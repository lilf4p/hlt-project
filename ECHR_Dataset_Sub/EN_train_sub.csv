The applicant, Mr Jusuf Nezirović, is a Slovenian national who was born in 1961 and lives in Trbovlje. He was represented before the Court by Mr Boštjan Verstovšek, a lawyer practising in Celje.', '2.', '3. On 12 October 1999 the applicant was injured in an industrial accident. The applicant’s employer had taken out insurance with the insurance company ZT.', '4. On 12 September 2001 the applicant instituted civil proceedings against ZT in the Ljubljana District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Ljubljani) seeking damages in the amount of 8,590,967 Slovenian tolars (approximately 35,800 euros) for the injuries sustained.', 'Between 1 October 2001 and 19 January 2006 the applicant lodged seven preliminary written submissions and/or adduced evidence.', 'Between 3 September 2003 and 21 September 2005 he made four requests that a date be set for a hearing. In letters to the applicant of 11 September 2003 and 28 June 2004, the judge explained that his case was not yet at the top of the list of cases for examination by the court.', 'Between 15 December 2004 and 27 September 2006 four hearings were held. One hearing, scheduled for 25 November 2005, was adjourned at the applicant’s request.', 'During the proceedings the court appointed a medical expert. The court also sought an additional opinion from the appointed expert.', 'On 27 September 2006 the court decided to deliver a written judgment. The judgment, upholding the applicant’s claim in part, was served on the applicant on 16 November 2006.', '5. On 30 November 2006 the applicant appealed to the Ljubljana Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani).', 'On 9 May 2007 the court allowed the applicant’s appeal in part and increased the amount of damages awarded.', 'The judgment was served on the applicant on 31 May 2007.', '6. On 22 June 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče).', '7. On 22 August 2007 the Ljubljana Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s request for the correction of an alleged material error in its judgment.', 'The proceedings before the Supreme Court would appear to be still pending.', '8. On 27 February 2008, while the proceedings were pending before the Supreme Court, the applicant lodged a supervisory appeal with the Ljubljana District Court, in accordance with section 6 of the Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without undue Delay (Zakon o varstvu pravice do sojenja brez nepotrebnega odlašanja, Official Gazette, no. 49/2006 - “the 2006 Act”). In his supervisory appeal, the applicant explained that the proceedings had begun on 12 September 2001 and were still pending. As a consequence, his right to a trial within a reasonable time had been violated. He requested that the proceedings on his appeal on points of law be expedited and that a decision be delivered by the end of 2008 at the latest.', 'There is no decision as to this supervisory appeal in the case file.', '9. On 27 March 2008 the applicant lodged a new supervisory appeal with the Ljubljana District Court, in which he described more thoroughly the processing of his case by the courts and alleged that his right to a trial within a reasonable time had been breached.', '10. On 10 April 2008 the president of the Supreme Court, to whom the supervisory appeal had been transferred, rejected it under section 6, subsection 5, of the 2006 Act. He noted that case had been submitted to the Supreme Court on 13 December 2007. Having regard to the measures available to him under the 2006 Act, he concluded that the proceedings could not be expedited. He added, however, that he had taken steps to eliminate the systemic delays at the Supreme Court, namely the employment of additional judges and legal secretaries.', '11. On 25 April 2008, relying on the same grounds as in his supervisory appeal, the applicant lodged a motion for a deadline with the Supreme Court. He requested that the case be decided within a month.', '12. On 9 May 2008, referring to his findings in the decision rejecting the supervisory appeal, the president of the Supreme Court rejected the motion for a deadline as unfounded, on the basis of section 11, subsection 3, of the 2006 Act.', '13. Following the judgment in Lukenda v. Slovenia (no. 23032/02, 6 October 2005), and decision no. U-I-65/05 of the Constitutional Court (22 September 2005), both of which bound the Slovenian State to establish conditions in which the right to a trial without undue delay was to be afforded, the Slovenian Government adopted on 12 December 2005 a Joint State Project on the Elimination of Court Backlogs, the so-called “Lukenda Project”. Its goal is the elimination of backlogs in Slovenian courts and prosecutors’ offices by the end of 2010, by providing for structural and managerial reform of the judiciary.', '14. The 2006 Act (see paragraph 8 above), the preparation of which was part of the Lukenda Project, was enacted by the Slovenian Parliament on 26 April 2006.

The report shall include the declaration in respect of criteria referred to in section 4 of this Act and the opinion on the time-limit within which the case may be resolved. The president of the court may also require the judge to submit the case file if he assesses that, in the light of allegations of the party indicated in the supervisory appeal, its examination is necessary.', '(4) If the judge notifies the president of the court in writing that all relevant procedural acts will be performed or a decision issued within a time-limit not exceeding four months following the receipt of the supervisory appeal, the president of the court shall inform the party thereof and thus conclude the consideration of the supervisory appeal.', '(5) If the president of the court establishes that in view of the criteria referred to in section 4 of this Act the court is not unduly protracting the decision-making in the case, he shall dismiss the supervisory appeal by a ruling.', '(6) If the president of the court ...', '(7) If the president of the court establishes that the undue delay in decision-making in the case is attributable to an excessive workload or an extended absence of the judge, he may order that the case be reassigned. He may also propose that an additional judge be assigned to the court or order other measures in accordance with the statute governing the judicial service.', '...”', '18. Sections 8 and 11 define the motion for a deadline and provide for measures that may be applied by the court dealing with the motion. They read, in so far as relevant, as follows:', '“(1) If, under section 6(1) or (5) of this Act, the president of the court dismisses the supervisory appeal or fails to respond to the party within two months or fails to send the notification referred to in section 6(4) of this Act within the said time-limit or if appropriate procedural acts have not been performed within the time-limit set in the notification or ruling of the president of the court, the party may lodge an application for a deadline on the grounds stated in section 5(1) of this Act with the court hearing the case.', '...', '(3) The party may lodge the motion for a deadline within fifteen days after receiving the ruling or after the time-limits provided for in paragraph 1 of this section.”', '(1) The president of the higher court in the judicial area covering the local court, district court or other court of first instance, shall have the competence to decide on the motion for a deadline concerning the cases heard by the local court, district court or other court of first instance.', '(2) The president of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia shall have the competence to decide on the motion for a deadline concerning cases heard by higher court or court having the status of higher court.', '(3) The president of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia shall have the competence to decide on the motion for a deadline concerning cases heard by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Slovenia.', '(4) Other judges may be assigned by the annual schedule of allocation to act in place of or together with the presidents of courts referred to in previous paragraphs for decision-making on motions for a deadline.', '...', '(3) If the president of the court establishes that, in view of the criteria referred to in Article 4 of this Act, the court does not unduly delay with the decision-making of the case, he shall reject the motion for a deadline by way of a ruling.', '...', '(5) The president of the court shall decide on the motion for a deadline within fifteen days after receiving it.”', '19.

On 21 September 2001 the Novomoskovskiy Town Court of the Tula Region convicted the applicant, a school teacher, of cruel treatment of his pupils and sentenced him to one year and six months' imprisonment, suspended. The applicant and his counsel were present at the hearing. The court heard statements from a number of witnesses and victims and examined a transcript of a meeting of the school disciplinary committee."", '8. The applicant appealed against the judgment on points of fact.', ""9. On 26 October 2001 the Tula Regional Court upheld the judgment on appeal. The applicant was not present at the hearing. The appeal court reviewed the applicant's conviction both on points of law and on points of fact. The prosecutor, who was present at the hearing, submitted that the conviction should stand. The appeal court did not hear any witnesses and there is no evidence that any were summoned."", '10. On 28 February 2002 the applicant received a copy of the appeal judgment.', '11. On 14 June 2005, following an application for supervisory review lodged by a deputy prosecutor of the Tula Region on 10 June 2005, a judge of the Tula Regional Court decided to institute supervisory review proceedings. The judge stated that in the absence of any evidence that the applicant had been duly notified of the appeal hearing on 26 October 2001, the examination of his appeal in his absence had violated his defence rights. The applicant was notified of the decision to institute supervisory review proceedings and sent his written pleadings to the court on 22 June 2005.', ""12. On 27 June 2005 the Presidium of the Tula Regional Court, having examined the case under the supervisory review procedure, quashed the appeal judgment of the Tula Regional Court of 26 October 2001 and remitted the case for a fresh examination on appeal. The Presidium noted that among the documents in the case file there was a notification of the appeal hearing dated 11 October 2001. The applicant had not appeared at the hearing and, later, in his numerous complaints repeatedly stated that he had never received the notification. The case file contained no conclusive evidence that the applicant had been duly notified of the hearing.

They live in Lengenfeld and Gobelsburg, respectively. They were represented before the Court by Mr H. Malek, a lawyer practising in Krems. The respondent Government were represented by their agent Ambassador F. Trauttmansdorff, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'Upon the applicants’ request the Krems Regional Court sitting as a Labour and Social Court (Landesgericht als Arbeits-und Sozialgericht) on 27 December 2000 and on 9 January 2001, respectively, ordered the F company to pay (Zahlungsbefehl) the first applicant 1,056.81 EUR, the second applicant 6,276.46 EUR and the third applicant 4,247.87 EUR. On 2 February 2001 these orders became enforceable.', 'On 13 February 2001 the Regional Court opened bankruptcy proceedings concerning the F company. This decision was published in the bankruptcy data base (Insolvenzdatei) in the internet on 14 February 2001.', 'On 19 February 2001 the applicants requested the Vienna District Court (Bezirksgericht) to enforce the above-mentioned payment orders by selling the F company’s movable property (Fahrnisexekution) and by granting the applicants a lien on outstanding accounts which the F company held against E.F., F.S. and I.S. (Forderungsexekution).', 'On 21 February 2001 the District Court granted this application and ordered enforcement of the payment orders (Exekutionsbewilligung) under Sections 249 and 294 of the Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung). It appears that the District Court apparently disregarded Section 10 of the Bankruptcy Act (see Relevant domestic law and practice) when it granted this request.', 'On 6 March 2001 E.F., F.S. and I.S., who were debtors of the F company and against whom that company had outstanding claims, appealed against this decision. They submitted that the enforcement order was unlawful as bankruptcy proceedings against the F company had been opened on 13 February 2001 and that, following the decision to open bankruptcy proceedings, they were no longer allowed to honour individual request for enforcement. The appeals were not transmitted to the applicants.', 'At the same day the bankruptcy trustee, referring to Section 10 of the Bankruptcy Act (Konkursordnung), requested the District Court to cancel enforcement proceedings.', 'With decisions of 26 March and 30 March 2001 respectively, the Vienna Regional Court remitted the file back to the District Court as it found that the appeals of 6 March 2001 needed improvement. On 9 and 19 April 2001 respectively these decisions were served on the applicants’ counsel.', 'E.F., F.S. and I.S. subsequently remedied the defects of the appeals. The appeals were not transmitted to the applicants.', 'With decisions of 3 August, 28 September 2001 and 11 October 2001 the Regional Court rejected the appeals concerning the enforcement of the order to pay by selling the F company’s movable property, as it noted that E.F., F.S. and I.S. had no legal standing in this regard, because they were not affected by that part of the order.', 'It granted, however, the appeals concerning the enforcement of the order to pay by granting a lien on the F company’s outstanding accounts against E.F., F.S. and I.S. It referred in this regard to Section 10 of the Bankruptcy Act. The court further noted that, according to relevant case-law and doctrine, it was for the person requesting an enforcement order to substantiate already in the application why enforcement under the Enforcement Act should be admissible irrespective of the opening of the bankruptcy proceedings. In the present case, the applicants had not made such submissions in their applications. The Krems Regional Court had opened bankruptcy proceedings against the F company on 13 February 2001. This decision had been published in the bankruptcy data base (Insolvenzdatei) on 14 February 2001. The enforcement order had been issued only on 21 February 2001 and was therefore unlawful. The court further noted that the applicants had filed their request for enforcement of the payment order on 19 February 2001, although bankruptcy proceedings had already been pending at this time. It therefore ordered them to reimburse the costs of the appeal proceedings, i.e. 196.88 EUR to be paid by the first applicant, 368.50 EUR to be paid by the second applicant, and 294.97 EUR to be paid by the third applicant.', 'The enforcement of judicial decisions is regulated by the Enforcement Act (Exekutionsordnung), which provides for the satisfaction of a pecuniary claim by seizure of individual assets of the debtor (Einzelexekution).', 'However, after the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings against the debtor, individual satisfaction of a creditor gives way to collective satisfaction on a quota basis of all creditors with pecuniary claims (Generalexekution). The execution of an individual claim under the Enforcement Act is in principle no longer possible.', 'Accordingly, Section 10 of the Bankruptcy Act stipulates that, after the commencement of bankruptcy, no right to a lien or to a payment may be obtained from a court in respect of assets forming the bankrupt’s estate on account of a claim against the bankrupt. According to Section 2, bankruptcy shall take effect from the day following its official publication.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He is represented before the Court by Mr J. Buzalka, a lawyer practising in Prague.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 2 June 1976 the former Prague 1 National Council (místní národní výbor) assigned a two-room flat to Mr X and his wife, Ms Y, in a State owned apartment house.', 'On 23 April 1990 the Prague 1 Housing Association (bytový podnik) brought proceedings against Mr X and a certain Ms Z before the Prague 1 District Court (obvodní soud) asking that their tenancy be terminated and that Mr X and Ms Z be ordered to leave the flat. It alleged that the tenants had failed to pay the rent for more than three months.', 'By a judgment of 20 September 1990, the District Court terminated the tenancy of Mr X and Ms Z, and ordered them to leave the flat within 15 days of the allocation of a substitute flat by the competent national council. The judgment was served on the parties at the end of 1990. On 14 May 1992 it became final.', 'On 11 February 1991 Mr X commenced divorce proceedings against Ms Y. The judgment declaring the divorce was notified to the latter at her new address in May 1991. The judgment of 20 September 1990 was served on her in March 1992.', 'In April 1993 the applicant became the owner of the apartment.', 'On 22 February 1994 he introduced a civil action in the District Court, seeking a declaration that the eviction of Mr X should not be conditional on the allocation of alternative accommodation. The applicant claimed that the former tenant had not paid the rent and maintenance contributions for seven months. He submitted that the flat had been assigned to Mr X and his wife, Ms Y, on 2 June 1976 and that after their divorce, Ms Y had been provided with a substitute flat, Mr X having continued to occupy the common flat. The applicant further submitted that the District Court had terminated the tenancy of Mr X and his wife, and had ordered them to leave the flat within 15 days of the allocation of a substitute flat by the competent national council.', 'On 27 June 1995 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s action finding, inter alia, that the fact that Mr X owed rent for over three months, or that he had caused disorder in the house, did not substantiate the applicant’s argument that the circumstances, on which the original judgment of 20 September 1990 had been based, had changed, thereby justifying its modification.', 'On 14 August 1996 the Prague Municipal Court (městský soud) quashed the first instance judgment, finding that the former tenant’s continued unlawful behaviour, which had constituted the reason for the termination of the tenancy, had to be considered as an alteration of the circumstances (změna poměrů) on which the District Court had originally based its judgment of 20 September 1990. It ordered the District Court to clarify the circumstances in which Mr X had defaulted on the payment of his rent.', 'On 19 June 1997 the District Court again dismissed the applicant’s action on the ground that the applicant had not proved that Mr X had violated his tenancy obligations. It further held that the amount of rent which the applicant had asked Mr X to pay was contrary to the national law.', 'On 8 January 1998 the Municipal Court upheld the District Court’s judgment applying, inter alia, section III(6) of Act no. 519/1991 which amended the Code of Civil Procedure. The court modified, however, the reasons for the decision. It held that the judgment of 20 September 1990 had not become final and could not, therefore, be modified upon the applicant’s request. It found that the eviction order had not been directed against the same persons, to whom the flat had originally been allocated in 1976. It further found that Ms Y had not been a party to the 1990 proceedings, and the fact that the 1990 judgment had been notified to her in March 1992 was irrelevant.', 'On 31 January 2000 the Prague High Court (Vrchní soud) dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law (dovolání). The court, considering that the judgment of the Municipal Court was a decision which had modified the first instance judgment, applied section 238(1)(a) and section 241(3)(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure (see “Relevant domestic law”, below). It shared the Municipal Court’s opinion that, if the original decision ordering the tenant’s eviction upon the allocation of a substitute flat had not become final, the applicant could not evict him without alternative accommodation being provided. The court added that the relevant judgment had clearly referred to Ms Z and not Ms Y, and that this had not been rectified, at least under section 164 of the Code of Civil Procedure.', 'On 31 August 2000 the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) dismissed as being manifestly ill-founded the applicant’s constitutional appeal (ústavní stížnost), in which the applicant had alleged a violation of Articles 36 §§ 1 and Article 38 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod), as well as Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.', 'Section 159(1) and (3) provides that a judgment, which has been duly served and which can no longer be appealed, becomes final. Once a case has been adjudicated and the decision has become final, it may not be reconsidered.', 'Pursuant to section 164(1), the president of a chamber may rectify anytime and, if necessary ex officio, clerical errors or any other evident incorrectness in a judgment.', 'Under section 238(1)(a), an appeal on points of law is admissible against a judgment of an appellate court, whereby the first instance judgment was modified.', 'Pursuant to section 241(3)(d), an appeal on points of law may be filed on the ground that a decision was based on the incorrect legal consideration of the matter.', 'Section III, containing the concluding and interim provisions, provides in its sixth sub-section that final judgments ordering an eviction from an apartment which were adopted before the entry into force of this Act, and which made the eviction conditional on the allocation of a substitute flat or other accommodation, retain their conditional nature. The beneficiary may nevertheless request a court, which is competent to execute the judgment, to modify that order and declare that the party leaving the flat should only be provided with substitute accommodation rather than a flat, or that no alternative housing need be allocated at all.', 'Article 36 § 1 provides that everyone may assert his or her rights before an independent and impartial court of justice or, in specified cases, before another authority.', 'Under Article 38 § 2, everyone is entitled to have his or her case considered in public without unnecessary delay, in his or her presence, and to express his or her opinion on all the submitted evidence.

The due amount, which was 14,257,956,000 Turkish liras (TRL) including the interest, was paid to the applicants on 26 May 1998.', 'Under Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts was set at 30% per annum. As of 1 January 1998 the statutory rate of interest was increased to 50%. The statutory rate of interest was set at the compound interest rate, namely 60% as of 1 January 2000.', 'A description of further relevant domestic law may be found in the Aka v.

The applicant, NN cel Baarn alias Nn.p109.v.20081101.1101, yclept Tjitske Drijfhout, claims to be a Netherlands national. She gives an address in Amsterdam. She states her profession as “student”. Her date of birth is given on the application form as “1 January 1900 (as stated by the respondent)”.', '2. The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr J. Hemelaar, a lawyer practising in Leiden.', '3. , may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 30 October 2008, the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed criminal offences. Because she refused to identify herself, the applicant was, pursuant to article 61a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering), detained in order for her identity to be established. She was registered as “NN cel Baarn”.', '5. On 31 October 2008 she was released and handed over to the aliens’ police (vreemdelingenpolitie) who held her (ophouding), pursuant to article 50 §§ 2 and 4 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), for similar purposes.', '6. The applicant, through her counsel Mr Hemelaar, wrote to the police officer responsible arguing that the applicant was being wrongly held. Appended to the letter were a number of statements of fellow suspects, all of whom claimed to know that the applicant had Netherlands nationality. All mentioned the fact that she had had to prove her identity to be admitted to higher education or employment. One, going by the name of “Roelof Pieters”, claimed to have seen the applicant’s passport. Another, called “Agnes Wijbrandse” in the document, claimed to have seen her driving license. All fellow suspects stated that they had given copies of identity documents to Mr Hemelaar, whom however they had instructed not to circulate them any further.', '7. After the initial holding measure had been extended for 48 hours, the applicant was placed in aliens’ detention with a view to her expulsion (vreemdelingenbewaring). In the course of an interview with the aliens’ police on 3 November 2008, she stated among other things that she had Netherlands nationality by birth, held a Netherlands passport and was “presumably” entered in the population register.', '8. The same day the applicant appealed against her deprivation of liberty with the Regional Court of The Hague. For the purpose of these proceedings, she was registered as “Nn.p109.v.20081101.1101”, date of birth 01 January 1900, Netherlands nationality. In the statement of grounds of appeal submitted by her counsel it was claimed that she was “a normal Dutch young lady” (een normale Hollandse jonge dame) and still a minor.', '9. On 5 November 2008 the applicant lodged a request with the Provisional Measures Judge (voorzieningenrechter) for the suspension of her aliens’ detention. In her written statement she claimed to be of age and to have a job.', '10. Also on 5 November 2008 the applicant was released.', '11. In the further course of the proceedings of the Regional Court, the applicant admitted to the first name Tjitske. Eventually her appeal was rejected by the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague, sitting in Utrecht, by decision of 2 December 2008.', '12. The applicant lodged a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State), this time under the name Tjitske Drijfhout.', '13. On 15 January 2009, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division dismissed the applicant’s further appeal on summary reasoning.', '14. On 15 April 2010, the Court put the following questions to the Agent of the Government:', '“1. In relation to Article 35 § 2 (a) of the Convention:', 'a. Is the person who lodged the above application as Ms Tjitske Drijfhout, the same person who was apprehended (aangehouden), questioned and subsequently put in aliens’ detention on or around 31 October 2008?', '2. If so, and in relation to the alleged facts:', 'a. At what point in time was the applicant apprehended?', 'b. For how long was the applicant held for questioning (ophouden voor verhoor)?', 'c. Following her apprehension, did the applicant provide any information as to her identity?', 'd. If not, was it easily possible for her identity to be established in another way at that time?', 'e. If her identity could not be established, was the applicant’s apprehension prolonged pursuant to article 61 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering)?', 'f. What measures were taken at that time in order to establish the applicant’s identity?', 'g. Did the applicant provide any information as to her nationality and, if so, in what way has she co-operated in establishing that nationality?', 'h. On what grounds was it concluded that the applicant fell under the provisions of the Aliens Act (Vreemdelingenwet)?', 'i. Did the applicant, at the time she was placed in aliens’ detention or subsequently, provide further information allowing her identity or nationality to be established and, if so, how?', 'j. When was the applicant taken into aliens’ detention and when was she released?', 'k. Did the aliens’ detention come to an end as a result of the applicant herself demonstrating at any time that the provisions of the Aliens Act 2000 at issue could not be applicable to her?', 'l. At what point in time and in which manner did the applicant’s identity become clear?”', '15. On 18 May 2010 the Agent of the Government replied as follows:', '“(...) The Government will – out of necessity – limit itself to a short reply, since it cannot confirm that the applicant is the person who was apprehended, questioned and subsequently put in aliens’ detention on or around 31 October 2008. A female person was indeed apprehended, questioned and put in aliens’ detention on that date, but she was merely known as ‘NN cel Baarn’ and ‘Nn.p109.v.20081101.1101’. Her fingerprints led to a positive identification, but the matching fingerprints were registered under ‘NN onbekend’ (NN unknown), reference number 1602200810. The latter were taken from a female apprehended in the course of a house-squat in the city of Utrecht on 16 February 2008, whose identity remained unknown.', 'For the sake of completeness, I should add that the person apprehended on or around 31 October 2008 appealed against the measure of aliens detention under the details mentioned above. Her representative informed the District [i.e. Regional] Court that she was also known as ‘Tjitske’. On 2 December 2008, higher appeal against the District Court’s judgment was lodged by ‘Tjitske Drijfhout, alias NN cel Baarn alias Nn.P109.v.20081101.1101’.', 'Upon receipt of your letter, the aliens’ police in Utrecht checked the information provided in the application. It appears that Tjitske Drijfhout, born in Amsterdam on 1 January 1900 and residing at Van Ostadestraat 55 hs, 1072 JB, Amsterdam, is unknown in the municipal database. There is, however, a person known as Tjitske Drijfhout, born on 1 January 1950. The above mentioned appeal to the District Court was lodged by a person claiming to be of minor age. The age of the apprehended person was estimated between 25 and 35. Under no circumstance could the apprehended person have reached the age of (nearly) sixty, let alone the age of (nearly) hundred-and-ten. Furthermore, the postal code of 1072 JB does not relate to the address provided.', 'The Government is of the opinion that – since at least part of the personal data submitted by the applicant are proven to be false – there is no reason to assume that the name provided by the applicant would be correct. The applicant’s identity has therefore not been disclosed, as a result of which the application should be declared inadmissible for being anonymous, as stipulated in Article 35 § 2(a) of the Convention. The Government refers to the Court’s decision to that effect in the case of Blondje v. the Netherlands (Appl. No. 7245/09). The fact that – other than the applicant in that case – the applicant in the present case has chosen to provide a somewhat less obvious pseudonym, does not alter that conclusion. ”', '16. A copy of this letter was transmitted to the applicant’s representative for comment. In a letter dated 11 August 2010, the latter admitted that 1 January 1950 was not the applicant’s date of birth but did not give any other date. He claimed that the wrong postcode, which differed only slightly from the actual postcode of the address given, was an honest mistake. He further admitted that the person referred to as NN cel Baarn and Nn.p109.v.20081101.1101 in the domestic proceedings was the applicant.', '17. On 28 September 2010 Court requested the applicant to establish her identity by submitting a copy of a valid identity document held by her.', '18. By letter dated 29 September 2010 the applicant’s representative, Mr Hemelaar, replied as follows (translation):', '“In the above-mentioned case you requested me, in your letter of 28 September 2010, for a copy of a valid identity document of the applicant.', 'I have been informed by the applicant that she cannot comply with that request, because she does not now hold a valid identity document from which her name as stated appears (omdat zij thans niet beschikt over een geldig identiteitsbewijs waaruit haar naam als opgegeven blijkt).', 'In the Netherlands there is no obligation to have an identity document. People can go through life without an identity document. Especially since the law has been changed and fingerprints are required, there is much resistance against applying for a passport in the circles in which the applicant moves. The situation of being ‘identity document-less’ (identiteitsdocumentloos) now occurs more frequently in those circles than it used to.', 'On behalf of the applicant, I point out that if the mere fact that the State denies the stated identity were enough to impose a duty of proof on the applicant, the effective exercise of the right of petition [would be] undermined. As you will be aware, especially in cases of aliens’ detention identity documents are usually unavailable. If now the State takes the position that the stated identity is incorrect (as in fact the Netherlands State does in a large number of cases, often on the fallacious reasoning that ‘The stated identity cannot be correct, because if it were correct, the authorities of the country of origin would issue/have issued a laissez-passer’), then no applications at all could be lodged against violations of human rights in cases of aliens’ detention.', 'In certain cases a Netherlands citizen may in fact be asked for an identity document in specific situations and the failure to produce one may attract penal sanctions (such as a 50 euro fine or an extension of detention on remand) and such sanctions were in fact imposed on the applicant. But a general obligation to purchase a passport or identity card, or possess one, does not exist in the Netherlands.', 'My client takes the view that she has not submitted an anonymous complaint and also refers to the decision of the Council of State, the highest administrative court in the Netherlands, from which it appears that the Council of State did not base its decision on that fiction either. My client has stated a name and an address (albeit with the wrong postcode). That ought to be sufficient. Unlike in the case of ‘Blondje’ the Council of State has considered this sufficient. It appears incorrect to the applicant that the State should all of a sudden adopt a different position in the present case.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-5887,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,CLARK AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicants, Susan Clark, Fred Clark, Claudine Clark, Yvonne Clark, Irene Clark and Clara Cartwright, are United Kingdom nationals, living in Braintree, Essex. They are represented by Mr T. Christie, President of the National Romani Rights Association. The respondent Government are represented by Mr H. Llewellyn of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.', 'Until July 1993 the six applicants and their families were living in caravans on a privately owned site at Cressing. On an unspecified date the Braintree District Council informed the owner that there were too many caravans on the site. As a result the applicants had to move.', 'On an unspecified date the applicants, or some of them, purchased a small plot of land, a few miles away from the site at Cressing, and stationed their caravans there. The applicants then sought retrospectively planning permission for the site’s change of use to a residential caravan site for seven families. This was refused by the Braintree District Council on 12 April 1994. On 28 June 1994 the applicants were served with two enforcement notices which required them inter alia to demolish all unauthorised structures such as fences, sheds and street-lighting appliances and to cease using the site for the siting of their caravans.', 'The applicants appealed to the Secretary of State for the Environment. An Inspector appointed by him held a public inquiry on 7 December 1994 and visited the site. On 10 January 1995 the Inspector dismissed the appeal.', 'The Inspector considered that the principal issues were: (i) the resulting impact on the appearance and character of the local countryside; (ii) the resulting impact on road safety; and iii) the degree of need for the accommodation.', 'The Inspector noted that one of the applicable policies was to protect the countryside from developments unless related to agriculture, mineral extraction, forestry or outdoor recreational uses or other uses compatible with the rural areas. Another policy, contained mainly in Circular 1/94 and earlier relevant circulars intended to ensure that the planning system recognised the need for accommodation consistent with gypsies’ nomadic lifestyle, but also reflected the importance of a plan-led system in relation to site provision.', 'The Inspector further found that the area where the applicants’ caravans were located was not covered by any specific protective planning designation. However, the landscape was predominantly arable and the development sought would detract from the area’s open rural character. To reach this finding the Inspector took into account that the site was exposed to wide public view; that the development included fences, telephone poles and lighting columns which together with the caravans inherently looked out of place; that permission was sought for a permanent and not temporary development and for seven pitches, whereas the normal policy was to limit them to three.', 'The Inspector further concluded that “the impact on road safety [was] one of the principal issues” in the appeal. The site was accessible through an unmade green lane, branching off a primary route with heavy traffic where the speed limit was 60 miles per hour and was often exceeded. The road had seen serious and fatal accidents. The use of the access to the site by the occupants of seven dwellings would appreciably increase the likelihood of accidents.', 'The Inspector also considered the applicants’ need for a caravan site. He noted that the available bi-annual counts showed that there had been a continuing, albeit decreasing, unmet need for authorised accommodation within the District of Braintree. He accepted that the applicants were in need of accommodation when they lost their pitches at the site at Cressing. He considered that these facts were powerful considerations in support of the development sought, but that on balance the benefits were outweighed by the indefinite harmful effects resulting from the choice of the particular site.', 'On 3 July 1995, the applicants again applied to the Braintree District Council for a planning permission for the site. The application was dismissed on 29 August 1995. The applicants’ appeal was dealt with by written representations and the Inspector dismissed it by letter dated 14 May 1996. In his decision, he considered whether certain changes proposed to the site would overcome the objections. He found however that the fence remained a prominent intrusive feature in the open rural area, with the tops of the caravans rising above it and that screening could only be achieved by planting after some considerable period during which the site would continue to damage the rural landscape. He also noted that the road was heavily used by fast-moving traffic and considered that movement of vehicles in and out of the site would add to the dangers of the type already a feature of this section of the road. He concluded, having carefully considered the applicants’ representations about their links with the area and their children’s schooling that this relatively large scheme twice the size of those normally considered appropriate in the local plan was still harmful to the character and appearance of the area and prejudicial to highway safety.', 'On 28 March 1996, six of the applicants were convicted by the Braintree Magistrates’ Court for, inter alia, failure to comply with the enforcement notices and were ordered to pay fines between 100 and 200 pounds sterling (GBP), plus costs. The Chairman noted that a wilful refusal to comply with an enforcement notice was a serious offence. Taking into account however the applicants’ previous good character and expressing sympathy for the applicants’ situation, he hoped that the planning authorities would find a way round their difficulties but stated that for a satisfactory outcome of the planning problem the applicants’ cooperation was necessary.', 'The representative of the applicants and the Braintree District Council exchanged correspondence and had meetings for the purpose of exploring the possibilities for the applicants’ moving to other sites. The applicants were urged to identify two other sites, each for three pitches, and to apply for planning permission. Also, since finding sites was difficult, the applicants were urged to be prepared to apply and accept whatever vacancies for caravan pitches would arise. The applicants objected stating that buying a plot and applying for planning permission without a guarantee that such permission would be granted would involve serious costs. They suggested that compliance with the enforcement notice should not be required or should be delayed. By letter of 13 September 1996 the Council indicated that ownership of a site was not a pre-requisite for applying for planning permission. Also, in the Council’s view the applicants had made no serious effort to find other suitable sites. The letter also addressed the applicants’ argument that the caravan policies were discriminatory. It stated that insofar as there were provisions applicable specifically to gypsy caravans, these discriminated in their favour, by providing for exceptions to the normal restrictive planning policies.', 'On 24 March 1997, the applicants were fined GBP 100 and GBP 75 costs for failure to comply with the enforcement notices.', 'The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended by the Planning and Compensation Act 1991) (“the 1990 Act”) consolidated pre-existing planning law. It provides that planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (section 57 of the 1990 Act). A change in the use of land for the stationing of caravans can constitute a development (Restormel Borough Council v. Secretary of State for the Environment and Rabey [1982] Journal of Planning Law 785; John Davies v. Secretary of State for the Environment and South Hertfordshire District Council [1989] Journal of Planning Law 601).', 'An application for planning permission must be made to the local planning authority, which has to determine the application in accordance with the local development plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise (section 54A of the 1990 Act).', 'The 1990 Act provides for an appeal to the Secretary of State in the event of a refusal of permission (section 78). With immaterial exceptions, the Secretary of State must, if either the appellant or the authority so desire, give each of them the opportunity of making representations to an inspector appointed by the Secretary of State. It is established practice that each inspector must exercise independent judgment and must not be subject to any improper influence (see the Bryan v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 November 1995, Series A no. 335-A, p. 11, § 21). There is a further appeal to the High Court on the ground that the Secretary of State’s decision was not within the powers conferred by the 1990 Act, or that the relevant requirements of the 1990 Act were not complied with (section 288).', 'If a development is carried out without the grant of the required planning permission, the local authority may issue an “enforcement notice” if it considers it expedient to do so having regard to the provisions of the development plan and to any other material considerations (section 172 (1) of the 1990 Act).', 'There is a right of appeal against an enforcement notice to the Secretary of State on the grounds, inter alia, that planning permission ought to be granted for the development in question (section 174). As with the appeal against refusal of permission, the Secretary of State must give each of the parties the opportunity of making representations to an inspector.', 'Again there is a further right of appeal on a point of law to the High Court against a decision of the Secretary of State under section 174 (section 289). Such an appeal may be brought on grounds identical to an application for judicial review. It therefore includes a review as to whether a decision or inference based on a finding of fact is perverse or irrational (R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Brind [1991] Appeal Cases 696, 764 H-765 D). The High Court will also grant a remedy if the inspector’s decision was such that there was no evidence to support a particular finding of fact; or the decision was made by reference to irrelevant factors or without regard to relevant factors; or made for an improper purpose, in a procedurally unfair manner or in a manner which breached any governing legislation or statutory instrument. However, the court of review cannot substitute its own decision on the merits of the case for that of the decision-making authority.', 'Where any steps required by an enforcement notice to be taken are not taken within the period for compliance with the notice, the local authority may enter the land and take the steps and recover from the person who is then the owner of the land any expenses reasonably incurred by them in doing so (section 178 of the 1990 Act).', 'New guidance on gypsy sites and planning, in the light of the 1994 Act, was issued to local authorities by the Government in Circular 1/94 (5 January 1994).', 'Councils were told that:', '“In order to encourage private site provision, local planning authorities should offer advice and practical help with planning procedures to gypsies who wish to acquire their own land for development. ... The aim should be as far as possible to help gypsies to help themselves, to allow them to secure the kind of sites they require and thus help avoid breaches of planning control.” (paragraph 20)', 'However:', '“As with other planning applications, proposals for gypsy sites should continue to be determined solely in relation to land-use factors. Whilst gypsy sites might be acceptable in some rural locations, the granting of permission must be consistent with agricultural, archaeological, countryside, environmental, and Green Belt policies. ...” (paragraph 22).', 'It was indicated that as a rule it would not be appropriate to make provision for gypsy sites in areas of open land where development was severely restricted, for example Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Nor were gypsy sites regarded as being among those uses of land normally appropriate in a Green Belt (paragraph 13).', 'Further guidance issued by the Secretary of State dated 23 November 1994 concerned the unauthorised camping by gypsies and the power to give a direction to leave the land (CJPOA above). Paragraphs 6-9 required local authorities to adopt “a policy of toleration towards unauthorised gypsy encampments:', '“6. ... Where gypsies are camped unlawfully on council land and are not causing a level of nuisance which cannot be effectively controlled, an immediate forced eviction might result in unauthorised camping on a site elsewhere in the area which could give rise to greater nuisance. Accordingly, authorities should consider tolerating gypsies’ presence on the land for short periods and could examine the ways of minimising the level of nuisance on such tolerated sites, for example by providing basic services for gypsies e.g. toilets, a skip for refuse and a supply of drinking water. ...', '8. Where gypsies are unlawfully camped on Government-owned land, it is for the local authority, with the agreement of the land-owning Department, to take any necessary steps to ensure that the encampment does not constitute a hazard to public health. It will continue to be the policy of the Secretaries of State that Government Departments should act in conformity with the advice that gypsies should not be moved unnecessarily from unauthorised encampments when they are causing no nuisance.', '9. The Secretaries of State continue to consider that local authorities should not use their powers to evict gypsies needlessly. They should use their powers in a humane and compassionate fashion and primarily to reduce nuisance and to afford a higher level of protection to private owners of land.”', 'Paragraphs 10-13 further require local authorities to consider their obligations under other legislation before taking any decisions under the 1994 Act. These obligations include their duties concerning pregnant women and newly-born children, the welfare and education of children and the housing of homeless persons. In a judgment of 22 September 1995 (R. v. Lincolnshire County Council, ex parte Atkinson, R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Wales and R. v. Wealden District Council, ex parte Stratford, unreported), the High Court held that it would be an error of law for any local authority to ignore those duties which must be considered from the earliest stages.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger,"['The applicant, Mr Andrej Batuzov, is a national of Latvia and Greece who was born in 1964 and lives in Riga. His application was lodged on 24 April 2007. He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Küster and Mr O.Wallasch, lawyers practising in Wiesbaden.', 'On 14 February 2000 the Koblenz District Court issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant on the ground that there was a strong suspicion that he had offered to instigate a third person to commit a murder of a public prosecutor and that he had agreed with a third person to commit a further murder. The warrant was further based on the strong suspicion that he had committed six offences under the Federal Weapons Act. The court found that the applicant was likely to abscond as he had to expect a severe sentence and had family ties in Eastern Europe.', 'On 17 February 2000 the applicant was arrested.', 'On 28 August 2000, 23 April 2001 and 25 July 2001 the Koblenz Court of Appeal ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand was to continue.', 'On 2 November 2000 the Koblenz District Court extended the facts of the warrant of arrest to the suspicion that the applicant had been dealing with drugs (500 kg of cannabis) to a considerable extent (Handeltreiben mit Betäubungsmitteln in nicht geringer Menge).', 'On 29 January 2001 the Koblenz Public Prosecutor’s Office charged the applicant with attempting to instigate a third person to commit a murder and with conspiracy to commit a murder (Verabredung eines Mordes). He was further accused of dealing with drugs to a considerable extent and with five offences under the Federal Narcotics Act. Moreover, he was charged with four offences under the Federal Weapons Act and three counts of human trafficking committed by a gang. Finally he was charged with five counts of forging official documents. The bill of indictment consisted of some 230 pages and named 73 witnesses living in five different countries.', 'On 25 May 2001 the Koblenz Regional Court admitted the indictment without modifications and decided to open the trial against the applicant and two other accused. The trial started on 14 August 2001.', 'On 13 January 2004 the Koblenz Regional Court adapted the warrant of arrest. It found that the applicant was likely to abscond as his son and partner had moved to Lithuania and as he had to expect a severe prison sentence.', 'On 1 September 2004, after the trial had taken place on 156 days, the Koblenz Public Prosecutor’s Office and the applicant came to an agreement. They agreed on a minimum sentence of eight years and six months´ imprisonment and that all other pending criminal proceedings against the applicant were to be terminated. Further, the Prosecutor’s Office agreed to apply for the conditional release of the applicant when he would have served two thirds of his sentence provided that the applicant’s conduct during the detention would be without reproach and that he would not commit any further offences. The agreement was noted in the minutes.', 'On the same day the Koblenz Regional Court sentenced the applicant to eight years and six months´ imprisonment for conspiracy to commit a murder, for drug trafficking with a considerable amount of drugs and for three offences under the Federal Weapons Act. The Koblenz Regional Court took into consideration the length of the criminal proceedings as well as the length of the applicant’s detention on remand as mitigating factors. The applicant was acquitted of the remaining offences he had been accused of. Simultaneously, the Koblenz Regional Court ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand was to continue.', 'On 8 September 2004 the applicant appealed on points of law against the Koblenz Regional Court’s judgment.', 'On 4 May 2005 the complete reasoning of the judgment was taken to the file. On 3 June 2005 the minutes were completed and taken to the file.', 'On 12 May 2005 the applicant appealed against the arrest warrant. On 14 June 2005 the Koblenz Regional Court dismissed the appeal against the arrest warrant. On 23 June 2005 the Koblenz Court of Appeal confirmed this decision. On 19 July 2005 the applicant filed a request for reconsideration (Gegenvorstellung). On 27 July 2005 the Koblenz Court of Appeal dismissed the request. On 6 July 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint against the decision of the Koblenz Court of Appeal, finding it inadmissible due to the applicant’s failure to submit all court decisions.', 'On 14 September 2005 the applicant applied again to the Koblenz Regional Court and requested to lift the warrant of arrest or to suspend its execution.', 'On 29 September 2005 the Koblenz Regional Court ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand was to continue.', 'On 21 November 2005 the Koblenz Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against this decision.', 'On 29 December 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court quashed the decision of the Koblenz Court of Appeal and remitted the case to that court. It stated that the detention on remand violated the applicant’s constitutional right to liberty as the courts had failed to adhere to the principle to hear cases more speedily in which the accused is detained (Beschleunigungsgebot in Haftsachen). The Federal Constitutional Court scrutinized the various stages of the applicant’s trial that had taken place so far. It had regard to the fixing of the hearing schedule by the Koblenz Regional Court and found that the conduct of one hearing per week only contradicted the case-law of the Koblenz Court of Appeal in similar voluminous cases which disclosed that two hearings per week had to be conducted. The Federal Constitutional Court found that the scheduling of the trial alone was likely to constitute a violation of the constitutional principle to have one’s case heard more speedily. The Federal Constitutional Court evaluated the further delays that had occurred after the pronouncement of the verdict as a whole. It noted, inter alia, that the Regional Court had taken the reasoning of its judgment to the case file only after 35 weeks had passed since its pronunciation. It attributed a further delay of six weeks to the judicial authorities as the applicant was notified of the judgment only after this period. The Federal Constitutional Court stated that the Koblenz Court of Appeal had therefore failed to strike a fair balance between the applicant’s right to liberty under Article 2 § 2 second sentence of the German Basic Law on the one hand and the state’s duty to prosecute crimes on the other hand. Referring to the case of Erdem v. Germany (no. 38321/97, ECHR 2001VII (extracts)) the Federal Constitutional Court argued that the more the detention on remand lasted the more reasoning it required. It stressed, inter alia, that the applicant’s detention on remand had lasted already more than two thirds of the sentence imposed on him and that the Koblenz Prosecutor’s Office had agreed to favour his release when 2/3 of the sentence had been executed. It further ordered the Koblenz Court of Appeal to reconsider the applicant’s appeal. Simultaneously it stressed that the established breaches of the principle to more speedily hear cases in which the accused is detained did not justify a further detention on remand.', 'On 3 January 2006 the Koblenz Court of Appeal quashed the decision of the Koblenz Regional Court dated 29 September 2005. The applicant was released.', 'On 17 July 2005 counsel filed the reasons for the applicant’s appeal. On 22 July 2005 the Regional Court sent the case file to the Koblenz Prosecutor’s Office. However, some parts of the case file had not been attached by mistake and were sent later on demand of the Public Prosecutor’s Office. On 4 August 2005 the Public Prosecutor received the missing parts of the case file. On 20 September 2005 the Koblenz Public Prosecutor finished his observations on the applicant’s appeal on points of law (Revisionsgegenerklärung). On 24 September 2005 the case file was sent to the Federal Public Prosecutor General. On 2 November 2005 the case file was sent to the Koblenz Regional Court in order to rectify errors in the minutes. The Koblenz Regional Court returned the case file on 11 November 2005.', 'On 24 April 2006 the Federal Court of Justice confirmed the judgment of the Koblenz Regional Court as to the conviction. Simultaneously, it reduced the cumulative sentence imposed on the applicant from eight years and six months to eight years and two months of imprisonment. The remainder of the applicant’s appeal was dismissed', 'The Federal Court of Justice found that the law enforcement authorities had violated Article 6 § 1 of the Convention by unreasonably delaying the criminal proceedings against the applicant. It referred in so far to the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court dated 29 December 2005. The Federal Court of Justice also stressed that the main proceedings before the Regional Court had lasted very long. It noted that although the Regional Court had taken account of the length in its fixing of the sentence it could not have considered any delays which had occurred after the pronouncement of the verdict. In order to compensate for the delay in the proceedings, the Federal Court of Justice reduced each separate sentence imposed on the applicant for one month and the cumulative sentence for four months.', 'The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice. On 27 September 2006 the Federal Constitutional Court found that the constitutional complaint was inadmissible and refused to admit it for consideration. The Federal Constitutional Court found that the applicant had failed to challenge the length of the proceedings before the Federal Court of Justice in a sufficient manner.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He lived in Zielona Góra, Poland.', '11. In July 1994 the applicant and his wife concluded a contract with E.W. and W.W., the owners of a company W. Under that contract the company was to carry out building work on the applicant’s house. On 24 November 1994 the applicant, considering that the company was in breach of the contract, withdrew from it.', '12. On 1 February 1996 the applicant and his wife (“the plaintiffs”) sued E.W. and W.W. in the Zielona Góra Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki), seeking compensation for the serious damage to the house allegedly caused by the defendants.', '13. On 13 March and 27 June 1996 the court held hearings and heard evidence from witnesses.', '14. On 24 July 1996 the court instructed Poznań Technical University (Politechnika Poznańska) to prepare an expert report. The report was submitted to the court on 4 November 1996. The defendants challenged the report on 2 December 1996.', '15. At a hearing on 23 December 1996 the Regional Court ordered the experts to revise their report. On 26 January 1997 they upheld their original conclusions.', '16. On 17 July 1997 the plaintiffs modified their claim.', '17. The court held a hearing on 29 October 1997.', '18. On 31 March 1998 the court ordered the experts to supplement their report.', '19. The parties filed their pleadings in March, April and October 1998.', '20. On 4 November 1998 the court held a hearing. The Government maintained that in the course of the hearing the plaintiffs had modified their claim. The applicant contested this.', '21. On 19 November 1998 the court gave judgment and dismissed the claim. The plaintiffs appealed.', '22. On 18 May 1999 the Poznań Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) quashed the first-instance judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court.', '23. On 30 September 1999 the Regional Court held a hearing. It decided to obtain a fresh expert report. In the meantime, the applicant had made two unsuccessful applications for his claim to be secured.', '24. On 20 February 2000 the expert report was submitted to the court.', '25. At the hearing held on 9 May 2000 the court heard evidence from the expert.', '26. The Government submitted that on 16 May 2000 the plaintiffs had altered the amount of the damages they had sought. Subsequently, they applied for an exemption from the court fee due for the increased claim. On 12 October 2000 the court refused their application. That decision was later upheld by the Poznań Court of Appeal. The applicant denied that they had altered their claim.', '27. On 28 February 2001 the plaintiffs again unsuccessfully applied for an exemption from payment of the court fee for the increased claim. Eventually, on 16 March 2001, the particulars of that claim were returned to them on account of their failure to pay the fee.', '28. The Government maintained that at the hearing held on 8 May 2001 the plaintiffs had increased their claim and had stated that they would not seek an exemption from the court fee. However, on 4 June 2001 the particulars of the amended claim were again returned to them on account of their failure to pay the fee in question.', '29. The applicant stated that this was not true. He maintained that, in a pleading of 11 May 2001, after the experts had again revised their valuation of the damage sustained, he had indeed extended the amount of the damages sought to 300,000 Polish zlotys (PLN), mostly because he had been forced to do so by the court. He had also sought an exemption from court fees since to do otherwise would have been illogical.', '30. A hearing scheduled for 12 July 2001 was adjourned at the plaintiffs’ request. A subsequent hearing was held on 6 September 2001.', '31. On 4 October 2001 the court heard evidence from the parties and closed the trial. On 11 October 2001 it gave judgment, awarding the applicant PLN 50,000 plus statutory interest.', '32. On 30 November 2001 the applicant appealed against the judgment. Shortly afterwards, on 10 December 2001, the Regional Court ordered him to rectify the formal shortcomings in his appeal.', 'On 8 January 2002 the applicant applied for an exemption from the court fees for lodging the appeal. The Regional Court rejected his application on 23 January 2002. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against the refusal; eventually, he paid the court fees on 22 February 2002.', '33. On 20 June 2002 the Poznań Court of Appeal heard, and dismissed, the applicant’s appeal. Since the applicant refrained from lodging a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court, the judgment became final on that day.', '34. Articles 417 et seq. of the Civil Code (Kodeks cywilny) provide for the State’s liability in tort.', 'In the version applicable until 1 September 2004, Article 417 § 1, which lays down a general rule, read as follows:', '“1. The State Treasury shall be liable for damage caused by a State official in the performance of the duties entrusted to him.”', '35. Article 418 of the Civil Code, as applicable until 18 December 2001 (see paragraphs 38-39 below), provided for the following exception in cases where damage resulted from the issuing of a decision or order:', '“1. If, in consequence of the issuing of a decision or order, a State official has caused damage, the State Treasury shall be liable only if a breach of the law has been involved in the issuing of the decision or order and if that breach is the subject of a criminal prosecution or a disciplinary investigation, and the guilt of the person who caused the damage in question has been established by a final conviction or has been admitted by the person’s superior.', '2. The fact that such guilt has not been established by means of a criminal conviction or a decision given in disciplinary proceedings shall not exclude the State Treasury’s liability for damage if such proceedings cannot be instituted in view of a [statutory] bar to prosecution or disciplinary action.”', '36. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy – Kodeks cywilny oraz niektórych innych ustaw) (“the 2004 Amendment”) entered into force. While the relevant amendments were in essence aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury’s liability for tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code – including the addition of a new Article 4171 and provision being made for the State’s tortious liability for its omission to enact legislation, a concept known as “legislative omission” (zaniedbanie legislacyjne) – they are also to be seen in the context of the operation of a new statute introducing remedies in respect of the unreasonable length of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 38-41 below).', 'Following the 2004 Amendment, Article 4171, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:', '“3. If damage has been caused by failure to give a ruling [orzeczenie] or decision [decyzja] where there is a statutory duty to do so, reparation for [the damage] may be sought after it has been established in the relevant proceedings that the failure to give a ruling or decision was contrary to the law, unless other specific provisions provide otherwise.”', '37. However, under the transitional provisions of section 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 as applicable before 1 September 2004 (see paragraph 34 above) applies to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date.', '38. On 4 December 2001 the Constitutional Court (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) dealt with two constitutional complaints in which the applicants challenged the constitutionality of Article 417 and 418 of the Civil Code. They alleged, in particular, that those provisions were incompatible with Article 64 and Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 41-42 below).', 'On the same day the court gave judgment (no. SK 18/00) and held that Article 417 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution in so far as it provided that the State Treasury was liable for damage caused by the unlawful actions of State officials in the performance of their duties. It further held that even though Article 418 of the Civil Code was compatible with Article 64 of the Constitution, it was contrary to Article 77 § 1 since it linked the award of compensation for such damage to the personal culpability, established in criminal or disciplinary proceedings, of the State official concerned.', '39. On 18 December 2001, the date on which the Constitutional Court’s judgment took effect, Article 418 was repealed. The Constitutional Court’s opinion on the consequences of the repeal read, in so far as relevant:', '“The elimination of Article 418 of the Civil Code from the legal system ... means that the State Treasury’s liability for the actions of a public authority consisting in the issuing of unlawful decisions or orders will follow from the general principles on State liability as laid down in Article 417 of the Civil Code. This, however, does not rule out the application in the present legal system of other principles on State liability, as laid down in specific statutes, and not necessarily only those listed in the Civil Code.”', '40. Article 45 § 1 of the Constitution states:', '“Everyone shall have the right to a fair and public hearing of his case, without undue delay, before a competent, impartial and independent court.”', '41. Article 64 of the Constitution reads:', '“1. Everyone shall have the right to ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.', '2. Everyone, on an equal basis, shall receive legal protection regarding ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.', '3. The right of ownership may only be limited by means of a statute and only to the extent that it does not violate the substance of such right.”', '42. Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution reads:', '“Everyone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any action of an organ of public authority contrary to law.”', '43. On 17 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”) entered into force. It lays down various legal means designed to counteract and/or redress the undue length of judicial proceedings.', 'A party to pending proceedings may ask for the acceleration of those proceedings and/or just satisfaction for their unreasonable length under section 2 read in conjunction with section 5(1) of the 2004 Act.', 'Section 2, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:', '“1.

A complaint about the unreasonable length of proceedings shall be lodged while the proceedings are pending. ...”', '44.

001-23159,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,PORTER v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Inadmissible,Lord Justice Schiemann;Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicant, Ms Shirley Porter, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1930 and lives in Israel. She is represented before the Court by Mr M. Spragg, a lawyer practising in London.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicant, a Conservative politician, was first elected to Westminster City Council in 1974. This inner London Borough covers a large part of central London, including Mayfair, Belgravia and Regent’s Park as well as some less affluent areas to the north and north-west. During the 1980’s, she was leader of the Council as well as of the majority party.', 'As a result of the local government elections in May 1986, the overall Conservative party majority was reduced from 26 to 4. The applicant was determined that the Conservative Party would have a greater majority at the 1990 elections. With this end in view, she re-organised the party’s administrative and decision making structure and chaired the Chairmen’s Group which was to develop and promote policy. In mid-February 1987, the applicant and others in the majority identified key wards, namely eight districts which were marginal. Their intention was to develop council policies which would target marginal wards, including such housing policies as could affect the make up of the electorate of those wards. References were made inter alia to “an immediate need to socially engineer the population in marginal wards” and to an aim “to preserve local communities – but boot out certain categories”.', 'The Council held a stock of 24,000 dwellings used for the provision of social housing. The plan which was developed involved selling Council property in strategically important areas at reduced prices to approved applicants who, it was hoped, would be more likely to vote Conservative – “designated sales”. Properties to be sold in this way were designated, then kept empty as they became available until suitable purchasers were approved.', 'On 14 March 1987, at a meeting of the Chairmen’s Group, it was proposed to designate all Council properties in the eight marginal wards. A memorandum on 17 March 1987 from the Director of Housing advised that this would render it impossible to meet statutory obligations to the homeless and they should seek legal advice. On 24 March 1987, the City Solicitor advised the applicant that “it was fundamental that the arguments in favour of selling be soundly based and properly argued. Anything which smacks of political machinations will be viewed with great suspicion by the courts.” He also stated that “the possibility of surcharge [legal requirement to pay any financial loss to the City] exists but it will be necessary for those challenging to show wilful misconduct. This re-emphasises the need for a good argument to be constructed in favour of sale”.', 'The same day the Chairmen’s group decided to adopt a target of 250 sales per annum in the marginal wards. On about 10 April 1987, the report commissioned by PACEC (economic consultants) however failed to provide support or professional justification for the identification of the eight key wards or for any increase in designated sales. A further paper on designated sales produced by the divisional director of housing adverted to a number of difficulties about the sales target and gave the view that it was imperative to obtain counsel’s advice.', 'On 5 May 1987, a number of Council officers met with Queen’s Counsel. There was no contemporaneous record of his advice. A report was made to the applicant and the Chairmen’s group that evening. The independent counsel was informed that the majority group wished to target sales in marginal wards for electoral advantage. He advised that they could not lawfully sell 250 properties per annum in the marginal wards alone. He also advised that properties had to be designated for proper reasons, across the whole of the City and not in particular wards and that, in identifying properties to be designated, the same criteria had to be applied across the whole City and, ultimately, choice made without reference to anything other than those proper criteria. The Chairmen’s group agreed to target sales city-wide in order to produce the number of designated sales in marginal wards.', 'At a meeting on 13-14 June 1987, the Chairmen’s group endorsed the target of 500 sales across the City which was intended to produce the desired number of sales. During June, an analysis was conducted in order to identify the properties that could be designated. The legal adviser to the Housing Committee repeated that it was vital that the Committee choose estates on the basis of housing and planning issues and that it would be necessary to be able to show that the list was neither arbitrary nor drawn up with reference to “improper factors”.', 'A joint report on Home Ownership in the names of various Council officials was circulated on 26 June 1987, outlining three options on designated sales but recommending none. The third option was to designate sufficient properties to produce 500 sales per annum. 20,697 properties had been identified in the report as eligible for designation – 29% were in the eight marginal wards. Evidence was given later that the joint report had been shown to counsel who had considered that it was “judge proof”. The list of properties to be designated was not recommended by officers – it was presented by the Chairman of the Housing Committee – 74% of all eligible dwellings in the eight key wards were to be designated while only 28% of all eligible properties in other wards were designated.', 'At the meeting of the Housing Committee on 8 July 1987, the Chairman of the Housing Committee presented Option 3 as the majority party’s preferred option. By seven votes to five, Option 3 was adopted.', 'Following this decision, on instructions from the Chairmen’s group, monitoring reports were issued concerning the progress to achieving “sales targets” in the eight key wards. Labour members of the Opposition were questioning the sales policy with increasing vigour however, repeatedly pressing for information on the selection of wards.', 'Between July 1987 and October 1989, some 618 dwellings were disposed of with vacant possession, sold to an approved list of purchasers, all first-time buyers, at discounts varying from 30% to 70% of the market value according to the circumstances of the purchaser.', 'In July 1989, complaints were made by local government electors to Mr John Magill, the Council’s Auditor about the legality of the designated sales policy, inviting the Auditor to take action under sections 19 and 20 of the Local Government Act 1982. Some 28 persons were named or referred to in the objection, including the applicant, her deputy Mr Weeks, the Director of the Housing Committee and others on that Committee.', 'In October 1989, the Auditor requested a formal response to the objections from the Council. The Council produced its response on 27 November 1989.', 'On 5 December 1989, the Auditor asked the Council if it wished to supplement its reply in light of further objections received during November. He also asked the Managing Director of the Council to provide him with a comprehensive set of reports to the Council, its committees etc. relating to key wards strategy and designated sales and relevant correspondence on those subjects.', 'On 20 March 1990, the Managing Director informed the Auditor that the City Council did not have a key wards strategy and that there were no Council documents under that heading.', 'On 1 May 1990, the Council’s supplementary response was sent to the Auditor.', 'By letter of 22 May 1990, the Managing Director informed the Auditor that the files containing papers relevant to the objections were available for inspection at City Hall. The documentation assembled was however far from complete.', 'From June to December 1990, the Auditor carried out a review of the extensive documentation at City Hall and obtained preliminary legal advice. He requested further documentation from the Council.', 'In December 1990, the Auditor commenced his interviews of persons involved. He was to carry out a total of 135 interviews, involving 50 individuals.', 'From January to April 1991, the Auditor made visits to Council offices to inspect further documents and made further requests for documents.', 'He completed his initial round of interviews in November 1992. He interviewed the applicant on 23 August 1992. Having regard to his wish to arrange interviews in a particular order, the progress of interviews was hampered by a delay on the part of some prospective interviewees in responding to requests for interviews and by the apparent reluctance of some interviewees to attend for interview. The Auditor exercised his powers under section 16 of the 1982 Act to require six individuals, including the applicant, to attend before him.', 'The Auditor reviewed the evidence and took further legal advice. In January 1993, he began a second round of interviews, which lasted from January to July 1993. He interviewed the applicant for the last time on 23 July 1993 (a total of 12 occasions at which the applicant was represented by counsel). Having regard to information already received and in consequence of further interviews, the Auditor decided to visit a number of Council offices and to search for documents. He inspected a large number of files, locating files in a storeroom and reviewing the entire underground filing area. New documentation, previously undisclosed, was obtained.', 'In April 1993, the Auditor became aware for the first time of handwritten notes made by the Director of Housing during meetings in the period May 1986 to October 1989.', 'The Auditor conducted a further seven interviews in September-October 1993. The applicant and others made written submissions to the Auditor during October.', 'On 13 January 1994, the Auditor issued “Notices to Show Cause” to ten named individuals, including the applicant. These stated that he had to consider whether to certify the sum of 21 million pounds sterling (GBP) or any other sum as due from them as being a loss or deficiency incurred by their wilful misconduct and were accompanied by a Note of his provisional findings and views (236 pages) a history of events (350 pages) and 12 other appendices (a total of over 10,000 pages) and a copy of the public statement issued by the Auditor that day to the press. In his Note, the Auditor concluded in respect of the applicant that he was provisionally minded to find her guilty of wilful misconduct. The purpose of the issuing of provisional views was to inform those at risk, the Council and the objectors of those views so that they could address such representations to the Auditor as they wished before he reached a final conclusion. He invited those concerned to indicate whether they wished an oral hearing.', 'On the same day, the Auditor held a press conference to read out his public statement, sitting at a table on which there was a bundle of material documents. This press conference and the ensuing publicity formed the basis of later complaints that there was an appearance of bias tainting the whole inquiry.', 'One of the persons named in the provisional findings, the Joint Vice-Chairman of the Housing Committee, Councillor Dutt, committed suicide shortly afterwards.', 'Solicitors for the applicant applied to the Audit Commission on 19 April 1994 to replace John Magill with a new auditor. The Audit Commission refused to do so.', 'As three parties and the Council requested an oral hearing (not the applicant), the Auditor fixed proceedings to begin on 17 October 1994. In a preliminary meeting in June 1994, the applicant applied for the Auditor to disqualify himself. Oral submissions were made on the point on 7 and 17 October 1994. On 18 October 1994, the Auditor gave written reasons for not disqualifying himself.', 'An audit hearing took place between 19 October 1994 and 7 February 1995, involving 32 days of hearings. The applicant was represented at the hearing by leading counsel who made extensive submissions on her behalf. She did not give evidence, having no confidence in the impartiality of the Auditor. Three accountants were called on her behalf.', 'The Auditor received further representations and evidence after the hearing. On 18 August 1995, the applicant made submissions in light of a recent House of Lords judgment on duties of local authorities to the homeless.', 'On 17 August 1995, the Auditor circulated a revised provisional calculation of net loss and invited representations by 5 October 1995. He received representations from the objectors. The parties were informed that notification of arrangements for the issuing of his decision would be given on 21 March 1996. On 19 March 1996, the applicant requested the Audit Commission to investigate his conduct. The Auditor delayed his decision pending this complaint. On 16 April 1996, the Audit Commission refused the applicant’s request. She did not seek judicial review of this decision.', 'On 9 May 1996, the Auditor notified his decision and issued certificates of surcharge under section 20 of the 1982 Act in respect of six individuals, the applicant, Mr Weeks (deputy leader of the Council), Councillor Hartley (Chairman of the Housing Committee), Mr Phillips (Managing Director from February 1987), Mr England (Director of Housing) and Mr Hayler (divisional Director of Housing). Each was found jointly and severally liable in the sum of GBP 31,677,064 being the amount of a loss incurred or deficiency caused by their wilful misconduct. The decision and statement of reasons ran to more than 1,100 pages.', 'The six respondents appealed to the Divisional Court under section 20(3) of the 1982 Act. The appeal of Mr Hayler was later allowed on grounds of his ill-health.', 'Between 29 April and 1 May 1997, the Divisional Court held a preliminary hearing on procedure. It directed inter alia:', '“The nature of the present hearing will be to go beyond a mere judicial review on Wednesbury grounds and look at the merits (...). The Auditor’s report and evidence will stand before us, but is open to challenge (...) ... it is for the appellants to open the appeal and to establish prima facie that there was something amiss with the Auditor’s report or certificate ...', 'The next question is on whom ultimately the burden lies at the appeal. As we have said, initially it is for the appellants to show that something was wrong with the Auditor’s report or certificate. If this hurdle is surmounted by the particular appellant, it is, in our view, for the respondents to prove, on the material before this Court, wilful misconduct by that appellant causing identified loss. ... It should also be borne in mind that this Court will have to be satisfied to the high degree of proof on the balance of probability, which is necessary for a finding of wilful misconduct. We rule that the ultimate burden of proof on appeal will be on the respondent.', '... we shall receive such evidence as we have indicated on affidavit, but we shall direct that the deponents be available to be cross-examined ...”', 'The appeals were heard between 1 October and 4 November 1997.', 'On 19 December 1997, the Divisional Court delivered its judgment (Porter v. Magill, 96 Knight’s Local Government Reports, p. 157). In its judgment, it commented as follows on the complexity of the proceedings:', '“On any view the auditor’s investigation was vast. It cost over £ 3 million. Whether Parliament contemplated so gigantic an investigation by an auditor into an objection to local authority accounts we very much doubt. In our judgment, in any future investigation of this kind it will be essential for the auditor to exercise a sense of proportion and to balance, on the one hand, the need for adequate scrutiny of the accounts and the objections to them and, on the other, the need to avoid prolonged and inordinately expensive inquiry...', 'The auditor in this case conducted over 130 interviews with 44 people, including the appellants, each of whom he interviewed many times. The history of events is set out in detail in over 400 pages... His investigations started at the behest of electors who were members of the minority party and who on 18 July 1989 gave him written notice, under section 17(4) of the 1982 Act, of objection to the lawfulness of the council’s accounts. He gave his final decision on 9 May 1996. Including appendices, it extends to almost 2,000 pages. He examined over 6,000 pages of documents. Many thousands of pages of transcript of his interviews, the proceedings before him and the submissions made to him were generated. We rule, prior to the hearing of the appeal that the auditor’s interviews of persons other that the appellants should be treated as evidence before us.', 'Before this court, with the assistance of all counsel to whom we are indebted, it has been possible, with the aid of comprehensive and detailed written submissions, amplified in oral argument, on behalf of all parties, to focus on the issues raised in this appeal with recourse to comparatively few of these voluminous papers. It has also been a significant feature of this appeal that, although none of the appellants chose to give evidence before the auditor, each of them has sworn a substantial affidavit for the purpose of the appeal, on which each was orally cross-examined. We have also received the written reports of expert valuers and accountants in relation to what, if any, loss the council suffered and these experts have also been orally cross-examined ...', 'It follows that we have conducted this appeal by way of re-hearing in accordance with RSC, Ord 55, r.3. In doing so we have kept in the forefront of our minds the impairment of recollection which is the inevitable consequence of the passage of up to 11 years between the occurrence of the material events and the evidence before us. In such circumstances, the contemporaneous documents are of obvious importance. We have approached the matter by considering, in relation to each appellant, whether the auditor appears to have gone wrong in any respect and whether, having regard to the high standard of proof appropriate to the seriousness of the allegation... wilful misconduct causing loss has been shown...”', 'Concerning the appellants’ assertions about alleged breaches of Article 6 § 1 by the procedures before the Auditor, it stated:', '“In our judgment, English law treats that matter as one of civil not criminal liability. The ‘penalty’ as it is described by the Third Report of the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life is in fact calculated by reference to the loss sustained by the council taxpayer by reason of the wilful misconduct alleged. It follows that the nature of the proceedings is compensatory and based upon the principle that those who misbehave in public office should be required to make good to the taxpayer any resulting loss. That is no different from the principle that a trustee should make good to the trust fund any loss which may result from his misconduct. If the penalty imposed were greater than the loss incurred, then different considerations might apply. But the only potential additional consequence is disqualification from office...”', 'It took the view that the jurisdiction of the domestic courts gave the appellants the required control by a judicial body that had full jurisdiction and provided the guarantees of Article 6 § 1 and that even if what happened before the Auditor was capable of amounting to a breach of the Convention the proceedings before the courts remedied any possible unfairness. It went on to find no problems arising from the role imposed on the Auditor by legislation and that no right to cross-examine the Auditor arose outside criminal proceedings. It noted that the delay had been extreme but that having regard to the proceedings as the whole which involved an expensive and time consuming investigation and to its finding that no prejudice or resulting injustice had been shown as suffered by the appellants, there was no breach of any reasonable time requirement either. It stated as regarded the Auditor’s press conference:', '“We are prepared to accept that, in the light of the great public interest in this matter and the lengthy period taken by the initial investigation culminating in the provisional findings, it was appropriate for the public to be given some explanation for the time spent and some indication of the auditor’s provisional views. But, in our judgment, the press conference which took place was ill-conceived and unfortunately executed. It would have been sufficient for a press statement to have been issued, preferably by the auditor’s solicitor, saying that the complexity of the investigation accounted for its length and that, at that stage, the auditor was provisionally minded to make findings of wilful misconduct causing loss against the individuals named but that, before he reached any final decision, the individuals would have the opportunity to give evidence and make submissions to him.', 'Instead, a televised announcement was arranged at which the auditor himself appeared and, although he said that his views were provisional, he expressed them in florid language and supported them by reference to the thoroughness of the investigation which he claimed to have carried out. There was a further feature of the event which should have had no place in the middle of a quasi-judicial inquiry. A stack of ringbinders on the desk at which the auditor sat bearing the name of his firm for the benefit of the cameras was, ostensibly, under the protection of a security guard: unless it was being implied that the persons under investigation might wish to steal the documents, it is not clear what was the purpose of this posturing.', 'We express the hope that, in any future, the statutory investigation of this kind, no auditor will stage any similar event, which may undermine the perception, whatever may be the reality, of the auditor’s open-mindedness. In the light of the material before us, including, in particular, the auditor’s reasons for declining to recuse himself, we accept that despite such inferences to the contrary as might have been drawn from the press conference, the auditor did have an open mind and was justified in continuing with the subsequent hearings. ...The error of judgment which we find he made, in holding the press conference as he did, did not, in our view, demonstrate bias on his part. He was at pains to stress the provisional nature of his findings and it is pertinent that in his final decision he made no finding of wilful misconduct against three persons in relation to whom he had, provisionally, been minded so to find. In any event, as with the investigation, any possible unfairness to the appellants has been cured by the hearing before us...”', 'On the substance of the appeal, the Divisional Court found that the Auditor’s decision lacked a “sufficient analysis of the possible impact on the state of mind of the appellants, which is crucial in relation to wilful misconduct, of the legal advice received, or reported to have been received, on 5 May 1987”. It concluded itself that the decision of 8 July 1987 was substantially influenced by a wish to alter the composition of the electorate by increasing the Conservative vote in marginal wards by the sale of council properties and was therefore unlawful. It found untrue the applicant and W.’s claim that following counsel’s advice on 5 May 1987 that the designation of sales for electoral purposes was abandoned:', '“... in our judgment [the applicant] and W. lied to us, as they had done to the auditor, because they had the ulterior purpose of altering the electorate which they knew rendered targeting sales in marginal wards unlawful... Because [the applicant] and W. knew the targeting policy was unlawful they were content, without further enquiry... to adopt the suggestion... that it be dressed up in city-wide clothes: neither claims that this was a proper course. Their purpose throughout was to achieve unlawful electoral advantage. Knowledge of the unlawfulness and such deliberate dressing-up both inevitably point to, and we find, wilful misconduct on behalf of each of them.”', 'The appeals of Mr England, Councillor Hartley and Mr Phillips were allowed, largely, on the basis that it was not established to the necessary standard of proof that what they said or did during the relevant time was, to their knowledge, unlawful or improper. The appeals of the applicant and Mr Weeks were dismissed and they were found to have caused loss by wilful misconduct in the reduced sum of GBP 26,462,621. Permission to appeal was refused. They renewed their applications to appeal on 2 and 30 January 1998 respectively.', 'On 20 February and 18 June 1998 respectively, Mr Weeks and the applicant were granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal.', 'The appeals were heard before the Court of Appeal between 22 and 26 March 1999. In its judgment of 30 April 1999, by a majority, it allowed the appeals. The majority held that, since the applicant had acted on what she believed to be correct legal advice, it was inconsistent of the Divisional Court to find that she and Mr Weeks had committed wilful misconduct while finding that the other appellants who believed that Option 3 was lawful had not shown wilful misconduct. The majority found the decision of the Housing Committee to have been lawful and any improper purpose attributable to the applicant did not render the committee’s decision unlawful and was not causative of any loss. It quashed the Auditor’s certificate.', 'On the allegations of bias, Lord Justice Schiemann noted that the applicant’s counsel accepted that he had not shown that the Auditor was actually biased and found that the expression of provisional views was part of the procedure sanctioned by Parliament and that there was nothing to lead him to suppose that the Auditor was unfairly biased against the appellants. As regarded delay, he considered that a fair hearing was still possible notwithstanding the lapse of time which had had no effect on the reliability of the conclusions reached or the appellants’ ability to present evidence. He also noted that as regarded any implied damage, psychological or otherwise, purported to flow from the delay no claim for damages had been put forward. He was satisfied that the appellants had not been required to prove a lack of wilful misconduct but that the Auditor and Divisional Court were persuaded that the appellants had committed wilful misconduct. In respect of the argument that the appellants were unable to cross-examine the Auditor before the Divisional Court, he considered that though a tribunal’s judgment may be reversed on grounds of actual bias, there was no requirement that the tribunal submit itself to cross-examination in order to see whether an admission of actual bias could be procured. Nor was he impressed by the argument that the appellants were unfairly prevented from cross-examining the Auditor as regarded quantum.', 'The Court of Appeal granted the Auditor permission to appeal to the House of Lords. His appeal was heard between 5 and 13 November 2001. In the House of Lords’ judgment of 13 December 2001, the Auditors appeal was allowed and the orders of the Divisional Court and the certificate of GBP 26,464,621 restored.', 'The House of Lords concurred generally with the findings of the Divisional Court and the approach of the dissenting judge in the Court of Appeal.', 'In his judgment, Lord Bingham found that the applicant and Mr Weeks accepted that they knew that they could not use the council’s powers for electoral advantage and that in adopting and implementing the designated sales policy both acted in a way which they knew to be unlawful. While the applicant’s counsel had argued that the applicant had acted in accordance with what they believed to be legal advice given to the council and were accordingly not guilty of wilful misconduct, he relied on the clear findings of the Auditor and the Divisional Court, who had heard the evidence, that the applicant and W. had not pursued the designated sales policy on legal advice. He noted that:', '“First, it is simply not true that [Mr S, the Queen’s counsel who gave the advice] was given access to all relevant information or that [the applicant] laid bare her hopes to her legal advisers. Mr S. received no written instructions and gave no written advice. There were two questions which the council should have put to him. The first was whether it was lawful to promote a policy of designating council properties for sale in marginal wards for the purpose of securing an electoral advantage for the majority party at the forthcoming council elections. That question was put to Mr S. and he answered it in the negative as he was bound to do. The second, follow-up question should have been whether, if that policy would be unlawful, the policy would become lawful, if, with the same objective, and in order to conceal the targeting of sales in marginal wards, the designated sales policy were extended across the City of Westminster. That question was never put. No-one, including [the applicant] and Mr Weeks, could have had any doubt at all what the answer would have been if it had. Mr S. was never told of the course on which the council proposed to embark or had embarked. The second weakness is found in the history of pretence, obfuscation and prevarication which surrounded the policy from May 1987 onwards. If the policy was genuinely believed to be lawful, albeit controversial, there was no need for such intensive camouflage.”', 'As regarded the alleged inconsistency in allowing the appeal of Messrs Hartley, England and Phillips while rejecting the appeal of the applicant and Mr Weeks, Lord Bingham concurred with the unease felt by Lord Justice Robert Walker in the Court of Appeal:', '“It is understandable that the Divisional Court was reluctant to be excessively critical of officers, who were subject to considerable pressure from elected members... Mr Hartley’s conduct does not earn that measure of indulgence. But the Divisional Court had the advantage of hearing these three witnesses. It was rightly alert to the high standard required before a finding of this gravity could be sustained. It may very well be that Messrs Hartley, England and Phillips were fortunate to be exonerated, to the limited extent that they were exonerated. But the findings made against [the applicant] and Mr Weeks were, in truth, very strong. They were the leader and deputy leader of the council, and were respectively the prime architect and midwife of this policy. I am satisfied that no injustice was done to either of them by upholding the findings of the auditor and the Divisional Court.”', 'Concerning the grounds of appeal raised under the Convention, Lord Hope rejected the argument that the proceedings fell under Article 6 § 1 in the criminal aspect:', '“I consider that the nature of the proceedings under section 20 of the 1982 Act is compensatory and regulatory, not punitive. Section 20(1) provides that the amount certifiable by the auditor, where it appears to him that a loss has been incurred or deficiency caused by wilful misconduct, is the amount of the loss or deficiency and that both he and the body in question may recover that amount for the benefit of that body. The object of the procedure is to compensate the body concerned, and the measure of the compensation is the amount of the loss suffered. In the present case the amount certified was very large, but the nature of the proceedings does not alter depending on the amount certified. No fine is involved, nor does the section provide for a penalty by way of imprisonment. Section 20(4) provides for the respondents’ disqualification from being members of a local authority. But this outcome is similar to where a trustee is removed after being found to have been in serious breach of trust, or a person is disqualified from acting as a director of a company. In my opinion measures of the kind provided for by section 20, which apply to persons having a special status or responsibility and are compensatory and regulatory rather than penal in character, lie outside the criminal sphere for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention.”', 'He went on to find that the applicant was nonetheless entitled to the protection offered by Article 6 § 1 concerning civil rights. To the extent that the Auditor was required by statute to act as investigator, prosecutor and judge, this problem was solved in his view by the provision of a complete rehearing by the Divisional Court which could exercise afresh all the powers of decision given to the Auditor. He agreed with the Divisional Court that the Auditor had made an error of judgment in making a statement at a public press conference. However while this created the risk of unfair reporting there was nothing in the words the Auditor used to indicate that there was a real possibility that he was biased. He noted the Auditor was at pains to point out that his findings were provisional and there was no reason to doubt this as his subsequent conduct demonstrated. Looking at the matter objectively, he did not find that it had been demonstrated that there was a real possibility of bias.', 'As regards the complaint of unreasonable delay in the proceedings, Lord Hope (with whose judgment on the issue all the members of the House of Lords agreed) observed that the period of which complaint was made could be divided into four distinct periods: (a) that from the receipt of the original objection on 18 July 1989 to the issuing by the Auditor of his provisional views on 13 January 1994; (b) that from 13 January 1994 to the end of the audit hearing on 7 February 1995; (c) that from 7 February 1995 to the issuing by the Auditor of his decision and the certificates of surcharge on 9 May 1996; and (d) that from 9 May 1996 to the decision of the Divisional Court which was given on 19 December 1997. Lord Hope noted that no complaint had been made about any delay after that date.', 'As to the proceedings before the Divisional Court, Lord Hope held that there was no basis whatever for the suggestion that there had been unreasonable delay at that stage. The Auditor had issued his certificate in May 1996. It was not until December 1996 that the respondents filed their evidence on the main issues. The accounting evidence was not filed until April 1997. A procedural hearing was held shortly afterwards in May 1997. The case proceeded to a hearing in the Divisional Court in October 1997, which lasted for 23 days and judgment was given on 19 December 1997. Having regard to the complexity of the issues and the volume of evidence that had to be prepared and presented, the proceedings in the Divisional Court had been concluded within a reasonable time.', 'As to the proceedings before the Auditor, Lord Hope stated:', '“In my opinion the most striking feature which emerges from all the facts relating to the conduct of the investigation by the auditor is that, far from causing delay by inaction, he was constantly in action. He was seeking out information wherever it could be found, often with considerable difficulty. He was interviewing and re-interviewing many witnesses, recovering and perusing thousands of documents, calculating amounts of loss and expenditure and then gathering all this information together into a decision which eventually extended to over 2,000 pages... It has been suggested that his investigation was over-elaborate. There are comments to that effect in the Divisional Court’s judgment... But the auditor had to form his own judgment on this matter. He had to take account of the importance of the exercise to all parties, including those who were at risk of being surcharged, and he was entitled to have regard to its obvious political sensitivity. I would attach particular significance to these factors and to the fact that it has not been suggested at any stage that the auditor caused delay at any stage by inactivity.', 'Applying the test described in Konig v. Germany ... which directs attention to the complexity of the case, the applicant’s conduct and the manner in which the matter was dealt with by the authorities, and leaving aside the question whether the [applicant and W.] can show that they were prejudiced, I would hold that the proceedings did not exceed the reasonable time requirement which Article 6 § 1 lays down. ...”', 'On 13 December 2001, the Council made a formal demand for the applicant to pay the certified sum by 27 December 2001.', 'On 28 December 2001, the Council issued proceedings in the High Court for the certified sum, damages and the audit fees. On the same date, the Council obtained an ex parte order freezing the applicant’s assets up to a value of GBP 33 million. She was required to file an affidavit listing her assets by 14 January 2002. The freezing order was renewed on 18 January 2002, including limited exceptions for living expenses and a reasonable sum (not exceeding GBP 20,000) for legal representation.', 'The applicant filed a defence, denying liability to pay additional damages or audit fees.', 'On 18 April 2002, the Council issued an application for summary judgment against the applicant. The applicant opposed the application at a hearing on 15, 16 and 30 July 2002. On 31 July 2002, the High Court issued summary judgment for payment of the certified sum and damages for breach of trust (a total sum not exceeding GBP 36,966,542). The applicant’s application for a stay pending proceedings in Strasbourg was refused.', 'The applicant was granted leave to appeal. On 23 October 2002, the applicant was granted an extension of time in which to lodge her appeal, subject to her compliance with orders requiring her to inform the Council of the source of her current funding, to discharge outstanding sums due to the Council in respect of their costs and to provide security for costs of the appeal in the sum of GBP 20,000 by 20 November 2002. To date, the orders have not been complied with and her appeal is liable to be dismissed.', 'Section 20 of the Local Government Finance Act 1982 provides as relevant:', '“(1) Where it appears to the auditor carrying out the audit of any accounts under this Part of this Act...', '(b) that a loss has been incurred or deficiency caused by the wilful misconduct of any person, he shall certify that... the amount of the loss or the deficiency is due from that person and ... both he and the body in question... may recover that ... amount for the benefit of that body; and if the auditor certifies under this section that any ... amount is due from two or more persons, they shall be jointly and severally liable for that sum or amount.', '(2) Any person who ...', '(b) is aggrieved by a decision of the auditor to certify under this section that a sum or amount is due from him, may ... require the auditor to state in writing the reasons for his decision', '(3) Any such person who is aggrieved by such a decision may appeal against the decision to the court and –', '(a) in the case of a decision to certify that any amount is due from any person, the court may confirm, vary or quash the decision and give any certificate which the auditor could have given ...”', 'In the House of Lords in the present case, Lord Hope examined the jurisdiction of the courts on an appeal under section 20(3) of the 1982 Act. It was his view that any problem which may be seen to result from the fact that, where accusations of wilful misconduct were involved, the Auditor was required to act not only as an investigator but also as prosecutor and judge was resolved by the appeal provisions in section 20(3):', '“The court can exercise afresh all the powers of decision given to the auditor... The powers which the Divisional Court has been given by section 20(3) fully satisfy [the requirements of Article 6 (1) of the Convention]. Not only does it have the power to quash the decision taken by the auditor. It has the power to rehear the case, and to take a fresh decision itself in the exercise of the powers given to the auditor... In the case of the procedure governed by section 20(3) however a rehearing on the merits can be conducted, and this is what was done in this case.”', 'In July 1997, Lord Nolan’s Committee on Standards in Public Life published its report “Standards of Conduct in Local Government in England, Scotland and Wales”. It recommended that the surcharge should be abolished. It took the view that it was unsatisfactory to have a procedure in which the Auditor formulated and prosecuted a case against individual councillors, judged guilt or innocence and determined the penalty. It considered that the concept of surcharge was outdated, that in practice it was in the nature of a penalty and that the procedure should be replaced by the direct involvement of the courts. It also noted the anomaly, regarded as inequitable by some, that the regime of surcharge applied only to local government and not to others in public service, finding it illogical that only those in local government should be subject to a regime for punishing misconduct which was serious but which did not involve corruption.', 'While section 20 of the 1982 Act was re-enacted by section 18 of the Audit Commission Act 1998, this was amended in turn by section 90 of the Local Government Act 2000, which removed the power of surcharge.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant company had no standing in the constitutional proceedings.', '19. On 19 August 2006 the proceedings on the merits of the 2002 petition of company A. (see paragraph 13 above) were terminated following the withdrawal by company A. of its petition on the grounds that the EGM had already taken place and that, consequently, the petition had become moot.', '20. The further course of the proceedings, as described below, thus merely concerned the extraordinary appeal of the Prosecutor General (see paragraph 15 above) and the constitutional complaints of company A. (see the preceding paragraph and paragraphs 26 and 30 below).', '21. On 11 December 2007 the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd) found that the Supreme Court had violated the right of company A. to a fair trial.', 'Consequently, the Constitutional Court quashed the judgment of 28 June 2006 and remitted the case to the Supreme Court for re-examination of the Prosecutor General’s extraordinary appeal.', '22. In its reasoning, the Constitutional Court held that “[company A.] had obtained the shares and had done so in the course of enforcement proceedings” and that “it was justified and lawful for [company A.] to assume that it had legitimately become the owner of the shares, which had provided a basis for it to have the power to call the general meeting”.', '23. The Constitutional Court also held that it had been wrong for the Supreme Court to have reexamined the question of the lawfulness of the acquisition by company A. of the shares in question. To that end, the Constitutional Court observed that, in the case at hand, the Supreme Court had dealt with proceedings concerning the calling of an EGM and that the acquisition in question had taken place in the course of enforcement proceedings falling within the jurisdiction of the enforcement courts and having been concluded with final and binding effect.', '24. On 28 May 2008 the Supreme Court ruled on the extraordinary appeal by the Prosecutor General for the second time. It again quashed the decision of 18 November 2004 and remitted the case to the District Court for re-examination.', '25.

On 15 January 2009 the Constitutional Court quashed the judgment of 28 May 2008 and remitted the case to the Supreme Court for a fresh determination of the extraordinary appeal by the Prosecutor General.', 'The Constitutional Court found the contested judgment to be arbitrary, devoid of adequate reasoning and contrary to the Supreme Court’s being bound by legal reasoning expressed by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 47 in the “Relevant domestic law” section below).', '28. On 23 November 2009 the Supreme Court ruled on the extraordinary appeal by the Prosecutor General for the third time. It again quashed the decision of 18 November 2004 and remitted the case to the District Court for reexamination.', '29. The Supreme Court considered the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 15 January 2009 to be incomprehensible and pointed out that the handling of the petition at first instance had been chaotic and riddled with numerous irregularities.', '30. Company A. challenged the Supreme Court’s judgment of 23 November 2009 under Article 127 of the Constitution. Its complaint (registered under file no. IV.

On 30 March 2009 the District Court allowed a fresh petition, following which company A. called the EGM for 29 April 2010.', '33. The applicant company was the defendant in those proceedings, being assisted by the State in the person of the Ministry, acting as an intervenor for the defendant (vedľajší účastník).', '34.

On 27 April 2009 the Supreme Court suspended the legal effect of the decision of 30 March 2009 pending the outcome of the proceedings.', '37. Nevertheless, on 29 April 2009, the EGM took place.', '38. On 20 May 2009 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 30 March 2009 and remitted the matter to the District Court for reexamination.', '39. The Supreme Court held, inter alia, that the legal views expressed by the Constitutional Court in its judgment of 11 December 2007 (see paragraph 21 above) had no directly binding legal effect upon the District Court.', '40. On 9 September 2010, upon a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution by company A., the Constitutional Court found a violation of the complainant’s right to a fair trial under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, quashed the judgment of the Supreme Court of 20 May 2009 and remitted the matter to the Supreme Court for a new determination of the extraordinary appeal by the Prosecutor General.', '41. The Constitutional Court found that there had been irregularities related to the serving of a copy of the Prosecutor General’s extraordinary appeal on company A. and that, in consequence, the Supreme Court could not be said to have ensured service of that appeal on company A. for observations, to the detriment of the latter’s procedural rights.', '42.

At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order that authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation.', '3. In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant appropriate financial compensation to a person whose rights under paragraph 1 have been violated.”', '47.

FRANCE [Extracts],1,Inadmissible,,"['The applicants, Mr Philippe Houdart and Mr Jérôme Vincent, are French nationals who were born in 1957 and live in Neuilly-sur-Seine and Paris respectively. They were represented before the Court by Mr Bigot, a lawyer practising in Paris.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicants are doctors. At the material time, although they remained registered with the Medical Association (ordre des médecins) for the city of Paris, they were not practising medicine but were working as journalists for “Sciences et Avenir”, a monthly science magazine for the general public of which they were the editor-in-chief and deputy editor.', 'Issue number 619 of the magazine, published in September 1998, was entitled “Hospitals, 1998 edition” with the following coverlines: “League-table of 512 French hospitals”, “Best results: the top 86 facilities”, “Blacklist of problem hospitals” and “Exclusive: mortality in your hospital”.', 'It was stated in the magazine that this special issue had been produced by the applicants, without their status as doctors being mentioned, and by a third journalist who was not a doctor. Its contents included a league-table of the 50 best and 50 worst hospitals in four specialist fields. They were ranked according to three criteria: their activity, based on health-establishment data from the PMSI (medicalised information system programme); mortality, assessed by reference to a national mortality indicator for patients in the same age bracket and with similar medical conditions; and notoriety, which was in fact measured by the attractiveness of the hospital for patients from outside the département. The combination of these criteria produced an overall rating out of 20. Information letters and requests for explanations were also sent to the directors of hospitals where major shortcomings had been found.', 'Saint-Girons Hospital ranked thirteenth in the list of the 50 hospitals with the worst results in the field of digestive surgery, with an overall rating of 3.81 out of 20 and a mortality rate 2.3 times higher than the norm.', 'On 8 October 1998 Doctor Maestracci, head surgeon at Saint-Girons Hospital, lodged a complaint with the département council (conseil départemental) of the Medical Association for the city of Paris. He criticised the applicants for the highly inaccurate nature of their investigation, as a result of using inappropriate criteria, failing to take account of specificities related to the precise type of medical condition and not distinguishing between emergency and scheduled admissions. Moreover, in his opinion there had been no subsequent moderation, whether in the commentary or in the choice of persons interviewed. He thus considered that his reputation and that of his staff had been seriously impugned, all the more so because he was working in a small town. He lastly argued that the investigation, by casting doubt on the quality of this local-community medical facility, might lead to inappropriate attitudes on the part of patients, particularly in the event of an emergency.', ""By a decision of 10 February 1999, the département council referred the complaint to the Medical Association's regional council for Ile-de-France and requested to be joined to the proceedings on account of a breach of Articles 13 and 31 of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners. The rapporteur from the département council made the following submissions in particular:"", ""“Whilst the seriousness of the journalists' work is not at issue, it does not appear upon reading the article that any disclaimer as to the limits of the methodology used has been clearly indicated."", 'The headings of the articles and paragraphs and the comments inserted in the boxes add a sensationalist tone which turns a report into an indictment.', 'Lastly, the possibilities for the criticised heads of department and hospital directors to defend themselves have been very limited.', 'Generally-speaking, the specific case of Saint-Girons Hospital raises the issue of the limits to the transparency of medical information. In the long term such transparency is desirable, but in the short term the beneficial effects of selecting the most efficient services for patients may be counter-balanced by the negative repercussions of anxiety-provoking remarks for a section of the population that is limited in its choice of hospital treatment by age, geography or social situation.', 'Prudence and concern about the repercussions of remarks among members of the public, as required by Article 35 [sic] of the Code of Professional Conduct, do not seem to have guided the authors, who should have ensured that the limits to their work were made clear and, in such a sensitive area, should have avoided provocative headings.”', ""In a decision of 23 May 2000 the regional medical council dismissed the applicants' plea of inadmissibility, which had been based on the possibility of raising the defences available under the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881, and found as follows:"", '“Notwithstanding the existence of the Press Act of 29 July 1881, it is clear that everyone is free to use the means of his choosing to enforce his rights without such possibility being open to challenge.”', 'The regional council gave the two applicants a warning (avertissement) based on the following reasoning:', '“On the basis of data that could be regarded as objective, albeit open to debate and debated, Doctors Houdart and Vincent, by inserting crossheads, boxes and passages in italics, transformed an informative article into a sensationalist one ...', 'By placing the unwritten ethics of journalists before those of doctors, which have been codified in a regulatory text, they crossed a boundary which must not be overstepped, especially as the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners has the aim of protecting patients – a section of the population that is weak both physically and psychologically. It cannot validly be argued that Doctors Houdart and Vincent submitted their article to the magazine without concerning themselves with the publication or without being aware of the sensationalist additions designed at least to lure readers and perhaps to boost sales; if that were the case, they failed in their obligation to verify the ultimate and potential use of their statements or the possible impact of those statements on the general public.', 'In this connection it is ineffective to claim that, since they were not practising medicine, Doctors Houdart and Vincent were not bound by the provisions of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners; on the contrary, their voluntary registration with the Medical Association shows their desire to abide by that Code, especially the provisions in the first section dealing with the general duties of doctors.', 'After studying the material in the file and hearing representations from the parties, it appears that Doctors Houdart and Vincent interpreted information to give it a sensationalist and derogatory character, thus causing damage, perhaps unintentionally, to the complainant Doctor Maestracci and to his patients, which is even worse. In these circumstances it is appropriate, in order to reiterate the need for medical ethics, to impose a penalty in the form of a warning.”', 'The applicants, relying in particular on Articles 6 and 10 of the [European] Convention [on Human Rights], then lodged an appeal with the National Medical Council.', ""On 21 November 2001 the disciplinary section of the National Medical Council dismissed a complaint by the applicants concerning the rapporteur's participation in the deliberation of the regional council, finding that his duties were consonant with the principle of impartiality enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The disciplinary section further found that the applicants had breached their duty of care when imparting information to the public, as provided for in Article 13 of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners:"", ""“Doctors Houdart and Vincent were, at the material time, respectively the editor-in-chief and deputy editor of the magazine 'Sciences et Avenir', and it was in their capacity as journalists that they wrote the offending articles published in the September 1998 issue of that magazine. The fact that they were not practising medicine, that the acts were committed in the context of their work as journalists and that they did not invoke their status as doctors is not capable of precluding the application of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners, by which every doctor remains bound once he or she is registered with the Medical Association. This fact obliges the disciplinary body, which has jurisdiction to rule on breaches by doctors of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners, only to reconcile the ethical duties of doctors with the requirements of the freedom of expression afforded to journalists. In that latter respect, whilst the first paragraph of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees freedom to impart information and ideas, the second paragraph of that Article stipulates that the exercise of this freedom, carrying with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such restrictions or penalties as are necessary, in particular, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others ..."", ""... the right for doctors to inform the public about the quality of hospital services, even designated by name, and to give a critical assessment of some of them, cannot be called into question, provided only that in presenting their analyses they do not breach the duty of care by which they are bound under the above-mentioned provisions of the Code of Professional Conduct. Whilst they set out the criteria by virtue of which they had drawn up a league-table of hospitals, they failed to take the precaution, which was all the more necessary as the publication was intended for the general public, of indicating the limits and the relative nature of a qualitative analysis based on data from the PMSI (medicalised information system programme), which they presented, by contrast, on page 36 of the publication, as 'an outstanding tool with remarkable accuracy'. Not only are the published results presented as unquestionable and scientifically established but they are also accompanied by comments and headings such as “Its hospitals make France sick”, “Blacklist of problem hospitals”, and “underperforming facilities can be found virtually everywhere”, the purpose of which is not to inform patients but to dramatise the information without any concern for the repercussions of this presentation on the patients who use services whose quality has been seriously impugned. Having regard to the applicants' level of responsibility in the publication, they cannot claim that they are mere employees working under the authority of the magazine's management without any right of scrutiny in respect of the articles published, nor that the presentation of the facts, the headings and the comments are the work solely of the publication director and were not even tacitly approved by them ...”"", ""The applicants then lodged an appeal on points of law with the Conseil d'Etat. They submitted that the professional disciplinary bodies did not have jurisdiction in respect of doctors who were not practising medicine professionally. They further complained that they had been deprived of a fair hearing, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, as they had not been given prior knowledge of the rapporteur's report to the two professional bodies. They lastly observed that the application of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners to doctors not practising medicine, in respect of acts they committed while engaged in the activity of journalism, and without their status as doctor being invoked, constituted a mistake of law. They based that latter argument on the wording of Article 13 of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners, which referred only to “participation in an educational and health-related action of public information” and on the incompatibility between the guarantees attaching to the status of journalist under the Act of 29 July 1881 and the rules of medical ethics."", ""On 23 February 2004 the Conseil d'Etat dismissed the applicants' appeal on points of law on the grounds that the professional disciplinary bodies did have jurisdiction because the applicants were registered with the Medical Association, that the report – simply a statement of facts – drawn up by the rapporteur appointed by the chairman of the disciplinary section did not necessarily have to be communicated to the parties, and that Article 13 of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners could apply to acts relating to the applicants' activity as journalists:"", ""“It transpires from the provisions of the above-mentioned Article 1 of the Decree of 6 September 1995 that the disciplinary bodies of the Medical Association have jurisdiction, in connection with proceedings brought before them, to assess the conduct of any registered doctor with regard in particular to the provisions of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners. It can be seen from the material in the file submitted to the tribunal of fact – and it is not in dispute – that Mr Houdart and Mr Vincent were, at the time of the impugned acts, registered with the Medical Association. Accordingly, these doctors are not justified in arguing that the disciplinary sections of the Ile-de-France regional medical council and of the National Medical Council were acting ultra vires in ruling on the breaches of professional duty that they were alleged to have committed in respect of certain articles published in a magazine under their management. The disciplinary section of the National Medical Council did not commit any mistake of law when it found that Article 13 of the Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners was applicable to facts relating to the applicants' activity as journalists.”"", '...', '...', 'Decree no. 95-1000 of 6 September 1995 laying down a Code of Professional Conduct for medical practitioners reads, in relevant part, as follows:', '“The provisions of the present Code shall be binding on medical practitioners who are registered with the Medical Association ...”', '“When a medical practitioner participates in an educational and health-related action of public information, regardless of the means of dissemination, he shall only impart information that has been confirmed, shall act with care and shall be concerned about the repercussions of his remarks among members of the public.

Following this, the applicant outside his competence as a mayor, organised armed shifts for the protection of the Albanian flag.', 'Furthermore, he also acting outside of his competence as a mayor and out of law, set up central crisis headquarters with several regional branches.

The public order was quickly restored, but other people from the nearby villages [who arrived] in an organised manner joined the crowed which became larger. According to our estimations, at around 3 p.m. a crowed of 7-8,000 people gathered in front of the Town Hall.', '...', '...at around 2.30 p.m. five persons were detained, three of whom were citizens of the Republic of Albania and all 39 bottles with Molotovs’ cocktails were found.

No deaths or injuries were reported until then and later [as a result of] the request of the parents of two victims an autopsy was not ordered by the investigating judge, therefore, the possibility to clarify the circumstances (time, place, manner, etc.) surrounding their deaths was excluded.', 'Around 5 p.m. the firing had stopped and the police restored the peace in the town.', '...the police searched the private offices of the chairmen of the Town Hall ... in Gostivar and the houses of the two “guards” of the flag in front of the Town Hall of Gostivar (two automatic guns and a big quantity of ammunition were found).', 'In the private office of the chairman of the Gostivar Town Hall the police, inter alia, found documents concerning the “crises headquarters and its regional branches” which were set up in case of an attempt to remove the Albanian flag.

At that occasion the applicant also allegedly stated that one day the Albanian flag would be flown as the official one and not only as the flag of a minority. Around 4.30 p.m. he addressed the people via a local TV station following which the riots stopped.', 'On 10 July 1997 the applicant was detained pending trial and on 8 August 1997 he was charged with stirring up national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance by a public official and with a serious case of organised resistance and the non-execution of a decision or an order of a State institution. He was released on 7 October 1997.', 'The Gostivar Municipal Court held hearings on 11, 12 and 15 September 1997.', 'In addition to hearing several witnesses, the court examined, inter alia, typed and hand-written originals as well as a translation of the applicant’s speech, a video-tape of the aforementioned meeting, the minutes and other documents on the setting up of central crisis headquarters with regional branches, shelters for the injured and a list of persons who took part in those activities.', 'On 16 September 1997 the Municipal Court found the applicant guilty of: (a) stirring up, as a public official, national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance for which he was sentenced to eight years’ term of imprisonment; (b) organising resistance against a lawful decision or activity of a State institution for which he was sentenced to four years’ term of imprisonment; and (c) non-execution, as a public official, of a Constitutional Court’s decision for which he was sentenced to three years’ term of imprisonment. The overall sentence was thirteen years and eight months’ term of imprisonment.', 'The offence of stirring up, as a public official, national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance had been made out by the failure of the applicant, who had been an elected mayor, to inform the Local Council and the central Government that the decision to display the flags of Albania and Turkey in front of the Town Hall had been unconstitutional. He had implemented such an unlawful decision and had instructed all other public institutions to display the respective flags during the public holidays. He had refused to implement the Constitutional Court’s interim order and decision and had organised a public meeting under the motto “to defend the official use of the national flag” at which the anthem of the Republic of Albania had been played and the flag of the Republic of Albania displayed.', 'Moreover, at the meeting he, inter alia, had stated:', '“ we shall give our lives but not our flag”, “we do not recognise the decisions of the Constitutional Court”;” “The Albanian flag was flown in front of many troops, i.e., partisans’, balists’ [Albanian movement which occupied western part of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia during the Second World War] and in front of other Albanian troops which were always fighting for the liberation of our territories. Our territories in [the Former Yugoslav Republic of] Macedonia are our territories, this should be acknowledged once and for all and on these territories our flag will always be flown”.', 'The court held that the applicant had called and organised the citizens of Albanian origin to protect the respective flag with their lives, thereby, he had encouraged the violent events of 9 July 1997 in which three lives had been lost, many citizens injured and considerable damage caused. He had caused a feeling of insecurity and fear among the citizens of Macedonian origin. He had been aware in advance of the serious consequences which his speech might have and had actually provoked.', 'There had been a connection between the meeting of 24 May 1997 and the events of 9 July 1997 as it was clear from the evidence that the set up of the central crisis headquarters, shelters for the injured, night shifts and different strategies how to defend the flag had been planned and undertaken by the applicant.', 'Furthermore, the two villagers who had been “on duty” to protect the flag on the night of 9 July 1997 gave evidence that a person who had identified himself as being a messenger of the applicant had asked one of them, Mr F., to be on the night shift of 8/9 July 1997 for the protection of the flag of the Republic of Albania. For this purpose he had received a proxy with the stamp and signature of the applicant. The name of the second witness Mr B. had also been put on the proxy. In the Town Hall Mr F. and Mr B. had been instructed by Mr K. from the village of Lakavica to watch over the flag until 6 a.m. and to inform the applicant in case they noticed something suspicious. Mr F. had been in a possession of a gun - “Walter”, calibre 7.65 with no licence.', 'The court concluded that the applicant was determined to protect the flag of the Republic of Albania despite the Constitutional Court’s decision. As an elected mayor of a town with mixed population instead of promoting an inter-ethnic co-operation and tolerance he had called the citizens of Albanian ethnic origin to resist a lawful police action and had organised armed resistance against the implementation of the Constitutional Court’s decision.', 'The applicant appealed to the Skopje Appellate Court. He argued that his rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly guaranteed by Articles 16 and 21 of the Constitution had been violated. The main reason to organise the meeting of 24 May 1997 had been to express his discontent with the Constitutional Court’s interim order of 21 May 1997. The violent events of 9 July 1997 had not been provoked by his speech and actions but by the police action. The “civil night shifts” had been organised to watch over and report if somebody or the police attempted to remove the flags.', 'On 5 February 1998 the Appellate Court upheld the lower court’s judgment. The sentence for having stirred up, as a public official, national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance was reduced to four years’ imprisonment; the sentence for having organised resistance against a lawful decision or activity of a State institution was reduced to three years’ imprisonment; and the sentence for not having executed, as a public official, the Constitutional Court’s decision was reduced to two years’ imprisonment on the ground that the applicant had no previous criminal record. The applicant’s overall sentence was reduced to seven years’ imprisonment.', 'The court held that the applicant was not punished because he had expressed his opinion or organised an assembly, but because he, as a public official, had stirred up national, racial and religious hatred, disagreement and intolerance by his speech of 24 May 1997 addressed to the citizens of Albanian origin by which he encouraged a group of citizens to criminal activities. As a result there were public riots and disorder on 26 May and 9 July 1997. Furthermore, he, as a public official, had refused to execute the Constitutional Court’s decision and had organised resistance against a lawful decision and activity of a State institution. In particular, he had planned and set up central and regional branches of the crisis headquarters and armed shifts for the protection of the flag of the Republic of Albania.', 'On 12 May 1998 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law, holding that the lower courts’ judgments were precise, consistent and reasoned.', 'On 2 March 1998 the applicant availed himself of his right to submit constitutional complaint concerning the alleged violation of his right to freedom of expression.', 'On 8 April 1998 the Constitutional Court dismissed his complaint. The court found, inter alia, that: a) the applicant had not informed the Local Council and the Government about the unconstitutionality of the decision to display the flags of the Republics of Albania and Turkey and had implemented it; b) had not implemented the interim order of the Constitutional Court of 21 May 1997; c) at the public meeting which had been organised by him and where he delivered his speech, the Albanian anthem had been played, the flag of the Republic of Albania flown, but the Macedonian flag had not been flown; d) from the content of his speech it was clear that he had conveyed a message that the Albanian population was endangered, that it should fight to defend the flag and promised that Gostivar would become an Albanian town; e) organised armed shifts and central and regional headquarters for the protection of the flag of the Republic of Albania and planned resistance in case of an attempt for its removal; and f) prompted by the applicant’s speech and actions the citizens of Albanian origin offered armed resistance on 9 July 1997 which resulted in three lives being lost, many people injured and substantial material damage being caused.', 'The court, inter alia, stated:', '“...', '[The limits of the right to respect for freedom of expression as provided by the Constitution read as a whole, as well as, the Convention are based on] the enforcement of the principle of legality set out in Article 14 § 1 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia (“No person may be punished for an action which was not considered as an offence by law, or other legislation prior to being committed, and for which no sanction has been foreseen”) together with the proscription of actions that impinge upon the rights and freedoms of others and other values guaranteed by the Constitution [that should be] proportionate to the need in a democratic society. ...this is foreseen in Article 2 of the Penal Code of the Republic of Macedonia, which sets out the basis and limits of the criminal punishment, [and] under which “The protection of freedoms and rights of peoples and of other fundamental values, and the enforcement of sanctions [that should be] proportionate to the need to prevent crime provide for the basis and definition of the legal characterisation of criminal offences and sanctions.', '...', 'In particular, the way the applicant made a presentation in public and expressed his opinion, the words he used, the place of his appearance, his position, the aim he wished to achieve and the consequences ..., as well as, the actions he undertook before and after the protest [examined] as a whole represent an action which is directed against legal order as basis for the enjoyment of all freedoms and rights, and it matches the legal characterisation of the criminal offences of which he had been found guilty and sentenced. The circumstance that the criminal offences had been made out by way of action which at its surface appeared to be an enjoyment of the right of freedom of expression does not represent a ground to justify the applicant’s guilt concerning the criminal offences committed, as it transpires from the facts of the case that his action had resulted in loss of the very content of the public expression as guaranteed and protected by the Constitution. The reason for that, as transpires from the facts of the case, is that the applicant with his publicly expressed opinion had not given his intellectual or political stance, nor had [his action] represented a way of intellectual or political persuasion of the persons attending the assembly, but had directly called the citizens of Albanian ethnic origin to disobey or, evenmore, fight against public order, thus causing intolerance, friction and hatred among the citizens of Gostivar in the situation of already existing sensitive inter-ethnic tension, and the feeling of insecurity among the citizens of Albanian ethnic origin, as well as, among the citizens of Macedonian ethnic origin, which all together had the event of 9 July 1997 as its tragic epilogue...”', 'On 4 February 1999 the Parliament adopted the Amnesty Act following which the applicant was granted amnesty and dispensed from having to serve his prison sentence. He was released on 5 February 1999 after having served one year and three months.', 'Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia guarantees the freedom of belief, conscience, opinion and public expression. Article 21 guarantees the right to peaceful assembly. Article 110 §§ 1 and 2 provide that the Constitutional Court is competent to decide on the conformity of the Government regulations and decisions with the Constitution and the laws, whereas § 3 of the same Article sets out the Constitutional Court’s competence to deal with complaints from individuals concerning violation of their rights and freedoms to communication, conscience, opinion and public expression, political association and activities, as well as prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender, race, religion or national, political or social affiliation.', 'Article 115 provides, inter alia, that the citizens directly and through representatives participate in the decision-making in respect of the issues of local relevance.

The applicant was born in 1969 and lived in Turkey until 1981.', '13. The applicant came to the Netherlands with his mother and two brothers in 1981, when he was 12 years old, in order to join his father who had already been living there for ten years. He was granted a residence permit (vergunning tot verblijf) which he was required to renew at one-yearly intervals until 1988, when he obtained a permanent residence permit (vestigingsvergunning).', '14. On 18 January 1989 the applicant was convicted by the single-judge chamber of the Almelo Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of the offence of breach of the peace (lokaalvredebreuk), and fined 200 Netherlands guilders (NLG – 90 euros (EUR)). The same court convicted him on 30 May 1990 of violent offence against the person, committed in public (openlijke geweldpleging), and sentenced him to a fine of NLG 350 (EUR 159) and a suspended term of imprisonment of two weeks.', '15. In 1991 the applicant entered into a relationship with a Netherlands national. They started living together in or around June 1991. A son was born to the couple on 4 February 1992.', '16. On 30 June 1992 the applicant was convicted by the Arnhem Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of violent offence against the person, committed in public, and sentenced to eighty hours of community service (in lieu of six months’ imprisonment).', '17. During the second pregnancy of the applicant’s partner, the relationship began to suffer. In order to alleviate the situation, the applicant moved out in November 1992, but remained in close contact with both his partner and his son. The pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.', '18. On 16 May 1993 the applicant was involved in a dispute in a café. He pulled a loaded gun and shot a man, wounding him in the leg. Outside the café he then got into a fight with a friend of the injured man. He pulled a second loaded gun and shot him in the head. The man died. The applicant was convicted of manslaughter (doodslag) and assault (zware mishandeling) by the Arnhem Court of Appeal on 21 January 1994 and sentenced to seven years’ imprisonment.', '19. Whilst serving his prison sentence, from 17 May 1993 until 14 January 1998, the applicant took courses in computer skills, administration and accounting, and also obtained a retailer’s certificate (middenstandsdiploma). He took further courses in order to qualify as a sports instructor. His partner and son visited him in prison at least once a week and regularly more often. A second son was born to the applicant and his partner on 26 June 1996, whom he also saw every week. Both his children have Netherlands nationality and have been recognised (erkend) by the applicant. Neither his partner nor his children speak Turkish.', '20. By a decision of 30 January 1997, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) withdrew the applicant’s permanent residence permit and imposed a ten-year exclusion order (ongewenstverklaring) on him in view of his conviction of 21 January 1994 and seven-year prison sentence. The Deputy Minister considered that the general interest in ensuring public safety and the prevention of disorder and crime outweighed the applicant’s interest in being able to continue his family life with his partner, children, parents and brothers in the Netherlands.', '21. The applicant lodged an objection (bezwaarschrift) against this decision, arguing that the offence in question had been committed long before, in May 1993, that he had not reoffended, that there was no indication that he would reoffend, and that his partner and children could not be expected to follow him to Turkey. Following a hearing before the Advisory Board on matters concerning aliens (Adviescommissie voor vreemdelingenzaken) on 1 July 1997, at which the applicant was assisted by an interpreter, the Deputy Minister rejected the objection on 4 September 1997 and ordered the applicant to leave the Netherlands as soon as he was released from prison.', '22. The applicant appealed to the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Zwolle, submitting that, as there was no risk of his reoffending, there was no necessity to impose an exclusion order on him and that to do so amounted to the imposition of a second penalty.', '23. The applicant was released from prison on 14 January 1998 and subsequently placed in aliens’ detention (vreemdelingenbewaring) pending his deportation.', '24. Following a hearing on 28 January 1998, the Regional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on 4 February 1998. The Regional Court did not accept the applicant’s argument that the period of time that had elapsed between the date on which his criminal conviction had become irrevocable and the date on which the exclusion order had been imposed was so long that the Deputy Minister should be deemed to have acquiesced in the applicant’s continued residence in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it did not discern any facts or circumstances capable of justifying a reduction of the period for which the applicant would be excluded from Netherlands territory. The applicant’s claim that there was no risk of his reoffending was based solely on his own statements and was not supported by the facts, given that he had also been convicted of violent offences in 1990 and 1992. In addition, it did not appear that the applicant had put down roots in the Netherlands or become dissociated from Turkish society to such a degree that he would be unable to return to his country of origin. Finally, the Regional Court considered that the interference with the applicant’s family life was justified for the purposes of preventing disorder and crime.', '25. The applicant was deported to Turkey on 11 February 1998. However, it appears that he returned to the Netherlands soon afterwards, as he was apprehended there on 29 May 1998. He was again deported to Turkey on 4 June 1998, and a request for a provisional stay of execution of the deportation order, which he had lodged with the Regional Court of The Hague, was declared inadmissible on 24 August 1998. He was also convicted of the offence of residing illegally in the Netherlands while subject to an exclusion order (Article 197 of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht)) and sentenced to three months’ imprisonment.', '26. On 17 September 1998 the applicant requested that the exclusion order be revoked. The Deputy Minister of Justice refused the request on 26 October 1998 and on 13 April 2000 dismissed an objection the applicant had filed against that refusal. The applicant subsequently lodged an appeal, which was declared inadmissible by the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Zwolle, on 2 August 2000. No appeal lay against that decision.', '27. The applicant submitted that, prior to his deportation in 1998, he had only been back to Turkey once in order to attend the funeral of his grandmother, and that he did not speak the Turkish language apart from understanding certain expressions. His only relative in Turkey was an uncle with whom he had no contact.', '28. According to a report drawn up by a psychiatrist in Turkey on 9 June 1998, the applicant was suffering from psychological problems as a result of being separated from his family. In particular, not being able to see his children was making him depressed. Treatment had begun in March 1998 and was continuing, though some improvement had been noted.', '29. On 29 March 2006 the applicant was discovered working at an illegal cannabis plantation in the Netherlands. He was arrested and subsequently placed in aliens’ detention. This detention was discontinued on 1 May 2006 in order to execute the judgment whereby the applicant had been sentenced to three months’ imprisonment (see paragraph 25 above). On 16 May 2006 the applicant was deported to Turkey.', '30. At the relevant time the decision to withdraw the applicant’s residence permit and to impose an exclusion order on him was taken under sections 14 and 21 of the Aliens Act 1965 (Vreemdelingenwet 1965) and in accordance with the policy laid down in Chapters A4 and A5 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 1994 (Vreemdelingencirculaire – a body of directives drawn up and published by the Ministry of Justice). Underlying this policy is the principle that the longer an alien has lawfully resided in the Netherlands – and the stronger, therefore, his or her ties with the Netherlands are assumed to be – the more serious an offence must be before it can justify withdrawing a residence permit and excluding the alien from Netherlands territory; the authorities thus apply a sliding scale (glijdende schaal).', '31. In accordance with this policy, a residence permit may be withdrawn and an exclusion order imposed on an alien who, at the time of committing the offence, has been lawfully residing in the Netherlands for more than ten but less than fifteen years – like the applicant in the present case – if he or she is sentenced to an unsuspended prison sentence of more than sixty months following a conviction for a serious, violent crime or for drug trafficking.', '32. If an exclusion order is imposed on the basis of a conviction for a serious, violent crime or drug trafficking, this order will in any event be revoked, upon request, if the alien has been residing outside the Netherlands for a period of ten years and if he has not been convicted of further criminal offences (Chapter A5/6.4 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines 1994).', '33. A person upon whom an exclusion order has been imposed is not allowed either to reside in or to visit the Netherlands.', '34. Article 15 § 2 of the Criminal Code reads:', '“A convicted person sentenced to a custodial sentence for a determinate period of which more than one year is to be executed shall be granted early release when two-thirds of that sentence have been served.”', 'Article 15a of the Criminal Code, in so far as relevant, provides:', '“1. Early release may be postponed or withheld where:', '(a) the convicted person, on grounds of the inadequate development or pathological disturbance of his mental faculties, has been placed in an institution for the treatment of persons subject to an order for confinement in a custodial clinic and where continuation of treatment is required;', '(b) the convicted person has been convicted in a final judgment of a serious offence for which, pursuant to Article 67 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [Wetboek van Strafvordering], detention on remand [voorlopige hechtenis] is allowed and where the offence was committed after the execution of his sentence commenced;', '(c) there is evidence that the convicted person has otherwise grossly misbehaved after the execution of his sentence commenced;', '(d) the convicted person evades, or attempts to evade, his sentence after its execution has commenced.', '2. If the prosecuting authorities [Openbaar Ministerie] charged with the execution of the sentence consider that, on one of the grounds mentioned in the first paragraph, there is cause for postponing or withholding early release, it shall lodge a written request to that effect with the Arnhem Court of Appeal without delay. ...”', '35. With regard to the various texts adopted by the Council of Europe in the field of immigration, mention should be made of the Committee of Ministers Recommendations Rec(2000)15 concerning the security of residence of long-term migrants and Rec(2002)4 on the legal status of persons admitted for family reunification, and of Parliamentary Assembly Recommendation 1504 (2001) on the non-expulsion of long-term immigrants.', '36. Recommendation Rec(2000)15 states, inter alia:', '“4. As regards the protection against expulsion', '(a) Any decision on expulsion of a long-term immigrant should take account, having due regard to the principle of proportionality and in the light of the European Court of Human Rights’ constant case-law, of the following criteria:', '– the personal behaviour of the immigrant;', '– the duration of residence;', '– the consequences for both the immigrant and his or her family;', '– existing links of the immigrant and his or her family to his or her country of origin.', '(b) In application of the principle of proportionality as stated in paragraph 4 (a), member States should duly take into consideration the length or type of residence in relation to the seriousness of the crime committed by the long-term immigrant. More particularly, member States may provide that a long-term immigrant should not be expelled:', '– after five years of residence, except in the case of a conviction for a criminal offence where sentenced to in excess of two years’ imprisonment without suspension;', '– after ten years of residence, except in the case of a conviction for a criminal offence where sentenced to in excess of five years of imprisonment without suspension.', 'After twenty years of residence, a long-term immigrant should no longer be expellable.', '(c) Long-term immigrants born on the territory of the member State or admitted to the member State before the age of ten, who have been lawfully and habitually resident, should not be expellable once they have reached the age of eighteen.', 'Long-term immigrants who are minors may in principle not be expelled.', '(d) In any case, each member State should have the option to provide in its internal law that a long-term immigrant may be expelled if he or she constitutes a serious threat to national security or public safety.”', '37. In Recommendation 1504 (2001) the Parliamentary Assembly recommended that the Committee of Ministers invite the governments of member States, inter alia:', '“11. ...', '(ii) ...', '(c) to undertake to ensure that the ordinary-law procedures and penalties applied to nationals are also applicable to long-term immigrants who have committed the same offence;', '...', '(g) to take the necessary steps to ensure that in the case of long-term migrants the sanction of expulsion is applied only to particularly serious offences affecting State security of which they have been found guilty;', '(h) to guarantee that migrants who were born or raised in the host country and their under-age children cannot be expelled under any circumstances;', '...”', 'The Committee of Ministers replied to the Assembly on the matter of non-expulsion of certain migrants on 6 December 2002. It considered that Recommendation Rec(2000)15 addressed many of the concerns of the Assembly and it was thus not minded to devise any new standards.', '38. Under the heading “Effective protection against expulsion of family members”, the Committee of Ministers recommended to governments in Recommendation Rec(2002)4 that, where the withdrawal of or refusal to renew a residence permit, or the expulsion of a family member, is being considered:', '“...member States should have proper regard to criteria such as the person’s place of birth, his age of entry on the territory, the length of residence, his family relationships, the existence of family ties in the country of origin and the solidity of social and cultural ties with the country of origin. Special consideration should be paid to the best interest and well-being of children.”', '39. In the majority of the member States of the Council of Europe, second-generation immigrants may be deported by the authorities on the ground that they have been convicted of a criminal offence. Eight member States have provided in their laws that second-generation immigrants cannot be deported on the basis of their criminal record or activities: Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Portugal and Sweden. Apart from Iceland and Norway, this protection is not confined to those who were actually born in the host country but also applies to foreigners who arrived during childhood (varying from before the age of three in Austria to before the age of fifteen in Sweden).']",[],[],[],['8'],[],[],0

She is represented before the Court by Mr Urbanek, a lawyer practising in St. Pölten (Austria).', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicant is the owner of a house in Weißenkirchen (Austria). In 1985 the applicant’s neighbour, A. K., applied for a building permit for a new barn. On 16 August 1985 the Mayor (Bürgermeister) of Weißenkirchen granted the building permit. In the following following years A. K. built the barn.', 'On 26 June 1991, after a hearing, the Mayor granted both a retroactive permit for certain modifications of A. K’s project and the permit to use the building (Benützungsbewilligung).', 'On 9 June 1992 the applicant, who had not been summoned to this hearing, appealed against the permit to use the building and submitted that the new building did not comply with the building permit. In particular she submitted that, because the barn was too close to her land, more rainwater and snow than before was deposited on her land which had adversely affected the soil and her house.', 'On 31 January 1994 the Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant filed a further appeal (Vorstellung) against this decision.', 'On 15 May 1995 the District Authority quashed the decision for procedural reasons.', 'On 17 June 1996 the Municipal Council again dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that the applicant had no locus standi in the proceedings concerning the permit to use the building.', 'On 7 October 1996 the Lower Austria Regional Government (Landesregierung) allowed the applicant’s further appeal, quashed the decision and remitted the case to the Municipal Council. It found that the applicant had locus standi as the proceedings were also related to a modification of the building permit. Furthermore, it found that the neighbour’s building did not comply with the building permit and that the permit to use the building was therefore unlawful. Finally, it stated that A.K. had to apply for a new building permit as regards the parts of the barn which had not been built in conformity with the building permit granted.', 'On 7 November 1996 the Municipal Council, implementing the Regional Government’s decision, allowed the applicant’s appeal of 9 June 1992.', 'On 29 March 1997 A. K. applied for a new building permit. The applicant lodged objections against this project.', 'On 18 November 1997 the Mayor held a hearing.', 'On 19 December 1997 the Mayor granted the building permit. On 5 January 1998 the applicant appealed against this decision. She submitted that the building permit was unlawful and that the legal adviser, who had assisted the Mayor during the hearing, had been biased.', 'On 2 July 1998 the Municipal Council dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It found that there was no indication that the legal adviser had been biased.', 'On 17 July 1998 the applicant filed a further appeal.', 'On 10 February 1999 the Regional Government allowed the applicants further appeal, quashed the decision and remitted the case to the Municipal Council. It found that the Lower Austrian Building Act 1996 (Bauordnung) would be applicable to A. K.’s application for a building permit and not the previous version of the building act. Moreover, it found that A.K.’s application was insufficient and, therefore, the building permit unlawful. On that basis the Municipal Council had to dismiss A.K.’s application. If A.K. would not properly apply for a building permit, proceedings for a demolition order had to be considered. Moreover, it stated that it was not necessary to deal with the complaint about the unfairness of the proceedings as the Municipal Council’s decision should be quashed following this decision.', 'On 24 March 1999 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court against this decision. She complained, inter alia, that the Regional Government had wrongly interpreted the transitional provision of the Lower Austrian Building Act 1996. Since the proceedings had already been pending when this Act came into force, the former Building Act should have been applicable. This complaint had no suspensive effect.', 'On 11 November 1999 the Municipal Council, implementing the Regional Governments decision of 10 February 1999, quashed the Mayor’s decision of 19 December 1997.', 'The applicant filed a further appeal against this decision, as she considered that the Municipal Council had misinterpreted the decision of the Regional Government.', 'On 5 May 2000 the Regional Government allowed the applicant’s appeal, quashed the decision of 11 November 1999 and remitted the case to the Municipal Council. It found that the latter had to take a decision on the merits and was not allowed to remit the case to the Mayor. Further it repeated its finding that the Lower Austrian Building Act 1996 was applicable in the proceedings at issue. The applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against this decision.', 'On 20 April 2001 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaints against the Regional Government’s decisions of 10 February 1999 and 5 May 2000.', 'On 5 November 2001 A.K. withdraw the application of 29 March 1997 for the building permit and informed the Municipal authorities that he would file a new application for a retroactive building permit for the barn.', 'The Government submits that A.K. has, at an unspecified date, filed a new request for a building permit.

001-23192,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,MENSON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicants are Alex, Chris, Daniel, Essie, Kwesi and Samantha Menson. They are siblings of Michael Menson, a black man who was killed as a result of being set on fire by assailants in a racist attack during the night of 27-28 January 1997. The applicants are all British nationals living in England. They are represented before the Court by Bindman & Partners, a firm of solicitors practising in London, England.', 'At the time of his death, Michael Menson was a single thirty-year old black man. He suffered a mental breakdown in 1991 and was subsequently diagnosed and treated in hospital for schizophrenia. After March 1996, Michael Menson frequently received treatment at Chase Farm Hospital for his mental condition.', 'When Michael Menson was not in hospital he lived in his own accommodation in New Southgate, London. However, two months before his death he moved into accommodation for persons with mental health problems at Holden Lodge, North London.', 'On about 21 January 1997, Michael Menson was given leave from Chase Farm Hospital and went to stay at Holden Lodge.', 'On the night of 27 January 1997, at about 10 p.m., Chie Menson telephoned Michael Menson at Holden Lodge. She told him that she had received a message from Chase Farm Hospital that he was to return there as soon as possible for his “ward-round”. Some time after that telephone call Michael Menson left Holden Lodge with the apparent intention of returning to Chase Farm Hospital.', 'It appears that having left Holden Lodge, Michael Menson took the wrong bus for his destination and he ended up getting off the bus in Edmonton, North London. He was subsequently attacked by four white youths who had got off the bus with him. They set his back on fire, probably whilst he was lying face down on the ground.', 'He was found on fire at approximately 1.40 a.m. on 28 January 1997 by an off-duty fireman who had been passing by in a car. At the time he was found, Michael Menson appeared to be in a severe state of shock with severe burns to his back, buttocks and upper thighs. The off-duty fireman flagged down a passing police car with two police officers in it. They in turn summoned an ambulance.', 'According to the applicants, the two police officers did not treat the circumstances of Michael’s discovery as suspicious and wrongly assumed that he had set fire to himself. Consequently, they failed to investigate the crime scene at all at that stage or to set in motion any trains of inquiry to search for or identify and catch Michael Menson’s attackers. It was only after specific instructions from Michael Menson’s family at a later stage that the police began to treat the attack as suspicious and to investigate it.', 'An ambulance arrived and Michael Menson was taken to North Middlesex Hospital where he was admitted and treated. It seems that the police officers left the scene of the incident when Michael Menson was taken to hospital.', 'Michael Menson was found to have sustained full thickness third degree burns to 30% of his body. Owing to the severity of his burns, he was transferred to the Regional Burns Unit in Billericay Hospital.', 'Sometime between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. on 28 January 1997, two officers arrived at the house of Ezekial Adewale, Michael Menson’s friend, in the mistaken belief that he was Michael Menson’s next-of-kin. It appears that the police had made this mistake as a result of inquiries to Chase Farm Hospital where Ezekial Adewale’s name and address were obtained.', 'The two police officers told Ezekial Adewale that Michael Menson had set himself on fire whilst walking along the North Circular Road in North London. The officers repeated this and stated that Michael Menson had been lucky because they had been passing, saw him on fire and had stopped and helped to extinguish the fire. Ezekial Adewale asked these officers if they had informed Michael Menson’s family. They told him they had not and he immediately gave them the address of Michael Menson’s brothers, Kwesi and Daniel.', 'Shortly afterwards, again sometime between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m., the same two police officers arrived at Kwesi and Daniel Menson’s home. The police officers told them that Michael Menson had set himself on fire in Edmonton, that he had been seriously injured and had initially been taken to the North Middlesex Hospital but had been subsequently transferred and was receiving treatment in the Regional Burns Unit in Billericay Hospital. The officers then asked Kwesi Menson to sign for some charred papers and two burnt keys which had been found on Michael Menson’s person and asked him whether Michael had been on medication or whether he had a mental health background.', 'Kwesi and Daniel Menson immediately went to Billericay Hopsital sometime around 3 a.m. They could not see Michael Menson at first because he was still receiving treatment for his burns. At about 11 a.m. they were allowed to see him briefly. He appeared alert and lucid and was able to answer their questions. Kwesi Menson asked his brother what had happened and Michael replied that he had been attacked by four white boys.', 'Michael Menson’s explanation to his brother conflicted with the report given by the police officers and so Kwesi Menson telephoned Edmonton Police Station at approximately 11.30 a.m. on 28 January 1997. He spoke to a police officer and told her that Michael Menson had told him that he had been attacked by four white boys.', 'On the evening of 28 January 1997, Alex Menson telephoned the hospital and was able to speak to Michael. Once again, although in pain, he was lucid and able to tell his sister about his recollection of the incident. He said that he remembered catching a bus in the wrong direction and that there had been four white boys on the bus, one of whom had been wearing a black leather jacket. He had got off the bus at the same stop as these white boys and followed them to ask for directions. He remembered that shortly after this he was leaning against something and then had felt something on his back. He then discovered that he was on fire and started to take his clothes off.', 'Following this conversation Alex Menson spoke to the ward sister at the hospital and a consultant treating Michael Menson and received confirmation that there were no contra-medical indications preventing Michael from being interviewed by the police. She also made requests to the police that they should come and interview Michael Menson about the attack.', 'Over the next 48 hours, Kwesi Menson again asked Michael Menson about what had happened. Michael Menson gave the same account. Kwesi Menson took notes on these occasions. Kwesi Menson had been asked to keep notes of these conversations by his sister, Alex Menson, because the police had resisted her requests to take a statement directly from Michael.', 'Kwesi Menson called the police on approximately three occasions from 28 to 29 January 1997 urging them to come to the hospital to take a statement from Michael. Alex Menson also called the police on repeated occasions over the same period requesting them: to take a statement from Michael; to go to the site of the incident; to take finger prints from the telephone box near to the place where Michael had been found; to interview local people; to put up an incident board requesting information; and to launch a media appeal for witnesses.', 'On 30 January 1997 Detective Inspector Williams came to the hospital, but he arrived at a time when Michael Menson was drowsy. Detective Inspector Williams decided not to take a statement from Michael Menson. Kwesi Menson gave a statement to Detective Inspector Williams summarising Michael’s account of the incident. However, during this meeting Kwesi Menson became very concerned because Detective Inspector Williams did not appear to take a full or accurate record of what Kwesi Menson was saying.', 'During the period between 28 January to 3 February 1997 Michael Menson received surgical treatment almost every day. When he was not in a post-operative state and up until 31 January, he was lucid, sitting up, talking to his family, feeding himself, doing crosswords, chatting with hospital staff and taking telephone calls. This included a telephone conversation with Ezekial Adewale during which Michael repeated his account of the incident and the attack by four young white men which, he stated, had occurred near a telephone box in Edmonton.', 'Notwithstanding Michael’s ability to make such statements to his family and friends, neither Detective Inspector Williams nor any other police officer took a statement from him at any stage.', 'On 3 February 1997 Michael Menson had a cardiac arrest and fell into a coma until 13 February 1997, when he died.', 'On 26 February 1997 the inquest into Michael Menson’s death before the Coroner’s Court was opened. It was adjourned on a number of occasions. During this time the police reported to the Coroner on several occasions, but copies of these reports were not disclosed to Michael Menson’s family.', 'In January 1998 an examination into the procedures and practices during the first stage of the investigation into Michael Menson’s death was carried out by the Metropolitan Police Service (“MPS”). In March 1998 the results of this examination were produced. The family were informed that this examination confirmed some of the doubts that the enquiry was not handled as well as it could have been and that an Investigating Officer had been formally appointed to look into the matter. The examination was made available to the Coroner but was kept back from the family as being confidential.', 'On 19 August 1998 the Menson family sent a letter of complaint to the Police Complaints Authority (“PCA”) concerning the MPS’s decision to withhold evidence from Michael Menson’s family prior to the inquest.', 'On 25 August 1998 Deputy Assistant Commissioner Townsend of Area 3 of the MPS responded informing the family that the complaint did not fall within section 84 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 and therefore would not be recorded as such. This letter went on to respond to points of concern expressed in the letter of complaint.', 'On 16 September 1998 a verdict of unlawful killing was returned by a jury at Hornsey Coroner’s Court following a hearing lasting just over one week during which evidence had been given by a number of witnesses including fire experts on behalf of the MPS.', 'On 16 September 1998 Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Townsend issued a statement on behalf of the MPS regretting that for the first 12 hours after the attack on Michael Menson, the police treated it as a case of self-immolation.', 'On 25 September 1998 the family lodged a further letter of complaint with the PCA setting out the particulars of complaints in detail from the time that Michael Menson was discovered by the police in the early hours of 28 January 1997 until shortly after the inquest. The following criticism of the police’s handling of the case was made in the letter of complaint:', '1. There were major errors in the police investigation of Michael Menson’s death, at the very outset of the case (and beyond) which substantially diminished the chances of detecting and prosecuting those responsible for Michael Menson’s death.', '2. There was a concerted effort by all key officers (from the officers first on the scene, to Deputy Assistant Commissioner level) to minimise and obscure these errors and deflect criticism from the police.', '3. These imperatives led the police:', '– to continue, beyond the first 12 hours of the investigation of Michael Menson’s death, to fail diligently or promptly to investigate the death;', '– to pressurise, abuse and mislead the Menson family about how Michael Menson met his death and the police investigation, with a view to affecting their ability properly to grieve and be represented at the inquest;', '– improperly to influence the Coroner conducting the inquest and to seek to lead the jury to bring a verdict which was least embarrassing to the Metropolitan Police.', '4. The police investigation into Michael Menson’s death was affected by racism and the subsequent internal investigation into the quality of the investigation failed even to address this issue.', 'The PCA appointed the Chief Constable of the Cambridgeshire Constabulary to carry out an investigation into the family’s complaint.', 'On 20 January 1999 the applicants were advised by Counsel that there were no reasonable grounds for advising the grant of legal aid to bring proceedings against the police in the light of the domestic law in respect of actions in negligence and claims of racial discrimination against the police.', 'On 15 February 1999 a Report of an Inquiry chaired by Sir William Macpherson of Cluny, a retired High Court Judge, was published into matters arising from the death of Stephen Lawrence, a black 18-year old youth who was murdered by a group of youths on 22 April 1993. The Inquiry investigating his death and its subsequent investigation by the MPS found that institutional racism existed both in the MPS and in other police services and institutions countrywide. The Inquiry found institutional racism primarily apparent in the actual investigation of Stephen Lawrence’s murder, including the police treatment and approach to the victim, key witnesses and the family of Stephen Lawrence and the “lack of urgency and commitment in some areas of the investigation”.', 'On 4 March 1999 the family of Michael Menson, with the assistance of campaigners, leafleted the area within which the suspects lived appealing for further information in respect of the murder.', 'On 9 March 1999 a suspect was arrested and later charged in connection with the death of Michael Menson. Two further suspects were arrested and later charged on 11 March 1999. Two of the accused (M.P. and C.C.) were committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court, London, for the murder of Michael Menson and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. The third accused (H.A.) was committed to stand trial at the Central Criminal Court for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. On 5 May 1999 another suspect (O.C.) was arrested in northern Cyprus and charged there on 5 August 1999 with the murder of Michael Menson.', 'On 15 June 1999 the applicants’ solicitor wrote to the PCA asking that the PCA also investigate other areas of complaint including the failure of the pre-inquest investigating teams to co-operate fully with the Racial and Violent Crime Unit and the making of untrue and misleading press statements damaging to Michael Menson’s family.', 'On 21 October 1999 the applicants’ solicitor was informed that the PCA had felt it wise to delay any further investigation into the applicants’ complaints pending the outcome of the criminal case against the accused in the English courts.', 'Further letters of complaints were addressed by the applicants’ solicitors to the Director of the Task Force alleging a failure on the part of the Task Force to liaise or to communicate adequately with the Menson family in respect of the criminal proceedings against the accused including the trial taking place in northern Cyprus.', 'On 25 November 1999 a criminal court in northern Cyprus found O.C. guilty of the manslaughter of Michael Menson and sentenced him to fourteen years’ imprisonment. By letter dated 23 December 2002, the applicants’ lawyer informed the Registry that the accused’s appeal had been rejected on 29 June 2001.', 'In December 1999 the Central Criminal Court in London found M.P. guilty of murder and sentenced him to life imprisonment. C.C. received a ten-year prison sentence for manslaughter. H.A. (and his co-accused) was convicted of perverting the course of justice in connection with the murder of Michael Menson and the subsequent investigation. All three accused received separate sentences on this count. According to the applicants’ lawyer’s letter of 23 December 2002, all of the accused’s appeals were rejected although the sentence of one of them was reduced.', 'The applicants maintain that the evidence given in the trials against the accused revealed the inadequacy of the police investigation. The applicants listed twenty-two areas of concern in a letter addressed by their solicitor to the PCA on 22 June 2000, including: the unfounded belief of police officers following the attack on Michael Menson that he had tried to commit suicide; the failure to seal the scene of the crime resulting in a loss of evidence; the failure to record or act on Michael Menson’s accounts to medical and nursing staff that other persons were responsible for what happened to him; the error of the police in recording the deceased’s injuries as non-life-threatening; threats made to and harassment of members of the deceased’s family by the police when, for example, they queried the police appeal for witnesses to come forward; assertions made by a police officer at the inquest that there was no evidence that others were involved in Michael Menson’s death; and the conduct of the police with respect to the conduct of the inquest and the criminal trials.', 'The Menson family members made formal statements to the Cambridge Constabulary investigating the case on behalf of the PCA in support of these complaints, as well as the complaints set out in the letter dated 25 September 1998 from the applicants’ solicitor.', 'On 8 February 2000 the PCA wrote to the applicants’ solicitor reporting on the evidence collated to date. The letter stated among other things:', '“Carefully examining the first 12 hours will be fundamental to understanding what came later as it appears that once flawed explanations had entered the minds of police officers, to varying degrees it appears it remained present throughout the ensuing period up to, including and after the inquest. To what extent racial stereotyping of both Michael Menson and the Menson family took place and how this may have affected the investigation of his death will be an integral part of the investigation throughout. Similarly we will be examining whether there was an institutional failure by the Metropolitan Police to challenge with sufficient rigour the assumptions made at the start. This will include examining this issue up to and including Chief Officer levels if necessary.”', 'On 22 April 2000 the PCA wrote to the applicants’ solicitors stating, among other things:', '“There is now available a significant body of evidence containing new information about these events, which appears to provide support for the family’s complaints from a number of independent directions ....”', 'On 13 September 2000 the applicants’ solicitor received an anonymous statement dated 1 September from a member or ex-member of the MPS. This statement, purportedly made on behalf of certain unidentified “serving and retired members”, contained serious allegations of misconduct by certain police officers involved in the investigation, including an allegation that one had lied to the Coroner during the inquest proceedings.', 'On 2 November 2000 the applicants’ representatives were informed at a meeting that the PCA had begun to interview nine police officers under caution but that only one had chosen to answer questions. A further difficulty was that certain key police officers had retired or were about to retire and could not be interviewed without their consent, and in any event not under caution. A report could not expected before November 2001 at the latest.', 'One key officer (S.) retired on at the beginning of 2001 and was therefore no longer subject to the police disciplinary code.', 'On 31 December 2002 the PCA informed the applicants’ solicitors in writing that it had received the Investigating Officer’s report and that the PCA was satisfied with the investigation which had been carried out into the applicants’ complaints. A copy of the report (which was supported by 218 statements, 465 documents, 18 interviews with officers under investigation and 17 appendices) had been made available to the Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”). The applicants’ solicitors’ were further informed that they would be notified if the CPS decided to bring criminal charges in the event of findings that any police officers had committed a criminal offence. The PCA’s letter concluded:', '“I regret that there may be yet further delay while these next steps in dealing with your complaint are completed. The Authority will consider the disciplinary aspects of the case only after any criminal issues have been decided.”', 'In England it is a rule of the common law that no one can recover damages in tort for the death of another (Baker v. Bolton (1808) 1 Camp. 493).', 'The Section 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 confers a right of action for a wrongful act causing death. Section 1(2) of that Act provides that an action may be brought for the benefit of the “dependants” of any deceased person against a person who wrongfully caused the death. If there is no dependency, there is no pecuniary loss to recover as damages. Bereavement damages (currently fixed at £7,500) are only available to parents of a child under the age of 18 (section1A(2)). Funeral expenses are recoverable (section 3(5)).', 'The statutory survival of causes of action enables recovery on behalf of the deceased’s estate of damages for losses suffered by the deceased before he died. This includes any non-pecuniary loss such as damages for any pain and suffering experienced between the infliction of injury and death.', 'Domestic case-law on the liability of the police at the relevant time in civil law for acts or omissions in the investigation and suppression of criminal offences is summarised in the Court’s Osman v. the United Kingdom judgment (Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VIII).', 'On 30 November 2000 the Race Relations (Amendment) Act received Royal Assent.

The 2000 Act has no retrospective effect.', 'Section 75 provides for the application of the provisions of the Act to persons holding statutory office as it applies to private persons. Therefore police constables are subject to its provisions.', 'A discrimination claim against the police in the conduct of its investigations may only be brought if it falls within the exhaustive provisions set out in the 1976 Act and, in particular, section 20, which deals with the provision of services to the public or a section of the public.', 'The Court of Appeal has held in the case of Farah -v- Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1997] 2 WLR 824 that only those parts of a police officer’s duties involving assistance to or protection of members of the public amount to the provision of services to the public for the purposes of section 20(1) of the 1976 Act. According to the applicants, this greatly limits the scope of any claim under the 1976 Act against the police. In the applicants’ conclusion, there is no provision in the 1976 Act that permits an action to be brought in respect of the police investigation of the attack on Michael Menson or confers any legal remedy in respect thereof.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

ROMANIA,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra;Mihai Poalelungi,"['1. The applicant, Mr Marcel Ţehanciuc, is a Romanian national who was born in 1966 and lives in Suceava.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.', '3. On 8 December 2003 the applicant, who was a customs officer in the Siret customs service, was indicted and sent before the criminal courts, accused of having accepted bribes, of committing forgery and of abuse of his official position, offences sanctioned by Article 254 § 2, Article 248 and Article 289 of the Romanian Criminal Code and sections 7(1) and 17(c) and (d) of Law no. 78/2000 on the prevention, discovery and sanctioning of acts of corruption.', 'The indictment contained detailed references to the criminal investigation started in 2002 and conducted with respect to a certain Mr. E. It stated that in 2002 the police had found that Mr. E had been illegally importing goods into Romania without paying the taxes due, allegedly with the help of some customs officers and some border policemen to whom he had allegedly given various amounts of money. The goods, which had been declared as destined for private use, had in fact been subsequently placed on the market and sold, and as such were not exempted from customs duties.', 'Besides Mr. E. and the applicant, eight customs officers were sent for trial before the Suceava County Court. The customs officers, including the applicant, were charged with taking bribes, but also with improper conduct in the exercise of their professional duties, namely in the application of the customs regulations concerning the importing into the country of the goods in question.', 'Some customs officers and the members of the border police were not indicted on the ground that the acts committed by them lacked intention or that they had only committed professional faults, while some of them received an administrative fine.', 'The evidence adduced by the prosecution included the statements of Mr. E. accusing the customs officers of taking bribes, statements which he partially withdrew later before the courts, testimonials of witnesses to the effect that E. had declared as private goods merchandise belonging to his company, a notebook belonging to E. containing inscriptions with dates when he entered the country, initials of persons (presumed to be those of the customs officers), figures placed in reference to those initials (presumed to represent amounts of money given to those customs officers), the customs forms signed by the customs officers upon each entry into Romania of E., as well as a list of telephone calls delivered by the telephone companies to the prosecution and indicating numbers called by E. and the duration of the calls during the relevant period.', '4. As a result of his being sent for trial, the applicant was suspended from his public duties pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. The National Customs Authority, the applicant’s employer, issued its decision in accordance with the provisions of section 79(2) of Law no. 188/1999 on the Regulations governing Public Servants.', '5. On 9, 10 and 11 December 2003 several local newspapers published articles about the applicant’s case. The articles included the list of all the customs officers sent for trial. The newspapers did not disclose the source of their information and no public authority was cited in the articles; no direct reference to documents in the prosecution file was made.', '6. During the proceedings before it, the Suceava County Court allowed further evidence to be adduced, namely documents and other testimonials. The applicant claimed his innocence, stating that he had not received any amount of money, that he had drawn up the customs forms according to the appropriate Customs Regulations and that the internal rules applied in his work provided that in order to avoid errors committed by a customs officer, random checks were to be made upon vehicles entering the country by a superior or by the border police, which had been done in the case of E. He further claimed that he could not be convicted for taking bribes in the absence of evidence that he had received undue amounts of money and that he had done so intentionally.', 'In his defence, he requested, among other things, that an accounting and customs report be produced to prove that the customs operations had been conducted by him in accordance with the customs regulations. The prosecution objected to the production of an expert’s report. The court rejected the request as not relevant, in so far as the file contained documents drawn up in the preliminary investigation establishing the amount of the damage.', 'On 1 July 2005 the Suceava County Court found the applicant guilty of all the crimes he had been charged with and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The sentence was suspended and he was given three years’ parole. The civil claims submitted by the Suceava General Department of Public Finance and the Iaşi Customs Department concerning alleged pecuniary damage were dismissed for belatedness.', '7. The applicant appealed against this judgment. He claimed that the first-instance court had relied on evidence that was inconsistent and not sufficient to prove the charges brought against him, especially considering that Mr E. had withdrawn his statements according to which he had bribed the customs officers. The applicant also submitted that the legal classification of the alleged criminal acts was incorrect.', 'The parties that had submitted civil claims, namely the Suceava General Department of Public Finance and the Iaşi Customs Department also challenged the judgment with respect to their requests concerning the alleged pecuniary damage.', 'On 13 February 2006 the Suceava Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment with regard to the applicant’s conviction and also concerning the civil claims of the public institutions.', '8. Following the applicant’s appeal on points of law, on 9 November 2007 the High Court of Cassation and Justice held that the facts and the law applicable to the case had been established correctly by both the first-instance and appellate courts and that the applicant’s conviction was based on sufficient evidence and was in accordance with the law.', 'With reference to the civil claims in the file and considering the appeal on points of law lodged exclusively by the Suceava General Department of Public Finance, the High Court quashed the previous judgments and decided to refer the case back to the first-instance court for a new assessment, in so far as their dismissal for belatedness with respect to the appellant had not been lawful.', '9. These proceedings ended on 21 May 2008, when the Suceava County Court gave its judgment, holding that the case remained without object in so far as Mr. E. had paid all the amounts owed to the State’s budget. This judgment was not challenged and on 16 June 2008 it became final.', '10. Section 79 of Law no. 188/1999 concerning Regulations governing Public Servants, as in force on 11 December 2003, provides as follows:', '“(1) The liability of a civil servant for offences committed in the course of his duties or in relation to his work attributions shall be established in accordance with the criminal law.', '(2) In the event of criminal proceedings being initiated in personam (punerea în mişcare a acţiunii penale) concerning criminal acts such as those provided for in section 49 (h) [crimes against the State, against a public authority, concerning work relations... involving corruption or otherwise... that would disqualify the person from exercising public office], the director of the public authority or institution shall order the suspension of the civil servant from the public office he/she holds.', '(3) If the criminal proceedings are terminated or if the court pronounces an acquittal or the termination of the case, the suspension ceases, and the public servant shall be reinstated to the previously held public office and all the salary rights corresponding to the suspension period shall be granted to him/her.”', '11. The relevant provisions of the Romanian Criminal Code in force at the time of the relevant facts read as follows:', '“(1) The act of a public servant who, either directly or indirectly, for himself or for another, claims or receives money or other undue benefits, or accepts the promise of such benefits or does not reject it, in order to perform, not to perform or to delay the accomplishment of an act with regard to his/her service duties or in order to perform an act that is contrary to these duties, shall be punished by imprisonment from 3 to 12 years and the deprivation of certain rights.', '(2) The act in paragraph (1), if it has been committed by a civil servant or a person exercising a service of public interest, shall be punished by strict imprisonment from 3 to 15 years and the deprivation of certain rights.”', '“The act of a public servant, who, in the exercise of service prerogatives, knowingly fails to perform an act or performs it erroneously and by so doing causes significant disturbance to the proper operation of a public authority or institution or of a legal entity, or causes damage to its property, shall be punished by imprisonment from 6 months to 5 years.”', '“(1) The act of forging an official document when it is drawn up, committed by an employee in the exercise of his/her working duties, by certifying untrue acts or circumstances or by omitting, knowingly, to insert certain data or circumstances, shall be punished by imprisonment from 6 months to 5 years.', '(2) Any attempt to commit such an act shall also be punished.”', '12. In 2004 the Romanian Constitutional Court was seized with a plea of unconstitutionality regarding Section 65 (3) provisions of the Government Emergency Ordinance no. 360/2002 regulating the Police Officers’ Statute; the provisions, as laid out at the time, stipulated that in the event when a police officer was charged with criminal acts allegedly committed in relation with his/her job, he/she was to be suspended from his/her office, until a final judgment in the criminal proceedings was given.', 'In its decision delivered on 27 May 2004, the Romanian Constitutional Court held that the suspension of a police officer, as it was prescribed at the time, did not breach the presumption of innocence in so far as:', 'Even though the suspension from office does determine the limitation of certain rights and liberties, it cannot be considered to be in breach of the presumption of innocence. This measure is necessary for the protection of public order and for the proper administration of justice.', 'The suspension from office of a policeman is ordered when he/she has intentionally committed a criminal act that would make him/she incompatible with his office; it is a measure taken for the protection of the employer’s interests in its facing the danger that the illicit activity could continue and the consequences of the criminal acts could expand, the protection being accomplished by preventing similar acts to be perpetrated and by upholding the prestige of the institution.', 'More particulars of the domestic legislation on the Police Officers’ Statute and of the Constitutional Court’s decision are presented in the case of Calmanovici v. Romania (no. 42250/02, §§ 50-51, 1 July 2008), in which the issue of the suspension of a police officer on account of his being arrested and sent before trial for allegedly committed criminal acts was assessed by the Court under Article 8 of the Convention (§§ 134 – 139).']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

It opened branches in 47 cities and in hundreds of districts. The applicants were members of HADEP and they held executive positions within the party."", '5. On 29 January 1999 the chief prosecutor at the Court of Cassation brought proceedings before the Constitutional Court and demanded that HADEP be dissolved. The prosecutor argued that HADEP had become a “centre of illegal activities against the integrity of Turkey”. In support of his allegations he referred to a number of pending criminal proceedings against HADEP members, including the applicants.', '6. In its decision of 13 March 2003, which was published in the Official Gazette on 19 July 2003 and thus became final, the Constitutional Court dissolved HADEP. The Constitutional Court based its decision on sections 68 and 69 of the Constitution and sections 101 and 103 of Law no. 2820 on Political Parties. In arriving at its conclusion, the Constitutional Court took account of the actions and statements of certain leaders and members of HADEP, including the applicants. As an ancillary measure under section 69 § 9 of the Constitution and section 95 of Law no. 2820, the Constitutional Court banned the applicants and 18 other HADEP members and leaders from becoming founder members, ordinary members, leaders or auditors of any other political party for a period of five years.', '7. Details of the criminal proceedings which had been brought against the applicants and which were referred to by the Constitutional Court in its decision are detailed below. In the opinion of the Constitutional Court, the actions of the applicants which are set out below, as well as the actions of the remaining 18 HADEP members and leaders, proved that a link existed between the applicants, HADEP and the PKK.', ""8. These applicants were executive members of HADEP's Malatya branch. In 1998 criminal proceedings were brought against them for lending assistance to an illegal organisation, namely the PKK, contrary to Article 169 of the Criminal Code then in force. The allegations against them included allowing hunger strikers to use HADEP premises in their protest against the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan in Italy. Banners had also been displayed on HADEP's premises expressing discomfort with the arrest, as well as denigrating the Turkish state and actions of the Turkish security forces. People present on the premises had also been allowed to watch PKK propaganda broadcasts on Med TV. Various pro-PKK newspapers and journals, as well as photographs of various PKK members who had been killed in operations, were also recovered from the premises."", ""9.

His conviction was upheld by the Court of Cassation on 4 December 2000 but the execution of the sentence was suspended following the entry into force of Law no. 4616.', ""22. Mr Atalay was the secretary of the Seyhan branch of HADEP. On 16 December 1998 the Adana State Security Court convicted him of incitement to hatred and hostility, contrary to Article 312 of the Criminal Code in force at the time. He was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment. His conviction was based on a speech which he had made during a party congress.

Mr Özata was the deputy leader of HADEP. On 17 September 1998 he was found guilty by the Ankara State Security Court of spreading separatist propaganda, contrary to Article 312 of the Criminal Code then in force.

He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment and his conviction was subsequently upheld by the Court of Cassation.

The Kurds like the colour green; because it is the colour of getting ready for liberation. The Kurds like the colour yellow; because it is the colour of getting ready for everything”.', ""25. Criminal proceedings were brought against him for spreading separatist propaganda in breach of section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

001-23700,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,MEHO and OTHERS v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,,"['The applicants, Mr Gazmen Meho and Ms Stasa Limani, are apparently nationals of Serbia and Montenegro (formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), who were born in 1962 and 1960 respectively, and live in the Netherlands. They are represented before the Court by Mr M.P.H. van Wezel, a lawyer practising in Utrecht (Netherlands).', 'The facts of the case, as apparent from public information and the documents submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The applicants are Kosovar Albanians. They have been living in the Netherlands apparently since October 1993. They applied for asylum in November 1994; ultimately, the dismissal in February 1998 of their appeal made the rejection of their asylum requests final.', 'The first applicant has been suffering increasingly from psychotic decompensation ever since 1996.', 'On 21 January 1997 the first applicant was found guilty by the Breda Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of rape and abduction and sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment, six months of which were suspended. The Regional Court’s reasoning included the following:', '“On 23 June 1996 the accused, together with D., deprived a woman called M. of her freedom and raped her. The victim was blindfolded, tied up, kicked, beaten and a burning cigarette was held to her back. In addition to this violence, she was threatened by being told that she would be murdered and by saying, close to the victim: ‘What do you think Mohammed, should we let her live for the children or shall we murder her’. Eventually the two accused left the victim tied and blindfolded on a lavatory. The Regional Court is of the opinion that a rape such as this may be counted as one of the most serious crimes known to us. After all, not only did this rape constitute a serious interference with the victim’s integrity, but in addition she was threatened in such a way that it is readily imaginable that she must have feared for her life during and after the rape.', 'In setting the sentence the Regional Court takes into account the fact that it appears from, in particular, the statement of the victim M. that the accused has had a minor part in the crime, compared to that of the co-accused D. It was in fact D. who committed the major part of the violence against the victim and who threatened the victim with death in various ways.', 'In setting the sentence, the Regional Court also takes into account the psychiatric report of Dr A.D. Haverkamp dated 6 January 1997, in which Dr Haverkamp reaches the conclusion that the accused, at the moment when the facts charged were committed, was suffering from retarded mental development in the form of illiteracy and mental disturbances in the form of character-neurotic disturbances, depression and periodic alcohol abuse, with its inhibition-reducing effect on the accused’s behaviour in the criminal situation, and that the accused’s accountability for the crimes is thereby diminished. The Regional Court accepts this conclusion as established fact.”', 'It seems that this judgment was never appealed against and that the first applicant served a term of imprisonment.', 'In March 1998 the first and second applicants lodged requests for residence permits for themselves and their underage children, citing “humanitarian reasons or, in the alternative, medical treatment”.', 'On 9 March 2000 the competent domestic authority, the Deputy Minister of Justice, rejected the first applicant’s request. A residence permit on humanitarian grounds was refused in view of the above conviction. A residence permit for the purpose of medical treatment was refused for the following reasons:', '“Aliens wishing to undergo medical treatment in the Netherlands may be granted admission for that purpose subject to certain conditions. Pursuant to the policy conducted in this respect, temporary residence for the purpose of medical treatment is normally granted only if the Netherlands are the most appropriate country (het meest aangewezen land) in which to undergo that medical treatment.', 'The fact of the Netherlands being the most appropriate country may follow from the nature of the condition, a particular specialist treatment [available] in this country, or other factors by reason of which treatment elsewhere of the person concerned is less appropriate.', 'For this reason the medical advisor of the Medical Advisory Office (Bureau Medische Advisering) of the Ministry of Justice has been asked for advice.', 'It appears from the report of the medical advisor, given in this case on 7 February 2000 by the medical advisor of the Medical Advisory Office, the content of which is to be deemed repeated and included here, that the person concerned [i.e. the applicant] is suffering from a psychotic disturbance. The person concerned has been undergoing treatment since December 1997 by a social-psychiatric nurse under the supervision of a psychiatrist. Treatment consists of talk therapy and periodic medication administered by injection and is lasting in nature. It is apparent, however, that such treatment is possible also in Kosovo. Various hospitals have psychiatrists who can treat the complaints both on an inpatient basis and on an outpatient basis. These possibilities are being extended further with international aid. Although the medicine Cisordinol is not available in Kosovo, alternative antipsychotic medication is.', 'If the current course of treatment is stopped, this will cause an acute medical emergency but, in view of the possibilities of treatment in the country of origin, this treatment need not be discontinued upon return. That being so the Netherlands are not considered to be the most appropriate country for undergoing this medical treatment.”', 'In a simultaneous but separate decision, the Deputy Minister declared the first applicant an undesirable alien in view of his conviction, and decided that any objections that might be lodged against his decisions would not suspend the applicants’ deportation.', 'The applicants objected. At the same time, they lodged an application to the President of the Regional Court of The Hague for a stay of their deportation pending a decision on their objection. They relied on the length of time they had already been living in the Netherlands. They also alleged that they were integrated into Netherlands society: in particular, two of their children had been born in that country and spoke no other language than Dutch. Finally, they also drew attention to the first applicant’s mental health. The first applicant was at that time being treated as an inpatient for psychiatric problems; the treatment he required was unavailable in Kosovo. He submitted a written statement by the psychiatrist who was treating him, to the effect that stress and radical change in his situation such as would result from his removal to Kosovo would jeopardise the progress thus far made. Reliance was also placed on a report published by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), dated October 2000, according to which “severe and chronic mental illness and psycho-social disorders” could not be satisfactorily treated in Kosovo.', 'Following a hearing on 6 April 2001, the President of the Regional Court gave his decision in the case on 20 April (transmitted to the applicants on 14 August 2001). Refusing to order a stay of deportation, he decided at the same time to dismiss the objections. As to the length of time already spent in the Netherlands, it was found that this had been caused by the legal remedies pursued by the applicants, so that they could not derive any rights from this period. In addition, there were contra-indications in respect of the first and second applicants.', 'His reasoning concerning the first applicant’s request for residence rights on medical grounds included the following:', '“As regards the residence permit for medical treatment of the [first applicant], the President is of the opinion that the defendant [i.e. the Deputy Minister] has undertaken sufficient investigations before arriving at a decision. In so doing the defendant’s medical advisor has obtained information from the sector administering treatment (behandelend sector). The conclusion of the medical advisor on the basis of this investigation is that treatment of the [first applicant’s] psychiatric complaints consists of talk therapy and medication administered by periodic injection. In addition, it has appeared that this treatment is permanent in nature. Finally, the medical advisor expresses the view that treatment for the [first applicant] is available in Kosovo, as is alternative medication.', 'The President is of the opinion that, although medical treatment of the [first applicant] will be difficult in the country of origin, it is not impossible. The permanently psychiatric condition of the [first applicant] might well deteriorate even in the Netherlands. It cannot be decisive, in considering the [first applicant’s] request, that the [first applicant] would be worse off in his country of origin than in the Netherlands.”', 'For the remainder, it was found that the first applicant had been declared an undesirable alien; the objection lodged against this declaration had been out of time, and the declaration had therefore become unappealable. That being so, the first applicant was not entitled to rely on compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature.', 'On 6 August 2003 the applicants’ representative informed the Court that the first applicant was being treated as an inpatient in a psychiatric hospital in Wolfheze, Netherlands.', 'In late 1999 or early 2000 a multidisciplinary task force was set up, with the support of the World Health Organisation, to prepare a strategic plan for improving the mental health care situation in Kosovo which was reported to be dire. In December 2000 this task force published a report containing proposals for significant improvements. Among these were the downsizing of an existing psychiatric institution in Shtimle/Štimlje, replacing much of its capacity with community-based care and improving the remaining part of the institution, and increasing the number of psychiatrists and support staff. These goals were to be achieved by 2004. The plan was submitted to UNMIK for approval by January 2001.', 'A report published in August 2002 by the non-governmental organisation Mental Disability Rights International (MDRI) entitled Not on the Agenda: Human Rights of People with Mental Disabilities in Kosovo, mentioned that the Shtimle/Štimlje institution was to be refurbished. It was, however, highly critical of conditions there and in other closed institutions, including the mental ward of Prishtinë/Priština University Hospital, and denounced insufficient staffing and violence among the patients.', 'In December 2002 UNMIK reported that the detention centre in Lipjan/Lipljan had started to provide proper care for mentally handicapped prisoners.', 'In 2003 MDRI reported in several press releases critical of current developments that the refurbishment and extension of the Shtimle/Štimlje institution, undertaken at the expense of decentralised community-based services, had been nearly completed, and that a group of mental patients would be transferred to an institution in Serbia itself.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1931 and lives in Ankara.', '6. In 2000 the Ministry of Culture published a book entitled “The Gypsies of Turkey”, written by Associate Professor Ali Rafet Özkan.', '7. On 15 June 2001 the applicant filed a petition with the Ministry of Culture on behalf of the Turkish Gypsy associations. In his petition, he stated that in twenty-four pages of the book, the author had stated that Gypsies were engaged in illegitimate activities, lived as “thieves, pickpockets, swindlers, robbers, usurers, beggars, drug dealers, prostitutes and brothel keepers” and were polygamist and aggressive. Furthermore, Gypsy women were presented as being unfaithful to their husbands. The applicant also submitted that the book contained several other expressions that humiliated and debased Gypsies. Claiming that the expressions constituted criminal offences, he requested that the sale of the book be stopped and all copies seized.', '8. On the same day, the head of the publication unit at the Ministry of Culture ordered that all copies of the book be returned to the publication unit as there were corrections to be made.', '9. On 11 October 2001 the applicant wrote a letter to the Ministry of Culture enquiring whether the copies of the book had been seized.', '10. On 17 October 2001 the head of the publication unit at the Ministry of Culture informed the applicant that the publications advisory board of the Ministry, composed of seven professors, had decided that the book was scientific research and that the expressions in the book did not contain any insults or similar expressions. The applicant was also informed that the author of the book would not permit any amendments to the text and that, in accordance with the author’s request, the Ministry had transferred the copyright of the book to him.', '11. On 4 February 2002 the applicant sent letters to the Ministry of Culture and to Associate Professor Ali Rafet Özkan and repeated his initial request. He received no reply.', '12. Subsequently, on 30 April 2002, the applicant brought proceedings before the Ankara Civil Court of General Jurisdiction against the Ministry of Culture and the author of the book, and requested compensation for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered on account of the expressions contained in the book. He alleged that the expressions constituted an attack on his identity as a Gypsy and were insulting. The applicant also asked for the copies of the book to be confiscated and for its publication and distribution to be banned.', '13. The author of the book submitted, in reply, that he had used the records of the Adana police headquarters and books written by other authors on Gypsies when writing the book and that he had not had any intention to insult or humiliate Gypsies. The author further stated that the passages referred to by the applicant should not be considered in isolation, but in the context of the whole book.', '14. On 24 September 2002 the Ankara Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s requests in so far as they concerned the author of the book. It considered that the book was the result of academic research, was based on scientific data and examined the social structures of Gypsies in Turkey. The first-instance court therefore held that the expressions in question did not insult the applicant. As to the applicant’s case against the Ministry, the firstinstance court decided that it lacked jurisdiction as the administrative courts had jurisdiction over the applicant’s claim.', '15. On 25 October 2002 the applicant appealed. In his petition, he submitted that the book could not be considered as scientific research and that therefore the Ministry of Culture should not have published it.', '16. On 21 April 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. In its decision it noted that the expressions in question were of a general nature. It therefore found no grounds for concluding that they concerned all Gypsies or that they constituted an attack on the applicant’s identity.', '17. On 8 December 2003 a request by the applicant for rectification of the decision was dismissed.', '18. Subsequently, on an unspecified date, the applicant initiated proceedings against the Ministry of Culture before the Ankara Administrative Court. He requested non-pecuniary compensation, alleging that the content of the book published by the Ministry of Culture had been offensive and insulting towards the Gypsy community. On 7 April 2004 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case. It held that before its publication, the book in question had been examined by a Rapporteur appointed by the publications advisory board. Following his approval, the advisory board had agreed to publish the book. In the wake of the applicant’s allegations the advisory board, composed of seven professors, had examined the book again on 25 September 2001 and had decided that it was an academic study based on scientific research and that no inconvenience would be caused by continuing its distribution and sale. The Administrative Court therefore concluded that the applicant’s allegations were unsubstantiated. It is not clear from the documents in the case file whether or not the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision.', '19. The last paragraphs of the conclusion to “The Gypsies of Turkey” read as follows:', '“The most important links connecting the Gypsies to each other are their familial and social structures as well as their traditions. Despite the fact that they have been leading a nomadic life for more than a thousand years, they have managed to protect their traditional way of living thanks to their endogamous character. Their attachment to these traditions begins at birth and continues till death. Doubtless, tradition is the most significant factor in the way of life of the Gypsies. The elderly members of the Gypsy society bear the heaviest responsibility in protecting and sustaining the traditions. However, due to ever-changing circumstances and needs, the social structure of the Gypsies has become difficult to preserve. In particular “Natia”, one of these social structures, can no longer be sustained in today’s Turkey.', 'The liveliest characteristic of Gypsies is their way of living. Hence, all branches of socio-cultural activity, consisting of migration and settlement, dance, music, language, eating and drinking, fortune telling, sorcery and professions, constitute the true nature of Gypsy life. That is to say, these elements form the visible part of the iceberg. Other persons usually recognise Gypsies through these phenomena. Nevertheless, the way to truly know Gypsies is to mingle with their society and to fully analyse their traditions and beliefs. The secret world of the Gypsies reveals itself through their beliefs, in particular through their superstitions and taboos.', 'Gypsies, like everyone, feel the need to have faith and to worship. In addition to adopting the religion of the country they live in, they also perpetuate the traditional beliefs specific to their culture. Consequently, it is observed that Gypsies have genuine feasts and celebrations stemming from their beliefs which can be partly traced to Hinduism.', 'In our opinion, these people, who suffer from humiliation and rejection everywhere, could be transformed into citizens who are an asset to our State and our nation once their educational, social, cultural and medical problems are solved. The only thing that needs to be done is to focus on this issue with patience and determination.”', '20. In December 1998 the Language Association, a non-governmental organisation, published a dictionary entitled “Turkish Dictionary for Pupils”. The publication of the dictionary was financed by the Ministry of Culture.', '21. On 30 April 2002 the applicant sent a letter to the Executive Board of the Language Association on behalf of the Confederation of Gypsy Cultural Associations. In his letter, the applicant submitted that certain entries in the dictionary were insulting to and discriminatory against Gypsies. In this connection, he referred to the descriptions and idioms below:', '“Gypsy” (çingene): (metaphorically) stingy.', '“Gypsyness” (çingenelik) (metaphorically): stinginess, greediness.', '“Becoming a Gypsy” (Çingeneleşmek): “displaying stingy behaviour”.', '“Gypsy’s debt” (Çingene borcu): an unimportant debt.', '“Gypsy plays Kurd dances” (Çingene çalar Kürt oynar): a place where there is a lot of commotion and noise.', '“Gypsy tent” (Çingene çergesi) (metaphorically): a dirty and poor place.', '“Gypsy wedding” (Çingene düğünü): a crowded and noisy meeting.', '“Gypsy fight” (Çingene kavgası): verbal fight in which vulgar language is used.', '“Gypsy money” (Çingene parası): coins.', '“Gypsy pink” (Çingene pembesi): pink.', '22. In the applicant’s opinion, these descriptions had negative, discriminatory and prejudiced meanings. The applicant further submitted that the Ministry of Education and the Turkish Language Society had amended their dictionaries at his request and asked the Language Association to correct the definitions of the aforementioned words and to remove the discriminatory expressions from the dictionary. He received no reply to his letter.', '23. Subsequently, on 15 July 2002, the applicant sent a further letter to the Language Association, repeating his request. He added that he would bring a case against the Association if his request was not granted by 20 August 2002.', '24. On 16 April 2003 the applicant brought proceedings in the Ankara Civil Court of General Jurisdiction against the Language Association, requesting that the aforementioned definitions and expressions be removed from the dictionary. The applicant also requested compensation for the nonpecuniary damage he had suffered on account of the expressions contained in the dictionary. He alleged in that connection that the dictionary definitions constituted an attack on his identity as a Gypsy and an insult to his personality.', '25. On 26 May 2003 the representative of the Language Association made submissions to the firstinstance court. He maintained, inter alia, that the definitions and expressions contained in the dictionary were based on historical and sociological reality and that there had been no intention to humiliate or debase an ethnic group. He further submitted that the dictionary contained expressions and definitions that were commonly used in society and that there were other similar expressions in Turkish which concerned Albanians, Jews and Turks.', '26. On 16 July 2003 the Ankara Civil Court dismissed the applicant’s case. It held that the definitions and expressions in the dictionary were based on historical and sociological reality and that there had been no intention to humiliate or debase an ethnic group. It further noted that there were other similar expressions in Turkish concerning other ethnic groups, which existed in dictionaries and encyclopaedias.', '27. The applicant appealed.

In about mid-1998 the hospital ceased paying the applicant, with the consequence that the applicant became unable to pay his sub-contractors and thus incurred late-payment penalties, lost business and sustained damage to his goodwill. The applicant eventually became insolvent and went out of business.', '5. Meanwhile the ownership and administration of the hospital had gone through a restructuring, in the course of which, on 1 January 2002, the hospital was transferred from the State’s administration to that of a municipality by the operation of Law no. 416/2001 Coll.', '6. On 1 January 2004 the ownership of the assets of the hospital was transferred to the municipality by the operation of Law no. 522/2003 Coll. Due and unpaid debts and liabilities, however, remained with the hospital.', '7. Later in 2004 the municipality established a non-profit organisation which took ownership of the hospital’s assets.', '8. The applicant asserted his property claims originating in the contract mentioned above by means of civil actions against the hospital and the municipality. This gave rise to a number of civil proceedings, some twenty of which are still pending before the Kežmarok District Court (Okresný súd).', '9. The applicant was successful in obtaining a number of judicial orders for payment in his favour, including a payment order (platobný rozkaz) issued by the District Court on 4 February 2002 against the hospital for the payment of the equivalent of some 25,000 euros (EUR).', '10. On the basis of the judicial orders for payment in favour of the applicant, between 2003 and 2009 the applicant initiated fourteen sets of enforcement proceedings under the Executions Order of 1995 (Law no. 233/1995, as amended). Three of these enforcement actions were terminated upon the applicant’s request. Nine sets of proceedings resulted in a successful recovery of the adjudicated claims. One action is still pending because the underlying civil proceedings are still pending.', '11. On 12 September 2007 the District Court declared the enforcement of the above-mentioned payment order of 4 February 2002 against the hospital improper (neprípustná) and terminated the proceedings. It observed that the applicant had petitioned for the enforcement on 6 March 2003, that pursuant to Law no. 416/2001 Coll. the hospital had been transferred from the State’s administration to that of a municipality, that by virtue of section 4a(2)(a) of the Municipal Property Act (Law no. 138/1991 Coll., as amended by Law no. 447/2001 Coll.) the hospital’s liabilities had not been transferred to the municipality and that, on 31 January 2005, the hospital had been wound up. In relation to the claim in question, the hospital had been wound up without a legal successor. No enforcement could accordingly have been directed against it.', '12. The above decision could have been challenged by way of an appeal but no appeal was filed by the applicant. It thus became final and binding on 5 October 2007.', '13. The applicant requested that the Prosecutor General challenge the legislation concerning the transfer to municipalities of assets without a corresponding transfer of liabilities in the Constitutional Court.', '14. By letter of 14 December 2007 the Prosecutor General informed the applicant that liabilities which had not been transferred to the municipalities had not been left unassigned but, by operation of section 55d(6) of the Budgetary Rules Act (Law no. 303/1995 Coll., as amended), remained with the government department originally responsible for overseeing the now restructured entity. In the case of the applicant’s contractual partner, the hospital, such unsettled liabilities remained with the Ministry of Health (“the Ministry”).', '15. Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended) provides:', '“1. The Constitutional Court shall decide complaints by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms ... unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court.', '2. If the Constitutional Court finds a complaint justified, it shall deliver a decision stating that a person’s rights or freedoms as set out in paragraph 1 have been violated by a final decision, specific measure or other act and shall quash such decision, measure or act. If the violation that has been found is the result of a failure to act, the Constitutional Court may order [the authority] which has violated the rights or freedoms to take the necessary action. At the same time it may remit the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order such authority to refrain from violating the fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order those who have violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 to restore the situation to that existing prior to the violation.', '3. In its decision on a complaint the Constitutional Court may grant appropriate financial compensation to the person whose rights under paragraph 1 have been violated.”', '16. The statutory bar to the enforcement of financial claims against healthcare establishments was laid down in different pieces of legislation and its duration, always intended to be temporary, was extended several times. The precise scope of the bar has also varied over time.', '17. The bar has its origin in Article 235 of the Enforcement Code of 1995 (Law no. 233/1995 Coll., as amended), such Article being incorporated into the code by Law no. 280/1999 Coll. The bar was, in this implementation, intended to last until 31 December 2001.', '18. Article 235 of the amended Enforcement Code of 1995 was repealed by the Constitutional Court by virtue of its judgment of 15 November 2000 (published in the Collection of Laws under no. 415/2000) with effect from 6 December 2000. The Constitutional Court found the bar unconstitutional because it created an unjustified difference between the treatment of healthcare establishments and other debtors.', '19. With effect from 1 January 2003, a new statutory bar to enforcement of financial claims against health-care establishments was introduced into the Health Insurance Code by the operation of Law no. 671/2002 Coll. In particular, enforcement was not permissible against the financial assets and income of health-care establishments in so far as such monies were allocated for providing and maintaining health care and related services, nor against assets belonging to health-care establishments which were purchased out of funds deriving from the insurance premiums paid by the establishment’s users and which were indispensable for the running and maintenance of the establishment.', '20. On 15 June 2004 a new bar entered into force by virtue of an amendment (Law no. 345/2004 Coll.) to the Health Insurance Code. It introduced a new section 54a to the code, stated to apply until 31 December 2004. Under sub-section 2 (d) of that provision, enforcement could not be aimed at attaching the property of health-care establishments obtained via insurance premiums or property to be used for providing health care.', '21. In 2006 a new constitutional challenge to the bar, as it then stood, was brought by a group of Members of Parliament. It was accepted by the Constitutional Court to the extent that, in its ruling of 6 December 2006 (published in the Collection of Laws under no. 18/2007), it suspended the legal effect of the bar. However, the Constitutional Court has never ruled on the merits of the bar, as it expired while the constitutional challenge was pending. In its decision of 30 April 2008 the Constitutional Court nevertheless made a formal note of its 2000 ruling, considering it a part of its case-law.', '22. The bar was most recently extended until 31 December 2009 by the operation of Law no. 192/2009 Coll., which introduced a new section 102c § 2 to the Health Care Providers Act (Law no. 578/2004 Coll., as amended).', '23. On 31 December 2009 the bar expired and has ceased to exist with effect from 1 January 2010 onwards.', '24. The Municipal Property Act (Law no. 138/1991 Coll.) has been amended numerous times. Amending Law no. 447/2001 Coll. entered into force on 1 January 2002 and introduced new sections 4a(2)(a) and 4b(2)(a), pursuant to which a municipality does not take over liabilities for the supply of goods, works and other contractual performance which have been assumed by the administrator of State property in connection with different types of property transferred to the ownership of the municipality and which liabilities are due or were not settled on the day of the transfer of the property from the State to the municipality.', '25. Under section 55d(6) of the Budgetary Rules Act (Law no. 303/1995 Coll., as in force since 1 January 2005), liabilities of the State which have not been transferred to a municipality or a self-governing region together with a transfer of functions of attributable to a government department and the right of ownership of related assets remain liabilities of the government department or the body that exercised the functions of the government department.', '26. Section 55g(6) provides that liabilities of the State which are not transferred to a municipality or a self-governing region together with a transfer of functions attributable to a government department on 1 January 2004 remain liabilities of the central government body responsible for the area in which the functions are transferred to the municipality or the selfgoverning region.', '27. Article 37 of the Enforcement Code provides for the possibility of carrying out enforcement proceedings against a different person than the debtor identified in the enforceable decision. Such enforcement is possible if it is established that the adjudicated liability has been transferred to such a different person. It is the responsibility of the parties to the enforcement proceedings to notify the enforcement officer of any such transfer.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-5138,ENG,NOR,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,ÖZTURK AND OTHERS v. NORWAY,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicants are Mr Saban Özturk and his wife Nadir Özturk, respectively Turkish and Norwegian/Turkish nationals born in 1964 and 1958, and also their four children (born in the years indicated in brackets), all of whom are Norwegian nationals: Ismail (1982), Handan (1987), Alev (1987) and Kemal (1995). The first applicant lives in Turkey and the other applicants live in Oslo, Norway. They are represented before the Court by Mr Kaj R. Bjørnstad, a lawyer practising in Oslo.', 'The facts of the case, as described mainly in the judgments of the national courts, may be summarised as follows.', 'Mr Saban Özturk, the first applicant, is of ethnic Kurdish origin. During his 5 years of primary education in Turkey he was taught in Turkish. In 1972 his father travelled to Norway and in 1976 the first applicant joined him there, at the age of 12. Three years later also his mother, sister and 2 brothers followed. They were all granted a residence permit.', 'Following an introductory Norwegian course for foreigners in 1977, the first applicant joined a Norwegian secondary school, where he completed his studies after 3 years. He then worked for 4 years as an assistant in a car shop, 1 year at a concrete factory and thereafter for 4½ years as an assistant warehouse manager in a furniture shop, until he was arrested in May 1989.', 'In 1981 the first applicant married the second applicant, Mrs Nadir Özturk. She arrived in Norway, 23 years old, in 1982. She obtained Norwegian citizenship in 1991 but kept her Turkish citizenship. While her parents remained in Turkey, 2 of her 7 brothers and sisters are living in Norway. One of them, a brother, is married to one of the first applicant’s sisters in Norway. The second applicant has worked as a cleaning assistant at a school for 11 years. She has no education beyond the 5 years’ primary schooling in Turkey and a short course in Norwegian following her arrival in Norway.', 'On 12 January 1990, the Eidsivating High Court (lagmannsrett) convicted the first applicant under Article 162 (3), cf. (1) and (5) of the Penal Code for complicity in the importation of approximately 1 kilo of heroin from Turkey and for having acquired approximately 850 grams of the drug in May 1989. It sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment. Two other persons were convicted in relation to these offences, one of whom was the first applicant’s brother, Celal. In its judgment the High Court stated that the evidence did not clarify the whole context of the case, which was only the tip of an iceberg. The first applicant and his brother were not deemed to be the principal perpetrators, but they had received the drugs in Norway and found a place to keep them, following the directions of someone else. The first applicant was considered to have had a more important role than his brother in the operation. Unlike the brother, the first applicant had not previously been convicted. The third person convicted, also a Turkish national, had travelled regularly between Turkey and Norway and was found to have been put under considerable pressure, in particular from Turkey, but also from Saban and Celal Özturk in order to act as a courier in the transport of the drugs in question. Because of the pressure he had been put under, he had reported the matter to the police in Norway and had sought police protection. The police had not been able to help him but had advised him not to act as a courier. Despite this he had carried out the operation and had later informed the police of the quantity he had imported and where parts of the drugs could be found.', 'While serving his prison sentence, the first applicant took a 1-year course in engineering and mechanics and a ½-year course in building. After being released in March 1996, he gained employment as a manager in the welding department of a company.', ""On 16 November 1990 the Oslo Police, referring to the criminal conviction, decided to order the first applicant’s expulsion. The decision was subsequently replaced by a decision dated 2 April 1992 of the Aliens Directorate (Utlendingsdirektoratet), in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Aliens Acts 1988 (Utlendingsloven, Act of 24 June 1988 No. 64). On appeal, the Ministry of Justice upheld the latter decision on 23 September 1992. The Ministry observed that, considering the case as a whole and having regard to the serious nature of the offence, the expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure vis-à-vis the members of the first applicant's close family. The family could, if it so wished, reunite in Turkey."", 'Subsequently the first applicant challenged the expulsion order before the Oslo City Court (byrett). He submitted, inter alia, that he felt like a Norwegian, that at present he had no links to Turkey, which was only a holiday destination for him and his family, who wished to remain in Norway. By judgment of 30 September 1993, the City Court upheld the decision by the Ministry of Justice. On appeal, this judgment was subsequently upheld by the High Court, in a judgment of 17 February 1995.', 'By judgment of 29 April 1996, the Supreme Court (Høyesterett) upheld the High Court’s judgment and rejected the first applicant’s appeal. In his opinion on behalf of a unanimous court, Mr Justice Bugge stated:', '""[I]n cases of serious narcotics offences, the expulsion of foreigners must fall within the Contracting States\' margin of appreciation, even though the expulsion, because of the expelled person\'s links to the host country, will have a serious impact on him and his family.', ""There is no reason to doubt that the expulsion would constitute a heavy burden for [the first applicant] and his family. He, his wife and the children have resided in Norway for a long period, the children since their birth. However, … the family does not have its vital interests solely linked to Norway and should not be considered alien to Turkish society. This is the case of [the first applicant] and his wife and also to a certain degree the children, who must be presumed to be or have become familiar with the Turkish language and way of life, even if they live in Norway. There is no question here of such qualified attachment to the country of residence for the expelled person and his family and such a lack of ties to the country of origin as are described in the Strasbourg Court's judgments in the cases of Moustaquim and Beljoudi."", 'It is not possible for the Supreme Court to have any firm opinion about whether the first applicant’s close family would elect to continue living in Norway. But even though expulsion would entail that Mr Özturk be separated from his family, it does not follow that the expulsion would transgress the limits of Article 8 § 2, when he has been found guilty of such a serious offence, with such damaging consequences to society, as in the present case.', ""The State does not dispute that Mr Özturk could be exposed to prosecution in Turkey, where an indictment has been issued against him with respect to the exportation from Turkey of the heroin in question in May 1989 ... From the point of view of criminal law, it concerns a different offence than that for which he was convicted in Norway. According to information obtained by the Attorney General via the Norwegian Embassy in Ankara about Turkish penal practice in this area, the exportation of narcotic substances may be penalised with 6 to12 years' imprisonment and a fine, assessed in the light of the quantity in question. In the event of heroin and certain other substances, the punishment may be doubled; it may also be increased by 50% if the trial court finds that the trafficking is a part of organised crime. Punishment will normally be imposed even though the accused has been convicted and has served a sentence for the offence in another country, but will be deducted from that served in accordance with a judgment of the Turkish court... . In practice, prisoners are released after having served 40% when a sentence has also been served in another country. Therefore, according to what has been stated to the Embassy, it is rare that, after deduction has been made of the sentence served in the other country, there will be anything left to serve in Turkey. Moreover, it has been stated that the principle ne bis in idem, namely that punishment shall not be imposed twice for the same offence, is respected by Turkish trial courts."", 'Against this background I find it clear that the possibility of Mr Özturk being prosecuted in Turkey could not lead to the finding of a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.""', 'From 14 to 15 May 1996 the first applicant was committed for examination to the psychiatric ward of Aker Hospital, Oslo. According to a psychiatric report dated 22 May, the applicant was above all disappointed and bitter about the authorities. He had stated that he might as well die as go to a Turkish prison, but that he would not commit suicide until the day of his deportation, possibly after his arrival in Turkey. He was assessed as not being psychotic but moderately depressed. There was no psychiatric ground for his being committed to a psychiatric hospital.', ""In June 1996 the first applicant's expulsion was put into effect."", 'His brother, Celal, had been expelled in 1995, whereas his other brother had died. His sister continued to live in Norway and obtained Norwegian citizenship. Their parents returned to Turkey in 1993 for health reasons and, because of their long absence from Norway, forfeited their residence permit.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The Constitutional Court observed that it had jurisdiction ratione temporis to consider only the period after 15 February 1993 when it had been established. However it took into account the state of the proceedings at that time. The case was neither legally nor factually complex. The applicant's conduct did not contribute substantially to the length of the proceedings. The District Court failed to deal with the case with the requisite efficiency having regard to, in particular, the fact that the applicant was divorced, had the sole custody over two minor children and was principally claiming ownership of the house where she had once lived with her family. Upon service of the Constitutional Court's finding (nález) on the applicant and the District Court, it became final and binding on 8 June 2000."", ""On 10 October 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint (sťažnosť) with the Constitutional Court pursuant to Article 127 of the Constitution as in force since 1 January 2002.

On 23 October 2002 her complaint was declared admissible."", ""On 11 December 2002 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the applicant's constitutional right. This finding formally concerned only the period after 8 June 2000 when its first finding of 1 June 2000 had become final and binding. The Constitutional Court observed that in the period between 8 June 2000 and 15 October 2002 (2 years, 4 months and 7 days) the District Court had been completely inactive. It also took notice of the fact that the total length of the proceedings was more than 12 years and that there had already been one finding of a violation of the applicant's right to a hearing without unjustified delay in the case. The Constitutional Court found no reasons to justify the length of the proceedings by the complexity of the case or by the applicant's conduct.

It found that this home was a flat acquired jointly by the former spouses during their marriage, situated in the “Strelbishte” neighbourhood of Sofia, and intended by them to fulfil the family’s housing needs (the applicant had moved into that flat in 1997 although it had not been fully finished). The fact that the applicant’s former husband had never lived there was of no relevance, as this had been the result of his disregarding his duty to cohabit with his spouse.

It agreed with the Sofia District Court that the former matrimonial home was the flat in “Strelbishte”, as it had been acquired, by means of a preliminary contract with the builder, during the marriage, for the family’s housing needs, as at that time the spouses had not owned another home, and as the applicant and her child had been living there at the time when the marriage was dissolved. The flat in “Borovo” was not the former matrimonial home, because it was co-owned by the applicant’s former husband and third parties and both spouses had left it in 1995.', '9. The applicant’s former husband appealed on points of law.', '10. In a judgment of 29 March 2001 the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the lower court’s judgment and remitted the case. It held that the former matrimonial home was the flat in “Borovo”, not the one newly built in “Strelbishte”. According to its settled caselaw, the former matrimonial home was the one which had been used before the dissolution of the marriage and, in case of a de facto separation preceding the dissolution, the one used before the separation.', '11. On remittal, the Sofia City Court, in a judgment of 20 March 2002, again upheld the order of the Sofia District Court. It relied on interpretative decision no. 12/1971 of the Plenary Meeting of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 18 below), according to whose point 2 (b), in the event of a de facto separation, the former matrimonial home is the one acquired during the separation with funds accumulated during the marriage. On this basis, it found that the former matrimonial home was the flat in “Strelbishte”. Given the unambiguous rule set out in the interpretative decision, the fact that the spouses had not lived in that flat together was immaterial.', '12. The applicant’s former husband appealed on points of law.', '13. The Supreme Court of Cassation held a hearing on 9 October 2002. The applicant was represented by counsel, who asked the court to dismiss the appeal and said that he had developed his arguments in a memorial which he filed during the hearing.', '14. In the memorial, which ran to four pages, the applicant’s counsel argued that the Sofia City Court had not erred by taking into account interpretative decision no. 12/1971 instead of the guidelines of the Supreme Court of Cassation given in the judgment of 29 March 2001, since where there was conflict between the instructions given in a specific case and the solution envisaged by a binding interpretative decision the latter prevailed. He further presented a number of arguments why the flat in “Strelbishte” was the former matrimonial home and why its use should be given to the applicant. He asserted that this flat had been acquired by the spouses with a view to fulfilling the family’s housing needs, that the applicant had contributed financially to its acquisition and that the only reason why she did not have title to it was her former husband’s protracting the conclusion of the final contract for its acquisition from the builder. The applicant had brought a separate suit, seeking a court order declaring the preliminary contract with the builder final. However, that suit was still pending. The spouses had lived in the flat since 1997, but even assuming that the applicant’s former husband had not done so throughout the entire period, this had been due to his dereliction of the duty to cohabit with his wife. The applicant and her child could not live in the flat in “Borovo”, because this was not the former matrimonial home, and this would mean cohabiting with their former inlaws, with whom they did not have good relations.', '15. On 21 November 2002 the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the Sofia City Court’s judgment. In the beginning of its twoandahalf page opinion it observed that the applicant had not made submissions in the proceedings before it. It found no indication that the spouses had obtained title and thus acquired the flat in “Strelbishte” during the marriage; there was merely a preliminary contract in respect of it. The date of delivery of the flat was irrelevant. Therefore, point 2 (b) of interpretative decision no. 12/1971 (see paragraph 18 below) was not applicable. However, even if the spouses had acquired the flat during the marriage, it would not have become the matrimonial home, because it had not been acquired in order to fulfil the family’s housing needs. Where a home had not been acquired for such purpose, point 2 (b) was inapposite on account of the repeal in 1991 of a communist-era statute restricting the number of properties which an individual was allowed to own. Thereafter, the contribution of funds by both spouses could be of importance solely for the existence or otherwise of a joint title to a home acquired during the marriage, not for its designation as the matrimonial home. The former matrimonial home was the flat in “Borovo”, as the spouses had lived there before their de facto separation in 1995. Since the couple’s child was already an adult and since the applicant shared some of the responsibility for the breakdown of the marriage, the use of the former matrimonial home was to be given to her former husband.', '16. On 29 November 2002 the applicant’s counsel asked the Supreme Court of Cassation to rectify the statement in its judgment that he had not made any submissions in the cassation proceedings. He considered that statement to be an obvious mistake, because, as noted in the minutes of the hearing, he had filed a memorial, which featured after page 10 in the case file. On 6 December 2002 the court refused, saying that only errors in the operative provisions of a judgment could be rectified.', '17. Article 107 § 1 of the 1985 Family Code provides that when a court allows a divorce petition, it must give the use of the former matrimonial home to one of the spouses if it cannot be used separately by both of them. In reaching its decision, the court must have regard to the interests of the children, the fault for the breakdown of the marriage, the health of the spouses and all other relevant circumstances.', '18. Interpretative decision no. 12/1971 of the Plenary Meeting of the Supreme Court (постановление № 12 от 28 ноември 1971 г., Пленум на ВС) was adopted on 28 November 1971 under the 1968 Family Code (which was superseded by the 1985 Family Code). It deals with all issues relating to the use of the former matrimonial home. Point 2 (b) of its operative provisions defines the former matrimonial home as the one acquired while the spouses were separated de facto, but with funds accumulated during the marriage.']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Stöger, a lawyer practising in Innsbruck. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicant is a part-time farmer and ski instructor residing in Gerlos, Tyrol. He is entitled to allow his livestock to feed on grass on a certain plot of land, namely plot no. 114/17 of the Gerlos land register which belongs to E. (grazing rights – Weiderecht). That land is building land.', 'On 16 August 2000 E. applied for a building permit for the construction of an underground car park on plot no. 114/17.', 'On 7 September 2000 the Mayor of Gerlos, as the building authority, conducted an oral hearing on the site of the project. The applicant had not been summoned to that hearing. In the course of the hearing the applicant, who had appeared nevertheless, claimed that as a holder of grazing rights on the proposed building site he had to be considered a party to the building permit proceedings and objected to the construction project.', ""By decision of 2 May 2001 the Mayor granted the building permit. He rejected the applicant's objections as inadmissible because he was not a neighbour within the meaning of section 25 of the Tyrolean Building Act (Bauordnung). He informed him that any dispute concerning the grazing rights had to be settled before the ordinary civil courts."", ""On 7 August 2001 the Gerlos Municipal Council (Gemeinderat) dismissed the applicant's appeal against that decision as inadmissible because the applicant was not a party to the building proceedings within the meaning of section 25 of the Building Act."", ""On 23 August 2001 the applicant lodged objections against the Municipal Council's decision (Vorstellung) with the regional government. The applicant submitted that the decisions, whereby he had not been accepted as a party, were wrong. He claimed that section 25 § 2 of the Building Act, which explicitly accepted persons holding a right to build (Bauberechtigte) as parties in building permit proceedings, should be interpreted as also extending the status of a party to persons who were holders of other kinds of servitudes encumbering the land of third persons."", ""On 25 February 2002 the regional government upheld the municipality's decision. It found that the wording of section 25 of the Building Act was clear and unambiguous and only conferred the status of a party on neighbours, namely persons who are the owners of land located at a specific distance from the proposed building project and persons who hold a right to build on the land at issue. As an obiter dictum, the regional government added that the legal situation of a person holding grazing rights was equally protected under civil law because, if a building permit infringed the civil rights of that person, a civil court could issue a prohibition on the carrying out of construction works."", 'On 8 April 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Administrative Court, reiterating the arguments that he had raised before the regional government. He did not lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Court.', 'On 26 June 2002 the regional government submitted its observations.', ""On 27 September 2005 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant's complaint. It found that the building authorities and the regional government had correctly found that the applicant's grazing rights did not confer on him the position of a neighbour within the meaning of section 25 of the Building Act. The building permit proceedings solely had the purpose of establishing that there were no obstacles under public law (the relevant building regulations) against a planned building project, but the building authorities had no competence to examine and decide whether a planned building project interfered with private rights of third persons. On 28 October 2005 this decision was served on the applicant's counsel."", 'Section 25 of the Tyrolean Building Act (Bauordnung) reads as follows:', '“(1) The applicant for the building permit and the neighbours are parties to the proceedings concerning the building permit.', '(2) Neighbours are the owners of plots of land that are immediately adjacent to the building site, or where at least one point of their borders is within a distance of 15 m from a point along the border of the building site. Moreover, those persons who have a right to build on such a plot of land are considered to be neighbours.', '(3) Neighbours whose plots of land directly adjoin the building site, or where at least one point of their borders is at a distance of 5 m from a point along the border of the building site, are entitled to claim non-compliance with the following provisions under the Building Act and Regional Planning Act, to the extent that these provisions also serve to protect them:', 'a) specifications of the land development plan in relation to protection against pollution;', 'b) fire-protection provisions;', 'c) specifications of the zoning plan with regard to building lines, border lines of buildings, the type of construction and its height;', 'd) provisions on distances under section 6;', 'e) in the event that a general zoning plan and a supplementary zoning plan or a zoning plan with the specifications of the general and the supplementary zoning plan do not exist, the absence of the requirements pursuant to section 55 (1) or section 113 (1) of the 2006 Tyrolean Regional Planning Act.', '(4) Other neighbours are entitled to claim non-compliance with the provisions listed in letters a) and b) of paragraph (3), to the extent that those provisions also serve to protect them.', '(5) If private-law objections are raised in the hearing on the building project, the authority shall strive, as far as possible, to achieve an agreement.

From the very outset of the investigation he refused to testify or cooperate with the authorities.', 'On 4 September 2000 the Chelyabinsk Regional Court held its first hearing on this case.

The applicant submitted that the court had used his refusal to testify to support the findings about his guilt.', 'The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court.

001-22391,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,S.R. v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicant is an Iranian national, who was born in 1963 and lives in Sweden. He was represented before the Court by Mr K. Jönsson, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The respondent Government were represented by Mr L. Magnuson, Ministry for Foreign Affairs.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 17 August 1988 the applicant arrived in Sweden and requested asylum. According to a memorandum written by the police authority in Stockholm the same day, the applicant stated that he had served four months in the military at the frontline in the war between Iran and Iraq but had deserted two months before his arrival in Sweden. Furthermore, he was a Mujahedin supporter and had distributed, inter alia, leaflets for this organisation. The authorities were not aware of his activities, however. A more comprehensive interview was held by the police authority in Lycksele on 12 December 1988. On that occasion, the applicant stated that he had been doing his military service in Iran as from April 1987 but had deserted in July 1988 after having been informed that he would be sent to the frontline. The applicant stated also that, although not formally a member of the Mujahedin, he had supported the organisation and taken part in its activities, inter alia by distributing leaflets and publications. He had started his activities in September/October 1987 while he was in military service. Allegedly, the Iranian authorities had eventually learned about the activities – revolutionary guards had found leaflets at his family’s home – and were therefore going to send him to the frontline. He decided to flee and so, after having been in hiding in Iran for some time, he left the country. His brother had been arrested by the revolutionary guards when they searched the family’s home and had not been released. However, the applicant had never been detained himself. The applicant alleged that, if returned to Iran, he would be executed as he had deserted from his military service and had been active for the Mujahedin.', 'On 23 March 1989 the National Immigration Board (Statens Invandrarverk) granted the applicant a permanent residence permit in Sweden. He was also provided with a Swedish alien’s passport. The Board did not find the applicant to be a refugee but nevertheless considered that, due to the prevailing political situation in Iran, there were compelling reasons not to return him to that country.', 'Allegedly, the applicant continued his political activities for the Mujahedin in Sweden by, inter alia, organising and participating in demonstrations.', 'In February 1994 the applicant was arrested and charged with drug trafficking involving four and a half kilograms of heroin. The District Court (tingsrätten) of Stockholm obtained an opinion of the National Immigration Board, dated 26 April 1994, in which the Board stated that, although Iranian authorities treated drug offences severely, the applicant would not risk being prosecuted again in Iran for the crimes that he had committed in Sweden. The Board thus concluded that there were no impediments to expel him to Iran.', 'By a judgment of 19 May 1994 the District Court found the applicant guilty of the charges brought against him and convicted him of an aggravated drug offence and of an attempted aggravated drug offence. He was sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. Also, his expulsion from Sweden was ordered with a permanent prohibition on his return. With respect to the expulsion, the Court noted that the applicant’s sister was living in Sweden but that he had no other connection to the country. It had regard also to the severity of the crimes of which he had been convicted.', 'The applicant and the public prosecutor appealed against the judgment to the Svea Court of Appeal (Svea hovrätt). The applicant maintained his innocence and submitted in addition that an expulsion to Iran would expose him to a risk of persecution and ill-treatment by the Iranian authorities on account of his activities within the Mujahedin organisation in Iran and Sweden. He claimed also that he risked long imprisonment due to his desertion from the Iranian army.', 'By a judgment of 15 July 1994 the Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction and increased the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment. Furthermore, agreeing with the reasoning of the District Court, the appellate court upheld the expulsion order.', 'On 5 August 1994 the applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Högsta domstolen). He maintained what he had submitted to the Court of Appeal relating to the risks facing him upon return to Iran and added that he could be prosecuted again in Iran for the drug offences in question and that he could be punished also for having taken part in the trafficking of asylum seekers from Iran to Turkey. He claimed that he would risk the death penalty if he were to be returned.', 'Leave to appeal was refused by the Supreme Court on 22 August 1994.', 'On 21 September 2000, shortly before the applicant’s release on probation, the police authority in Stockholm contacted the applicant concerning his expulsion from Sweden. The applicant stated that he wished to return to Iran and that he would contact the Iranian Embassy in Sweden in order to obtain a passport. He would thus not oppose his expulsion. A week later, the applicant not having been in contact with the embassy, the police authority called the embassy and was informed that they wished to meet the applicant in person. The applicant was escorted by policemen to the meeting which took place on 29 September. According to a police memorandum of 24 October, the meeting went well. At a later contact, however, the embassy required that the applicant write a “life resumé” in order to get a laissez-passer. The applicant refused to do this and stated that he would no longer return to Iran voluntarily.', 'On 8 October 2000 the applicant was released on probation. He was immediately detained with a view to his deportation to Iran.', 'On 26 October 2000 the applicant requested the Stockholm police authority to refrain from deporting him and to inform the Migration Board (Migrationsverket; previously the National Immigration Board) that there were impediments to his deportation. The applicant referred to Article 3 of the Convention and to the same circumstances as submitted to the courts during his trial. He stated that it had become apparent during the expulsion proceedings that the Iranian Embassy was aware of his asylum application. He referred also to the embassy’s requirement that he submit a statement giving details about his life, which he had not dared to do.', 'Having been informed by the police authority that they would not stay the deportation or refer the matter to the Migration Board, the applicant petitioned the Government under chapter 7 section 16 of the Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 1989:529). This provision empowers the Government to revoke an expulsion order that has been imposed as a consequence of a criminal conviction, if it finds that the order cannot be enforced or there are other special reasons against upholding the order.', 'On 20 November 2000 the Government stayed the enforcement of the expulsion order until further notice following the Court’s indication of 13 November 2000, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that it was desirable in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court not to expel the applicant to Iran.', 'On 29 November 2000 the applicant obtained an opinion from Mr S. Mahmoudi, professor in international law at the University of Stockholm, which has subsequently been forwarded to the Government. In addition to giving an account of relevant Iranian legislation, Professor Mahmoudi made, inter alia, the following observations in regard to the applicant’s situation. As the Iranian authorities could be expected to know about the applicant’s asylum application and the reasons for his expulsion from Sweden, it is likely that he would be thoroughly questioned upon return to Iran. It is possible for the Iranian authorities to prosecute the applicant for the drug offences, although he has already been convicted and has served his sentence in Sweden. Previously, many people were sentenced to death and executed for drug offences, but today the usual practice is to impose long prison sentences. The death penalty is used only in a few cases involving repeated and organised large-scale drug trafficking. The applicant could also be sentenced to pay fines for having left Iran illegally and for having taken part in the trafficking of asylum seekers from Iran and he would risk a prison sentence for his desertion from the army. His involvement in Mujahedin activities is more difficult to assess; generally, however, the efforts of the Iranian authorities are mainly directed towards those who are more active members and have used arms against Government troops. Professor Mahmoudi maintained, however, that any prediction as to the outcome of a criminal case in Iran is difficult due to the courts’ arbitrary application of the laws. He thus concluded that it could not be excluded that the applicant would be sentenced to death. In any event, there is an apparent risk that he would be sentenced to imprisonment for life or for a very long period of time or to corporal punishment for the drug offences committed in Sweden and other crimes allegedly committed in Iran.', 'On 19 December 2000, at the request of the Government, the Migration Board gave its opinion on the applicant’s petition for the expulsion order to be revoked. The Board stated that, according to consistent Iranian case-law, the Iranian courts do not consider a criminal case when the person involved has already been convicted and served his or her prison sentence abroad. The Board therefore maintained the assessment made to the District Court on 26 April 1994 that there were no impediments to the applicant’s expulsion to Iran.', 'The applicant’s petition for a revocation of the expulsion order is still pending before the Government.', 'On 6 December 2000 the Government decided that the applicant be released from detention. Instead, an obligation to report to the police three times per week was imposed on the applicant in accordance with chapter 6 section 5 of the Aliens Act. By a decision of 5 June 2001 this obligation was changed to two occasions per week. A decision of 4 December 2001 did away with the reporting obligation but ordered the applicant to hand in his passport to the local police authority if that had not already been done.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

In 1991 their daughter P. was born. On an unspecified date in 1992 the applicant moved out of the family home.', 'On 4 June 1992 the applicant applied to the Gdynia District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) for a residence order in respect of P.. Consequently, access proceedings were instituted.', 'In June 1992 the applicant filed a petition for divorce with the Gdynia District Court.', 'On 13 July 1992 the applicant requested the Gdynia District Court to make an interim order on access arrangements during the custody and access proceedings. On 27 July 1992 he also requested that J.S. be divested of parental rights.', 'On 10 August 1992 the applicant was awarded interim access to the child by the Gdynia District Court. This allowed him to visit the child on Saturdays. J.S. refused to comply with that order.', 'On 3 September 1992 the applicant applied for a court order prohibiting his wife from removing the child from Poland without his consent. On 4 November 1992 the court refused his request.', 'On 30 December 1992 he requested the Gdynia District Court to change the access arrangements determined on 10 August 1992.', 'On 8 June 1993 the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dissolved the applicant’s marriage. The court awarded parental rights to both parents. It also limited the applicant in the exercise of his rights: it ordered that P.’s permanent residence be with her mother, but allowed the applicant to co-decide about the child’s education and health. The court did not specify access arrangements. On 10 December 1993 the applicant appealed against the divorce.', 'On 9 December 1993 J.S. instituted proceedings in which she requested that the applicant be divested of his parental rights on the ground that he had been aggressive towards her.', 'On 14 December 1993 the custody and access case was joined with the case instituted by the applicant’s wife.', 'In January 1994 J.S. left Poland together with the child and settled in Germany. She did not inform the applicant about it and did not give their new address in Germany.', 'In February 1994 the court gave J.S. three months in which to ensure compliance with the access arrangements provided for by the order of 10 August 1992. In February and in April 1994 the applicant again amended his application concerning the access arrangements and requested that the court issue a new interim decision to replace that of August 1992.', 'On 5 April 1994 the Gdynia District Court issued a decision allowing the applicant to see P. every Tuesday for two hours at the Family Diagnostics Centre in Sopot in her mother’s presence. The mother appealed.', 'On 6 September 1994 the Gdańsk Regional Court quashed this decision and remitted the case.', 'In October 1994 J.S. married a German citizen, changed her name to J.V. and moved to Hamburg with P.. She did not inform the applicant of her whereabouts. The applicant subsequently established their address with the assistance of the Polish consulate in Hamburg.', 'On 1 November 1994 the mother submitted that she would agree to report with the child at the Family Diagnostics Centre for an interview if she was granted appropriate protection against the applicant’s aggressive behaviour.', 'Following the remittal, on 19 October 1995 the Gdynia District Court issued its decision. The court dismissed J.V.’s motion that the applicant be divested of his parental rights, and the applicant’s motion that the child reside permanently with him. The court found that J.V was living with her new husband, a German citizen, his parents and P. in a house with a garden. It had been established by German social assistance authorities that P. got on well with her new environment and called her stepfather “dad”. P was happy, healthy and well cared for in her mother’s house. In April 1995 J.V. gave birth to another child. Conversely, the applicant was unemployed, lost his right to social security assistance and lived in his parent’s house. He had been also paying maintenance for another child – a six-year old son. The court considered that P. had every chance of obtaining an upbringing in a functional restructured family composed of her mother, her step-father and half-sister. She had a sense of security and stability in her mother’s house and it had been in the child’s interest to stay there. The court did not find any reasons to divest J.V of her parental rights. The fact that she had left Poland without informing the applicant thereof had certainly been an abuse of her parental rights, but could not serve as a ground on which to divest her of her rights in respect of P.’s custody. As to the applicant, there were also no grounds on which to divest him of his parental rights.', 'The applicant lodged an appeal with the Gdańsk Regional Court. He submitted that since 1992 the mother had made it impossible for him to have any contacts with P.', 'On 11 April 1996 the Gdańsk Regional Court upheld this decision. The court repeated the arguments of the first-instance court.', 'On 15 April 1996 the applicant instituted new proceedings in which he again requested the Gdynia District Court to establish access arrangements. On 23 April 1996 he lodged a further motion asking that full custody rights be restored to him.', 'On 20 May 1997 the Gdynia District Court dismissed the applicant’s motion of 23 April 1996 and refused to award custody to him. The court found, on the basis of new evidence obtained meanwhile from the German authorities, that P. was well integrated in her new family in Hamburg. She had no distinct memory of her life with her father before the divorce. Moreover, she received affection from her mother, her mother’s husband and his family. The spouses cared well for her, providing P. with the best conditions for her upbringing. The court accepted J.V.’s testimony that she had not deprived the applicant of effective access to the child as it had been the applicant who had made the contacts difficult due to his aggressive behaviour. The court concluded that removing P. from her mother’s custody, or even establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant, would harm the health and development of the child.', 'On 19 June 1997 the applicant appealed against this decision.', 'On 16 September 1997 the Gdańsk Regional Court upheld the contested decision and dismissed his appeal. It noted that having regard to the child’s well-being there were no circumstances which would justify a new decision on access arrangements.', 'On 10 April 1998 the Ombudsman lodged a motion on the applicant’s behalf with the Gdynia District Court to determine access arrangements. It was argued that the question of the applicant’s access to P. had never been settled except for the interim order of 10 August 1992. The child’s mother had deprived the applicant and the child of any possibility of contact. The applicant was right in emphasising that J.V. had abused her parental rights by removing the child from Poland without the applicant’s or the court’s permission or knowledge. That had constituted a violation of the domestic regulations and relevant provisions of international law. The Ombudsman stressed that J.V.’s actions had been clearly unlawful.', 'On 18 December 1998 the Gdynia District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for an interim access decision allowing him to send letters and presents to P.', 'On 18 March 1999 the Gdynia District Court established a temporary access arrangement and allowed the applicant to call P. once a week and to send letters to her. The applicant’s further appeal against this access arrangement was dismissed by the decision of the Gdańsk Regional Court on 28 May 1999.', 'On 6 July 2001 the Gdańsk District Court gave a decision on access arrangements. The child would visit the applicant once a year and he would be allowed to spend 14 days with her during the summer holidays. In addition the child would twice a month call the applicant. The applicant was allowed to send letters to his daughter.', 'The child’s mother appealed against this decision', 'On 14 June 2002 the Gdańsk Regional Court amended the first instance decision. The court considered that there were no grounds on which to accept that the child should have direct contacts with the applicant. P. had been brought up without any contacts with her father and she did not know him. Furthermore, as it appeared from her statements given in the proceedings before the German authorities, she had not been interested in having contact with the applicant. The court held that establishing a permanent access arrangement with the applicant could harm the child’s health and her development. In conclusion, the court allowed the applicant to send letters and gifts to his daughter.', 'On 12 December 1994 and 26 January 1996 the Gdynia District Court imposed fines on J.V. in the amount of 10 PLN for failure to comply with its order of 10 August 1992. On an unknown later date J.V. paid the fine which had been imposed on her on 12 December 1994. The enforcement proceedings concerning the second fine were discontinued in July 1997.', 'On 10 November 1999 the applicant again requested the court to impose a fine on J.V, alleging that she had prevented him from talking to P. on the phone and that she had refused to accept letters he had sent to P.', 'On 16 November 2000 the Gdynia District Court dismissed his request. The court considered that the applicant had failed to contact the mother in order to obtain her telephone number, and that it was not established that the mother had sent back any applicant’s letters.', 'On 27 March 2001, the Gdańsk Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the first-instance decision. The court considered that it had not been confirmed that J.V. had obstructed the applicant’s attempts to contact his daughter.', 'On 20 January 2000 the Reinbeck District Court in Germany decided to change the divorce judgment insofar as it concerned the custody of P. and granted custody solely to the mother. It considered that the parents were in conflict and that, in any event, the applicant and the child lived far away from each other.

001-71034,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,2005,CASE OF J.A. PYE (OXFORD) LTD AND J.A. PYE (OXFORD) LAND LTD v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Violation of P1-1;Just satisfaction reserved,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"['9. The second applicant company is the registered owner of a plot of 23 hectares of agricultural land in Berkshire. The first applicant company was its predecessor in title. The owners of a property adjacent to the land, Mr. and Mrs. Graham (“the Grahams”) occupied the land under a grazing agreement until 31 December 1983. On 30 December 1983 a chartered surveyor acting for the applicants wrote to the Grahams noting that the grazing agreement was about to expire and requiring them to vacate the land. In January 1984 the applicants refused a request for a further grazing agreement for 1984 because they anticipated seeking planning permission for the development of all or part of the land and considered that continued grazing might damage the prospects of obtaining such permission.', '10. Notwithstanding the requirement to vacate the land at the expiry of the 1983 agreement, the Grahams remained in occupation at all times, continuing to use it for grazing. No request to vacate the land or to pay for the grazing which was taking place was made. If it had been, the evidence was that the Grahams would happily have paid.', '11. In June 1984 an agreement was reached whereby the applicants agreed to sell to the Grahams the standing crop of grass on the land for £1,100. The cut was completed by 31 August 1984. In December 1984 an inquiry was made of the applicants as to whether the Grahams could take another cut of hay or be granted a further grazing agreement. No reply to this letter or to subsequent letters sent in May 1985 was received from the applicants and thereafter the Grahams made no further attempt to contact the applicants. From September 1984 onwards until 1999 the Grahams continued to use the whole of the disputed land for farming without the permission of the applicants.', '12. In 1997, Mr Graham registered cautions at the Land Registry against the applicant companies’ title on the ground that he had obtained title by adverse possession.', '13. On 30 April 1998 the applicant companies issued an originating summons in the High Court seeking cancellation of the cautions. On 20 January 1999 the applicant companies issued further proceedings seeking possession of the disputed land.', '14. The Grahams challenged the applicant companies’ claims under the Limitation Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) which provides that a person cannot bring an action to recover any land after the expiration of 12 years of adverse possession by another. They also relied on the Land Registration Act 1925, which applied at the relevant time and which provided that, after the expiry of the 12-year period, the registered proprietor was deemed to hold the land in trust for the squatter.', '15. Judgment was given in favour of the Grahams on 4 February 2000 ([2000]Ch 676). Mr Justice Neuberger held that since the Grahams enjoyed factual possession of the land from January 1984, and adverse possession took effect from September 1984, the applicant companies’ title was extinguished pursuant to the 1980 Act, and the Grahams were entitled to be registered as proprietors of the land. At the conclusion of his 30-page judgment, Neuberger J. remarked that the result he had reached did not accord with justice and could not be justified by practical considerations: the justification advanced for the right to acquire title to land by adverse possession – namely the avoidance of uncertainty – had in his view little relevance to the use of registered land where the owner was readily identifiable by inspecting the register of the relevant title at the Land Registry. The fact that an owner who had sat on his rights for 12 years should be deprived of the land was in his view “illogical and disproportionate”: as he expressed the point, “it does seem draconian to the owner and a windfall for the squatter that, just because the owner has taken no step to evict a squatter for 12 years, the owner should lose 25 hectares of land to the squatter with no compensation whatsoever”.', '16. The applicant companies appealed and on 6 February 2001, the Court of Appeal reversed the High Court decision on the ground that the Grahams did not have the necessary intention to possess the land, and the applicant companies were therefore not “dispossessed” of it within the meaning of the 1980 Act ([2001]EWCA Civ 117, [2001]Ch 804). Although this conclusion was sufficient to dispose of the appeal, two members of the Court of Appeal went on to address the question whether the applicants’ loss of title to the land could also have given rise to a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as applied in domestic law by the Human Rights Act 1998.', '17. Lord Justice Mummery held that Article 1 did not impinge on the relevant provisions of the Limitation Act 1980, which did not deprive a person of his possessions or interfere with his peaceful enjoyment of them but only deprived a person of his right of access to the courts for the purpose of recovering property if he had delayed the institution of his legal proceedings for 12 years or more after being dispossessed by another. The extinction of the applicants’ title was not, in his view, a deprivation of possessions nor a confiscatory measure for which payment of compensation would be appropriate, but simply a logical and pragmatic consequence of the barring of the right to bring an action after the expiration of the limitation period. In the alternative, Mummery L.J found that any deprivation was justified in the public interest, the conditions laid down in the 1980 Act being reasonably required to avoid the risk of injustice in the adjudication of stale claims and as ensuring certainty of title: those conditions were not disproportionate, the period of 12 years being reasonable and not imposing an excessively difficult burden on the landowner.', '18. Lord Justice Keene took as his starting point that limitation periods were in principle not incompatible with the Convention and that the process whereby a person would be barred from enforcing rights by the passage of time was clearly acknowledged by the Convention. This position obtained, in his view, even though limitation periods both limited the right of access to the courts and in some circumstances had the effect of depriving persons of property rights, whether real or personal, or of damages: there was thus nothing inherently incompatible as between the 1980 Act and Article 1 of the Protocol.', '19. The Grahams appealed to the House of Lords, which, on 4 July 2002, allowed their appeal and restored the order of the High Court ([2002] UKHL 30, [2002] 3 All ER 865). Lord Browne-Wilkinson, with whom Lord Mackay of Clashfern and Lord Hutton agreed, held that the Grahams did have “possession” of the land in the ordinary sense of the word, and therefore the applicant companies had been “dispossessed” of it within the meaning of the 1980 Act. There was no inconsistency between a squatter being willing to pay the paper owner if asked and his being in possession in the meantime. Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred to the European Convention on Human Rights only to note that there was no ambiguity in the 1980 Act which called for resolution.', '20. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, agreeing with Lord Browne-Wilkinson, made the following statement in the course of his judgment:', '“[The Grahams] sought rights to graze or cut grass on the land after the summer of 1984, and were quite prepared to pay. When Pye failed to respond they did what any other farmer in their position would have done: they continued to farm the land. They were not at fault. But the result of Pye’s inaction was that they enjoyed the full use of the land without payment for 12 years. As if that were not gain enough, they are then rewarded by obtaining title to this considerable area of valuable land without any obligation to compensate the former owner in any way at all. In the case of unregistered land, and in the days before registration became the norm, such a result could no doubt be justified as avoiding protracted uncertainty where the title to land lay. But where land is registered it is difficult to see any justification for a legal rule which compels such an apparently unjust result, and even harder to see why the party gaining title should not be required to pay some compensation at least to the party losing it. It is reassuring to learn that the Land Registration Act 2002 has addressed the risk that a registered owner may lose his title through inadvertence. But the main provisions of that Act have not yet been brought into effect, and even if they had it would not assist Pye, whose title had been lost before the passing of the Act. While I am satisfied that the appeal must be allowed for the reasons given by my noble and learned friend, this is a conclusion which I (like the judge [Neuberger J]...) ‘arrive at with no enthusiasm’.” [JA Pye (Oxford) Ltd and another v. Graham and another [2000] 3 All ER 865, at 867]', '21. The question whether the result was incompatible with the applicants’ rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention was not pursued before the House of Lords, it being conceded that the Human Rights Act 1998 had no retrospective effect. However, in his judgment Lord Hope of Craighead, who also agreed with Lord Browne-Wilkinson on the reasons for dismissing the appeal, observed that the question under the Convention:', '“....is not an easy one, as one would have expected the law - in the context of a statutory regime where compensation is not available - to lean in favour of the protection of a registered proprietor against the actions of persons who cannot show a competing title on the register. Fortunately.......a much more rigorous regime has now been enacted in Schedule 6 to the 2002 Act. Its effect will be to make it much harder for a squatter who is in possession of registered land to obtain title against the wishes of the proprietor. The unfairness in the old regime which this case has demonstrated lies not in the absence of compensation, although that is an important factor, but in the lack of safeguards against oversight or inadvertence on the part of the registered proprietor.”', '22. Section 15 of the Limitation Act 1980, a consolidating Act, provides:', '“(1) No action shall be brought by any person to recover any land after the expiration of twelve years from the date on which the right of action accrued to him or, if it first accrued to some person through whom he claims, to that person...', '(6) Part I of Schedule 1 to this Act contains provisions for determining the date of accrual of rights of action to recover land in the cases there mentioned.”', '23. Paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 provides:', '“Where the person bringing an action to recover land, or some person through whom he claims, has been in possession of the land, and has while entitled to the land been dispossessed or discontinued his possession, the right of action shall be treated as having accrued on the date of the dispossession or discontinuance.”', '24. In the case of unregistered land, section 17 of the 1980 Act provides that, on the expiration of the limitation period regulating the recovery of land, the title of the paper owner is extinguished. In the case of registered land, section 75(1) of the Land Registration Act 1925 provides that, on the expiry of the limitation period the title is not extinguished but the registered proprietor is deemed to hold the land thereafter in trust for the squatter.', '25. The Law Reform Committee considered the law on limitation periods in its report of 1977 (Cmnd 6923). It commented negatively on the courts’ practice of granting an implied licence to the would-be adverse possessor, which had the effect of stopping time running against the owner, and proposed no change to the existing limitation periods, and agreed that the expiration of the limitation period should serve to extinguish the claimant’s title.', '26. A Law Commission Consultation Paper on Limitation of Actions in 1988 (Law Com 151) gave a number of general policy aims of the law on limitations. The Consultation Paper noted that defendants have a legitimate interest in having cases brought to court reasonably promptly as evidence may not be available indefinitely, and because defendants should be able to rely on their assumed entitlement to enjoy an unchallenged right. The State, too, has an interest in ensuring that claims are made and determined within a reasonable time in order to deliver a fair trial, and as guarantor of legal certainty. Finally, limitation periods were seen to have a salutary effect on plaintiffs in encouraging them to bring claims reasonably promptly.', '27. A separate Law Commission Consultative Document on land registration in 1998 (prepared with the Land Registry; Law Com 254) noted that although the original intention of the system of land registration was to apply the principles of unregistered land to a registered format, there were certain areas where this was not wholly true. One example given was the position of the rights of adverse possessors (section 75(1) of the Land Registration Act 1925 was referred to). The Consultative Document set out and commented on four particularly cogent reasons often given for the law on adverse possession: (i) Because it is part of the law on limitation of actions. It noted:', '“... because adverse possession is an aspect of the law of limitation, it is of course customary to account for it, at least in part, in terms of the policy of limitation statutes generally, namely to prevent defendants from stale claims and to encourage defendants not to sleep on their rights. However, adverse possession does not merely bar claims. Its effect is positive: ‘a squatter does in the end get title by his possession and the indirect operation of the Limitation Act ..’. This can only be justified by factors over and above those which explain the law on limitation ... this particular justification has much greater force in relation to unregistered land than it does for land with registered title. Unregistered title ultimately depends on possession. It therefore behoves a landowner to be vigilant to protect that possession and not to sleep on his or her rights. ... where title is registered (...) the basis of title is primarily the fact of registration rather than possession. Registration confers title because the registration of a person as proprietor of land of itself vests in him or her the relevant legal estate ...”', '(ii) Because if land and its ownership are out of kilter, the land may become unmarketable. Where the registered owner has disappeared, and cannot be traced, and a squatter takes possession, the doctrine of adverse possession “does at least ensure that in such cases land remains in commerce and is not rendered sterile”. Where there have been dealings “off the register”, such as where a farmer agrees to a land swap with a neighbour under a “gentleman’s agreement” but does not register the change, “adverse possession fulfils a useful function”. (iii) Because in case of mistake the innocent but mistaken squatter of land may have incurred expenditure. In such circumstances adverse possession can be justified on grounds of hardship, and there are parallels with the principles of proprietary estoppel. (iv) Because it facilitates and cheapens investigation of title to land. The Law Commission accepted this last reason as being very strong for unregistered land, but considered that for registered land, where title depends on the contents of the register rather than possession, it was not applicable.', '28. The Law Commission proposed, provisionally, that the system of adverse possession as it applied to registered land should be recast to reflect the principles of title registration, and that it should be limited to very few, exceptional cases.', '29. Two Reports, on Limitation of Actions (Law Com 270) and on registered land (Law Com 271), followed the Consultation Papers, and were published in July 2001.', '30. The Law Commission Report on Limitation of Actions recommended that the general limitation period for actions in respect of land should be ten years. It added that if the proposals made on registered land in Law Com 254 were accepted, the proposal would relate only to interests in unregistered land (and unregistrable interests in registered land).', '31. The Report on registered land (Law Com 271) proposed that a squatter should be able to apply to be registered as proprietor after 10 years’ adverse possession, and that the registered proprietor should be notified of that application. If the proprietor objected to the registration, the application by the adverse possessor for registration would be rejected. The registered proprietor would then be required to regularise the position (for example by evicting the squatter) within two years, failing which the squatter would be entitled to be registered as proprietor.', '32. The Land Registration Act 2002, which does not have retroactive effect, implemented the proposals in Law Com 271.', '33. On 23 March 2005, Deputy Judge Strauss in the Chancery Division gave judgment in the case of Beaulane Properties Ltd v. Palmer (Times Law Reports, 13 April 2005). The case concerned a licensee who had remained in possession of registered land for over 12 years after the expiry of his licence. Applying the judgment of the House of Lords in the present case, the judge found that under English law as it stood up to the entry into force of the Human Rights Act 1998, the registered owner of the land lost all claim to it. However, on analysing the facts on a Convention basis, he found that there was no real public or general interest in the law on adverse possession in the case of registered land, and that the adverse consequences for the landowner were disproportionate. By re-interpreting the relevant legislation in accordance with Section 3 of the Human Rights Act, the judge found that the claim by the former licensee to have acquired the disputed land failed.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

They are owners of two private driving schools. The third applicant, Riihimäen Liikenneopisto Oy, is a driving school company in Riihimäki. They are represented before the Court by Mr Timo Hakanen, a lawyer practising in Jyväskylä. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen, Director in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 17 April 2000 the Provincial State Office (lääninhallitus, länssyrelsen) of Southern Finland granted the Joint Municipal Board of the Vocational Institute of Riihimäki (Riihimäen ammattioppilaitoksen kuntayhtymä, yrkesinstitutens samkommunen) a driving school licence to teach their students to drive. The licence was valid from 1 August 2000 until 31 July 2005, with the name “Autokoulu RAOL”. Mr T.S. was approved as its director.', 'The applicants appealed against the decision to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen) of Hämeenlinna, claiming that the decision be annulled as, inter alia, T.S. did not meet the criteria for a director as required in the Decree on Driving Licences (ajokorttiasetus, körkortsförordningen; 845/1990, amend. 167/1994). They further alleged that operating a driving school did not belong to the functions of a municipality or a federation of municipalities. In any case, the name of the licence-holder, “Autokoulu RAOL” should have been deleted and the number of training vehicles limited to two motor vans and two passenger cars. They contended that the establishment of a new driving school affected their rights as it would reduce their incomes and thus they had a right to appeal pursuant to section 6 of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen; 586/1996).', 'On 21 November 2000 the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen) of Hämeenlinna held an oral hearing, in which it heard the Provincial State Office, the Joint Municipal Board and the applicants. It further obtained written opinions from the parties.', 'On 19 February 2001 the Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Provincial State Office on the ground that T.S. was not competent to act as a director, and thus the Provincial State Office should not have granted a driving school licence to the Joint Municipal Board.', 'The Joint Municipal Board appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), reiterating that T.S. fulfilled the criteria. The Provincial State Office, the Ministry of Transport and Communications (liikenneministeriö, kommunikations- ministeriet) and the applicants submitted opinions to the court and the Joint Municipal Board gave its observations.', 'On 13 August 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Administrative Court and declared the applicants’ application to the Administrative Court inadmissible without considering its merits. It held that the issue was whether the applicants had a right of appeal against the decision of the Provincial State Office. It emphasised that pursuant to the Road Traffic Act (tieliikennelaki, vägtrafiklagen; 267/1981, amend. 103/1994) and the Decree on Driving Licences the licence for a driving school had to be granted if the applicant fulfilled certain criteria. The appropriateness of a new licence was not relevant to the decision-making. Therefore, when deciding on the new licence it was irrelevant whether the new licence affected the status of already existing driving schools. The court concluded that the owners of other driving schools were not directly affected by the decision and had no right to appeal under the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act. The decision became a precedent (KHO:2003:46).', 'Section 21 of the Constitution of Finland (perustuslaki, grundlagen; 731/1999) provides that everyone has the right to have his or her case dealt with appropriately and without undue delay by a legally competent court of law or other authority, as well as to have a decision pertaining to his or her rights or obligations reviewed by a court of law or other independent organ for the administration of justice.', 'Section 6, subsection 1 of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act provides that any person to whom a decision is addressed or whose right, obligation or interest is directly affected by a decision may appeal against a decision.', 'Section 66 of the Road Traffic Act (267/1981, as in force until 1994) provided that a driving school licence was required for operating a driving school. The State Provincial Office might grant a licence, if the applicant was deemed to fulfil the criteria for operating a driving school and the establishment of the school was considered necessary and appropriate in accordance with the general instructions issued by the then Ministry of Transport.', 'According to the said section, as amended by Act on 1 March 1994 (103/1994), a licence to operate a driving school is granted by the relevant State Provincial Office. A driving school licence shall be granted if, having regarded his or her skills, reliability, solvency and other qualifications, the applicant is deemed suitable for operating a driving school. If the applicant is a legal person, the director responsible for the teaching at the driving school must, in light of his or her skills, reliability, solvency and other qualifications, be suitable to operate a driving school.', 'Section 66, subsection 3 of the said Act provides that a licence shall be granted for a certain period of time. It may also include preconditions and restrictions. According to subsection 4, a licence is not required if teaching takes place in drivers’ vocational training, which is supervised by the National Board of Education, or in an institute training driving instructors.', 'Chapter 8, section 39 of the Decree on Driving Licences sets the criteria for the licence of driving schools. A licence shall be granted if the applicant, or, where the applicant is a legal person, its director responsible for the teaching, has, inter alia, a driving instruction permit and has during the past ten years worked for at least four years as a full-time teacher in a driving school or in a vocational institution giving class C driver instruction.', 'In its precedent (KHO 1987-A-75) the Supreme Administrative Court found that a decision of the Ministry of Transport to suspend a charter transport licence for a determined period of time did not affect the rights of a competing charter transport carrier within the meaning of section 26, subsection 5, of the Decree on Professional Motor Traffic. Thus the competing carrier had no right to appeal against the Ministry’s decision.', 'According to the Supreme Administrative Court’s precedent (KHO 1995-A-1), in a case where the Government had decided at the same time several applications for compensation to be paid with discretionary funds included in the state budget, a person had a right to appeal against the Government’s decision only to the extent the decision concerned his/her own application.', 'In 1995 the Supreme Administrative Court issued a precedent (KHO 1995-A-51) concerning a driving school licence. In that case the Provincial State Office had granted A a right to establish a driving school and allowed him to take responsibility for the teaching even though he had at the same time the same responsibility in another driving school. The Supreme Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Ministry of Transportation, by which it had declared inadmissible an application lodged by four other driving school owners, and found that the Provincial State Office’s decision concerned rights of the applicants, who had the right to appeal.', 'In its decision no. 63 of 8 January 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the housing corporation located in the neighbourhood of a restaurant did not have a right to appeal against a decision by which a restaurant was granted a licence to serve alcohol both indoors and in the outdoor area of the restaurant.', 'The Supreme Administrative Court further found in its decision no. 795 of 8 April 1997 that a person operating a pharmacy in the neighbouring municipality did not have a right to appeal against a decision of the National Agency for Medicines by which it issued a licence for the storing of medicines, as the applicant in question had not applied for the licence and as the granting of a licence to him (being a pharmacist in another municipality) did not affect his rights and obligations within the meaning of section 4 of the Administrative Appeals Act.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The decision was also based on the fact that the applicant’s partner, who was the father of the child, was alcoholic and had displayed violent behaviour towards the applicant.', '7. On an unknown date, the applicant moved to a new apartment in Entroncamento and left her partner.', '8. On 2 December 2009, the prosecutor confirmed the placement of C. in foster care for a period of three months and the applicant agreed to see a psychiatrist on a regular basis.', '9. Between 12 May and 3 June 2010, the applicant, who was then suffering from depression owing to the separation from her child, was admitted to the Coimbra Psychiatric Unit.', '10. On 29 June 2010, the placement of C. in foster care was extended for another six months and the applicant renewed her promise to see a psychiatrist and promised to find a job, as well as better housing.', '11. On 21 December 2010, the prosecutor confirmed the placement of C. pending review of the interim protection order as provided for by law.', '12. The applicant, who was granted legal aid, opposed the extension of the measure and the case was brought before the Entroncamento Court. The prosecutor requested that the child be placed in foster care with a view to her adoption; the applicant requested that she be returned to her.', '13. By a judgment of 17 May 2011, the Entroncamento Court ordered the final placement of C., then eighteen months old, in foster care with a view to her adoption. Relying, in particular, on the statements from the social services in Torres Novas and from the foster home’s staff, the court considered that the applicant was not in a position to change her situation and fulfil her parental duties. As no other family member was available to take care of the child, the court considered that the placement in foster care, with a view to adoption, would be in the best interests of the child.', '14. The applicant challenged the decision before the Evora Court of Appeal (Tribunal da Relação de Évora), which, on 22 September 2011, dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision of the firstinstance court.', '15. There was no subsequent appeal before the Supreme Court of Justice (Supremo Tribunal de Justiça).', '16. On 7 April 2009, the CPCYP was informed that the applicant was living in poor conditions and about to give birth. The applicant and her partner were both HIV-positive. The former had an unstable professional and personal life and had previously suffered the loss of a child in circumstances which remained unclear. The latter had a long history of drug addiction.', '17. On 13 May 2009 the applicant gave birth to J.P. in Setúbal.', '18. The child was immediately admitted to the paediatric service of the hospital and then placed in foster care following an interim protection order issued on 28 May 2009.', '19. On an unknown date, the case was brought before the Setúbal Family Court (Tribunal de Família e Menores de Setúbal), which held a hearing on 3 May 2010. The applicant alleged that she had not been informed of the hearing and had therefore not been heard by the court.', '20. On 6 May 2010, the Setúbal Family Court ordered the placement of the child in foster care with a view to his adoption.', '21. On 11 May 2010, the applicant’s newly appointed lawyer challenged that decision before the Evora Court of Appeal, which, on 17 November 2010, upheld the first-instance decision.', '22. Despite the applicant’s wish, the appointed lawyer did not bring the case before the Supreme Court, considering that an appeal against a decision based on “suitability and appropriateness” (conveniência ou oportunidade) would be barred by Article 1411, paragraph 2, of the Code of Civil Procedure.', '23. On an unknown date, the applicant wrote a letter to the Supreme Court, which replied, on 18 November 2011, that it could only hear formal appeals against decisions of lower jurisdictions lodged in compliance with the applicable rules.', '24. On 10 February 2011, the applicant lodged an administrative request with the Prosecutor’s Office. The request was closed on 23 March 2012 and a similar request was again closed on 24 September 2012.', '25. On 25 September 2012, the applicant was informed that the case was being transferred to the Barreiro Family Court (Tribunal de Família e Menores do Barreiro). The reasons for this transfer are unknown.', '26. On 24 October 2012 the applicant was notified that the Barreiro Court would discontinue the proceedings as the case had already been settled by the Evora Court of Appeal.', '27.

The relevant case-law of the Supreme Court of Justice shows a general trend towards recognition of the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to hear appeals relating to the protection of children and young persons as long as the appeals raise issues of law and do not question the “suitability or appropriateness” of the lower court’s decisions, which are matters of fact. The following are some excerpts from relevant decisions:', '“... The intervention of the Supreme Court of Justice in the judgment of appeals is limited to an assessment of the decisions taken in accordance with strict legality. 3. It can verify compliance with requirements, procedural or substantive, the power to choose the most convenient measure to protect the interests at stake and the compliance with the purpose for which such powers were allocated to the courts, but not the suitability or appropriateness of that choice.” (10 April 2008)', '“... However, this limitation does not imply that the intervention of the Supreme Court of Justice should be totally excluded with regard to this type of appeal; it merely restricts it to an assessment of the appealed decisions as far as the strict application of the law is concerned. In particular, [it restricts the Supreme Court’s assessment] to the procedural and substantive grounds on which the power to adopt the relevant measure ... is exercised” (20 January 2010).', '“As proceedings for the promotion and protection of children and young persons at risk are qualified as voluntary jurisdiction proceedings, ... its [Supreme Court of Justice] intervention can only be limited to verifying the procedural and substantive assumptions legally established for the application of the measure that has been determined by the lower court and its adequacy for the purpose to which the criteria of suitability and appropriateness must be subordinated.” (4 May 2010)', '“... However, this legal provision must be carefully interpreted as, frequently, the appeals do not only relate to lower courts’ decisions based on suitability or appropriateness but also to the enforceability of the legal requirements or other requirements on which the decisions are based, namely their compliance with constitutional or supranational norms, which are subject to the scrutiny of the Supreme Court of Justice.” (21 October 2010).', '“Granting custody [of the child] to the person selected for adoption or to an institution with a view to future adoption triggers a severance in any existing relation with the biological family of the child. ... Such a measure is based on the general assumption that there is no affective parent-child relationship, or that any such relationship is severely impaired, and can only be decided in the situations described [Article 1978, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code] where verification is subject, on appeal, to the Supreme Court of Justice’s scrutiny.” (30 June 2011).']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

She is represented before the Court by Mr Richard Daniel, Mr Alain Garay and Mr Arthur Leontyev, lawyers practising respectively in Norfolk, Paris and St. Petersburg.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 9 July 1991 the applicant gave birth to a son Yevgeniy. The applicant and the father of the son lived together from July 1991 to May 1992 but were never married. The applicant suffered physical abuse by her partner which led to their separation in May 1992. It was agreed that the applicant would have custody of the child and that the child would visit his father at weekends.', 'In the summer of 1997 the applicant began to associate with the religious minority known as the Jehovah’s Witnesses and involved her son in its religious activities. Her former partner, being an Orthodox believer, turned to a public organisation called the Committee for Rescuing Youth from Totalitarian Sects and the Lyubertsy Custody Council, a State agency, with a view to obtaining custody of the child for himself.', 'On 9 March 1998 the father refused to return the child to the applicant following a weekend visit. The applicant complained to the police and on 16 March 1998 filed an application for legal custody with the Lyubertsy City Court (Люберецкий городской суд). On 19 March 1998 the applicant was notified that her former partner had already applied for custody and that the hearing of the case was scheduled to begin on 24 March 1998.', 'By judgment of 14 April 1998 the Lyubertsy City Court granted custody of the child to the father, ordered him not to prevent the applicant’s contacts with the child and dismissed the applicant’s counterclaim. In reaching its decision the City Court took into account, inter alia, a report submitted by the Committee for Rescuing Youth from Totalitarian Sects and prepared by the researchers of the Russian Academy of Education, which described the Jehovah’s Witnesses organisation as a destructive and totalitarian sect whose activity presents a serious danger for society. It found that the applicant’s affiliation with the organisation had a harmful effect on the health and development of the child.', '', 'On 12 July 1998 the Judicial Chamber for Civil Cases of the Moscow Regional Court (судебная коллегия по гражданским делам Московского областного суда) upheld the judgment of the first instance court and dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation. On 17 November 1998 the applicant requested the Chairman of the Moscow Regional Court to order a review of her case. By letter of 8 February 1999 the Regional Court rejected the applicant’s request.', 'On 23 February 1999 the applicant filed an application with the Lyublino District Court of Moscow (Люблинский районный суд г. Москвы) - a court with jurisdiction over the father’s area of residence - to define and extend the contacts with her son, whom she saw 2 hours a week in the presence of the father. On 31 March 1999 the Moscow Regional Public Prosecutor refused the applicant’s request to reconsider her case.', 'On 17 May 1999 the applicant filed a petition with the Supreme Court of Russia requesting its officials to lodge a protest against the lower courts’ judgments. The request was granted by the Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court, whose protest was then put before the Moscow Regional Court for consideration. By decision of 29 June 1999 the Presidium of the Moscow Regional Court rejected the protest brought by the Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court and upheld the validity of the impugned judgments. The applicant was not present at the hearing before the Regional Court as she was only notified of it on 4 July 1999 by a letter postmarked 28 June 1999.', 'By decision of 22 July 1999 the Judicial Chamber for Civil Cases of the Supreme Court of Russia revoked, upon a protest by the Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court, the judgments of the Lyubertsy City Court and the Moscow Regional Court, as well as the decision of the Presidium of the Moscow Regional Court. It sent the case back to the first instance court for new consideration. It found that in examining the applicant’s case the courts had infringed norms of substantive and procedural law. In particular, they had wrongly entered into a discussion of the nature of the Jehovah’s Witnesses organisation and failed adequately to examine all the relevant individual circumstances of the applicant’s case.', 'On 23 August 1999, following the re-opening of the custody proceedings, the case went back to the Lyubertsy City Court, which adjourned it until 20 September 1999. As the father failed to appear before the court on that date, the hearing was further postponed until 22 November 1999. On 5 October 1999 the Lyublino District Court, where the applicant’s request for defined and extended contact stood adjourned, ordered the case to be remitted to the Lyubertsy City Court for examination jointly with the custody issue.', 'On 22 November 1999 the Lyubertsy City Court held a hearing in which it refused the applicant’s request for the return of the child pending determination of the long term future as well as for an independent psychological report on his current condition. The hearing scheduled for 24 January 2000 was adjourned due to the absence of the father. On 14 February 2000 the City Court held a further hearing.', 'On 13 March 2000 the applicant and the father concluded a friendly settlement, renouncing fully their reciprocal claims before the Lyubertsy City Court concerning the custody of their child. The applicant also withdrew her claims previously presented to the Lyublino District Court regarding the definition and extension of contacts with her son.', 'According to the settlement, the child would reside with his father and the mother would have the child at weekends. In agreement with the father, the mother can meet with the child in the evening on weekdays and take him with her on school holidays.

However, the police discovered that they had used forged documents and illegally entered into the country. In his testimony to the police, Mr Ebigwei alleged, inter alia, that there was a risk for his life if deported to Nigeria, because he was a Christian and because of the conflict between Christians and Muslims there, which resulted in the death of two of his brothers and his sister four years ago.The applicants were brought before the First Instance Court of Thebes and tried by virtue of immediate summary proceedings (ie where no further investigations are required) : Mr Ebigwei on 15 November 1999 and Mr Eziobou on 19 November 1999.

He is a businessman. He is represented before the Court by Mr. J. Somogyi, a lawyer practising in Budapest.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'A.', 'The application concerns the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest by four members of the Kunszentmiklós Police on 29 April 1995 and his alleged ill-treatment subsequently at the Kunszentmiklós police station. As to the actual course of these events, the Government and the applicant submitted conflicting versions.', 'a. The applicant’s account of the relevant events', 'On 29 April 1995, at about 6 p.m., the applicant was working in the yard of his house, when he saw Mr. R. approach, running on the street. Two police officers wearing uniforms and holding guns were chasing Mr. R. The applicant asked one of the policemen why they were chasing Mr. R. In response the policemen ordered the applicant to drop the wooden bar he was holding in his hand. He complied with the order. Thereupon he was ordered to lie down on the ground. He, being afraid, attempted to run away, during the course of which the other policeman present hit him in the face. He nevertheless managed to break free and escape to the neighbouring gardens. Realising that two further police officers had meanwhile arrived on the premises, he eventually went out on the street again and lay down on the ground. Subsequently he was handcuffed and brought to the Kunszentmiklós police station. He alleges that during the drive to the police station Police Officer F. hit him once in the stomach.', 'At the police station his hands were handcuffed behind his back and, subsequently, Police Officer F. and the police officer who had previously taken the action against him in front of his house systematically beat him up. During the beating he fell on the floor, where he was kicked several times and his head was banged against the floor, which resulted in a bleeding bruise on his forehead. A person wearing plain clothes stepped on his dislocated foot. Thereupon he was instructed to wash himself, go outside and tell his relatives waiting there that he had not been hurt and that they should leave. He did not comply with this instruction.', 'b. The Government’s account of the events', 'On 29 April 1995 Police Officers R. and F. were on duty in Kunszentmiklós. They halted a car for an identity check of the driver and his passenger. This latter person, however, did not comply with the police officers’ instruction but jumped out of the car and started to run away. While chasing him, the police officers reached the street where the applicant lives. Here the applicant appeared, holding a wooden bar in his hands.', 'According to the police officers and a civil guard present, the applicant yelled at them, blocked their way and hit with the wooden bar in the direction of Police Officer R.’s head. Thereupon Police Officer F. took out his service gun and ordered the applicant to drop the wooden bar. He dropped the wooden bar and ran away. Police Officer R. ran after him, caught him and attempted to stop him grasping him by his left shoulder. The applicant turned around and, with his right fist, he hit Police Officer R. on the left cheek. Thereupon the police officer tried to push the applicant down on the ground, but the latter hit him again on the left cheek twice, managed to break free and ran away. In this moment the applicant’s relatives and neighbours showed up in the street; the preceding events had consequently not been eye-witnessed by anyone other than the police officers and the civil guard. Police Officer R. went on trying to subdue and hand-cuff the applicant in order to prevent further violence but he could not overcome his resistance.', 'Eventually, the applicant broke free and ran into the spectators’ crowd where he disappeared. Police Officer R. followed the applicant into the crowd and saw him fall on the ground accidentally. By the time he got near the applicant lying on the ground in order to handcuff him, several women - some relatives and acquaintances of the applicant - leant over the applicant, covering him with their bodies and preventing his handcuffing. While the police officers were trying to pull these women away, the applicant broke free again and ran away. Jumping over several fences, he soon reappeared in another direction in the street.', 'In this moment two further policemen arrived on the premises upon the acting police officers’ call for back-up. Presumably owing to exhaustion, the applicant meanwhile lay down on the stony earth road further down the street, where the above-mentioned women leant over him again, covering him with their bodies. The proceeding police officers finally managed to handcuff the applicant, whom they brought to the Kunszentmiklós police station.', 'According to the testimonies given in the course of the ensuing investigations by the police officers involved and the civil guard present, the applicant had injuries on his face when handcuffed; in turn, he was not ill-treated at the police station.', 'c. Subsequent events on 29 April 1995', 'Later that day Dr. F. was called to the Kunszentmiklós police station, who, at 10.35 p.m., examined the applicant and prepared a medical report on his injuries. Subsequently he left to fetch his instruments in order to suture the applicant’s wound on the forehead. The applicant alleges that thereupon a police officer handcuffed him again and went on hitting and kicking him.', 'After Dr. F. had returned and sutured the applicant’s wound over the eye, the latter was brought to the Bács-Kiskun County Police Department’s Prison in Kecskemét.', 'd. Medical reports and opinions evaluating the applicant’s injuries', 'In his report of 29 April 1995, Dr. F. stated that the applicant had the following injuries: abrasions, bruises and suffusions of the face, the forehead, the neck, the shoulders, the right upper arm, the chest and the back, a swollen reddish discoloration and suffusion in the upper stomach region, as well as a ruptured wound over the right eye. In Dr. F.’s opinion, these injuries were to heal within seven days.', 'On 2 May 1995 Dr. T. examined the applicant in the Kecskemét prison. In his report Dr. T. described altogether nineteen counts of contusions and abrasions scattered on the applicant’s head, arms, chest, back, trunk and legs.', 'On 28 May 1995 the Bács-Kiskun County Police Department appointed a medical expert to give his opinion on the previous medical reports concerning the applicant’s injuries. The expert found that the applicant’s injuries, as described by Dr. F. on 29 April and by Dr. T. on 2 May, could be due to the struggle between the applicant and the police officers and the applicant’s falling down on harsh ground in the context of his arrest. In turn, the expert found no reference in the reports to any injury, which could be attributed to any brutality other than the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest.', 'On 10 August 1995 Professor D., a forensic pathologist appointed by the Kecskemét Branch Office of the Szeged Prosecution’s Department of Investigation (“the Branch Office”), issued an opinion as to the nature of the applicant’s injuries. He found that the contusions and abrasions on the applicant’s body, as described in the medical reports of 29 April and 2 May, could be due to punches or to falling down on harsh ground. The swollen lesion in the gastric area had been likely to derive from a punch on the applicant’s stomach. The injuries altogether could be the consequences of the applicant’s forcible immobilisation and handcuffing. From a forensic medical aspect it could not be proven if the injuries had been suffered in the context of the applicant’s arrest or of any potential subsequent ill-treatment.', 'On 20 September 1995 the Forensic Pathology Department of the Semmelweis Medical University issued a forensic medical opinion in the case. According to this opinion, the applicant’s injuries must have been due to at least eighteen counts of forcible impact and it could not be excluded that these impacts had been punches. However, in the Forensic Pathology Department’s view, the medical report prepared by Dr. F. on 29 April 1995 was not precise enough to underlie a forensic opinion as to the cause of the applicant’s injuries.', 'e. Proceedings in pursuit of the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment', 'On 9 and 11 May 1995, respectively, the applicant laid charges of ill-treatment and of light bodily assault against the police officers involved. The ensuing proceedings took place before the Branch Office.', 'On 6 September 1995 the Branch Office discontinued the investigation upon the charges laid by the applicant. The Branch Office, relying on forensic medical expertise and witness evidence - given by the police officers and the civil guard present at the incident -, found that the applicant’s injuries could be due to the fight between the police officers and the applicant upon the occasion of the latter’s arrest, when hindering the lawfully proceeding police officers in arresting Mr. R. The Branch Office held that it could not be proven beyond doubt that the applicant’s injuries had been caused by ill-treatment rather than in the course of his lawful arrest.', 'On 27 September 1995 the applicant lodged a complaint against the decision of 6 September 1995. He criticised the fact that the Branch Office had held no hearing in the case. Moreover, he submitted the forensic medical opinion prepared by the Forensic Pathology Department of the Semmelweis Medical University on 20 September 1995.', 'On 13 October 1995 the Kunszentmiklós District Public Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The Prosecutor’s Office pointed out that it had not been possible to prove beyond doubt that his injuries had been caused as alleged and that the investigation had been, therefore, lawfully discontinued. To the extent that the decision of the Branch Office had concerned the applicant’s charges of light bodily assault, the Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 6 September 1995 and transferred the case to the Kunszentmiklós District Court in order that it should proceed with the applicant’s charges in private prosecution proceedings.', 'On 9 November 1995 the applicant lodged a revisionary complaint with the Attorney General’s Office. In January 1996 the Attorney General’s Office dismissed this complaint.', 'On 29 February 1996 the Kunszentmiklós District Court, in preparatory proceedings, discontinued the private prosecution proceedings against Police Officers F., R. and S. The District Court found unsubstantiated the applicant’s charge of light bodily assault brought against the police officers.', 'On 16 April 1996 the Bács-Kiskun County Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The Regional Court, while upholding the discontinuation of the proceedings, quashed the reasoning of the first-instance decision on the ground that it had constituted a pre-judgment of the case in breach of Article 10 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', 'The Regional Court held that the original charges laid by the applicant, namely those of ill-treatment and of light bodily assault, concerned one and the same event. His charge of ill-treatment was to be pursued in public prosecution proceedings but the relevant investigation had been discontinued and no indictment had been brought against the police officers on this account. In the instant private prosecution proceedings, however, the unlawful origins of the injuries inflicted in the context of the police action against him could not be established. A decision on this question having been a pre-requisite of examining the merits of the charge of light bodily assault, the proceedings were without an object.', 'f. Criminal proceedings against the applicant', 'Shortly after the events of 29 April 1995 the Head of the Kunszentmiklós Police instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant, charging him with having violently hindered the arrest of Mr. R. Subsequently the Branch Office prosecuted the applicant on account of the offence of violence against persons acting in official capacity.', 'On 30 April 1995 an investigator of the Branch Office heard the applicant as defendant concerning the circumstances of his arrest the day before. On this occasion the applicant did not allege that, subsequent to his arrest, he had been ill-treated at the police station.', 'On 3 May 1995 the Branch Office heard Police Officer R. and Mr. S., the civil guard involved in the events of 29 April 1995. Police Officer R. who stated that the applicant’s injuries had been due solely to the struggle in the context of his arrest. Mr. S. stated that, when handcuffed, the applicant had already had some abrasions on the face and that between the applicant’s arrival at the police station and his own departure therefrom at about 8 p.m. he had witnessed no ill-treatment of the applicant.', 'On 11 May 1995 the applicant was heard again in the presence of his lawyer. On this occasion the applicant stated that during the drive from the premises of his arrest to the police station, Police Officer F. had hit him once in the stomach, and that on his arrival at the police station, the police officer had poured some water on him. When in the building, Police Officer R. had sprayed some tear-gas in his eyes and then together with Police Officer F. he had started to hit and kick him. Subsequently he had been forced to wash himself. In a few minutes Dr. F. had arrived who had not examined him, but had had a look at his face and had stated that the wound over his eye needed to be sutured. After the doctor’s departure, Police Officer S. had kept on kicking him.', 'Also on 11 May 1995 the Branch Office heard Dr. F. who stated that when he had examined the applicant on 29 April 1995 between approximately 8 p.m. and 10 p.m., the latter had made no reference to any ill-treatment suffered at the police station. Dr. F. also stated that when having examined the applicant, he had observed no trace of wetness on the applicant’s clothes, neither had he seen any sign of a conjunctivitis due to contamination by tear-gas.', 'Moreover, on 11 and 26 May and 15 June 1995 four relatives of Mr. R. were heard as eye-witnesses. These persons stated that, when arrested in front of his house on 29 April, the applicant had not had any injuries.', 'On 11 August 1995 the Branch Office heard Police Officer O. who had arrived on the premises of the applicant’s arrest upon the call for back-up. He reinforced the above testimonies of Police Officer R. and Mr. S. and stated that, when handcuffed, the applicant had already had some bleeding injuries on the face.', 'On 26, 27 and 28 August, 30 September, 7 and 28 November 1997 the Kecskemét District Court held hearings in the case. When heard as a witness on 27 August 1997, Dr. F. stated that in his view the applicant’s injuries had been inflicted before he had first seen him on 29 April 1995, rather than during the interval between this inspection and the examination at about 10 p.m. Moreover, when heard as a witness on 28 August 1997, the author of the forensic medical opinion of 28 May 1995 sustained his earlier opinion in the sense that from a medical aspect it could neither be verified nor excluded that the applicant’s injuries had been due to punches.', 'On 28 November 1997 the Kecskemét District Court convicted the applicant of the offences of violence against persons acting in official capacity and of light bodily assault. It sentenced the applicant to one year’s imprisonment, the execution of which was suspended for three years. As to the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment, the District Court noted that thirteen counts of his fifteen injuries were due to the struggle in the context of his arrest, whereas the cause for the remaining two injuries, namely a wound on his right eyelid and an abrasion on the left side of his forehead, remained unclear. Since, however, the medical reports had identified no injuries typical of physical abuse and no other evidence had emerged in support of the applicant’s allegations, the District Court found them unsubstantiated.', 'On 29 June 1998 the Bács-Kiskun County Regional Court upheld the first-instance judgment, while reducing the probationary period to one year.', 'B.

He was represented before the Court by Ms Y. Aslan, a lawyer practising in Manchester.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicant was convicted on 13 March 1998 of murdering a man in a night club in Birmingham the previous July. He was also convicted of robbery and possession of a firearm with intent. The trial judge sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder, with a recommended minimum term of 17 years. For the two other offences he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 15 years and 7 years respectively, to run concurrently. The Lord Chief Justice subsequently recommended a minimum term (“tariff”) of 17-18 years. In February 1999, the Secretary of State notified a tariff of 20 years to the applicant.', 'Subsequent to the enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the applicant applied to the High Court in February 2004 for the setting of a tariff in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 22 of the Act (see under “Relevant domestic law” below). On 6 May 2004, his solicitors submitted representations for a reduction of three years in the applicant’s tariff. On 30 June 2004, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was requested to seek the views of the victim’s family on the applicant’s request for a review of his tariff. The CPS being unable to assist, it was decided in September 2004 to enlist the help of Victim Liaison Officers in the Probation Service to contact the families of victims. On 11 March 2005, the Victim Liaison Officer for the West Midlands indicated that the victim’s family had not responded to the request for their views on the matter.', 'During 2004, the case of R(Hammond) v. Home Secretary was under consideration by the Divisional Court, which was asked to rule on whether the relevant provisions of Schedule 22 were to be construed as allowing for an oral hearing. In its decision of 25 November 2004, the Divisional Court ruled that an oral hearing was permissible in appropriate circumstances. This ruling was subsequently confirmed by the House of Lords. According to the Government, it was not considered appropriate to process any applications for review under Schedule 22 until the question of oral hearings had been dealt with. Once the Divisional Court had determined the issue, all prisoners in the High Court’s database received a letter inviting their views on the need for an oral hearing in their case. Such a letter was sent to the applicant on 6 December 2004, eliciting a reply on 6 January 2005.', 'The procedure therefore only began to operate in early 2005, at which point, according to the Government, there were more than 1,100 cases pending. This number included applications from prisoners whose tariff had been set by the Home Secretary, and from prisoners in respect of whom no tariff had yet been set.', 'In November 2006, the Courts Service, in answer to a letter from the applicant’s solicitor enquiring about the delay in dealing with his case, apologised for the situation and explained that in view of the great number of such applications pending before the High Court, priority was being given to cases in which the tariff would expire in 2010.', 'On 1 August 2008, the High Court (Mr Justice Grigson) rejected the applicant’s application. He concluded that the minimum period of 20 years notified by the Secretary of State could not be said to be manifestly excessive and so would not be reduced, apart from the period the applicant had spent in custody on remand (7 months and 15 days).', 'Following the Court’s judgment in the case of Stafford v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 46295/99, ECHR 2002IV, Parliament adopted the Criminal Justice Act 2003. Schedule 22 of the Act sets out a procedure whereby a prisoner who received a mandatory life sentence before the date the Act entered into force (18 December 2003) and who was notified by the Secretary of State of the minimum term to be served may apply to the High Court for a review of that tariff.

They are represented before the Court by Mr J.J. Eizenga, a lawyer practising in ‘s-Hertogenbosch.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 7 May 1985, the first applicant married Mr Castelo Antonio in a traditional ceremony in Angola. They had three children, Engrazia Maya Antonio (born in 1984), Manuel Jacinto Antonio (born in 1986) and the second applicant.', 'In 1993, Mr Castelo Antonio fled from Angola to the Netherlands, where he applied for asylum. He was eventually granted a residence permit on grounds of a policy of tolerance (gedoogdenbeleid), i.e. where expulsion would entail undue hardship given the general situation in the country of origin. The first applicant and the three children continued to live in Luanda (Angola).', 'On 15 February 1999, the two applicants travelled from Angola to Portugal for which country they had obtained an entry visa. On 27 February 1999, they travelled from Portugal to the Netherlands, where on 5 March 1999 they applied for asylum. The two other children, Engrazia and Manuel, remained in Luanda in the care of a friend. When interviewed on 5 March 1999 by a Netherlands immigration official on the reasons for her asylum request, the first applicant stated that she had applied for asylum in the Netherlands because her husband was living there, of which fact she had become aware in 1998.', 'On 9 March 1999, the Netherlands Government requested that Portugal accept responsibility for the applicants’ asylum request pursuant to the Dublin Convention. On 5 April 1999, the Portuguese authorities accepted that responsibility. The Netherlands Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) subsequently declared inadmissible the applicants’ asylum request. The applicants’ appeal was rejected in a final decision taken by the Hague Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) on 22 October 1999.', 'In the meantime, on 19 April 1999, the first applicant applied for a residence permit to stay with her husband. She also made this application on behalf of the second applicant. Holding that the first applicant had not established the existence of a legally valid marriage with Mr Castelo Antonio by way of authenticated official documents, and that Mr Castelo Antonio did not comply with the minimum income requirement under the applicable immigration rules (i.e. the equivalent of 956.97 euros per month), the Deputy Minister of Justice rejected this request on 22 September 1999 and issued an order for the applicants’ expulsion.', 'On 23 September 1999, the first applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against this decision with the Deputy Minister and, on the same day, requested the President of the Hague Regional Court to issue an interim measure to the effect that she would not be expelled pending the proceedings on her objection.', 'On 14 December 1999, Mr Castelo Antonio was granted Netherlands nationality.', 'On 11 January 2001, considering that the Deputy Minister had considerably exceeded the statutory time-limit for determining the applicant’s objection, and thus apparently attached no great importance to an expulsion at short notice, the President of the Hague Regional Court granted the interim measure requested by the first applicant.', 'On 1 June 2001, the Deputy Minister of Justice withdrew the policy decision in force since 20 August 1998 to stay expulsions to Angola given the general situation there. The decision to withdraw this moratorium was based on the official reports (ambtsberichten) of 26 June 2000 and 4 May 2001 of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to which the general situation in Angola had improved.', 'According to a further official report of 27 August 2002 of the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the security situation in Angola had considerably improved since 4 April 2002 when the warring Angolan Government forces and the UNITA rebel forces signed an official ceasefire agreement in the form of a Memorandum of Understanding in order to pave the way for further negotiations on a political level. The report stated that both the Government and UNITA forces respected the ceasefire agreement. However, some incidents of armed plundering, mostly caused by hungry former UNITA fighters, had still occurred, which incidents could not always be effectively countered by the Angolan police forces. Certain former unsafe areas could therefore not yet be classified as secure. Areas now classified as safe were the capital Luanda, the coastal areas of the provinces Namibe, Benguela, Kwanza Sul and Cabinda, and all the provincial capitals.', 'On 23 October 2001, the applicant was heard on her objection before an official committee (ambtelijke commissie). On 30 November 2001, the Deputy Minister of Justice rejected the applicant’s objection and ordered her expulsion from the Netherlands. On 11 December 2001, the first applicant filed an appeal (beroep) against this decision with the Hague Regional Court and, on the same day, requested the President of the Hague Regional Court to issue an interim measure allowing her to remain in the Netherlands pending the proceedings on her appeal.', 'In its decision of 14 March 2003, following a hearing held on 31 January 2003, the Hague Regional Court sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch rejected the first applicant’s appeal (beroep) against the decision of 30 November 2001.', 'It noted at the outset that the first applicant had failed to substantiate her marriage with Mr Castelo Antonio with authenticated documents. It further noted that, pursuant to the applicable statutory immigration rules and the pertaining immigration policy guidelines, it was a material condition for the admission of foreign spouses that the existence of a marriage be shown by official and authenticated documents.', 'As the first applicant had failed to submit such documents and had failed to undertake any attempts to contact her parents, other relatives or the (local) authorities in Angola in order to obtain official and authenticated documents proving her marriage with Mr Castelo Antonio, the Regional Court concluded that the Deputy Minister had correctly rejected the first applicant’s request for a residence permit on the grounds of her purported marriage. This finding was not altered by the recording of her marital status, on the basis of an affidavit given by the first applicant, in the municipal personal records database (gemeentelijke basisadministratie) of the town where she lived in the Netherlands, as the statutory provisions on such municipal databases could not be regarded as a specific regulation aimed at implementing statutory immigration rules.', 'Insofar as the first applicant complained that the refusal to grant her a residence permit was contrary to her rights under Article 8 of the Convention, the Regional Court held:', '“It is not disputed that in casu there is family life within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention between [the first applicant], her (purported) spouse Castelo Antonio and their daughter, Maria Janete Antonio.', 'The [Deputy Minister] has correctly considered that there has been no interference as to the right to respect for family life as meant by Article 8 of the Convention as the refusal to allow residence [in the Netherlands] did not entail depriving [the first applicant] of a residence title enabling her to enjoy family life.', 'The question thus arises whether there are facts and circumstances of such a nature that the right to respect for family life would give rise to a positive obligation for the [Deputy Minister] nevertheless to grant [the first applicant] residence [in the Netherlands]. In order to answer that question, the interests of the [Deputy Minister] must be balanced against the interests of [the first applicant]. It is of primary importance to attain a “fair balance” between those interests, in which the [Deputy Minister] enjoys a certain margin of appreciation. An important aspect of this balancing of interests is the question whether it is possible to exercise family life in the country of origin.', 'The Regional Court is of the opinion that the [Deputy Minister] could find in all reasonableness that the [first applicant’s] interests did not outweigh the general interest. In this finding it is important that neither for [the first applicant] nor for the other members of her family are there any objective obstacles to the exercise of family life outside the Netherlands or in Angola, the [first applicant’s] country of origin. In this connection it is equally relevant that the (purported) spouse of [the first applicant], who has not been admitted to the Netherlands as a refugee, also originates from that country. Noting the official reports (ambtsberichten) of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of 26 June 2000 and 4 May 2001, the situation in Angola also does not form an obstacle.', 'As to the [first applicant’s] argument, based on the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights of 2 August 2001 ... (Boultif v. Switzerland) ..., that in her case it should also be examined whether in all reasonableness it can be expected from her husband, in view of his Netherlands nationality, that he returns to Angola or goes [with her] to Portugal, the Regional Court considers that it can in all reasonableness be expected of the (purported) spouse that he returns to Angola or goes [with the first applicant] to Portugal to exercise family life there in view of the fact that he (originally) comes from Angola and that no objective obstacle has become apparent. Also the health problems advanced by [the first applicant] do not necessarily constitute an obstacle to the exercise of family life outside the Netherlands or in the country of origin as the family’s separation was [partly] the cause of the [first applicant’s] health problems. Furthermore, two children of the family still reside in Angola. Also on that ground, the Regional Court fails to see why family life could not be exercised there.', 'In view of the above considerations, the Regional Court is of the opinion that the [Deputy Minister} could in all reasonableness conclude that there was no positive obligation to grant [the first applicant] residence in the Netherlands on the grounds of Article 8 of the Convention.”', 'On 14 March 2003, the provisional measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Hague Regional Court sitting in ‘sHertogenbosch rejected the first applicant’s request for an interim measure as her appeal against the decision of 30 November 2001 had been rejected by the Hague Regional Court.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The company is licensed to trade in certain specified military equipment. By Government decision of 30 November 1995, the company was granted a licence, valid until 30 November 2000, to trade in, inter alia, salvage vehicles and amphibious crafts.', 'It appears that the company bought some military equipment, including armoured vehicles, in the United Kingdom which were not covered by the above licence. Subsequently, after that purchase, the company requested that the licence be extended to cover, inter alia, armoured vehicles.', ""On 26 June 1996 the company's request for an extended licence was rejected by the National Inspectorate of Strategic Products (Inspektionen för strategiska produkter; hereinafter “the Inspectorate”). The Inspectorate stated that licences are given on a very restrictive basis and that it did not find any reason to extend the company's existing licence. On 27 November 1996 the Inspectorate rejected, with the same reasons, a renewed application from the company. No appeal lay against the Inspectorate's decisions."", 'B. Relevant domestic law', 'Chapter 2, Section 20, sub-section 1 of the Instrument of Government (regerings-formen) provides that restrictions may be introduced in the right to trade or practise a profession only in order to protect significant public interests and never solely in order to further the financial interests of particular persons or firms.', 'The 1992 Military Equipment Act (lagen om krigsmateriel; hereinafter “1992 Act”) regulates activities which involve, inter alia, the manufacture, supply and export of military equipment. Thus, the Act covers weapons, ammunition and other equipment designed for military use, which constitute military equipment according to regulations issued by the Government. Such regulations are found in an annex to the 1992 Military Equipment Ordinance (förordningen om krigsmateriel).', 'According to the 1992 Act, there is a general prohibition against the manufacture, supply and export of military equipment (Sections 3–6). A special permit or licence is required if an exception to the general rule is to be made. Prior to 1996, the Government decided, directly, in all matters concerning, inter alia, the supply of military equipment. Matters of routine character were determined by the responsible minister. As from 1 January 1996, the Inspectorate is the Swedish authority that examines applications for permits under the 1992 Act. However, in cases where the Inspectorate deems a matter under the 1992 Act to be of principle significance or otherwise of special importance, the matter shall be referred to the Government for consideration (Section 1a).', ""Permits under the 1992 Act to manufacture, supply and export military equipment may be granted only if supported by security or defence policy reasons and provided that such permits are not in conflict with Swedish foreign policy (Section 1). In the travaux préparatoires to the Act (cf. Government Bill 1991/92 No. 174), directives were given on how to apply this rule. The Government's earlier decisions in similar matters would serve as guidance in the examination of other, future cases and thus be taken into account by the Inspectorate in its application of the Act. According to the principles thus emanating from the Government's earlier practice, a permit should be granted only if this was necessary for a supply of military equipment and the need for know-how in this area. A further requirement was that the granting of a permit must not be contrary to Swedish foreign policy goals and to the principles on which that policy is based."", 'A permit granted under the 1992 Act may, as a main rule, be cancelled at any point in time if the permit holder has disregarded a regulation contained in the Act, or a regulation, requirement or provision issued under the Act or if there are other special reasons for such a cancellation (Section 16).', 'An appeal against a decision by the Inspectorate to cancel a permit in accordance with Section 16 of the 1992 Act or to determine a fee under its Section 22 may be brought before the administrative courts. An appeal may not be lodged against any other decision by the Inspectorate under the Act (Section 23a).', 'If the Inspectorate has referred a matter to the Government for consideration in accordance with Section 1a of the 1992 Act, an application for judicial review may be lodged with the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten) in accordance with the 1988 Act on Judicial Review of Certain Administrative Decisions (lagen om rättsprövning av vissa förvaltningsbeslut). This is, however, only the case if the Government have decided to cancel a permit to manufacture or to supply military equipment in accordance with Section 3 or 4 of the 1992 Act.', ""The issue of appeal was discussed in connection with the establishment of the Inspectorate (cf. Government Bill 1995/96 No. 31). Considerations pertaining to national defence, security and foreign policy were the only considerations that were deemed relevant and which were to be decisive for the outcome of a permit matter under the 1992 Act. Private interests, such as an applicant company's interest in disposing of its products on the military equipment market, were to be afforded no relevance. The fact that the authority determining a permit matter should not include such interests in its assessment also motivated that it should not be possible to pursue such interests on appeal or in an application for judicial review. The situation was, however, deemed to be different when the cancellation of a permit was at stake. The starting-point here was that the permit holder was entitled to keep the permit. Considerations pertaining to the legal rights of the individual or the individual company in question were deemed to be of more relevance in this context. It was, however, also stressed that the courts could not be expected to make assessments that were of a pronounced political nature (ibid., pp. 34–35).""]",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The latter had refused to sign an order from the prefect, drawn up by Gâtlan, handing over possession of a large piece of land in the border village of Cenad to V.M., a PSD senator ...', 'Deputy prefect Gâtlan whipped D.B. out like a rotten tooth for having the temerity not to put his name to the illegal appropriation of the land by the senator and his pack of hounds. He did not rest until D.B. had been removed from any outfit even remotely concerned with the restitution of land ...', 'But don’t be fooled into thinking that Dorel Gâtlan doesn’t have problems of his own. He has two major problems. The first concerns the land he inherited from his daddy in the village of Cernăteaz. Roughly 17 hectares of marshland ... Given the pitiable state of his inheritance, Mr Gâtlan has his eye on a roadside property in the municipality of Gearmata. Unfortunately for him, the mayor of Gearmata, who chairs the local committee on implementation of the Real Property Act, is against the exchange of the two pieces of land. Without further ado, Gâtlan suspends him from his post and hands him over to the police, who open two criminal investigations against him ... It should be noted that in Romania dealings in real property are coordinated, by law, by the prefects. However, in Timiş county, the deputy prefect has long since supplanted the prefect by stripping him of all his powers.', 'Gâtlan’s biggest personal problem arose on 1 January 1998, when he fatally injured the septuagenarian C.M. in an accident. The victim was a shop caretaker ... His executioner, who at the time was sales director of the S.C. Radiotel Timişoara company, was driving under the influence of recent New Year’s Eve Bacchanalian celebrations. The victim was small and thin. The impact was so sudden and so violent that the bonnet and windscreen of the executioner’s car were smashed to pieces. The victim’s internal organs, also in pieces, were scattered over a radius of a hundred metres. Gâtlan’s friends in the police said that the executioner’s car had been travelling at only 40 km.p.h. Unfortunately for Gâtlan, the victim’s soninlaw is the university lecturer Dr V.B. ...', 'Initially, Gâtlan obtained a ruling that there was no case to answer, and the case was closed. However, Dr V.B. subsequently sent a memorandum to the Procurator-General of Romania and the case was reopened. Sickened by the machinations of those in power, whose excesses are such that the PSD’s exploits in Timiş county surpass even those in the capital, V.B. dismissed his lawyer and lost the case following an appeal by Gâtlan. The executioner was merely ordered to pay the victim’s family 20,000,000 lei in damages. V.B. then made one last-ditch attempt to get rid of Gâtlan. Shortly before the appointment of the prefects and deputy prefects, he tried desperately to alert the Civil Service Minister and the Prime Minister to the fact that Gâtlan was not fit for the job of deputy prefect, as he was guilty of killing through negligence.', 'But the die has already been cast. The person pulling strings to have Gâtlan appointed is the current Minister of Agriculture, I.S. At first, V.B.’s case had been backed up to prime ministerial level by his colleague P.A., PSD member of parliament for Timiş county and a university lecturer. But, under pressure from the rector of Timişoara Polytechnic, a leading PSD member, V.B. was forced to drop the case unconditionally and hold his tongue. The same sources say that the rector himself had come under intense pressure from I.S. [the Minister of Agriculture] to persuade V.B. to drop his complaint against Gâtlan. And Gâtlan, by way of thanks for being found not guilty and having his reputation restored vis-à-vis his superiors, never made any apology, not even a purely formal one, to the victim’s family.', 'Our readers are no doubt well aware that Gâtlan is the most ardent supporter of I.S.’s election to the chair of the PSD county branch.”', 'On 25 September 2001 Mr Gâtlan lodged a criminal complaint with the Timişoara Court of First Instance, alleging that the applicant had made several defamatory and insulting statements in his article, in breach of Articles 205 and 206 of the Criminal Code. He also applied to be joined as a civil party to the proceedings against the applicant and the weekly review Academia Caţavencu, the party with civil liability.', 'Although the applicant was summoned to appear and a warrant was issued for him to be brought immediately before the court, he did not attend any court hearing, nor did he produce any evidence in his defence.', 'In a judgment of 6 March 2002, the court rejected the criminal complaint on the ground that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant had published the article with the intention of insulting or defaming the complainant. The court therefore acquitted the applicant, finding that one of the elements constituting the offences of insult and defamation was lacking, namely intent.', 'However, the court observed that the applicant had accused the complainant of causing a road traffic accident by driving under the influence of alcohol and of unfairly dismissing the secretary-general of the prefect’s office and the mayor of a municipality. The court considered that those assertions were inaccurate, since the courts which had tried Mr Gâtlan on a charge of manslaughter had not found him guilty of driving under the influence of alcohol. It also observed that the two persons referred to above had been removed from office by order of the prefect, and that there was nothing to suggest that the complainant had influenced the decisions in any way.', 'In view of the circumstances, the court found that the complainant should be awarded damages since, while the offences of which the applicant stood accused did not fall within the sphere of criminal law, they were such as to render him liable in tort, as he had not checked thoroughly the facts set out in his article. Accordingly, under Articles 998 and 999 of the Civil Code, the court ordered the applicant and the weekly review jointly and severally to pay the complainant 5,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL) in respect of the non-pecuniary damage sustained.', 'The applicant, the weekly review Academia Caţavencu and the complainant all lodged appeals against the judgment with the Timiş County Court. The applicant appealed against the award of compensation for nonpecuniary damage, arguing that the complainant had not proved the existence of such damage. The complainant, for his part, requested that the applicant be convicted of insult and defamation and that the amount of compensation be increased.', 'On 7 June 2002 the court allowed the request for an adjournment lodged by the applicant’s lawyer. At a hearing on 3 July 2002, the applicant’s lawyer raised an objection of unconstitutionality in respect of the first two paragraphs of Article 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and requested the court to stay its decision on the merits and to refer the case to the Constitutional Court. He argued in particular that, for a criminal court to decide on a claim for damages without the civil party having paid stamp duty, when the defendant had been acquitted, was in breach of the constitutional principles of protection of private property and prohibition of discrimination with regard to the payment of taxes and levies. The applicant’s lawyer alleged that the exemption from stamp duty gave the civil party an unfair advantage over individuals who, in order to have access to a civil court, had to pay stamp duty in proportion to the amount being claimed.', 'On 8 July 2002, under the third and sixth paragraphs of section 23 of the Constitutional Court (Organisation and Operation) Act (Law no. 47/1992), the court declared the objection inadmissible on the ground that the Constitutional Court had already ruled several times, notably on 2 December 1997, 3 February 1998 and 1 February and 23 May 2001, on the constitutionality of the Article in question, and had found it to be compatible with the Constitution.', 'On 19 November 2002 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a memorial with the registry of the County Court, objecting that the first and sixth paragraphs of section 23 of Law no. 47/1992 were in breach of the Constitution. He submitted that the condition laid down in the first paragraph of the section in question for the referral of an objection to the Constitutional Court, namely that the provision in issue must be decisive for the outcome of the case, allowed the courts a margin of appreciation and was therefore contrary to the constitutional principle of free access to a court. Pointing out that the third paragraph of the section in question ruled out referral to the Constitutional Court only of objections relating to provisions which had already been found to be unconstitutional, the lawyer concluded that the court should have referred his first objection to the Constitutional Court.', 'On 20 November 2002 the court observed that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had attended any hearings, although the applicant had been repeatedly given notice to appear. The court dismissed the objection of unconstitutionality raised the previous day, finding that it had already been examined at the hearing of 3 July 2002.', 'The hearing was held the same day and, in a fresh decision on the merits, the court allowed the complainant’s appeal and ordered the applicant to pay a criminal fine of ROL 500,000 for insult and defamation. It also ordered him, jointly and severally with the weekly review, to pay the complainant ROL 10,000,000 in compensation for the nonpecuniary damage sustained.', 'The court found that the assertions concerning the removal from office of the mayor of a municipality and the complainant’s having driven while under the influence of alcohol had been defamatory, since they had lacked any factual basis and even the most cursory checking of the facts by the applicant would have revealed the truth. In that connection, the court pointed out that the mayor in question had been removed from office by an order of the prefect dated 30 March 2001, published in July 2001, and that the Timişoara Court of Appeal, in a final judgment of 8 November 2000, had found the complainant not guilty in relation to the road traffic accident, taking the view that the victim had been entirely at fault, having crossed the road without due care and attention.', 'In the circumstances, the court found that the use of the term “executioner” had been insulting.', 'In a dissenting opinion, one of the judges took the view that the applicant should have been acquitted, as account should have been taken of the fact that the weekly review Academia Caţavencu had a reputation as a satirical publication which made frequent revelations concerning the professional and private conduct of politicians. He added that the complainant could have obtained satisfaction by making use of his right of reply.', '“Any attack on an individual’s honour and reputation through words, gestures or other means shall be punishable by a prison sentence of between one month and two years or by payment of a fine.”', '“Any public statement or allegation concerning an individual which, if true, would render that individual liable to a criminal, administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose him or her to public opprobrium, shall be punishable by a prison sentence of between three months and one year or by payment of a fine.”', '“Evidence of the truth of such a statement or allegation shall be admissible where it was made in order to protect a legitimate interest.

001-61755,ENG,NLD,CHAMBER,2004,CASE OF BRAND v. THE NETHERLANDS,2,Violation of Art. 5-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,,"['9. The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Eindhoven.', '10. On 23 June 1994 the ’s-Hertogenbosch Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) convicted the applicant of participation in robbery with violence resulting in grievous bodily harm and sentenced him to fifteen months’ imprisonment, with deduction of the time spent in pre-trial detention. In addition, having found that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder and was dangerous, the Regional Court further ordered the applicant’s confinement in a custodial clinic (hereafter a “TBS order” - terbeschikkingstelling met bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege).', '11. On 10 October 1994, when the applicant had served his prison sentence, the TBS order took effect. However, the applicant was not transferred to a custodial clinic as there were no places available. He therefore remained in pre-placement detention in the ’sHertogenbosch ordinary remand centre.', '12. In order to expedite his admission to a custodial clinic, the applicant instituted summary civil proceedings (kort geding) against the Netherlands State. He withdrew these summary proceedings after his transfer to a custodial clinic in Nijmegen on 28 December 1995.', '13. On 8 February 1996 the applicant took civil proceedings against the Netherlands State before the Hague Regional Court, claiming compensation in tort (onrechtmatige daad) in an amount of 29,200 Netherlands guilders (NLG), i.e. NLG 50 for each day during the first ten months of his pre-placement detention after 10 October 1994 pending transfer to a custodial clinic and NLG 100 for each subsequent day until 28 December 1995.', '14. In its judgment of 24 July 1996 the Regional Court held that a delay of six months was acceptable for a transfer to a custodial clinic and that the Netherlands State had only acted unlawfully in so far as this delay had exceeded six months. It awarded the applicant compensation in the amount of NLG 50 for each day spent in pre-placement detention between 6 and 10 months after 10 October 1994 and NLG 100 for each subsequent day until 28 December 1995, i.e. a total amount of NLG 20,100. It rejected the applicant’s claim for the remainder.', '15. The Netherlands State filed an appeal with the Hague Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof). The applicant filed a cross-appeal (incidenteel beroep) in which he reduced his claim for damages to NLG 24,900 in that he no longer sought compensation for the first three months of his pre-placement detention, i.e. the period between 10 October 1994 and 28 December 1995.', '16. In its judgment of 20 March 1997 the Court of Appeal rejected the principal appeal filed by the Netherlands State. It did, however, quash the judgment of 24 July 1996 on the basis of the cross-appeal filed by the applicant in so far as the applicant’s claims in excess of NLG 20,100 had been dismissed in this judgment. It ordered the Netherlands State to pay a further amount of NLG 4,800 to the applicant. The Netherlands State filed an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad).', '17. On 5 June 1998 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 20 March 1997 and referred the case back to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. It held, inter alia:', '“3.3 Article 9 § 1 (b) of the [1951] Prisons Act (Beginselenwet Gevangeniswezen) reads:', '‘Remand centres are intended: (b) for the accommodation of all others lawfully deprived of their liberty by a judicial decision, court order or public authority, in so far as there is no other suitable place for their accommodation or for as long as admission to another suitable place is not possible.’', 'The point of departure for the examination ... must therefore be that the [applicant’s] continued stay in the remand centre ‘for as long as admission to another suitable place is not possible’ is in principle lawful as being based on the law. Moreover, the parties and the Court of Appeal have taken this approach.', 'However, where it can no longer reasonably be held that the failure to admit a person to a custodial clinic is justified by the circumstances, the continuation of detention in the remand centre must be regarded as unlawful (Supreme Court, 28 June 1963, Nederlandse Jurisprudentie 1963, 480). Also, the parties and the Court of Appeal have taken this as their point of departure. Part 1 [of the cassation complaint] thus lacks a factual basis.', '3.4.1 The Court of Appeal, faced with the question from what moment the situation referred to in the last paragraph of 3.3 arises, has held that ‘apart from exceptional circumstances, the stay of a [person awaiting admission to a custodial clinic] should not exceed three months’ and, further, that, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, the [applicant’s] stay in the ’s-Hertogenbosch remand centre was unlawful after a period of three months had elapsed. Parts 2-9 [of the cassation complaint] are directed against these findings and the reasons given by the Court of Appeal.', '3.4.2 In the examination of these parts, it must be stated in the first place that the impugned findings of the Court of Appeal concern a situation prior to the entry into force of Article 12 of the Act on confinement to a custodial clinic of persons subject to a TBS order (Beginselenwet verpleging ter beschikking gestelden). ... this provision entered into force on 11 July 1997. The Supreme Court’s considerations hereafter will thus address the legal situation until 11 July 1997.', '3.4.3 In 1963 the Minister of Justice gave an undertaking to the Upper House of Parliament that the admission to a custodial clinic of persons in respect of whom a TBS order had been given and in respect of whom a custodial clinic had been selected would be carried out within eight weeks after the TBS order had taken effect. ...', 'In a letter to the Lower House of Parliament of 3 June 1986, the State Secretary of Justice ... stated that she was unable to maintain this undertaking, given the growth in waiting lists.', 'Article 12 of the Act on confinement to a custodial clinic of persons subject to a TBS order reads:', '‘1. The admission [to a custodial clinic] of a person in respect of whom a TBS order has been issued takes place within a period of six months after the date on which the TBS order has become effective.', '2. When Our Minister, taking account of the requirements mentioned in Article 11 § 2 [of this Act], considers that admission is not possible within the period set out in the first paragraph, he may extend this period by three months each time.', '3. A decision to extend within the meaning of the second paragraph shall be equated to a refusal to decide within the period mentioned in the first paragraph.’', 'In the Explanatory Memorandum to this Article it is stated, inter alia:', '‘... in the proposed first paragraph of Article 12 a time-limit of six months is set out within which the admission must in general be carried out. This time-limit has been chosen on the basis of the fact that, in addition to the previously accepted guideline for a maximum duration for a TBS admission of twelve weeks, the time needed for the selection examination, the consultation with the envisaged institution of admission and the decision-making at the Ministry must also be taken into consideration.', 'In 1986 my predecessor abandoned the above-mentioned time-limit of twelve weeks since, as a result of the lack of capacity of the custodial clinics including the [forensic psychiatric observation] Dr F.S. Meijers Institute, this time-limit could no longer be observed.', 'It cannot be expected for a foreseeable time that all persons in respect of whom a TBS order has been issued can be admitted to the custodial clinic selected for them within the stated time-limit. The proposed second paragraph of Article 12 therefore opens the possibility of an extension of the six-month period by three months each time.’', '3.4.4 The following must be derived from the statements of the Minister and the State Secretary of Justice. After 1963 the Government apparently assumed that the undertaking made in 1963 concerned the time needed for selection and admission of persons awaiting admission to a custodial clinic and that this period would not exceed a maximum of twelve weeks. The State Secretary ‘abandoned’ this undertaking in 1986 on grounds of ‘the lack of capacity of the custodial clinics, including the Dr F.S. Meijers Institute’. It follows from this that, where the above-mentioned lack of capacity is not taken into consideration, the point of departure is that the procedure of selection and admission of persons subject to a TBS order does not, in principle, need to take more than three months. The consequences of this lack of capacity and other circumstances that might influence the delay in admission will be addressed in considerations nos. 3.4.5 – 3.4.10.', 'In the light of the presupposed standard in 3.3 it cannot be said, however, that the mere exceeding of the three-month time-limit in itself renders a lawful detention in a remand centre unlawful under Article 9 § 1 (b) of the [1951] Prisons Act. This situation only arises where it can no longer reasonably be held that the failure to admit a person to a custodial clinic remains to be justified by the circumstances. Only then can it be said that, although there is a legal basis for the continued detention in a remand centre of a person subject to a TBS order, the further duration of that detention is contrary to what is fitting conduct in society according to unwritten (customary) law (in strijd is met hetgeen volgens ongeschreven recht in het maatschappelijk verkeer betaamt).', '3.4.5 For cases like the present one, this unwritten law is as follows.', 'It must be stated first that the TBS order in cases like the present one starts to run from the date of early release and that the Minister of Justice, pursuant to Article 4 of the TBS Execution Rules (Reglement tenuitvoerlegging TBS) (as in force until 2 October 1997), had to decide ‘as soon as possible on the admission to a custodial clinic intended to execute the confinement order’. This did not, however, mean that the Minister of Justice was obliged to ensure that the required capacity for persons subject to a TBS order was available at any given point in time. A certain friction between available and required capacity is indeed acceptable from the point of view of efficient expenditure of financial resources. It has already become clear in 3.4.3 that the Minister of Justice, when he allowed a delay of twelve weeks in 1963, took into account beforehand the fact that this delay would not be sufficient in all cases.', 'It further needs to be noted that Article 12 of the Act on confinement to a custodial clinic of persons subject to a TBS order entered into force on 11 July 1997. In this provision, identical wording to which was already included in the Bill submitted on 12 October 1993, the point of departure is an admission delay, continuously subject to extension, of six months. The views of the Government and Parliament during the history of the adoption of the aforementioned Act are relevant to the examination of the question as to the period of delay in a remand centre awaiting admission to a custodial clinic intended for the person concerned which can be considered, in general, justified by the circumstances and thus acceptable in society.', 'Noting the above, and with due regard for the considerations set out in 3.4.4, the Supreme Court is of the opinion that, after the end of the prison sentence, the preplacement detention in a remand centre for a period of six months of a person subject to a TBS order awaiting admission to a custodial clinic intended for him cannot be regarded as unlawful. A period longer than six months would be unlawful, unless there were special circumstances, as referred to in 3.4.7 below.', '3.4.6', '3.4.7 In part 6 [of the grounds of appeal in cassation] the complaint is made that the Court of Appeal has not accepted that it is incompatible with the standard given in the Supreme Court’s judgment of 28 June 1963 (NJ 1963, 480) that a distinction be made between general circumstances, which could be relevant for a waiting period for admission to a custodial clinic of three months, and special circumstances which could be relevant for the period after three months. ...', 'The complaint fails. Only on grounds of special circumstances to be submitted by the State and in the event of a proven dispute relating to the person concerned and/or the State – such as, for instance, incidental and serious friction between available and required capacity for persons subject to a TBS order – can the exceeding of the maximum duration of an admission delay be justified.', '3.4.8', '3.4.9', '3.4.10 Since the State has not adduced any of the special circumstances referred to in 3.4.7, it follows from the foregoing that the detention of [the applicant] in the ’s-Hertogenbosch remand centre must be considered unlawful from the moment when a period of six months had passed following the beginning of his stay there awaiting admission [to a custodial clinic].', '3.4.11', '3.4.12 The complaint set out in part 10 [of the grounds of appeal in cassation] about the reasons [given by the Court of Appeal for rejecting the State’s argument in relation to the determination by the Regional Court of the amount of compensation of respectively NLG 50 and NLG 100 per day] is well–founded. The State has disputed ... on grounds that cannot immediately be refuted that the end date of the TBS would change when the starting date had been postponed. By ignoring this, the Court of Appeal has not given sufficient reasons for its impugned finding.', '3.4.13 Part 10 further contains a complaint that the Court of Appeal has used an incorrect standard in the determination of compensation by assuming that the stay of [the applicant] in the remand centre can at best be compared to the case of a suspect who has spent more time in pre-trial detention than was justified. This complaint is also well–founded. The unlawfulness of detention in a remand centre after six months does not arise from the continued deprivation of liberty but from the failure to start treatment in a timely manner in a custodial clinic intended for this purpose. The comparison used by the Court of Appeal does not fit the nature of this form of unlawfulness and the non-pecuniary damage resulting therefrom', '18. On 10 January 1999 the TBS order against the applicant expired. The public prosecutor had not sought a prolongation of the order.', '19. In a judgment of 25 February 1999 the Amsterdam Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Hague Regional Court of 24 July 1996 in so far as it had awarded compensation to the applicant in an amount of NLG 20,100. It awarded the applicant compensation in an amount of NLG 11,250, rejected the rest of his claim and upheld the remainder of the judgment of 24 July 1996.', '20. The Amsterdam Court of Appeal found it established that the delay in the admission of the applicant to a custodial clinic constituted an unlawful act in so far as this delay had exceeded a period of six months. It held that the applicant had been unable to demonstrate that there were special circumstances in his case for holding that a delay of more than three months constituted of itself an unlawful act. It agreed with both parties to the proceedings that it could not be determined what had been, in concrete terms, the effect of the applicant’s lengthy stay in the remand centre on his treatment. Relying on a report of 5 December 1996 by the National Ombudsman, the Court of Appeal further held that no general conclusive findings could be made on that issue. It did not find it established that, in the applicant’s case, the delay in admission had had a major and serious impact on treatment possibilities.', '21’s feelings of uncertainty and frustration. Having found it established that the applicant’s feelings of unrest had become more intense with the passage of time pending admission to a custodial clinic, it further held that he had sustained increasing non-pecuniary damage with the passage of time. As to this aspect, it considered that a three-monthly increase of the basic amount by NLG 250 per month on each occasion was, in the present case, in accordance with the requirements of equitable compensation. It consequently fixed the total amount of compensation at NLG 11,250.', '22. It rejected the applicant’s argument that the compensation should be calculated on a daily basis. The Court of Appeal agreed with the State that the use of a daily compensation amount in cases like the present one, where the unlawfulness did not arise from the deprivation of liberty as such, suggested a degree of precision for which there was no basis in reality.', '23. The relevant provisions of the Netherlands Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht), as in force at the relevant time, read as follows:', '“Article 13', '1. A person sentenced to imprisonment who, on grounds of the inadequate development or pathological disturbance of his mental faculties, is eligible for this, may be placed in a judicial institution (justitiële inrichting) for the treatment (verpleging) of persons subject to a TBS order; in that case Articles 37c, 37d and 37e shall apply by analogy. ...', 'Article 37', '1. The judge may order that a person who, owing to the inadequate development or pathological disturbance of his mental faculties, cannot be held responsible for an offence, shall be committed to a psychiatric hospital (plaatsing in een psychiatrisch ziekenhuis) for a period of one year, but only if he represents a danger to himself, to others, or to the general safety of persons or property. ...', 'Article 37a', '1. The judge may impose a TBS order (terbeschikkingstelling) on a suspect whose mental faculties were inadequately developed or pathologically disturbed at the time of the commission of the offence if:', '1o the offence he has committed is one which, according to its statutory definition, renders offenders liable to a term of imprisonment of four years or more or if the offence is defined in Articles 132, 285 § 1, 318, 326a or 395 of the Criminal Code, Article 175 § 2 of the 1994 Road Traffic Act (Wegenverkeerswet), Article 11 § 2 of the Opium Act (Opiumwet), or Article 432, under 3o, of the Criminal Code, and', '2o the said measure is necessary in the interests of the safety of others or the general safety of persons or property.', '2. In applying paragraph 1, the judge may refrain from imposing a penalty, even if he finds that the suspect may be held criminally responsible for the offence.', '3. In making an order referred to in paragraph 1, the judge shall take account of the statements contained in the reports made concerning the suspect’s personality, and shall take account of the seriousness of the offence committed and the number of previous convictions for indictable offences.', '4. Paragraph 1 of this Article and Article 37 § 1 may be applied in conjunction with regard to the same offence.', 'Article 37b', '1. The judge may order that a person who is subject to a TBS order shall be confined to a custodial clinic (verpleging van overheidswege) if this is necessary in the interests of the safety of others or the general safety of persons or property. ...', 'Article 37c', '1. Treatment shall be provided in custodial clinics for persons subject to TBS orders in accordance with rules to be laid down by Order in Council (algemene maatregel van bestuur).', '2. The Minister of Justice shall ensure that persons subject to TBS orders who are confined to a custodial clinic receive the necessary treatment. In respect of specific patients, the Minister may issue special instructions to the head of the custodial clinic in the interests of the safety of others or the general safety of persons or property.', '3. The rules to be laid down pursuant to paragraph 1 shall make provision for persons subject to TBS orders to appeal against decisions which restrict their freedom of movement or correspondence or their right to receive visitors.', 'Article 37d', '1. Persons subject to TBS orders may be confined to the following institutions, on condition that the institutions have been designated for this purpose by the Minister of Justice:', 'a. private institutions managed by legal persons established in the Netherlands;', 'b. State institutions.', '2. Treatment shall preferably take place in a private institution. ...', 'Article 37e', 'The costs of the confinement of persons subject to TBS orders shall be borne by the State in so far as no other provision is made for them by or pursuant to any Act of Parliament. Rules shall be laid down by Order in Council concerning payment for confinement elsewhere than in State institutions.”', '24. A TBS order with confinement to a custodial clinic is not intended to have a punitive effect, but to protect society from any risk posed by the person concerned. In practice, it is imposed in cases concerning murder, manslaughter, rape and other serious violent crimes or sexual offences. TBS orders are initially imposed for a period of two years and may be prolonged by a judge for further periods of one or two years where the safety of others or the general safety of persons or property so require (Article 38d of the Criminal Code). The total duration of a TBS order may not exceed four years, unless it has been imposed on the ground of an offence directed against, or constituting a danger to, the physical integrity of one or more persons. In the latter case, there is in principle no restriction on the number of extensions that can be granted by a judge (Article 38e of the Criminal Code).', '25. The provisions relating to the proceedings on the extension of a TBS order are set out in Articles 509o – 509x of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering). Article 509o § 1 provides that the public prosecutor’s office (openbaar ministerie) may submit a request (vordering) for the prolongation of a TBS order no sooner than two months and no later than one month before the date on which the order is due to expire. The request must be accompanied by a recent and reasoned recommendation prepared by the custodial clinic where the person concerned is receiving treatment (Article 509o § 2 CCP). The court competent to decide on such a request is the Regional Court that tried the person concerned at first instance for the crime that gave rise to the TBS order (Article 509p).', '26. According to the TBS Execution Rules (Reglement tenuitvoerlegging terbeschikkingstelling; “RTTBS”) as in force at the relevant time, the prosecution department must inform the Minister of Justice as soon as possible of any judicial decision imposing a TBS order with confinement to a custodial clinic (Article 3 RTTBS). Under Article 4 RTTBS, the Minister must decide as soon as possible in which specific custodial clinic the person concerned is to be placed, taking into account the available information on the psychological examination and observation of the person concerned, advice on mental treatment, the case file on the criminal proceedings, the available possibilities for treatment, security requirements and the personal wishes of the person concerned.', '27. The custodial clinics, of which there were seven at the relevant time, are top-security institutions as the persons placed there have been found to pose a great danger to society as well as to themselves. The purpose of treatment provided in these clinics is to reduce this danger and to prevent recidivism. The treatment is geared to individual disorders and personalities and is aimed at helping persons subject to a TBS order to gain insight into and control over their disorders, to make them aware of their responsibilities and to adjust their behaviour accordingly so that they no longer pose a threat to society.', '28. The decision on the selection of the most appropriate custodial clinic – given the differences between the various institutions as regards security levels, patient population (gender, psychiatric diagnosis of the patients and their ability to function in a group setting etc.), methods of treatment and average stay of patients – is in most cases preceded by a seven-week period of psychiatric observation in the Dr F.S. Meijers Institute, a forensic psychiatric observation institution specialised in this field.', '29. The legal basis for pre-placement detention is provided for in Article 9 of the 1951 Prisons Act (Beginselenwet gevangeniswezen). This provision, as in force at the relevant time, reads:', '“Remand centres are intended:', 'a. for the accommodation of those who must undergo punishment by imprisonment or military detention;', 'b. for the accommodation of all others lawfully deprived of their liberty by a judicial decision, court order or public authority, in so far as there is no other place suitable for their accommodation or for as long as their admission to another suitable place is not possible.”', '30. In a judgment given on 28 June 1963 the Supreme Court held that Article 9 § 1 (b) of the 1951 Prisons Act also covered situations in which persons subject to a TBS order entailing confinement to a custodial clinic were detained in a remand centre pending a decision as to the specific custodial clinic in which they were to be placed, and that such a detention in a remand centre was in principle lawful as being based on the law. It did, however, add that it did not follow from this interpretation that such – in principle – lawful detention would remain lawful where it could no longer reasonably be held that the failure to admit the person to a custodial clinic remained justified by the circumstances (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (Netherlands Law Reports) 1963, 480).', '31. In the National Ombudsman’s report no. 96/575 of 5 December 1996, it was stated that, in principle, taking into account the seven-week observation period and a margin of some weeks for the administrative processing of the selection application and the admission procedure, a delay of three months between the date on which a sentenced person became eligible for early release and the date of admission to a custodial clinic was acceptable. Acknowledging that incidental friction between the available and necessary capacity of custodial clinics could not be wholly excluded, the National Ombudsman further held that an additional delay of no longer than three months at the very most might still be acceptable. However, given the responsibility of the Minister of Justice for adequate capacity planning, the Ombudsman did emphasise that reliance on force majeure would only be acceptable if the Minister could demonstrate unforeseen circumstances that indeed rendered a longer period of pre-placement detention unavoidable.', '32. On 1 October 1997 Articles 1–11 and 13–80 of the Act on confinement to a custodial clinic of persons subject to a TBS order (Beginselenwet verpleging ter beschikking gestelden) entered into force. Article 12 of this Act had already entered into force on 11 July 1997.', '33. Article 12 of this Act provides that a person subject to a TBS order must be admitted within six months to a custodial clinic after the TBS order has taken effect. This period can be extended by the Minister of Justice by further periods of three months each time if placement proves impossible.', '34. In the report of 15 July 1993 of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman Treatment (the “CPT”) on its visit to the Netherlands from 30 August to 8 September 1992 (CPT/Inf (93)15), it is stated:', '“130. ... the delegation also met (for instance, in the De Schie Prison, the De Singel Prison and the FOBA) some male and female prisoners in respect of whom treatment measures (eg. a TBS placement) had been decided, in some cases a long time before, but who had not yet been transferred because of a lack of places.', 'The CPT would like to receive the Dutch authorities’ comments on this subject.”', '35. In their response to the CPT report (CPT/Inf (93)20), the Netherlands Government stated:', '“The increase in the number of persons under a TBS order has placed the existing capacity under severe strain, causing a rise in the number of prisoners awaiting transfer to a TBS clinic. The Netherlands Government shares the CPT’s view that such prisoners should be placed in an appropriate hospital facility within a reasonable length of time. The situation has changed, however, since the delegation’s visit. A programme has been set up to increase the capacity through building projects and the creation of more places in existing establishments, and outpatient departments for part-time treatment have been added to some TBS clinics, widening the prospect for earlier probationary leave. These measures will reduce waiting times considerably.”', '36. In the CPT report of 29 September 1998 on its second visit to the Netherlands from 17 to 27 November 1997 (CPT/Inf (98)15), it is stated:', '“111. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Dutch authorities have been confronted by a significant increase in TBS orders, a problem which has been exacerbated by the prolonged stays – for more than six years – of some 160 persons within the TBS system. As a result, the number of persons waiting in prisons for admission to TBS establishments rose from 26 in 1991 to over 200 at the time of the CPT’s second periodic visit. In response to this situation, the Dutch authorities have decided to increase the number of TBS places, in order to reach a capacity of 1,000 in 1999. However, the CPT notes that, in a letter sent to the Lower House of Parliament on 2 April 1998, ... the Minister of Justice indicated that the shortage of TBS places in 2002 is estimated at 340.', 'Concern has been expressed in the Netherlands about the position of inmates waiting in prison for admission to a TBS institution. During this waiting period, currently averaging 9 months, the persons concerned do not receive the treatment they require, a situation which, it has been pointed out, is likely to provoke feelings of anxiety, self doubt and anger in the persons concerned. Further, as they are considered dangerous, those inmates run a serious risk of being placed in restrictive regimes in the prison establishments where they are temporarily being held.”', '37. In their response to the CPT report (CPT/Inf (99)5), the Netherlands Government informed the CPT of the measures taken by the Dutch authorities in order to overcome the difficulties flowing from the large number of prisoners awaiting admission to a custodial clinic and of the steps taken to ensure that such prisoners received at least minimally adequate treatment whilst awaiting admission. According to the Netherlands Government, efforts were being made to improve/accelerate the outflow of TBS patients to mainstream psychiatric facilities and the new statutory provision for the conditional lifting of TBS orders was expected both to increase the outflow of TBS patients as well as to reduce the number of patients entering custodial clinics.', '38. The Government further informed the CPT that lengthy waiting lists for places in custodial clinics would continue to exist pending a resolution of the capacity problem, but that experiments had started in a few places providing special psychiatric treatment for inmates awaiting admission to a custodial clinic in ordinary prisons. In these experiments, therapists attached to forensic outpatient departments offered a form of preparatory therapy designed to alleviate anxiety about the eventual TBS treatment and to reduce the growing hostility felt by these people towards the justice system. According to the Government, the initial results of these experiments were encouraging in that the persons involved – therapists, prison staff and inmates – had all responded positively and there was a growing demand among prisoners awaiting admission to a TBS institution for this kind of support (pp. 40-41).']",['5'],['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1

ITALY,3,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"['5. The applicant, who was born on 28 March 1943 in Trieste, was abandoned by her mother at birth.', '6. Her birth certificate records the following information:', '“Today, 28 March 1943, at 7.30 a.m., a woman, who did not consent to being named, gave birth to a baby girl.”', '7. The applicant was placed first in an orphanage and subsequently with the Godelli family. When she was six years old she was adopted by Mr and Mrs Godelli under the simple adoption (affiliazione) procedure, by a decision of the Trieste Guardianship Judge of 10 October 1949.', '8. At the age of ten, after learning that she had been adopted, the applicant asked her adoptive parents to tell her who her birth parents were, but did not receive an answer. On an unspecified date she discovered that a young girl living in her village, who had been born on the same day as her, had been abandoned and subsequently adopted by another family under the simple adoption procedure. The applicant suspected that she was her twin sister. The adoptive parents of the two girls prohibited any contact between them.', '9. The applicant stated that she had had a very difficult childhood because she had been unable to find out her origins.', '10. In 2006 the applicant requested information about her origins from the Trieste Register Office, in accordance with section 28 of Law no. 184 of 4 May 1983 (Adoption Act: “Law no. 184/1993”), the regulations governing simple adoption having been repealed by that Law. The Register Office gave the applicant her birth certificate, on which her birth mother’s name did not appear because she had not agreed to have her identity disclosed.', '11. On 19 March 2007 the applicant lodged an application with the Trieste City Court, under Article 96 of Presidential Decree no. 396/2000, seeking rectification of her birth certificate. On 4 May 2007 the court declined jurisdiction and dismissed the application on the ground that section 28(5) of Law no. 184/1983 provided that where persons aged over twenty-five were seeking access to information about their birth parents the court with the appropriate jurisdiction was the Family Court.', '12. On 5 June 2007 the applicant lodged an application with the Trieste Family Court. On 11 June 2008 the court dismissed her application on the ground that, under section 28(7) of Law no. 184/983, she was prohibited from gaining access to information about her origins because her mother, at the time of the applicant’s birth, had not agreed to have her identity disclosed.', '13. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed her appeal by a decision of 23 December 2008.', '14. The court observed, in particular, that the Family Court had stressed the fact that the applicant’s birth mother had requested to keep her identity secret and that it had therefore correctly applied section 28(7) of Law no. 184 of 1983, even though the applicant had been adopted under a simple adoption order, as simple adoption did nevertheless create a family status. The Court of Appeal found that section 28(7) was designed to guarantee respect for the mother’s wishes. The prohibition on allowing the applicant access to information about her origins also served a public interest.', '15. The applicant did not lodge an appeal on points of law.', '16. Under Article 250 of the Civil Code, one of the parents may decide not to recognise his or her child. In order to exercise that right, the mother must, at the time of the birth, request the hospital to keep her identity secret. In such a case a medical file containing medical information about the mother and child is drawn up. Only the child’s general practitioner may have access to the file, with the permission of the child’s guardian.', '17. Simple adoption (affiliazione) was created in 1942 in order to provide assistance to abandoned or parentless children aged under eighteen. Unlike full adoption, this did not create an effective family relationship and the person being adopted did not have to be childless; however, he or she did have to be aged under eighteen. A simple adoption order could be requested by: the person with whom the child had been placed, the Health and Social Security Department, or the person who had been raising the child on their own initiative.', '18. The Articles of the Civil Code providing for simple adoption were repealed as a result of the entry into force of Law no. 184 of 4 May 1983 (subsequently revised by Law no. 149 of 2001 and by Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003).', '19. Section 27 of Law no. 184/1983 guarantees the right to keep a child’s origins secret in the absence of express authorisation by the judicial authority.', '20. Under section 28(7) of Law no. 184/1983, a mother who decides not to keep her child can give birth in a hospital and at the same time remain anonymous on the declaration of birth. That anonymity lasts one hundred years, after which access to the birth certificate becomes possible.', '21. An adoption order, once issued by the court, is sent to the register office so that a note can be made in the margin of the birth certificate. Any copies of the adopted child’s civil-status certificates must be issued with only the new family name shown and must bear no mention of the biological father or mother or any annotation regarding the adoption. However, where the registrar is expressly so authorised by the court, he or she may disclose this information.', '22. Adopted children may have access to information about their origins and the identity of their birth parents on reaching the age of twenty-five. Where there are compelling and proven reasons relating to their physical and mental health, they may obtain that information on their majority. An application is lodged with the family court of their place of residence, which gives its decision after assessing the particular situation and hearing any persons whom it deems it necessary to hear.', '23. Access to the information is refused where the birth mother has not recognised the child at birth and where one of the birth parents has declared their wish not to be named on the birth certificate or has given their consent to the adoption subject to remaining anonymous.', '24. In a judgment of 16 November 2005, the Constitutional Court held that withholding information about a child’s origins without first verifying whether the mother still did not wish to be identified was compatible with Articles 2, 3 and 32 of the Constitution.', '25. The Constitutional Court observed, in particular, that section 28(7) of Law no. 184/1983 aimed to protect mothers who – in difficult circumstances – decided not to keep their child, by allowing them the possibility of giving birth in a hospital and at the same time remaining anonymous on the declaration of birth. In the court’s view, the mother could thus give birth in good conditions and was prevented from taking an irreversible decision. That possibility would be jeopardised if, under that provision, the mother were also to know that she might one day be called upon by the judicial authority to confirm or waive her decision.', '26. Article 111 § 7 of the Italian Constitution provides: “Appeals to the Court of Cassation in cases of violations of the law are always admissible against judgments or measures affecting personal freedom pronounced by the ordinary or special courts”.', '27. A government bill on access to personal origins has been before the Italian Parliament since 2008. The bill has two main objectives:', 'i) to permit and make provision for a procedure whereby confidentiality can be waived without calling into question the legal consequences of the decision initially taken by the mother;', 'ii) to make a waiver of confidentiality subject to the express agreement of the mother and child.', 'Under the provisions of the bill, anyone aged twenty-five or over who has been adopted and not recognised at birth may apply to the family court for access to information about their origins, subject to the mother’s agreement. Where the child seeks to discover his or her origins, the family court will take steps to find the mother and obtain her consent to waive confidentiality while respecting her private life. Where the mother has died and where the father has died or cannot be identified, the court will obtain information about their identity and any medical data that may disclose the existence of any transmissible hereditary diseases.', '28. Whilst the system of anonymous or secret births would appear to exist in a minority of countries in Europe, it is not exceptional. In addition to France, where for many years the positive law has provided for a system of anonymous births, other national legislations, which are relatively recent as they have been drafted during the past decade, also provide for births in such conditions (Austria, Luxembourg, Russia, Slovakia).', 'In France the system of anonymous births tends to resemble that of secret births, like the practice in the Czech Republic where the secrecy of the birth mother’s identity is temporary, rather than definitive, as access to the relevant information is delayed.', '29. The situation of children born anonymously or secretly is comparable to that of children who find it difficult, or even impossible, to gain access to their biological origins. The omission of the name of one or other or of both parents may sometimes be provided for by law, but this is very rare (Italy, Luxembourg, France). Usually factual circumstances will prevent the registrar from fully completing the child’s birth certificate; court proceedings are brought to determine paternity/maternity and may be available to persons other than the child alone. Notwithstanding the fact that such actions may not necessarily be effective in the particular circumstances, their very existence, allowing research to be done into personal ties maintained by a child with his birth family, provides a safeguard for the interested persons.', '30. It should further be pointed out that the practice of abandoning children continues in modern forms: there is an undeniable increase in the number of “windows” or “baby hatches” reminiscent of foundling wheels in the Middle Ages. It is practically and materially impossible for the child to gain access to information about his or her birth family; the register of births will give a “fictitious” name to the child that bears no connection to that of its birth parents. The circumstances of the birth may be only partially secret (Spain, Hungary), but this will then necessarily mean that some data is available. Legal proceedings are generally available for children searching for their birth mother (Bulgaria, Croatia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) or mothers who may be searching for their child (Ukraine).', '31. In the case of full adoption, the child will often lose all contact with its birth family; the new parent-child relationship will totally erase any ties that may have existed during the child’s previous life with other adults (Austria, France, Monaco, Bulgaria, Russia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia). Access to the birth certificate is sometimes possible from a minimum age (Germany, Croatia, Hungary, Latvia, Portugal). The child may be authorised to gain access to a wider range of information (Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Switzerland, Spain), which often presupposes bringing legal proceedings whereby the competing interests may be examined.', '32. The United Kingdom and Ireland have set up a mechanism making it easier for adopted persons to gain access to records about their adoption that goes a long way towards reconciling the right to information of the adopted child and respect for the private and family life of the mother or, more broadly, the birth family.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Prijedor.', '6. Before the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the applicant lived in Bosanska Krupa in a socially owned flat over which he had an occupancy right (the concept of “socially owned flats” is described below).', '7. On 14 October 2002 the competent administrative authority confirmed the applicant’s occupancy right over the flat in Bosanska Krupa, but stated, however, that the building in which the flat was located had been destroyed during the war.', '8. On 25 November 2002 the applicant asked the local authority to allocate him a replacement flat. However, he did not receive any reply.', '9. On 13 December 2004 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the local authority before the Bosanska Krupa Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”), seeking to be allocated a replacement flat. On 16 February 2005 the Municipal Court invited the local authority to submit a response to the applicant’s claim. As they failed to do so, the Municipal Court adopted a judgment on 25 March 2005 without a hearing, in accordance with section 182 of the Civil Procedure Act 2003 (see paragraph 18 below). It held that the applicant was entitled to a replacement flat because his occupancy right over a destroyed flat had been confirmed by the competent administrative authority. Therefore, it ordered the local authority to allocate him a suitable replacement flat in Bosanska Krupa, in lieu of the one in respect of which he had had an occupancy right and which had been destroyed during the war. Pursuant to the aforementioned provision of the Civil Procedure Act 2003, that judgment became final on the same date (see paragraph 18 below).', '10. On 1 June 2005 the Municipal Court rejected the local authority’s request for restitutio in integrum. It would appear that they did not appeal to a higher court.', '11. On 23 March 2006 the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings. On 4 May 2006 the Municipal Court refused to issue a writ of execution, stating that the judgment of 25 March 2005 was not enforceable because it did not contain any indication of the location and the surface area of the replacement flat. That decision was upheld by the Bihać Cantonal Court (""the Cantonal Court"") on 20 December 2006.', '12. On 16 March 2007 the applicant complained to the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”) of the non-enforcement of the judgment of 25 March 2005. On 12 June 2008 the Constitutional Court upheld the rulings of the lower courts and instructed the applicant to start new civil proceedings against the local authority in order to establish the latter’s precise obligation regarding the flat to be allocated to him. That decision was delivered to the applicant on 11 August 2008.', '13. It would appear that the judgment of 25 March 2005 remains unenforced. It would also appear that the applicant did not start new civil proceedings against the local authority.', '14. In the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia practically all flats were built under the regime of “social ownership”. They were generally built by socially owned enterprises or other public bodies for allocation to their employees, who became “occupancy right holders”. The rights of both the allocation right holders (public bodies which nominally controlled the flats) and the occupancy right holders were regulated by law (the Housing Act 1984, which is still in force in Bosnia and Herzegovina).', '15. In accordance with this Act, an occupancy right, once allocated, entitled the occupancy right holder to permanent, lifelong use of the flat against the payment of a nominal fee. When occupancy right holders died, their rights transferred, as a matter of right, to their surviving spouses or registered members of their family who were also using the flat (sections 19 and 21 of this Act). The concept of “social ownership” was abandoned during the 1992-95 war. As a result, socially owned flats were effectively nationalised (for more information about socially owned flats see Đokić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 6518/04, §§ 5-8, 27 May 2010).', '16. The Restitution of Flats Act 1998 prescribed the procedure for repossession of pre-war flats and the rights of occupancy right holders. Section 4 of that Act provides that claims for repossession should be submitted to the competent administrative authority.', '17. Section 36 of the Instruction on Implementation of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998 provides that the competent administrative authority shall decide on claims for repossession of flats which were damaged or destroyed during the war. A decision accepting such a claim should contain confirmation of the claimant’s occupancy right over the destroyed/damaged flat, as well as an instruction that the occupancy right holder is entitled to its repossession in the event that the flat is reconstructed (section 37 of the Instruction).', '18. In accordance with section 182(1) of the Civil Procedure Act 2003, if a defendant who has been duly served with a plaintiff’s claim fails to submit a written response to it within the set time-limit, the court shall accept the claim, if it has been so requested, unless it is manifestly ill-founded. A claim is manifestly ill-founded if it evidently contravenes the facts on which it is based or if the facts from the claim contravene the evidence proposed by the plaintiff or well-known facts (section 182(2) of this Act). If a decision is taken in accordance with the aforementioned provision an appeal is not allowed (section 183(1) of this Act).', '19.

The events described below took place between January 1998 and February 1999.', '11. The applicant contacted the police after he was attacked by a young man with whom he had had homosexual relations. He was arrested for allegedly engaging in buggery with a young man aged 16 years of age contrary to section 12(1) and schedule 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. The applicant underwent a medical examination with his consent during which samples were taken and his residence was searched by police. He was released on police bail the following day and was subsequently formally charged.', ""12. The applicant attended before the Magistrates' Court on four occasions and each time he was bailed to re-appear. During this period, the applicant wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and other government officials stating that the criminal proceedings against him violated his human rights, citing the case of Sutherland v. the United Kingdom (no. 25186/94, Commission's report of 1 July 1997, unpublished)."", ""13. The applicant subsequently requested leave to apply for judicial review of the CPS decision to prosecute him but this application was refused. His renewed application was later rejected by the High Court. Following a hearing at the Magistrates' Court, the applicant was committed for trial at the Central Criminal Court. He appeared before the Central Criminal Court for a plea and directions hearing and for a hearing on various matters including his request for the trial to be postponed in order to allow him more time to prepare."", '14. The CPS later advised the applicant by letter that it had decided not to proceed with the case against him and that he should accordingly attend the Central Criminal Court on a particular date. On that date he was formally acquitted by that court. The trial judge asked the applicant if he would like to make a claim for costs but, following a brief discussion, the applicant decided not to make any claim on the grounds that, in his view, the CPS were “quibbling” over the amount to be awarded.', '15. Section 12(1) of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (“the 1956 Act”) made it an offence for a person to commit buggery with another person. Pursuant to Section 13 of the 1956 Act it was an offence for a man to commit an act of “gross indecency” with another man, whether in public or private.', '16. Section 14(1) of the 1956 Act made it an offence for a person to commit indecent assault on a woman. Section 14(2) of the 1956 Act provided that a girl under the age of sixteen years of age could not give any consent which would prevent an act being an assault for the purposes of the section.', '17. Section 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 (“the 1967 Act”) provided, inter alia, as follows:', '“(1) Notwithstanding any statutory or common law provision ... a homosexual act in private shall not be an offence provided that the parties consent thereto and have attained the age of twenty-one years. ...', '(7) For the purposes of this section a man shall be treated as doing a homosexual act if, and only if, he commits buggery with another man or commits an act of gross indecency with another man or is a party to the commission by a man of such an act ...”', '18.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Istanbul.', '5. On 22 April 2000 the applicant, a lawyer and member of the administrative board of the Istanbul Human Rights Association, organised a demonstration in Sultanahmet Square in Istanbul, in the form of a march followed by a statement to the press, to protest against plans for “F-type” prisons.', '6. At about 12 noon a group of forty to fifty persons brandishing placards and signs gathered in the square, under the leadership of the applicant and Eren Keskin, a lawyer and President of the Istanbul Human Rights Association. The police asked the group to disperse and to end the gathering, and informed them via a loudspeaker that the demonstration, for which advance notice had not been submitted, was unlawful and was likely to cause public-order problems at a busy time of day.', '7. The demonstrators refused to obey and attempted to continue marching towards the police, who dispersed the group using a kind of tear gas known as “pepper spray”. The police arrested thirty-nine demonstrators, including the applicant, and took them to a police station.', '8. After an identity check, and in view of her profession, the applicant was released at 12.45 p.m.', '9. On 26 April 2000 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Beyoğlu prosecutor’s office against the head of the Istanbul security police and the police officers concerned, alleging that she had been ill-treated through the use of pepper spray, unlawfully arrested and prevented from making the public statement scheduled for the end of the demonstration.', '10. On 29 June 2000 the public prosecutor’s office discontinued the proceedings on the ground that no offence had been committed.', '11. On 25 July 2000 the applicant applied to the Beyoğlu Assize Court seeking to have that decision set aside.', '12. On 25 September 2000 the Assize Court upheld the decision that there was no case to answer.', '13. Article 34 of the Constitution provides:', '“Everyone has the right to hold unarmed and peaceful meetings and demonstration marches without prior permission.', '...', 'The formalities, conditions, and procedures governing the exercise of the right to hold meetings and demonstration marches shall be prescribed by law.”', '14. At the material time section 10 of Law no. 2911 on assemblies and marches was worded as follows:', '“In order for a meeting to take place, the governor’s office or authorities of the district in which the demonstration is planned must be informed, during opening hours and at least seventy-two hours prior to the meeting, by a notice containing the signature of all the members of the organising board ...”', '15. Section 22 of the same Act prohibits demonstrations and processions on public streets, in parks, places of worship and buildings in which public services are based. Demonstrations organised in public squares must comply with security instructions and not disrupt individuals’ movement or public transport. Finally, section 24 provides that demonstrations and processions which do not comply with the provisions of this Act will be dispersed by force on the order of the governor’s office and after the demonstrators have been warned.', '16. The European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) at its 64th plenary session (21-22 October 2005) adopted an opinion interpreting the OSCE/ODHIR guidelines on drafting laws on freedom of assembly with regard to the regulation of public meetings. It set out its approach in this area, particularly with regard to advance notice of demonstrations in public places.', '“29. Establishing a regime of prior notification of peaceful assemblies does not necessarily extend to an infringement of the right. In fact, in several European countries such regimes do exist. The need for advance notice generally arises in respect of certain meetings or assemblies – for instance, when a procession is planned to take place on the highway, or a static assembly is planned to take place on a public square – which require the police and other authorities to enable it to occur and not to use powers that they may validly have (for instance, of regulating traffic) to obstruct the event.”', 'However, the Venice Commission clearly emphasised that the regime of prior notification must not in any circumstances indirectly restrict the right to hold peaceful meetings by, for instance, providing for too detailed and complicated requirements, or imposing too onerous procedural conditions (paragraph 30 of the opinion).', '17. Under Article I § 5 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction of 13 January 1993 (“the CWC”), each State Party undertakes not to use riot control agents as a method of warfare. Tear gas or so-called “pepper spray” are not considered chemical weapons (the CWC contains an annex listing the names of prohibited chemical products). The use of such methods is authorised for the purpose of law enforcement, including domestic riot control (Article II § 9 (d)). Nor does the CWC state which State bodies may be involved in maintaining public order. This remains a matter for the sovereign power of the State concerned.', 'The CWC entered into force with regard to Turkey on 11 June 1997.', '18. It is recognised that the use of “pepper spray” can produce effects such as respiratory problems, nausea, vomiting, irritation of the respiratory tract, irritation of the tear ducts and eyes, spasms, chest pain, dermatitis or allergies. In strong doses, it may cause necrosis of tissue in the respiratory or digestive tract, pulmonary oedema or internal haemorrhaging (haemorrhaging of the suprarenal gland).']",['11'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1961. When lodging his application, he was detained in Straubing Prison (Germany). He is currently detained in Grad Vraca (Bulgaria).', '7. The applicant entered Germany in 1979. He has been convicted some fifteen times since 1980, notably of theft and burglary. In particular, on 1 March 1984 the Kempten District Court convicted him of three counts of joint theft as a member of a gang and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. On 7 October 1988 the Munich I Regional Court convicted the applicant of six counts of burglary and one count of attempted burglary and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. On 1 October 1993 the Munich District Court convicted the applicant of joint attempted burglary, committed approximately one month after his release from prison, and sentenced him to one year and six months’ imprisonment.', '8. On 21 December 1994 the applicant was arrested and remanded in detention.', '9. On 26 January 1996 the Munich I Regional Court convicted the applicant of eight counts of burglary and attempted burglary, committed only a few months after his release from prison, and sentenced him to eight years and six months’ imprisonment. It found that by breaking into different shops, the applicant had stolen goods worth some 140,000 Deutschmarks (approximately 71,581 euros). It further ordered the applicant’s preventive detention pursuant to Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 40-41 below). Having regard to an expert report, the court found that the applicant had a propensity to commit offences by which serious economic damage was caused and was therefore dangerous to the public.', '10. By a decision of 16 April 1997, supplemented on 29 October 1997, the city of Munich ordered the applicant’s expulsion to Bulgaria and prohibited him to re-enter Germany for an indefinite duration in view of his criminal convictions. It authorised the applicant’s expulsion directly from prison as soon as he had served his sentence. The expulsion order became final on 30 December 1997, the regional government of Upper Bavaria having dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 25 November 1997.', '11. In the plan governing the execution of the applicant’s sentence, drawn up by the Straubing Prison authorities and presented to the applicant on 9 October 1997, it is noted that the applicant’s transfer to a social therapeutic institution, relaxations in the conditions of his detention and preparations for his release were not envisaged as the city of Munich had issued a deportation order against him.', '12. On 7 January 2002 the Erlangen Prison authorities informed the applicant, who was at that time detained in Straubing Prison, that it was not possible to transfer him to Erlangen in order to enable him to participate in a social therapy because he was liable to be expelled after having served his prison sentence.', '13. The applicant served his full prison sentence until 19 June 2003. Since then, he was remanded in preventive detention.', '14. On 21 August 2003 the Regensburg Regional Court, in review proceedings pursuant to Article 67c § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 42 below), decided that the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention was still necessary in view of its objective.', '15. On 1 December 2003 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal, allowing the applicant’s appeal, quashed the decision of 21 August 2003 and remitted the case to the Regional Court. It found that the Regional Court had not been entitled to authorise one of its judges to hear the applicant alone instead of hearing him in its full composition without giving reasons for doing so. Moreover, the refusal of the Straubing Prison authorities to allow the applicant’s defence counsel to inspect his personal files had violated the right to a fair trial.', '16. The applicant’s counsel was subsequently granted access to the applicant’s personal files at Straubing Prison.', '17. On 26 February 2004 the Regensburg Regional Court, having heard the applicant on 15 January 2004 and the applicant and the two experts W. and T. on 19 February 2004, again decided that the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention was necessary in view of its objective (Article 67c § 1 of the Criminal Code). It therefore refused to suspend the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention and to grant probation.', '18. Having regard to the report submitted by the expert for forensic psychiatry W., the Regional Court found that it was very likely that the applicant would reoffend if released. He had been convicted of burglary on numerous occasions and had reoffended shortly after having served long prison sentences. As confirmed by a report submitted by the Straubing Prison authorities dated 17 January 2003 and by the applicant’s statements at the hearing, the applicant continuously refused critically to reflect on his offences and felt persecuted and wrongfully convicted by the German courts.', '19. The Regional Court considered that there were also no other elements indicating that the applicant was no longer inclined to reoffend. It noted that according to expert W., it was advisable for the applicant to participate in a social therapy. It conceded that the applicant had not been admitted to a social therapy in Erlangen Prison he had applied for in 2002. The conditions of his detention had also not been relaxed (Vollzugslockerungen). Both of these measures were important conditions for arriving at a prognosis that he was no longer dangerous to the public. However, this did not alter the fact that the applicant kept posing a risk to the public.', '20. According to the Regional Court, the applicant’s preventive detention was also not disproportionate. As the applicant was not a German national it was unlikely that the prison authorities, having regard to the usual practice, would relax his conditions of detention. He had further been refused a social therapy in view of his imminent expulsion. The court considered that it was illegal to retain a convicted person in preventive detention for an indefinite period of time only as a consequence of his foreign nationality and the resulting refusal of relaxed conditions of imprisonment. The Public Prosecutor’s Office would have to consider this issue when deciding on a fresh motion lodged by the applicant to suspend his preventive detention pursuant to Article 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 45 below). Otherwise, a suspension of the preventive detention order against the applicant on probation could have to be ordered in the future for reasons of proportionality even without the conditions of his detention having previously been relaxed.', '21. On 23 April 2004 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 26 February 2004.', '22. Endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant was still dangerous to the public. He had also proved obstinate in prison and had to be punished three times in 2003 for having insulted the prison staff. Due to the fact that the applicant, as confirmed by expert W., refused to take responsibility for his past offences, there were no suitable measures to prepare the applicant adequately for his release. As the applicant was in preventive detention only since 20 June 2003, the execution of this measure was still proportionate.', '23. On 27 May 2004 the applicant, represented by counsel, lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. He notably argued that his right to freedom as guaranteed by Article 2 § 2 of the Basic Law was violated because his preventive detention was disproportionate. Moreover, he claimed that the refusal to admit him to a social therapy due to his imminent expulsion discriminated him because of his Bulgarian nationality and therefore disregarded his right to equality under Article 3 of the Basic Law.', '24. On 28 September 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint and to grant him legal aid (no. 2 BvR 1079/04). It found that his complaint had no prospects of success. There was nothing to indicate that the criminal courts, in reaching their decision under Article 67c § 1 of the Criminal Code, notably in finding that the applicant was still dangerous, had failed duly to consider human dignity and the right to freedom as guaranteed by the Basic Law.', '25. The Federal Constitutional Court confirmed that measures relaxing the conditions of detention were a decisive factor for the prognosis of a convicted person’s dangerousness. However, the applicant neither claimed to have applied for such measures in the course of his preventive detention nor to have been unlawfully refused such measures. The decisions of the criminal courts were also not based on the fact that until then, no such measures had been granted. As regards therapeutic measures, the criminal courts had rightly pointed out that due to the applicant’s persistent refusal to accept responsibility for his offences there were no suitable measures to prepare him adequately for his release.', '26. On 25 November 2004 the Straubing District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for measures relaxing the conditions of his preventive detention, notably leave under escort for one day under the supervision of two prison officers. It argued that he might abscond on that occasion. The applicant’s appeal on points of law against this decision to the Nuremberg Court of Appeal was to no avail. On 14 March 2006 the Straubing Prison authorities dismissed another request made by the applicant to relax his conditions of preventive detention on the same grounds.', '27. On 17 December 2004 the Erlangen Prison again declared not to consent to a transfer of the applicant from Straubing Prison to it in order to admit the applicant to a social therapy. It argued that it was not in a position to prepare the applicant, who was liable to be expelled, for a life without offences in Bulgaria. The living conditions in that country were not known to the therapists. On 31 January 2005 the Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court dismissed as inadmissible the applicant’s request to declare that refusal unlawful. It found that it were the Straubing Prison authorities which were competent to decide on the applicant’s transfer to a different prison.', '28. On 21 December 2006 the Regensburg Regional Court, reviewing the necessity of the applicant’s preventive detention under Articles 67d § 2 and 67e of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 43-44 below), refused to suspend the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention order on probation. Having regard to the report of psychiatric expert A. it had consulted, it found that there was still a risk that the applicant would commit further serious offences against the property of others (but no violent offences) if released.', '29. The Regional Court considered that the applicant’s continued preventive detention was still proportionate. It conceded that it was problematic that no measures at all were planned by the prison authorities to further the applicant’s reintegration into society. Moreover, owing to, in particular, his foreign nationality, the applicant could not expect any relaxations in the conditions of his detention. In practice, the latter were a precondition for coming to an assessment that a detainee was no longer dangerous to the public. Therefore, the court would have to decide at the next periodic review of the applicant’s preventive detention whether the applicant was to be released for reasons of proportionality, despite the fact that he had not previously been granted relaxations in the conditions of his detention and had not been considered as no longer posing a threat to the public.', '30. On 12 March 2007 the Nuremberg Court of Appeal, endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It noted, in particular, that expert A. had considered that there was no starting point for beginning with measures preparing the applicant’s conditional release. As he contested having committed the property offences he had been found guilt of, he could not critically reflect on his criminal behaviour. Therefore, relaxations in the conditions of the applicant’s detention, which were very important to arrive at a prognosis that a person was no longer dangerous to the public, had not been refused without good cause.', '31. On 16 February 2005 the Munich I Public Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the applicant’s request to suspend the execution of his preventive detention in view of his imminent expulsion under Article 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 25 April 2005 the General Public Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '32. On 12 July 2005 the Munich Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s request for judicial review. Endorsing the reasons given by the prosecution authorities, it found that there was still a risk that the applicant reoffended and that he was still was not conscious of his guilt. In these circumstances, a therapeutic treatment was without prospects of success.', '33. On 19 June 2007 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 1676/05). It found that the decision of the Court of Appeal to consider as lawful the prosecution’s balancing between the public interest in the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention and the applicant’s interest in his personal liberty had – at least at that time – not been unconstitutional.', '34. On 7 November 2005 the Munich I Public Prosecutor’s Office dismissed another request made by the applicant to suspend the execution of his preventive detention under Article 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the same grounds.', '35. The applicant’s appeals were to no avail. In its decision of 16 May 2006 the Munich Court of Appeal noted, in particular, that it might appear contradictory to the applicant that measures aiming at his reintegration into society, such as a social therapy, were refused to him because of the deportation order against him, but that the authorities nevertheless refused to suspend the execution of his preventive detention under Article 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, the refusal of the said measures alone did not mean that the prosecution authorities could only exercise their discretion in a lawful manner by granting his request under the said provision.', '36. On 7 September 2007 the Munich I Public Prosecutor’s Office decided to suspend the execution of the applicant’s preventive detention at the date of his expulsion to Bulgaria, and on 1 November 2007 at the earliest, under Article 456a of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '37. On 13 December 2007 the applicant was expelled to Bulgaria in accordance with the deportation order issued by the city of Munich on 16 April 1997.', '38. On 30 November 2009 the Korneuburg Regional Court (Austria) convicted the applicant of two counts of murder, one count of attempted murder and robbery with firearms, committed on 1 June 2009 in Austria and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The judgment was upheld on appeal. The applicant was subsequently transferred to Bulgaria in order to serve his sentence.', '39. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, and the making, review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court’s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, §§ 45-78, 17 December 2009). The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows:', '40. The sentencing court may, at the time of the offender’s conviction, order his preventive detention (a so-called measure of correction and prevention) under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence (a penalty), if the offender has been shown to be a danger to the public (Article 66 of the Criminal Code).', '41. In particular, the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to at least two years’ imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already, to at least one year’s imprisonment in each case, for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence. Secondly, the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for at least two years. Thirdly, a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public (see Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force at the relevant time).', '42. Article 67c of the Criminal Code governs orders for the preventive detention of convicted persons which are not executed immediately after the judgment ordering them becomes final. Paragraph 1 of the Article provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention, the court responsible for the execution of sentences (that is, a special Chamber of the Regional Court composed of three professional judges, see sections 78a and 78b (1)(1) of the Court Organisation Act) must review, before completion of the prison term, whether the person’s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective. If that is not the case, it suspends the execution of the preventive detention order and places the person on probation with supervision of their conduct which commences with the suspension.', '43. Article 67d of the Criminal Code governs the duration of preventive detention. Paragraph 2, first sentence, of that Article, in its version in force at the relevant time, provides that if there is no provision for a maximum duration or if the time-limit has not yet expired, the court shall suspend on probation the further execution of the detention order as soon as it is to be expected that the person concerned will not commit any further unlawful acts on his release.', '44. Pursuant to Article 67e of the Criminal Code, the court (that is, the chamber responsible for the execution of sentences) may review at any time whether the further execution of the preventive detention order should be suspended and a measure of probation applied. It is obliged to do so within fixed time-limits (paragraph 1 of Article 67e). For persons in preventive detention, this time-limit is two years (paragraph 2 of Article 67e).', '45. Pursuant to Article 456a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Public Prosecutor’s Office may dispense with the execution of a prison sentence or a measure of correction and prevention if the convicted person is expelled from German territory. The execution of the sentence or measure may be continued if the expelled person returns to Germany territory (Article 456a § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).', '46. Section 9 § 2 of the Execution of Sentences Act provides that prisoners may be transferred to a socio-therapeutic institution with their consent if the special therapeutic measures and social aids of the institution are advisable for their rehabilitation. The transfer is conditional upon the consent of the head of the socio-therapeutic institution concerned.', '47. Under section 11 § 1 of the Execution of Sentences Act, the conditions of detention may be relaxed by making an order permitting the prisoner to perform regular work outside prison either under the supervision of a member of the prison staff (outside work) or without such supervision (work release). The prisoner may further be permitted to leave the prison for a certain time during the day either under the supervision of the prison staff (short leave under escort) or without such supervision (short leave). Under section 11 § 2 of the said Act, these measures may only be ordered with the prisoner’s consent and if there is no risk that the prisoner might seek to abscond or commit offences during the relaxation of the conditions of his detention.', '48. Under section 6 § 1 (c) of the Federal Administrative Rules relating to Article 11 of the Execution of Sentences Act, which seek to ensure the uniform application of the law by the authorities, external work, work release and short leave may, as a rule, not be permitted to prisoners against whom a final expulsion order is in force and who are to be deported directly from prison. Exceptions may be granted in agreement with the competent aliens’ authority. Short leave under escort may be authorised.', '49. On 4 May 2011 the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the complainants’ preventive detention beyond the former ten-year maximum period and also concerning the retrospective order for the complainants’ preventive detention (file nos. 2 BvR 2365/09, 2 BvR 740/10, 2 BvR 2333/08, 2 BvR 1152/10 and 2 BvR 571/10). Reversing its previous position, the Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective ordering of such detention were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty.', '50. The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all the relevant provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of persons in preventive detention. It found that those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment (Abstandsgebot). These provisions included, in particular, Article 66 of the Criminal Code in its version in force since 27 December 2003.', '51. The Federal Constitutional Court ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with the Basic Law remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until 31 May 2013 at the latest. The provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention which did not concern the retrospective ordering or prolongation of preventive detention could only continue to be applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality. As a general rule, proportionality was only observed where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious violent crimes or sexual offences if released.', '52. In its reasoning, the Federal Constitutional Court relied on the interpretation of Article 5 and Article 7 of the Convention made by this Court in its judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above; see §§ 137 ss. of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment). It stressed, in particular, that the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment and the principles laid down in Article 7 of the Convention required an individualised and intensified offer of therapy and care to the persons concerned. In line with the Court’s findings in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above, § 129), it was necessary to provide a high level of care by a team of multi-disciplinary staff and to offer the detainees an individualised therapy if the standard therapies available in the institution did not have prospects of success (see § 113 of the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment).']","['14', '5']",['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The first applicant was born in 1956. She died on 24 August 2007. The second applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Tbilisi.', '15. On 27 January 2006, at around 11 p.m., a group of friends met at the Café Chardin in Tbilisi. In the group were T.S.-aia, the Minister of the Interior’s wife, D.A.-aia, Director of Constitutional Security at the Interior Ministry, his deputy O.M.-ov, V.S.-dze, Director of the General Inspectorate of the Interior Ministry, G.D.-dze, Head of Press at the Ministry and the Minister’s spokesman, and A.K.-dze, a lady friend of T.S.aia. Another woman, Th.M.-dze, a friend of A.K.-dze, was also with them.', '16. Mr Sandro Girgvliani, the applicants’ 28-year-old only son, and a friend of his, L.B.-dze, were sitting at another table in the same room.', '17. According to the applicants D.A.-aia, O.M.-ov, V.S.-dze and G.D.dze are very well-known public figures in Georgia who, with V.M.shvili, the Georgian Minister of the Interior, played an active part in the so-called Rose Revolution that brought about the resignation of President E. Shevardnadze in November 2003 (see The Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia, no. 9103/04, §§ 11-13, 8 July 2008). According to the applicants, the government relies on the support of these trusted aides.', '18. As submitted by the applicants, on the evening in question Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze, both young bankers, arrived at the Café Chardin later than the group of friends mentioned above. The applicants’ son was actually hoping to see Th.M.-dze, whom he was apparently courting. On entering the café, he went up to the table where T.S.-aia, the Interior Minister’s wife, and her friends were sitting to say hello to Th.M.-dze. After greeting Th.M.-dze with a kiss, he went to sit with L.B.-dze at a nearby table. At one point he signalled to Th.M.-dze to join them at his table and she temporarily changed tables. The discussion between Sandro Girgvliani and Th.M.-dze, which lasted between 20 and 30 minutes, was apparently quite tense, punctuated with lively gestures that suggested they were disagreeing about something. Because of this, A.K.-dze went up to Th.M.dze twice, to ask her if everything was all right and if she needed any help. Th.M.-dze said all was well and she would soon be going back to A.K.dze’s table. When she finally did so the Minister of the Interior’s wife asked her if there was anything wrong. Th.M.-dze said that the young man she had been talking to was a friend and that there was no problem.', '19. On 28 January 2006, at about 3 p.m., Sandro Girgvliani’s body was found by three friends, with the help of a local man, near the cemetery in Okrokana, a suburb of Tbilisi, 6.3 km from the Café Chardin.', '20. According to an expert report drawn up by forensic specialists on 28 January 2006, after inspecting the crime scene, and the photographs appended to it, Sandro Girgvliani’s body, naked from the waist up, was discovered lying in the snow in the woods near the cemetery. Visual examination of the body revealed numerous parallel linear wounds on the left arm and shoulder, three 8 cm wounds to the neck, a similar wound to the throat and numerous bruises and lesions, some deep, to the chest. A pocketknife was found in the victim’s trouser pocket.', '21. The autopsy carried out on 28 January 2006 by the National Forensic Bureau established that the victim had 12 cuts of different sizes on his throat, caused by a sharp object, and one lesion on the left shoulder. Three of the wounds to the throat were deep enough to have damaged the muscles. One of them, measuring 0.5 cm in diameter, had reached the pharynx. According to a State expert who examined a sample of skin taken from the throat, the wounds had been caused by a sharp, pointed object with a handle, probably a knife. A very large number of cuts of different sizes – from 4 to 15 cm long – were found on the left shoulder, the left forearm, the right shoulder, the fingers, the belly, both knees and tibias, the thighs, the forehead, the nose, and around the eyes. Analyses revealed the presence of alcohol but no drugs in the blood. According to the experts, the amount of alcohol in the victim’s blood at the time of death was insignificant (0.35 ‰).', '22. The report concluded that death had been caused by the wound to the pharynx. The victim had died of asphyxia when blood from the wound to his pharynx was sucked into the airways. It was a serious, life-threatening wound.', '23. On 28 January 2006 criminal proceedings were instituted by the Ministry of the Interior for murder (Article 108 of the Criminal Code). On the same day criminal proceedings were instituted on counts of false imprisonment (Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code) and criminal association (Article 179 § 2 of the Criminal Code). Also on the same day, the two cases were joined.', '24. On 28 January 2006 L.B.-dze was questioned as a witness. He explained that on 27 January 2006, at around 8 p.m., Sandro Girgvliani, himself and some colleagues of theirs went to the Keiser inn. They ordered various dishes, and beer and vodka. They left the inn at about 1 a.m. The applicants’ son and L.B.-dze took one taxi and their colleagues took another one. On the way, Mr Girgvliani suggested stopping off at the Café Chardin for a coffee. According to L.B.-dze, they met several people they knew in the café and stayed there until about 2 a.m., when they left and started walking down Leselidze Street towards the main road. A silver Mercedes ML pulled up alongside them. Two men got out and grabbed L.B.-dze by the neck to push him into the car. One of them pushed the applicants’ son into the car, holding his hands behind his back.', '25. L.B.-dze asked the three kidnappers what they wanted. One of them said that, to start with, he wanted to know what they had in their pockets. L.B.-dze and Sandro Girgvliani showed him their mobile phones, which the man confiscated and placed in the glove compartment. The same man then asked them for proof of identity. L.B.-dze gave him his work pass, which was also confiscated. L.B.-dze and Mr Girgvliani took the men for policemen, but when the car started heading uphill, out of Tbilisi, the applicants’ son asked where they were going, as there was no police station in that direction. By way of an answer, the man sitting next to him elbowed him in the ribs. L.B.-dze asked the same question, but to no avail. Mr Girgvliani then demanded that they show their police badges, and was again elbowed in the ribs. The man sitting next to the driver finally answered that they would soon see where they were going and find out what would happen when they got to “the top”. Everyone then remained silent for a moment. On the way out of Tbilisi, the driver called someone on his mobile phone, saying: “We’re on our way up. The road is fine; you can come up in your car”. Near Okrokana cemetery they stopped the car, pulled L.B.dze and the applicants’ son out and pushed them towards the cemetery. L.B.dze was dragged along by the driver of the vehicle and the man who had been sitting in the front. Suddenly he felt a violent blow to the neck and collapsed. His captors then started kicking him while one of them held a pistol to his head. At the same time, Sandro Girgvliani was being beaten by the third man.', '26. A short time later, L.B.-dze saw a fourth man, who had not been in the car. The man came up to him, aimed a gun at him and said he was only getting the punishment he deserved. He then kicked him in the face, fired a shot into the air then walked over to where Sandro Girgvliani was being beaten and started hitting him too.', '27. At one point the two men beating Sandro Girgvliani came over to those who were beating L.B.-dze and said “the other bastard’s got away”. They then made L.B.-dze take his clothes off, hit him some more and left him there.', '28. L.B.-dze managed to get up, with difficulty, and made his way back to the road. He walked along the road to a service station, where he woke up the watchman. He waited with the watchman until the early morning, when he was able to ask a passer-by to let him use his mobile phone to call the police. When questioned subsequently, the watchman confirmed L.B.-dze’s story.', '29. At the end of that interview L.B.-dze said that he was still in shock and could not remember any other details at that time.', '30. On 28 January 2006 L.B.-dze was granted civil party status and was questioned again in that capacity. He confirmed his previous statements and added that he had been pistol-whipped around the head.', '31. On 28 January 2006 the colleagues with whom Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze had spent the evening until 12.20-12.30 a.m. were all questioned. They confirmed that the applicants’ son and L.B.-dze had taken a taxi. They had not heard about the subsequent events and Sandro Girgvliani’s death until the next day.', '32. On 29 January 2006 L.B.-dze was arrested and placed under investigation for concealment of murder.', '33. On 29 January 2006 the waiters, the manager and the accountant at the Café Chardin were interviewed. They stated that on Fridays and Saturdays a percussionist played the drums in their café and a DJ played music. One of the waitresses said that table no. 5 had been occupied by G.D.-dze, the spokesperson for the Minister of the Interior, and 6 or 7 other people. According to her, G.D.-dze and his friends had left the café at around 2.40 a.m. She had not noticed any trouble or fight that evening. However, she would not have been able to overhear any unpleasant verbal exchanges between the clients because of the music played between 10 p.m. and 1 a.m. The person who had served coffee to the applicants’ son said that Mr Girgvliani had been joined by a friend who had gone to the toilets. The two had only ordered coffee and had left after about 20 minutes.', '34. On 30 January 2006 the investigating authority ordered the heads of all the police stations in Tbilisi to search their districts for silver Mercedes ML cars, to draw up lists of the owners, to get their photographs and their mobile and ordinary phone numbers and to find out about their professional contacts, friends, families and any possible criminal connections. The results of these investigations, which went on until 1 March 2006, were communicated to the investigating authorities by stages.', '35. On 30 January 2006, L.B.-dze, when questioned as an accused person, gave new information. He said that a young woman he did not know had joined them at their table in the Café Chardin. The applicants’ son had greeted her warmly. At the same time L.B.-dze had been talking to an acquaintance. He had nevertheless noticed that the discussion between the applicants’ son and the lady concerned had grown tense. He could not hear what they were talking about because Sandro Girgvliani and the lady were sitting very close to each other and the music was loud. After ten minutes the lady had stood up, angry, and gone back to the other table, around which there were other ladies but also some muscular-looking men. Sandro Girgvliani did not tell L.B.-dze who the woman was. No-one in the café had had an argument with Sandro. At the cemetery, when the applicants’ son was being beaten, L.B.-dze had not been able to see him, but he had heard his screams. Later, a fourth man had joined the other assailants. He had a gun. According to L.B.-dze, it was not impossible that that man had someone else with him, as Sandro Girgvliani was a strong man and it would not have been easy to hold him still while they subjected him to the kind of torture indicated by the marks on his body. It was also after that man arrived that the applicants’ son had let out a terrible scream. Sometimes the man in question left Sandro Girgvliani and came over to hit L.B.-dze. As he was being kicked in the face, L.B.-dze had had to cover his face, so he could not see exactly what was happening to his friend and how many men were beating him.', '36. On 30 January 2006 L.B.-dze was released, there being no evidence against him.', '37. On 30 January 2006 some clients of the Café Chardin who had known Sandro Girgvliani were questioned. They said they had witnessed no altercation in the café.', '38. On an unspecified date the investigator in charge of the case asked the mobile phone operators to provide lists of all the numbers which had been in communication on 28 January 2006 from certain antennas in Tbilisi, between midnight and 2 a.m. for some antennas and between 1 and 3.30 a.m. for others. On 31 January and 16 February 2006, the two operators supplied the data concerned in table form.', '39. On 30 January 2006 the investigator found that the crime could have been committed for reasons of personal revenge against L.B.-dze, who had left his wife to live with another woman. The Tbilisi City Court then ordered the monitoring of the telephone conversations of L.B.-dze’s ex-wife and his new wife from 31 January to 1 March 2006.', '40. On 31 January 2006 the investigator requested and obtained from one of the mobile phone operators a list of all the telephone numbers dialled between 10 and 31 January 2006 from the telephone of G.A.-ia, the first Deputy Director of Constitutional Security at the Ministry of the Interior.', '41. When questioned on 31 January 2006, Sandro Girgvliani’s lady friend Th.M.-dze made the same statements as on 13 March 2006 (see paragraphs 98-108 below), except that she did not mention Sandro Girgvliani’s having insulted G.D.-dze.', '42. According to an expert medical report of 31 January 2006, L.B.-dze had numerous bruises on his face and other parts of his body. They were considered light injuries that did not affect his ability to work.', '43. On 6 February 2006 the first applicant was granted civil party status.', '44. When questioned on 16 February 2006, A.K.-dze said that the discussion between Th.M.-dze and Sandro Girgvliani had been calm and she had not noticed whether O.M.-ov had left the café to go looking for cigarettes. The remainder of her testimony was the same as that given on 13 March 2006 (see paragraphs 111-112 below).', '45. D.A.-aia, V.S.-dze, G.D.-dze and T.S.-aia were also heard on 16 February 2006. The statements they made were essentially the same as those they made on 12 March and 20 June 2006 (see paragraphs 113123 below). However, T.S.-aia, the Minister’s wife, said nothing about asking Th.M.-dze if “everything was all right” when she came back to their table after talking to Sandro.', '46. When questioned on 16 February 2006, O.M.-ov said that on the evening of 27 January 2006 he had gone with his friend and hierarchical superior D.A.-aia to the Café Chardin. He had had a drink. He had no recollection of seeing Th.M.-dze change tables. There had been no incident or altercation. He said he had eventually found the cigarettes the Minister’s wife had asked for at an all-night vendor’s near B. supermarket. At about 3 a.m. they had all gone home in good spirits. Other than that, O.M.-ov gave the same account of events as on 22 July 2006 (see paragraph 199 below).', '47. Throughout the month of February 2006 shop assistants, night vendors and caretakers of establishments located on Leselidze street were questioned. None of them had noticed anything of relevance.', '48. On 28 February 2006 recordings made by the surveillance camera at the home of a wealthy businessman located on the road to Okrokana were seized from the head of security at the property, who also worked as a guard at the Ministry of the Interior. The recordings were of the period between 2 and 3 a.m. on 28 January 2006.', '49. On 5 March 2006 the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia, on the basis of “the Ministry of the Interior’s memo of 24 February 2006”, decided to take the case away from the Ministry of the Interior and hand it over to the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office.', '50. According to the criminal case file submitted to the Court, the memo in question was a classified internal document sent by D.A.-aia to the Minister of the Interior. It revealed, inter alia, that D.A.-aia was the person responsible in the Ministry of the Interior for elucidating the important aspects of the case. In the first part of the note D.A.-aia reported the same facts to the Minister as those described by L.B.-dze in his statements concerning the kidnapping and the assault that caused Sandro Girgvliani’s death (see paragraphs 25-28 above). It went on to explain that on the night in question he had been in the Café Chardin himself with a group of friends until 3.30 a.m., celebrating V.S.-dze’s birthday. G.A.-ia, his subordinate, had also been invited by V.S.-dze. According to D.A.-aia, he had spoken to G.A.-ia several times on the telephone from the Café Chardin to find out if he was coming. After confirming that he would be coming, G.A.-ia had informed D.A.-aia around 3 a.m. that he would not be able to make it after all.', '51. In the same memo, D.A.-aia explained to the Minister that on 2 February 2006 a regional manager from his department had informed him that a Mercedes ML that had been seized as evidence in a criminal case was being taken to Kutaisi. D.A.-aia had taken an interest in the vehicle and, on learning that it was a silver Mercedes ML, had decided to question a number of Ministry employees about it. He had thus been able to establish that on 28 January 2006 around 1.30 a.m. the car had left the courtyard of the Ministry with G.A.-ia and two other Ministry staff members, A.A.uri and A.Gh.-ava, on board. After seeking the necessary information from the mobile phone operator, D.A.-aia had been able to reconstitute G.A.ia’s movements and to conclude that on the night concerned he had been in the vicinity of the cemetery at Okrokana and had spoken on the phone with M.B.dze, another Ministry employee.', '52. Lastly, in the same written memo, D.A.-aia informed the Minister that he had asked G.A.-ia if he had been present at the scene of the crime on the night in question. G.A.-ia, strangely unsettled, had denied being there.', '53. According to D.A.-aia, all this seemed to indicate that G.A.ia, A.A.uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze might have had a hand in committing the crime in question. He asked the Minister to decide what course of action should be taken.', '54. On 6 March 2006 the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office cancelled the decision granting the first applicant civil party status on the ground that only the direct victim of the crime, that is, the son, was entitled to civil party status. As the direct victim in this case was dead, the only standing one of his parents could claim was as his heir.', '55. On 6 March 2006, L.B.-dze, in his civil party capacity, applied to the investigator in charge of the case, stating that he did not need to be assisted by counsel and that he declined the services of the two lawyers assigned to his case.', '56. That same day, L.B.-dze was asked to assist in identifying the presumed perpetrators of the crime, without the assistance of a lawyer.', '57. L.B.-dze identified G.A.-ia, the first Deputy Director of Constitutional Security at the Ministry of the Interior, “without any doubt”, as one of the people who had taken part in his kidnapping and assault at the cemetery in Okrokana.', '58. L.B.-dze identified A.Gh.-ava, a subordinate of G.A.-ia’s, as “possibly being” the driver of the Mercedes ML, but he could not be certain.', '59. L.B.-dze also said that A.A.-uri, another of G.A.-ia’s subordinates, “was probably” the man who had sat next to Sandro Girgvliani in the car. When asked by the prosecutor if he was 100% certain, L.B. said that he could not be 100% sure but that A.A.-uri resembled the man concerned.', '60. Finally, when faced with four unknown persons among whom M.B.dze, the second Deputy Director of Constitutional Security at the Ministry of the Interior, had been placed, L.B.-dze said that the man next to M.B.-dze could be one of the perpetrators of the crime, but he was not 100% sure. The man’s face and stature resembled the man who had beaten Sandro, who was the one with whom he had had the least contact.', '61. On 6 March 2006 G.A.-ia, A.Gh.-ava and A.A.-uri, but also M.B.dze, were arrested.', '62. On 6 March 2006 L.B.-dze was questioned as a civil party.', '63. According to the video recording of the interview, the investigator asked L.B.-dze if he wished to be assisted by a lawyer. L.B.-dze said he did not. He then confirmed his previous statements, adding that Sandro Girgvliani had made a phone call to someone from the taxi before suggesting that they stop by the Café Chardin. When they entered the café, L.B.-dze had gone to the toilet and then joined Sandro Girgvliani at a table. By the time Th.M.-dze had joined them at their table, music was playing. Th.M.-dze and the applicants’ son had been sitting quite close to one another, so it had been impossible for him to hear what they were talking about. Anyway, a friend had come to sit and talk to L.B.-dze for 2 to 5 minutes. This last sentence does not appear in the record of the interview included in the case file. According to L.B.-dze, Th.M.-dze and Sandro Girgvliani had not had an argument, but the discussion between them had been tense.', '64. L.B.-dze added that he himself had not had any argument with anyone in the café. He could not say for sure whether Sandro Girgvliani had, as he had left him to go to the toilet.', '65. L.B.-dze explained that when they had left the café, he and Sandro Girgvliani had not crossed the room together, but they had gone out into the street together. That statement does not appear in the record of the interview in the case file. However, the video recording shows that when L.B.dze said that, the investigator suggested including the following wording in the record, which he dictated himself: “I cannot remember if Sandro and I went out through the café door together. (...) it is possible that I was a little way behind him.” L.B.-dze then added himself that if he remembered rightly, before leaving the café he had gone to the toilet again. The investigator told him to note it down in the record.', '66. In answer to the investigator’s question whether anyone could have followed them as they left the café, L.B.-dze said he did not think so.', '67. Lastly, the investigator asked L.B.-dze if he thought the assailants had intended to kill him with Sandro. L.B.-dze thought they probably had not, considering that they had just abandoned him there, still alive, instead of killing him.', '68. Still on 6 March 2006, L.B.-dze was questioned again, with no lawyer present, about the fourth person who had arrived on the scene later.', '69. L.B.-dze said he could not rule out the possibility that the person concerned had not come alone. It was this man who had fired the shot in the air. In answer to a question from the investigator, L.B.-dze replied that he had indeed been invited by an MP into his office in the Parliament to look at a photograph and say whether he recognised the man in it. L.B.-dze had said that he could not be sure, but he thought the man in the photo “looked just like” the fourth man, who had joined them at the cemetery later. The MP had recorded the procedure, with L.B.-dze’s consent, and as the man in the photo was O.M.-ov, the recording had been made public. To the investigator, L.B.-dze said that the man in the photograph resembled the “fourth man”, but that he could be mistaken.', '70. When questioned on 6 March 2006, G.A.-ia said that he had been at work late on 27 January 2006 in the evening. Before going home, he had decided to stop by the Café Chardin, with A.A.-uri and A.Gh.-ava, to wish V.S.-dze a happy birthday. He had been invited, he explained. To get there, he had taken a Mercedes ML that was parked in the Ministry courtyard, having been impounded as evidence in a criminal case. G.A.-ia explained that he had given A.A.-uri number plates with the number WAW-293 to put on the car.', '71. The three men had stopped the car in Leselidze street near the café. Only G.A.-ia had got out of the car. At the entrance to the café, he found someone he did not know (Sandro Girgvliani) insulting G.D.-dze’s mother. On hearing this, G.A.-ia asked what the problem was. In response, Mr Girgvliani insulted him too and walked away. G.A.-ia decided to follow him “to find out why he was hurling insults”. He returned to the car and asked A.A.-uri, who was at the wheel, to follow the two men. He also asked his two colleagues if they had their pistols on them, as he thought they might need to make an arrest. When they replied that they were not armed, G.A.-ia called M.B.-dze on the phone and asked him to come and help them and to bring his gun.', '72. A.A.-uri pulled up alongside Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze, and G.A.-ia got out of the car and asked the two men to show their identity documents. Mr Girgvliani asked him in a very disparaging tone who he was. G.A.-ia said they were from the Ministry of the Interior and asked him for his papers again. Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze insulted him again. The discussion grew more heated and A.A.-uri got out of the car and told them to calm down. Sandro Girgvliani pushed him and A.A-uri fell over. According to G.A.-ia, Mr Girgvliani and L.B.-dze told the other men that they could go anywhere they liked and sort things out. They all decided to get in the car and go somewhere else. They drove twice round the main square in Tbilisi, while G.A.-ia tried to understand why Sandro Girgvliani had been insulting G.D.-dze. Then they stopped the car and told Sandro Girgvliani and his friend to get out, but they refused, saying that was no place to talk and they should go elsewhere. So they had gone to Okrokana, and stopped the car near the cemetery. Then they had all got out and started fighting. It was a bright night and there was fairly good visibility.', '73. M.B.-dze had soon come along to assist his colleagues. He had dealt mainly with Sandro. When Sandro Girgvliani had escaped, G.A.-ia had told M.B.-dze not to bother following him. The scuffle had lasted 15 minutes and it must have been 2 a.m. when they left Okrokana.', '74. G.A.-ia also maintained that on the way back from Okrokana he had received phone calls from D.A.-aia and G.D.-dze asking him if he was coming to V.S.-dze’s birthday party (cf. paragraph 154 below).', '75. When questioned on 6 March 2006, M.B.-dze maintained that after receiving a call for help from his superior, G.A.-ia, around 1.30 a.m., he had taken his weapon and gone to the Ministry of the Interior to pick up an official car, thinking that it would be necessary to arrest someone. When he reached Leselidze street he realised his colleagues had gone, so he called G.A.-ia, who told him they were on their way to Okrokana. When he drove there he spotted the Mercedes ML “which he thought his colleagues were using”. He headed towards the cemetery, where the noise was coming from. He found Sandro Girgvliani lying on the ground and L.B.-dze putting up a fight. His colleagues were accordingly concentrating their efforts on L.B.dze. Sandro Girgvliani had got up again, however, and attacked him. They had started to wrestle. Sandro Girgvliani’s clothes were ripped in the struggle. At one point M.B.-dze thought he saw a knife in Sandro Girgvliani’s hand. He took his gun out and fired into the air. That was when Sandro Girgvliani had taken the opportunity to run away. The struggle had lasted no longer than 15 minutes.', '76. M.B.-dze stated that neither he nor his colleagues had used any sharp weapons, and that he could only assume that, after escaping, Sandro Girgvliani must have injured himself on the wire fencing round the tombs or in the bramble bushes.', '77. When questioned on 6 March 2006, A.Gh.-ava confirmed G.A.-ia’s account of events. He also said that he and his colleagues had identified themselves to Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze as employees of the Ministry of the Interior. He said that Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze had got into the car of their own free will. A.Gh.-ava confirmed, like M.B.-dze, that it had been a clear night and that none of his colleagues had been carrying a knife or any other sharp object.', '78. When questioned on 7 March 2006, A.A.-uri gave exactly the same account as G.A.-ia, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze. As to the origins of Sandro Girgvliani’s wounds, A.A.-uri made the same suppositions as M.B.-dze.', '79. On 7 March 2006 a public prosecutor from Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office placed G.A.-ia, A.Gh.-ava, A.A.-uri and M.B.-dze under investigation for wilful bodily harm resulting in death (Article 119 of the Criminal Code) and premeditated false imprisonment by a group of persons with life-threatening violence (Article 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h) of the Criminal Code). On 8 March 2006 they were remanded in custody.', '80. On 8 March 2006 L.B.-dze, with no lawyer present, was called to identify the “fourth man”, who had arrived last at the cemetery. According to the video recording of this investigative measure, among the four men in the line-up to be presented to L.B.-dze, O.M.-ov took the third position from the left. The public prosecutor then invited L.B.-dze into the room and asked him to look carefully at the four men. L.B.-dze hesitated before saying: “I can’t be 100% sure ... the man must have been bigger, but I don’t know..., I don’t recognise, let’s say, going by the face..., I could say it was the second man from the left, or the third from the left.” The public prosecutor replied: “So you do not recognise any of these four people for sure.” L.B.-dze explained that he did not “recognise anyone for sure, but the two men he had picked out looked like the assailant who had arrived last at the cemetery”. The public prosecutor then invited him to write the report, including sentences he dictated to him: “Among the four individuals presented to me, I am unable to identify anyone as the individual who on 28 January 2006 committed the unlawful acts against me and against Sandro Girgvliani”. The public prosecutor then asked L.B.-dze to start a new paragraph, and L.B.-dze complied. The doubts and resemblances noted by L.B.-dze are not mentioned in the record of the proceedings, which also contains another error: according to the record, O.M.-ov was in the third position from the right, not from the left as seen in the video recording.', '81. When questioned on 8 March 2006, the barman from the Café Chardin explained that the musicians generally played as long as there were still clients in the establishment. A waitress, R.A., said that the percussionist played the bongo drums on Fridays and at the weekend, from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m. On the evening in question R.A. had recognised G.D.-dze and O.M.ov as soon as they had walked into the café. Even if she would not have been able to hear an argument with all the noise, R.A. could safely say that there had been no trouble at Sandro Girgvliani’s table or at the table where G.D.-dze, O.M.-ov and their friends had sat. One of G.D.dze’s friends, whose name she could not recall, had asked her what brands of cigarettes she sold. As she had not had the brand the person wanted, he had gone looking for them elsewhere.', '82. On 8 March 2006 the café’s accountant, a waiter L.M., a waitress and three patrons present in the café were questioned. They all said that there had been no trouble that evening. L.M. said he knew G.D.-dze, who had been at table no. 5 with some friends, by sight. They had still been there when he had finished work at 3.30 a.m. According to L.M., music was playing in the café from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.', '83. In spite of what it says in the corresponding reports, the video recordings of the above interviews are not included in the criminal case file submitted to the Court.', '84. On 9 March 2006, during a reconstruction at the scene of the crime, L.B.-dze said that the two men who had taken him out of the car and beaten him had stayed with him until the end. Some way off he could see Sandro Girgvliani lying on the ground covering his face with his hands, while the man who had elbowed him in the car to keep him quiet stood over him. L.B.-dze also said that the fourth assailant had probably arrived at the cemetery about ten minutes after them. Before Sandro Girgvliani had run away, L.B.-dze had heard a terrible scream and a shot fired into the air. According to the video recording of this investigative measure, L.B.dze said that when he managed to get to his feet again he started calling Sandro Girgvliani’s name, hoping to find him. He continued to call him, but in vain, after reaching the road. When no answer came he had started walking. He had tried to flag down a car, but no-one would stop for a half-naked man in the state he was in.', '85. On 10 March 2006 L.B.-dze was questioned again, with no lawyer present, the prosecutor simply explaining that he had the right to be represented, before proceeding with his questions. He was questioned, inter alia, about the contradiction between his statements to the authorities and those he had made on television concerning the moment when they left the café. On television he had stated that he and Sandro Girgvliani had had no run-in with G.A.-ia when they were leaving the café.', '86. L.B.-dze then explained that, first of all, inside the café there had been no incident resembling an argument or an altercation, but he did not exclude the possibility of some “latent conflict” between his friend and the other people in the café. Secondly, outside the café, that is to say, once they had stepped out into the street, there had been no incident or trouble of any kind. He could not, however, exclude the possibility that his friend had exchanged angry words with someone as they left the café, without him noticing. The prosecutor then reminded him that he had stopped off at the toilets when Sandro Girgvliani started making his way out of the café and that he had followed him out but had not been right beside him. L.B.dze agreed that something might have happened to his friend on the way out without him noticing. The prosecutor then dictated the following entry for the record: “I do not remember if there was any trouble when we left the café, because I seem to remember I went to the toilet. So I cannot say whether any incident occurred at that juncture”. The prosecutor explained that by “incident” he meant an exchange of words. L.B.-dze agreed.', '87. Insisting heavily on the possibility that an incident might have occurred on the way out of the café, the prosecutor asked L.B.-dze if he could say with any certainty that the accused G.A.-ia had not been there when they left the café. L.B.-dze could not say whether he had or had not been there.', '88. The prosecutor then asked L.B.-dze about his statement on television that O.M.-ov could have been one of the men who had assaulted them at the cemetery. The prosecutor reminded him that he had not been able to identify O.M.-ov on 8 March 2006 and asked him for an explanation. According to the video recording, L.B.-dze replied that although he had not been able to identify O.M.-ov, he could not rule out the possibility that he had been at the cemetery. When asked whether O.M.-ov really had been there or not, L.B.-dze repeated that he could not say he had not been there. To include these answers in the record, the prosecutor dictated to L.B.-dze: “I cannot say for sure that O.M.-ov was not one of the people who assaulted us at the cemetery ... I was unable to identify O.M.-ov, but I cannot exclude the possibility that he or any other person took part in the crime.”', '89. On 10 March 2006, the second applicant informed the prosecutor that he consented to his wife, the first applicant, being given standing as heir to the civil party, given that, pursuant to Article 68 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”), both parents could not claim that standing simultaneously. The first applicant was given that status on the same day.', '90. On 11 March 2006 statements made by B.E. on 2 March 2006 were verified at the scene of the crime. This young man, who lives in Okrokana, had helped Sandro Girgvliani’s friends to find his body in the woods. B.E. showed the place where, in the gorges of the river that runs past the cemetery, he had first spied the traces of a bloodied body that had fallen down in the snow. With Sandro Girgvliani’s friends they had followed the regular blood stains along the path. The young man confirmed that all along the way the traces of only one injured person had been visible.', '91. On 13 March 2006 a test run showed that the offenders would have needed 17 minutes and 33 seconds to drive from the Café Chardin to the cemetery in Okrokana 6.3 km away and back. O.M.-ov would have needed 18 minutes and 20 seconds to get to the B. supermarket 5.5 km from the café.', '92. According to a letter from the management of the Café Chardin, dated 14 March 2006, the surveillance camera only covered the area occupied by the bar and did not record pictures.', '93. When questioned on 15 March 2006, the bouncers at the café said that they had been in the entrance, between the two doors. The music had been loud and people had had to raise their voices to be heard. They reported that there had been no disturbance inside the café. They would not have been able to hear any argument outside because of the music. They could see out into the street through the large windows, but they would not necessarily have noticed any incident. In any event, their job was not to keep an eye on what went on in the street but to keep an eye on the inside of the café and the entrance.', '94. On 13 March 2006 the first applicant said that she had seen Th.M.dze’s interview on television, where Th.M.-dze said that L.Tch.shvili, a chauffer of the Ministry of the Interior, had bought T.S.aia two packets of cigarettes at the start of the evening. Considering that two hours was not enough time for T.S.-aia to have smoked two packets of cigarettes, the first applicant requested that the people present that evening be asked about the real reasons why O.M.-ov had left the café at the same time as her son and L.B.-dze. She also requested that O.M.-ov be asked how it was that the security camera at the B. supermarket showed that he had not gone there that evening.', '95. She further requested leave to take part in the above investigative measures, in conformity with Article 69 (i) of the CCP.', '96. On 15 March 2006 the first applicant’s requests were rejected by the public prosecutor, on the grounds that the points raised had already been elucidated and there was no need to repeat the investigative measures concerned.', '97. However, the applicant subsequently learned that, to clarify the points she had raised on 13 March 2006 the prosecutor had questioned A.K.-dze and Th.M.-dze on 13 March 2006 and D.A.-aia, V.S.-dze, T.S.aia and G.D.-dze on 20 June 2006, without informing her or inviting her to attend the proceedings.', '98. When questioned on 13 March 2006, Th.M.-dze stated that on the evening of 27 January 2006, at around 10.30 p.m., her friend A.K.-dze came to pick her up from her home to take her out for the evening. She had difficulty walking from her building to the car as the streets of Tbilisi were covered with ice. Th.M.-dze saw that A.K.-dze was not alone in the car; there was also the wife of the Minister of the Interior, whom she knew well, together with V.S.-dze, Director of the General Inspectorate of the Interior Ministry, whom she had not met before. The car was driven by V.S.-dze’s chauffeur. They headed for the Café Chardin. They found a table there and the Minister of the Interior’s wife asked V.S.-dze’s chauffeur to go and find her some K-brand cigarettes. The chauffeur, L.Tch.-shvili, left and returned ten minutes later with two packets of K cigarettes. L.Tch.-shvili then left the café and went to wait in the car for the rest of the evening.', '99. At around midnight Th.M.-dze received a phone call from Sandro. It appears they had had a tiff and he wanted to make up. She refused to see him, but Sandro Girgvliani insisted. Th.M.-dze misled him into thinking she was at a café in another part of the town and said she did not want to see him. To take the phone call, she had gone out into the café lobby, where the music was not so loud.', '100. Some 30-40 minutes after that phone call, D.A.-aia and O.M.ov had joined the Minister of the Interior’s wife and her group of friends. 5 to 10 minutes later, G.D.-dze had also joined them.', '101. At about 1.15 or 1.20 a.m. Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze entered the Café Chardin. Sandro Girgvliani went up to Th.M.-dze, gave her a kiss and asked her how she was. He then went to talk to some other people he knew in the room. 15 or 20 minutes later, he signalled to Th.M.-dze that he was about to leave. When Th.M.-dze asked him where he was going Sandro Girgvliani told her he was drunk and had to go home. Instead of leaving, however, he sat down at a nearby table with L.B.-dze and ordered a coffee. He then signalled to Th.M.-dze to come and join him. Th.M.-dze discreetly changed tables a few minutes later. The applicants’ son asked her who the men were with whom she had come to spend the evening. Th.M.-dze said they were friends of her friends and that she did not really know them. So Sandro Girgvliani asked her what she was doing spending her evening with strangers. She said it was of no importance whom she spent her evenings with and expressed surprise that he should have come all the way to the Café Chardin to ask her such a question. Sandro Girgvliani then asked her what she was doing with “that poof”, referring to G.D.-dze, the Minister of the Interior’s spokesman. According to Th.M.-dze, the tone of their conversation, which lasted 15-20 minutes, was “stilted” and Sandro Girgvliani was gesticulating. At one point A.K.-dze left the Minister of the Interior’s wife and her friends and went over to Th.M.-dze to ask her if everything was all right. Th.M.-dze said it was. A.K.-dze then went to the toilet and, on the way back, asked Th.M.-dze what she was doing. Th.M.dze said she would return to their table shortly. At the end of the conversation, Sandro Girgvliani suggested that Th.M.-dze leave the café with him. She said she would join him later and asked him to call her in half an hour. Th.M.-dze then went back to her table. The Minister’s wife asked her if “everything was all right”. Th.M.-dze said she was fine.', '102. Ten minutes later Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze got up to leave the café. On his way out, Sandro Girgvliani waved goodbye to Th.M.dze, who waved back and said she would join him later.', '103. Th.M.-dze stated that before she said the words “I’ll see you later” she heard the Minister’s wife ask O.M.-ov to go and buy some cigarettes, as there were only 2 or 3 left in the last packet. O.M.-ov, who was sitting next to Th.M.-dze, got up and blocked Th.M.-dze’s view; she had to lean over to tell Sandro Girgvliani she would join him. O.M.-ov went towards the exit at about the same time as Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze. Th.M.-dze could not see the door from where she was sitting, so she did not see who left first, O.M.-ov or Sandro Girgvliani and his friend. She could see the door to the toilets, however, and maintained that she did not see any of the three men go to the toilet before leaving the café.', '104. Th.M.-dze waited for Sandro Girgvliani to call her, as arranged, looking at her watch every so often. That was how she could be so sure that O.M.-ov, who had left the café at the same time as Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze, was gone for 30-40 minutes. When Sandro Girgvliani failed to call her, Th.M.-dze got annoyed and said she was leaving. A.K.-dze said they would all soon be leaving anyway. Th.M.-dze got the impression that they were waiting for O.M.-ov to come back before leaving the café.', '105. O.M.-ov came back 30-40 minutes later with the cigarettes in his hand. He looked cold. Th.M.-dze asked him if it was cold outside. He said it was. He explained that he had been unable to find any K-brand cigarettes in the vicinity and had had to go further afield – “to the B. supermarket” – to find them.', '106. At about 2.50 a.m. the evening came to an end and at about 3 a.m. they all got up to leave. V.S.-dze’s chauffeur drove Th.M.-dze and A.K.dze home. D.A.-aia took the Minister of the Interior’s wife home.', '107. It was 3.10 a.m. when Th.M.-dze got home.', '108. In answer to a question from the prosecutor, Th.M.-dze said she had not had a tense conversation with Sandro Girgvliani or his friend L.B.dze. Apart from calling one of them a “poof”, Sandro Girgvliani had not insulted the people she was with. In answer to another question, Th.M.dze said there was an 80% chance that the other people in the party had not overheard the insult in question, as Sandro Girgvliani was speaking in a normal tone and the music was loud. She also said that when she had gone back to her friends she had not told them what Sandro Girgvliani had called G.D.-dze. She further stated that there had been no contact between the applicants’ son and L.B.-dze and the group of friends at the other table.', '109. In a television interview Th.M.-dze stated that O.M.-ov had followed Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze out of the café.', '110. Subsequent examination of the video recorded by the surveillance system at the B. supermarket did not reveal that O.M.-ov had gone there on the night in question.', '111. When questioned for the second time, on 13 March 2006, A.K.dze stated that she and her friends went to pick up Th.M.-dze from her home around 10.30 a.m. She said she did not notice exactly when Th.M.-dze went over to join Sandro Girgvliani at his table. However, the 510minute conversation between Mr Girgvliani and Th.M.-dze had been calm and Sandro had not spoken at any time to any of the people in the group she was with. A.K.-dze maintained that she did not hear Mr Girgvliani insult anyone. When Th.M.-dze came back to her table, A.K.-dze asked her who the young man was that she had been talking to. Th.M.-dze told her he was a friend and he wanted her to leave with him. A.K.-dze had told her that she might as well go, as that was what he wanted. Th.M.-dze had been in good spirits. A.K.-dze confirmed that O.M.-ov had left the café at one point to buy cigarettes for the Minister of the Interior’s wife. She thought he was gone about 20-25 minutes. She confirmed that at the beginning of the evening the Minister’s wife had had a packet or two of cigarettes with her. A.K.-dze did not smoke. She categorically denied going over to Th.M.dze when she was talking to Sandro, to see if she was all right.', '112. According to the record of that interview, the interview was filmed, but contrary to what it says in the file, the video recording was not included in the criminal case file submitted to the Court.', '113. When questioned on 12 March and 20 June 2006, D.A.aia reiterated that he had arrived at the café with O.M.-ov at about 11.30 p.m., in his official car. He confirmed that the Minister of the Interior’s wife had asked O.M.-ov to go and fetch some K-brand cigarettes. D.A.-aia had nodded to O.M.-ov to do as she asked and had given him the keys to the official car. D.A.-aia had learned later that outside the café O.M.-ov had asked D.A.-aia’s chauffeur to take the car and go looking for cigarettes. According to D.A.-aia, O.M.-ov was away for 20 minutes and came back with a packet of cigarettes which he said he had bought “near B. supermarket”. According to D.A.-aia, O.M.-ov had appeared calm.', '114. D.A.-aia said that he had not smoked on the evening in question. He confirmed that he had spoken to G.A.-ia several times on the telephone to see if he was coming to join the party. After first confirming that he was coming, at about 3 a.m. G.A.-ia said he would not be joining them after all. Since arriving at the café, D.A.-aia had used O.M.-ov’s mobile phone, with his own SIM card in it, as the battery in his own mobile phone was flat.', '115. D.A.-aia maintained that no member of his group had had any altercation or incident with the people present in the café.', '116. Lastly, D.A.-aia explained that he had immediately informed the Minister of the Interior of what one of his department’s regional directors had reported to him on 2 February 2006 (see paragraphs 50-52 above). The Minister had instructed him in writing to continue investigating and discover the truth of the matter.', '117. When questioned on 12 March and 20 June 2006, V.S.dze confirmed what Th.M.-dze had said about the period prior to their arrival at the café. He added, however, that before going he had made a phone call to D.A.-aia telling him to bring their mutual friend G.A.-ia along. According to D.A.-aia, G.A.-ia was supposed to join them, but in the end he did not come.', '118. V.S.-dze confirmed that at one point Th.M.-dze had gone over to another table and at another juncture the Minister of the Interior’s wife had sent O.M.-ov to buy her some cigarettes. According to V.S.-dze, O.M.ov had returned 15-20 minutes later. V.S.-dze did not smoke. He too said that there had been no incident or altercation between his friends and any other person in the café.', '119. When questioned on 12 March and 20 June 2006, T.S.-aia said that V.S.-dze had come to pick her and A.K.-dze up at her home in his chauffeur-driven official car. They had then gone to pick up Th.M.dze They were at the café by about 11 p.m. D.A.-aia and O.M.-ov arrived at about 12.30 a.m. and G.D.-dze arrived at about 1.15 a.m. The remainder of her account corroborated V.S.-dze’s version of events.', '120. T.S.-aia did add, however, that when Th.M.-dze came back to their table after talking to Sandro, she asked her if “everything was all right”. Th.M.-dze, who was calm, said she was fine. T.S.-aia confirmed that later in the evening she had asked O.M.-ov to go and get her some Kbrand cigarettes. O.M.-ov had returned 20-25 minutes later. She further stated that shortly after they reached the café, V.S.-dze’s chauffeur had brought her two packets of cigarettes which he had bought near the B. supermarket. T.S.aia also said that there had been no altercation between her friends and any of the other people present in the café. Come midnight they had all wished V.S.-dze a happy birthday', '121. D.A.-aia had driven T.S.-aia home in his official car. O.M.ov and G.D.-dze were with them in the car.', '122. When questioned on 20 June 2006, G.D.-dze explained that his friend the Minister’s wife had called to say that she was dining at the Café Chardin and invited him to join her. G.D.-dze got to the café around 11.50 p.m. In answer to a question from the prosecutor, G.D.-dze said that he did not usually smoke, but on the evening in question he had smoked the cigarettes that were on the table. Indeed, everyone in the party, except D.A.aia and V.S.-dze, had smoked the same cigarettes. At one point he had noticed that there were none left, but later someone had brought some more. He had not noticed who had gone to buy more cigarettes.', '123. G.D.-dze did not know whether their colleague G.A.-ia had also been expected in the café that evening. He had no knowledge of any incident or altercation between his friends and anyone else in the café that evening and he had not heard anyone insult him.', '124. When questioned on 12 March 2006, V.S.-dze’s chauffeur confirmed that he had bought two packets of K-brand cigarettes for the Minister of the Interior’s wife at the start of the evening. Later, when he was waiting in the car for the party to end, O.M.-ov had called him and taken him to a nearby car park where D.A.-aia’s official car was parked. L.Tch.shvili had closed his car and walked towards O.M.-ov. As he passed by the Café Chardin he saw G.A.-ia, who was walking fast. He greeted him, but received no reply. G.A.-ia was alone. In the car park O.M.-ov told L.Tch.-shvili that he had been drinking and did not want to take D.A.aia’s official car to go and buy some cigarettes. He asked L.Tch.-shvili to drive. They drove off in search of the cigarettes and found some near the B. supermarket. They got back to the café about 30 minutes later.', '125. On 22 March 2006 the statements made by G.G., one of Sandro Girgvliani’s friends who had discovered the body, were verified at the scene of the crime. He explained that the police had arrived before them and there were many footprints in the snow at the cemetery. G.G. pointed out the place under a tree where he had seen what looked like the red imprint left by a bloodied face. The friends had gone through the cemetery and started to explore the river gorges. They asked a young village lad who was out bird-hunting (see paragraph 19 above) to help them. The lad spotted what looked like a large blood stain in the snow some way off. They saw that it led to other stains, some of which indicated that Sandro Girgvliani had had to lie down in the snow to rest at regular intervals. At one point they realised that the applicants’ son must have fallen off a ledge and tried to climb back up into the wood. At the edge of the wood he had turned into the bushes and fallen in the brambles.', '126. On 23 March 2006 the first applicant complained to the investigator in charge of the case that, in breach of section 86 § 2 of the law on detention, the four accused were sharing the same cell in prison no. 7 in Tbilisi. She argued that this gave them an opportunity to coordinate their stories to prevent the truth from emerging. She requested that the detainees be separated forthwith, in conformity with Article 161 § 1 of the CCP.', '127. That same day the first applicant submitted the same request to B.A.-aia, the director of the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice, and also to the Chief Public Prosecutor.', '128. On 30 March 2006 the first applicant complained to the Public Prosecutor’s Office that she had received no reply to her complaint of 23 March 2006.', '129. On 29 March 2006 the first applicant complained to the investigator in charge of the case that B.A.-aia, the above-mentioned director of the Prisons Department, who was also the brother of D.A.-aia, was making sure the four accused were as comfortable as possible in prison, inter alia, by allowing them access to alcohol and drugs. The detainees in the neighbouring cells would often hear them laughing and having a good time. The first applicant maintained that B.A.-aia was treating them like that to prevent them from incriminating his brother D.A.-aia. She requested that the authorities stop supplying the accused with drink and drugs and test them within 48 hours to detect the presence of alcohol and drugs in the bloodstream. She also requested authorisation to take part in this verification procedure as the civil party’s heir.', '130. No action was taken on this complaint.', '131. On 27 April 2006 the head of the Prison Department’s welfare service informed the first applicant that the four accused had indeed been placed in the same cell from 8 to 23 March 2006, because of renovation work in Tbilisi’s prison no. 7. Once the work was completed, they had been separated. The documents submitted to the Court by the Government for the hearing confirm that the accused were placed in the same cell. There is also documentary evidence that on 21 February and 25 March 2006 a company did some renovation work in prison no. 7.', '132. On 28 April 2006 section 86 § 2 of the law on detention was amended and the words “persons under investigation in the same criminal case shall be detained separately” were deleted.', '133. The first applicant considered that the comfort and leniency clearly shown to the four accused by the authorities was designed to prevent them from incriminating the senior Ministry of the Interior officials and the Minister’s wife who had been at the Café Chardin. She submitted that, in actual fact, G.A.-ia, A.A.-uri and A.Gh.-ava, three of the accused, had gone to the café after being summoned there by telephone to punish her son for having insulted the Minister of the Interior’s spokesman.', '134. On 25 April 2006 the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office asked the Department of Constitutional Security of the Ministry of the Interior, directed by D.A.-aia, for a copy of the criminal case file in which the Mercedes ML featured as evidence.', '135. The file shows that the vehicle was seized on 19 October 2005 as having been acquired with the proceeds of crime. On 13 December 2005, when the investigation into the present case was under way, the owner of the car lodged a complaint with the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Minister of the Interior, claiming that on 6 December 2005 he had seen his car being driven in Tbilisi with new number plates (WAW – 293). He said he had followed the car and taken photos of it, and had asked the driver by what right he was driving a car known to have been seized. In response, the chauffeur had threatened him. Saying that he could identify the driver, the owner of the car demanded that an investigation be opened without delay. On 13 December 2005 the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office referred the complaint to the Department of Constitutional Security of the Ministry of the Interior for “immediate verification”. However, the complaint was not followed up. On 4 February 2006 the investigator in charge of the case took the car keys from G.A.-ia to send the vehicle to Kutaisi and discovered that the seals had been broken. He immediately informed his superior in Kutaisi and asked him to take action.', '136. On 1 May 2006, at the request of the investigator in charge of the case of Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze, the Tbilisi City Court decided to dismiss the four accused from their respective posts in the Ministry of the Interior.', '137. On 1 May 2006 the first applicant requested that the Minister’s wife, G.D.-dze, D.A.-aia, V.S.-dze, O.M.-ov, A.K.-dze and Th.M.-dze be heard again in her presence, given that the recording made by the surveillance camera at B. supermarket that she had managed to obtain did not reveal that O.M.-ov had gone there on the night in question. She pointed out that a similar request she had made on 13 March 2006 had been rejected on the grounds that the points raised had already been elucidated. She asked to be informed of the investigative measures which had helped elucidate the points raised in her complaint, as well as the conclusions that had been reached.', '138. On 9 May 2006 her request was rejected because the people concerned had already been heard several times precisely to clarify the questions raised by the applicant in her complaint. To see the content of their statements she would have to wait for the case to be referred for trial, when she would have access to the criminal file.', '139. On 3 May 2006 the investigator invited the applicants and the first applicant’s father to be questioned about the applicant’s public statement that someone, acting through a third party, had offered her family a sum of money in exchange for their silence. On 4 May 2006 the applicants and the first applicant’s father explained that they had expressed their indignation at such a proposal and that the person who had delivered the message could be risking his life if ever the truth were to come out. The person concerned had told them that if they did not accept the money and remain silent, their lives could be in danger.', '140. The file shows that on 3 May 2006 the prosecuting authorities offered the four accused, in the presence of their lawyer, a plea-bargaining arrangement. In particular, they were offered a suspended sentence in return for identifying any senior Ministry of the Interior official or other person who had had a hand in the crime.', '141. According to the relevant video recordings, the four accused rejected that proposal. A.A.-uri replied: “Everyone who was there is now in prison.” A.Gh.-ava said: “I am naming no names, like I said the first time I was questioned, I know nothing and nobody was involved.” M.B.dze declared that nobody else, including the Minister of the Interior’s wife’s friends, was involved in the crime. After reading the offer in full, he repeated that, “dear to him as his freedom was”, he could not accept. G.A.ia said: “I cannot name any senior officials who were involved in the case.” The public prosecutor asked for an explanation. G.A.-ia said that he could not accept the offer. The public prosecutor asked him again: “You mean nobody else was involved – is that it?” G.A.-ia said yes. With the help of the public prosecutor and his lawyer, he stated in the record: “No member of the Ministry of the Interior or any other person was involved in this crime; so I cannot name anybody and must therefore reject the offer.”', '142. On 18 May 2006, one of the mobile telephone operators gave the public prosecutor a CD with the list of numbers G.A.-ia had been in contact with on the night in question, showing the location of the antennas covering the various calls. The list showed that G.A.-ia had been near the “Chardin” antenna at 1.56 a.m. and that later, at 2.17 and 2.35 a.m., he had had two telephone conversations via the “Okrokana” antenna. At 2.54 a.m. he was already back in the centre of Tbilisi near the main square and the Café Chardin. For the other calls, the number G.A.-ia had spoken to was indicated, but not for the two above-mentioned calls. However, cross-checking this information with other information found in another volume of the case file shows that at 2.17 and 2.35 a.m. D.A.-aia called G.A.-ia in Okrokana.', '143. On 16 May 2006 the four accused refused to have their statements verified at the scene of the crime.', '144. On 21 June 2006 the preliminary investigation was closed. The first applicant and L.B.-dze were given five volumes of the criminal case file for consultation. On 22 June 2006 the whole case concerning both Sandro Girgvliani and L.B.-dze was sent before the Tbilisi City Court for trial.', '145. On 20 June 2006 G.A.-ia, A.A.-uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze were charged with wilful bodily harm resulting in death, and premeditated false imprisonment by a group of persons with life-threatening violence and destruction of another person’s property (Articles 119 and 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h) and 187 § 1 of the Criminal Code). G.A.-ia was also charged with abuse of authority under Article 333 § 1 of the Criminal Code. Appended to the indictment was a list of the items of evidence collected by the prosecuting authorities during the investigation.', '146. On 27 June 2006 the Tbilisi City Court commenced its examination of the case. As the first applicant had not had access to the materials in the case file during the investigation, in conformity with Article 69 (j) of the CCP, and had not been informed of the referral of the case for trial until 24 June 2006, she said she needed an extra three days to study the five volumes of the criminal case file and prepare her position. She pointed out in this connection that, unlike the civil party, the accused had had unrestricted access to the file throughout the preliminary investigation, in keeping with Article 76 § 3 of the CCP.', '147. On 27 June 2006 her request was refused on the grounds that the first applicant and her lawyer had had access to the file during the investigation and after the case had been referred for trial, and they would have access to it throughout the trial.', '148. At the hearing on 27 June 2006 L.B.-dze reiterated in full the various statements he had made during the investigation. He explained that he and Sandro Girgvliani had left the café together. G.A.-ia had also been armed and both he and A.Gh.-ava had beaten him. He had been forced at gunpoint to take his clothes off. His assailants had taken his clothes away, leaving him in his underpants and socks. He had not been fully able to identify O.M.-ov, but could only be 70% sure that the man in the photograph was one of the assailants (see paragraph 80 above).', '149. At the hearing on 29 June 2006 Th.M.-dze fully confirmed the various statements she had made during the investigation. In her opinion Sandro Girgvliani had guessed she was at the Café Chardin because he had heard the sound of the bongo drums during their telephone conversation (see paragraph 99 above). When she talked to Sandro Girgvliani at his table, she had her back to her friends and could not tell whether G.D.-dze had heard Sandro Girgvliani insult him. Th.M.-dze had not smoked any K-brand cigarettes. According to her, only the Minister’s wife had smoked those cigarettes. At the table nobody had asked whether G.A.-ia was supposed to join them.', '150. On 30 June 2006 D.A.-aia fully confirmed the statements he had made during the investigation. Notably, he reiterated that the mobile phone he had used in the café was O.M.-ov’s, with his own SIM card in it, as the battery in his own mobile phone was flat. He added that the telephone number (8 77 79 89 60) that featured most frequently in the lists of calls made and received by each of the Ministry of the Interior officials present in the café that night was the number of a colleague of his called M-eli.', '151. However, the criminal case materials contained a letter dated 2 March 2006 issued by the relevant mobile company, according to which the telephone number 8 77 79 89 60 belonged to a certain K.N.-dze from the limited liability company “Falko”. Furthermore, the records of the telephone calls made and received by some of the persons involved, which had been obtained by the investigation at various stages and included in the case file, disclosed that the number in question had been contacted during the night in question by:', '- G.A.-ia at 12.31 a.m., 1.04 a.m., 1.26 a.m., 1.46 a.m., 2.01 a.m. and 2.12 a.m.;', '- D.A.-aia at 1.28 a.m.;', '- G.D.-dze at 1.32 a.m., 1.36 a.m., 1.45 a.m.;', '- O.M.-ov at 1.26 a.m. and 1.27 a.m.', 'In addition, those records also showed that G.D.-dze and V.S.-dze had contacted another telephone number – 877 76 76 90 – several times between 1.50 and 1.55 a.m., and that D.A.-aia had called G.D.-ze at 1.56 a.m.', '152. Giving evidence on 30 June 2006, the Minister’s wife T.S.-aia fully confirmed the various statements she had made during the investigation. She added that she had not been told that G.A.-ia had also been invited to the party. D.A.-aia had often been on the telephone, but she had not heard what he was talking about because of the noise.', '153. On 30 June 2006 V.S.-dze also fully confirmed the statements he had made during the investigation. He stated that he had learnt from D.A.ia that G.A.-ia had been supposed to join their party in the café.', '154. Also on 30 June 2006, G.D.-dze fully confirmed the statements he had made during the investigation, adding that he had not been told that G.A.-ia had also been invited to the party (cf. paragraph 74 above). He also said that it was not impossible that D.A.-aia or someone else had used his telephone, which he had left on the table. At one point someone had called his number asking to speak to D.A.-aia. He himself had not made any calls to the accused. G.D.-dze also added that nobody had insulted him in the café.', '155. In their testimonies on 30 June 2006, O.M.-ov and A.K.-dze fully confirmed the statements they had made during the investigation. O.M.ov said that he had been unaware that their group in the café had been waiting for G.A.-ia. A.K.-dze said that she could not really remember, but did not exclude the possibility that she had gone over to Sandro Girgvliani’s table to say something to Th.M.-dze.', '156. At the hearing on 3 July 2006, L.Tch.-shvili confirmed the statements he had made during the investigation. He added that O.M.ov had called him from a number he did not recognise.', '157. Also on 3 July 2006, G.A.-ia confirmed the statements he had made during the investigation, adding that as Deputy Director of the Ministry of the Interior he had no need to receive instructions from anybody to arrest an individual who was breaking the law under his nose. He acknowledged, however, that as time passed the discussion had gone beyond the limits of a routine job. Sandro Girgvliani had insulted G.D.-dze’s mother and the “mothers of the KGB” who were inside the café. G.A.-ia said that he had not been carrying a gun that evening. On the way to Okrokana he had called G.D.-dze’s number to speak to D.A.-aia, whom he had been unable to contact by any other means.', '158. On the same day A.A.-uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze refused to testify and remained silent.', '159. Still on 3 July 2006, the first applicant requested that the court, in conformity with Articles 69 (j), 439 § 4, 440 § 1 and 485 § 2 of the CCP, examine the following items of evidence publicly and with the participation of the parties (“the fourteen exhibits”):', 'i. the video of the verification of L.B.-dze’s statements, recorded at the scene of the crime on 9 March 2006;', 'ii. the video of the verification of G.G.’s statements, recorded at the scene of the crime on 22 March 2006;', 'iii. the video of the verification of B.E.’s statements, recorded at the scene of the crime on 11 March 2006;', 'iv-vii. the videos of 6 March 2006 showing L.B.-dze identifying G.A.ia, A.A.-uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze;', 'viii. the video of 8 March 2006 showing L.B.-dze identifying O.M.ov;', 'ix. the video of 6 March 2006 showing L.B.-dze’s second interview;', 'x. the video of 10 March 2006 showing L.B.-dze’s additional hearing;', 'xi. the two video cassettes of 13 March 2006 showing Th.M.-dze’s additional questioning;', 'xii. the compact disc containing the images recorded by the surveillance camera at the home of B.P., a wealthy businessman, on the road from Tbilisi to the Okrokana cemetery (the Tbilisi-Kojori road);', 'xiii. four compact discs of 13 March 2006, with recordings of Th.M.dze’s additional questioning;', 'xiv. a sketch tracing the presumed movements of Sandro Girgvliani at the scene of the crime.', '160. On 3 July 2006 the court allowed this request only in respect of the exhibits numbered iii and xii above, but only ordered the publication of a written summary of the two video recordings concerned. The court pointed out that the people whose statements were recorded on the other CDs concerned had already been heard by the court. Furthermore, the records of these investigative measures, which had been filmed, were in the case file and the applicant had never challenged them.', '161. On 5 July 2006 the first applicant requested that the evidence in the case file be made public and examined at the hearing, in keeping with Article 484 of the CCP.', '162. The court rejected that request on the same day, holding that the evidence had already been examined in public and it was not necessary to examine it again.', '163. On 5 July 2006 L.B.-dze’s lawyer requested that the two mobile phone operators be asked to supply records of all the telephone calls made and received by the four accused but also by the seven people who had sat at the same table in the café as the Minister of the Interior’s wife. The first applicant joined in this request, arguing that the case file did not contain necessary information concerning telephone calls that might have been made between the four accused and their friends in the café, or between the accused, their friends in the café and V.S.-dze’s chauffeur waiting in the car. She maintained that without that information it was impossible to know whether G.A.-ia had really had an altercation with her son which had nothing to do with the Ministry of the Interior officials sitting in the café, or whether, as she suspected, after being insulted by her son the officials had called G.A.-ia to come and punish Sandro.', '164. That request was rejected on 5 July 2006.', '165. At the hearing on 5 July 2006 L.B.-dze asked to be heard again. He then said that now he had seen O.M.-ov again and listened to him and observed him when the court had heard him as a witness, he could now say with certainty that he was indeed the man who had joined the other assailants at the cemetery and participated, with particular cruelty, in the attack on him and Sandro. L.B.-dze further stated that he had also been observing M.B.-dze since the start of the trial and was now convinced that he had not been present in Okrokana. What he had said about the behaviour of the fourth man, who had arrived at the cemetery after the others, therefore concerned O.M.-ov and not M.B.-dze. L.B.-dze further explained that at the time of the investigation he had believed that the public prosecutor and he were on the same side. Later, however, he had realised that the prosecutor was strongly backing the hypothesis of an altercation between Sandro Girgvliani and G.A.-ia in the entrance to the café. During the different identification parades on 6 March 2006 the prosecutor had advised him not to request the assistance of a lawyer, as the suspects had just been arrested and no time should be lost. The prosecutor had also advised L.B.-dze that it would be “better” if he could not identify O.M.-ov.', '166. On 5 July 2006 L.B.-dze was placed under investigation for intentionally perverting the course of justice with manifestly contradictory statements (see paragraphs 194-203 below).', '167. On 5 July 2006 the president of the court decided to allow the parties an hour to prepare their closing statements. The first applicant protested that she needed a week, because she had not had time to familiarise herself properly with the case file, either between the time when the case was referred for trial and the start of the trial or during the actual trial, which had only lasted nine days. If she was to be able to defend her rights, she needed a week.', '168. Her request was rejected.', '169. On 5 July 2006 L.B.-dze’s lawyer, having regard to the available records of a selection of the telephone calls made and received by G.A.ia, D.A-aia, G.D.-dze and O.M.-ov on the night in question, asked the judge to order the two mobile phone operators in Tbilisi to communicate the names of the subscribers with the telephone numbers 8 77 79 89 60, 8 77 48 48 45, 8 99 96 00 01 and 8 99 75 10 89 (see paragraphs 150-151 above). The first applicant additionally requested that the records of the phone calls of A.A.uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze, as well as all those present at the Minister’s wife’s table, also be provided. The public prosecutor objected that that information had nothing to do with the charges.', '170. The judge rejected these requests the same day. The lawyers then challenged the judge, arguing that if he did not consider it necessary to obtain information so important for the case, he was clearly partial and incapable of pronouncing a fair judgment. The judge rejected the challenge outright.', '171. On 6 July 2006 the Tbilisi City Court, in view of the abrogation on 28 April 2006 of Article 119 of the Criminal Code, reclassified the offences as crimes under the new Article 117 § 6 of that code. It thus found G.A.ia guilty of premeditated false imprisonment by a group of persons with lifethreatening violence (Article 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h) of the Criminal Code), wilful bodily harm resulting in death (Article 117 § 6 of the Criminal Code), abuse of authority (Article 333 § 1 of the Criminal Code) and destruction of another person’s property (Article 187 § 1 of the Criminal Code). A.A.-uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze were found guilty of the crimes provided for in the above-mentioned Articles 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h), 117 § 6 and 187 § 1.', '172. G.A.-ia was sentenced to 8 years’ imprisonment (7 years under Article 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h), 6 years under Article 117 § 6, 1 year under Article 333 § 1 and 1 year under Article 187 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The other three accused were sentenced to 7 years’ imprisonment each (6 years under Article 143 § 2 (a), (c) and (h), 6 years under Article 117 § 6 and 1 year under Article 187 § 1 of the Criminal Code).', '173. The prosecution appealed against that decision, asking for the sentences to be increased to eight and nine years respectively. The first applicant joined in the appeal, in conformity with Article 25 § 1 of the CCP. She did not consider it worthwhile lodging a separate appeal as the appeal court would have examined the case only within the framework of the charges specified in the first-instance judgment (Article 450 of the CCP) and would not have been able to reclassify them as aggravated murder (Article 109 of the Criminal Code) as she would have wished, or to refer the case for additional investigation (Articles 498 and 501-504 of the CCP).', '174. On 18 July 2006 the offenders were placed in Avchala prison no. 10.', '175. On 20 and 26 July and 11 September 2006 the first applicant appealed to the president of the court that examined the case at first instance and on 3 August 2006, to the president of the criminal section of that court, requesting access to the fourteen exhibits in the case file before it was sent to the Court of Appeal (Articles 69 (j) and 485 § 2 of the CCP). The president of the court did not reply. The first applicant reiterated her request on 11 September 2006. On 18 September 2006 she was told that the case file containing the exhibits had already been sent to the Court of Appeal.', '176. On 6, 17 and 30 October, 24 November and 8 December 2006 the first applicant asked the Tbilisi Court of Appeal to give her access to the fourteen exhibits in question. She pointed out that on 3 July 2006 the court of first instance had rejected the same request and that she had applied in vain to the president of the court on 20 and 26 July and 11 September 2006. She argued that without access to the evidence concerned she would be unable to properly defend her rights in the appeal proceedings.', '177. No reply was received to any of these requests, except that of 8 December 2006, which was rejected on the same day. The applicant later challenged that decision, together with the appeal court’s judgment, on points of law.', '178. On 8 December 2006 the applicant asked the Court of Appeal:', '- to order the two mobile phone operators to produce the records of the telephone calls made and received between midnight and 12 noon on 28 January 2006 on the telephone numbers of the four accused, the seven people who were at the same table in the café as Th.M.-dze, and also L.Tch.-shvili, stating the location of the corresponding antennas;', '- to give her access to the recording made by the surveillance camera at the home of a wealthy businessman on the road to Okrokana between midnight and 12 noon on 28 January 2006. The applicant explained that only a recording covering the period between 2 and 3 a.m. had been included in the case file by the investigating authorities and that did not show the traffic using that road before 2 a.m. and after 3 a.m.;', '- to question G.D.-dze, Th.M.-dze, T.S.-aia and A.K.-dze in order to double-check the telephone numbers these people had used on the night in question.', '179. On 8 December 2006 the applicant’s request was rejected.', '180. On 8 December 2006 the applicant asked the Court of Appeal to summon the two Ministry of the Interior investigators who had been in charge of the investigation prior to 5 March 2006, to question them about the records they had seized from the mobile phone companies but not included in the case file. She also asked the Court of Appeal to obtain those records and any other evidence the investigators might have gathered and not included in the case file.', '181. Her request was rejected.', '182. On 11 December 2006 the four accused refused to attend the hearing and informed the Court of Appeal that they would be represented by counsel.', '183. On the same date, 11 December 2006, the Tbilisi Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment in full. Concerning L.B.-dze’s identification of O.M.-ov, it found the allegation ill-founded, pointing out that, in any event, M.B.-dze had confessed to being the fourth assailant, who had arrived last at the cemetery. Lastly, the Court of Appeal explained that the court of first instance would not have been able to examine the question of O.M.-ov’s involvement anyway, as O.M.-ov was not concerned by the criminal case as referred for trial (Article 450 of the CCP).', '184. On 19 December 2006 and 4 January 2007, the first applicant applied to the Court of Appeal to give her access to the fourteen exhibits, to enable her to defend her rights at least in cassation. She received no reply.', '185. On 21 December 2006 the first applicant applied to the Principal State Prosecutor, requesting the investigators who had been in charge of her son’s case to be placed under investigation for abuse of authority and destruction of evidence. In particular she maintained:', '- that the offenders’ deeds had been deliberately misclassified as wilful bodily harm resulting in death, when her son had in fact been the victim of a crime under Article 109 of the Criminal Code, namely aggravated murder (committed by a group, with particular cruelty, out of self-interest, to order);', '- that the investigating authorities had failed to consider the possibility suggested by various aspects of the case that D.A.-aia, V.S.-dze, G.D.-dze, O.M.-ov, T.S.-aia, Th.M.-dze and A.K.-dze or any one of them had been involved in the crime;', '- that the investigating authorities of the Ministry of the Interior in charge of the investigation between 28 January and 5 March 2006 had destroyed evidence. In particular, the applicant alleged that she had obtained, by chance, a copy of the decisions of 31 January and 1 February 2006 in which the Tbilisi City Court found lawful such investigative measures as requiring the mobile phone companies to submit the records of all the phone calls made and received between 10 January and 31 January 2006 on the telephones of A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze. However, the records of those calls, the records of their seizure, the investigators’ request for the Tbilisi City Court to allow the seizure and the two decisions mentioned above had not been included in the case file, so the court had not been able to examine them. As they were missing from the case file, the applicant presumed that the evidence must have been destroyed or concealed. In its stead, on 11 May 2006 the investigating authorities of the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office had placed in the case file, for the same telephone numbers, a selection of the records of the calls concerned, namely, those made between 1.28 and 2.58 a.m. on 28 January 2006. That incomplete information, however, did not serve the purpose of an effective investigation.', '186. The Chief Public Prosecutor having failed to reply, the applicant reiterated her request on 16 February 2007, demanding a prompt reply.', '187. The Chief Public Prosecutor again failed to reply.', '188. On 11 January 2007 the first applicant lodged a cassation appeal against the appeal judgment of 11 December 2006 and all the procedural decisions pronounced in the appeal proceedings, including the decision of 8 December 2006 denying her access to the different items of evidence. In particular, she asked for the judgment of the Court of Appeal to be quashed, the procedural decisions set aside and the case referred to the Tbilisi Court of Appeal for fresh examination. The applicant stressed that her aim was to have a full and exhaustive investigation carried out. If this had been done earlier, the complicity between the four accused and the Minister’s wife’s friends in the café would have been demonstrated.', '189. On 16 February 2007 the first applicant asked the Supreme Court of Georgia, when examining her appeal, to grant her access to the fourteen exhibits. She reiterated that without examining that evidence she would not be able to defend her interests as a civil party (Articles 15 §§ 3 and 5, 69 (k), 447 § 1 and 485 § 2 of the CCP). Her request went unanswered.', '190. L.B.-dze and the four convicted persons also lodged cassation appeals.', '191. On 27 July 2007, the Supreme Court of Georgia, acting as final court of appeal, found that the guilt of the four officials concerning the destruction of another person’s property (Article 187 § 1 of the Criminal Code) had not been validly demonstrated and acquitted them of that charge, reducing each of their prison sentences by six months, but upheld the remainder of the earlier judgment.', '192. Concerning the complaint about the repeated refusal of access to evidence, the Supreme Court noted that the matter had been examined at first instance and that there had subsequently been no particularly important grounds to justify its further examination in application of Article 553 § 4 of the CCP. In addition, no appeal had been lodged against the decisions of the court of first instance. Lastly, the purpose of the first applicant’s demands had mainly been to prosecute persons external to the criminal case in point as brought against the four accused persons. However, a court was not a criminal prosecution body under Articles 15 § 5 and 439 § 3 of the CCP and the scope of its deliberations was confined to the charges in the indictment (Article 450).', '193. The Supreme Court’s decision was served on the parties and the civil parties on 30 July 2007.', '194. After accusing O.M.-ov at the hearing on 5 July 2006, L.B.-dze was charged with perverting the course of justice by making manifestly contradictory statements (Article 371-1 of the Criminal Code).', '195. On 11 July 2006 he was questioned in this connection in the presence of his lawyer. He explained that at the different identification parades on 6 March 2006 (see paragraph 56 above) he had not been assisted by any lawyer who could have advised him. The investigator, on the other hand, had impressed on him that it would be “extremely serious if he identified the wrong person and that he should think carefully”. L.B.-dze had been able to identify G.A.-ia without any doubt. The investigator had then told him that for the other suspects it would be sufficient for him to say whether there was a physical resemblance. L.B.-dze remembered that when he had been invited into an MP’s office he had said that the man in the photograph looked like the fourth man, who had arrived later at the cemetery, but as he was not certain, he preferred not to incriminate him. He had not really been able to dispel his doubts until he had seen O.M.-ov give evidence in court. Only then had he been convinced, by the way O.M.-ov moved and spoke, that he was indeed the fourth assailant. To make absolutely sure, however, he had borrowed a video recording of O.M.-ov’s hearing from the first applicant which had apparently been made in secret. After watching the recording several times, L.B.-dze had been able to identify O.M.-ov with certainty. He repeated that he could not exclude the possibility that there had been more than four assailants at the cemetery, but he had only seen four. L.B.-dze pointed out that he had said several times in court that he did not know who M.B.-dze was. He also specified that on 6 March 2006 he had not identified that person as the fourth assailant (see paragraph 60 above). The fourth assailant had kicked him in the face, held a gun against his head and eye and threatened to kill him, and pistol-whipped him. He had then gone over to hit Sandro Girgvliani before coming back to him again. According to L.B.-dze, when it was all over and he found himself alone with his assailants, O.M.-ov had suggested to his friends that they take a photograph of their bruised and naked victim with a mobile phone.', '196. At the end of the record of that interview it is mentioned that the lawyer had wanted to ask L.B.-dze some additional questions, but the investigator would not authorise it.', '197. On 12 July 2006 L.B.-dze, as an accused person, requested that criminal proceedings be brought against O.M.-ov, with himself as a civil party, and that a thorough medical check-up be carried out to determine how serious the after-effects of the ill-treatment he had suffered on 28 January 2006 were.', '198. On 13 July 2006 his request was rejected, on the grounds that the criminal case being investigated was against L.B.-dze, for perverting the course of justice, not against O.M.-ov. The right of application to the prosecuting authorities was explained to him.', '199. On 22 July 2006 O.M.-ov was questioned as a witness in the case. He said that at around midnight on 27 January 2006 D.A.-aia had called him in his office and asked him to go down to the courtyard of the Ministry so they could take the official car together. They were already in town when D.A.-aia told him that he was going to the Café Chardin to wish V.S.-dze a happy birthday. As D.A.-aia’s mobile phone battery was flat O.M.-ov lent him his and D.A.-aia put his SIM card in it. In the café O.M.-ov found the Minister’s wife, the young women mentioned earlier and V.S.-dze. O.M.ov ordered an alcoholic beverage. About an hour and a half after they arrived in the café, the Minister’s wife asked him to go and find her some K-brand cigarettes, a brand they did not stock in the café. D.A.-aia gave him his car keys. He had been drinking, however, and did not want to drive, so, using G.D.-dze’s mobile phone he called V.S.-dze’s chauffeur to drive him. Before leaving the café, he went to the toilet. Outside, he met V.S.-dze’s chauffeur, who took him away in D.A.-aia’s car in search of cigarettes. They bought the cigarettes from a night vendor near the B. supermarket. He then went back to the café. He must have been away for 20-25 minutes. According to O.M.-ov, the statement made by L.B.-dze on 5 July 2006 was untrue and merely the result of pressure brought to bear by the first applicant and anti-Government activists.', '200. On 6 July 2006 the first applicant applied to the Chief Public Prosecutor requesting that, in the light of L.B.-dze’s statement of 5 July 2006, and in conformity with Articles 22, 261 and 263 § 1 of the CCP, O.M.-ov be arrested immediately as a prime suspect and placed under investigation, and that she be given status in the case as the civil party’s heir. She requested that the case be taken away from the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office, which had failed to conduct an effective investigation, and that the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office take charge of the investigation of O.M.-ov’s case.', '201. On 11 July 2006 her request was referred to the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office, which informed the first applicant on 25 July 2006 that, in the framework of the criminal proceedings against L.B.-dze, the statement he had made on 5 July 2006 would be verified and an “objective and lawful” decision taken.', '202. On 3 August 2006 the first applicant requested that the criminal proceedings against L.B.-dze be taken out of the hands of the Tbilisi City Prosecutor’s Office for the reasons mentioned above and that the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office take charge of the case. That request was rejected as unfounded by a prosecutor from the Chief Public Prosecutor’s Office on 4 August 2006.', '203. Neither the first applicant nor her lawyer found out what the outcome of the criminal proceedings against L.B.-dze had been. On receiving the observations of the Government (see paragraphs 5 above and 294 below), the applicant party learned that the case had been discontinued.', '204. On 24 November 2008 the President of Georgia, along with pardoning 363 other prisoners, decided to grant G.A.-ia, A.A.uri, A.Gh.ava and M.B.-dze a measure of clemency and reduce the remainder of their respective sentences by half.', '205. As that measure made them eligible for release on licence, the four men applied to the competent body in the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice on 14 August 2009 to be released. According to the certificates appended to their requests by the prison authorities, the men’s behaviour had been good (calm, courteous and on good terms with the prison authorities) and none had received any reprimand while in detention. Based on a unanimous favourable decision of the board on 21 August 2009, which described the crime committed by G.A.-ia, A.A.-uri, A.Gh.-ava and M.B.-dze as “physical aggression towards other persons which resulted from a verbal altercation” (“urTierTSelaparakebis niadagze fizikuri Seuracxyofa miayenes moqalaqeebs”), the Tbilisi City Court decided, on 5 September 2009, to release the four convicts on licence. It noted in particular that the men had served two-thirds of their sentences as reduced on 24 November 2008 (Article 72 § 8 of the CCP), and took their good behaviour into account. In the court’s opinion their continued detention was no longer necessary to reform them.', '206. On 6 July 2009 the second applicant applied to the Tbilisi City Court requesting that the four men be ordered to pay him 200,000 Georgian laris ((“GEL), approximately 84,000 euros (“EUR”)) for the non-pecuniary damage he had suffered. He said that the pain caused by the murder of his only son and the ill-treatment inflicted on him before he died was a source of immeasurable suffering that would remain with him all his life.', '207. To have his claim examined the second applicant had to pay a State tax of GEL 3,000 (approximately EUR 1,262).', '208. By a judgment of 5 February 2010, the four individuals were ordered, in first instance, jointly to pay the applicant GEL 40,000 (approximately EUR 16,832) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It was also decided to refund GEL 600 (approximately EUR 254) of the State tax he had had to pay.', '209.

As disclosed by the Government’s submissions, supported by a summary of the relevant official statistical data issued by the relevant department of the Supreme Court of Georgia, in 2006 three persons were convicted of wilful grievous bodily harm resulting in death (Article 117 § 6 of the Criminal Code), all of them being sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment without remission.', '213. In the same year, 199 persons were convicted of false arrest by a group, with premeditation and life- or health-threatening violence (Article 143 § 2 of the Criminal Code), 105 of whom were given suspended prison sentences. The duration of those sentences varied from one to eight years – 78 persons were sentenced to three years in prison, 36 persons to four years and 44 persons to five years. In 2007, the prison sentences imposed for the same crimes varied between three and seven years.', '214. Still in 2006, 32 persons were convicted of abuse of authority (Article 333 § 1 of the Criminal Code). 17 of them were sentenced to two years’ imprisonment without remission and 15 were given suspended prison sentences. Only on two occasions was the penalty of disqualification from holding public office also pronounced.', '215. The Government also submitted numerous (more than 30) judgments delivered by various courts of first instance in 2006 under, inter alia, the above-mentioned three provisions of the Criminal Code. However, the voluminous information contained in those judgments was not presented in an analytical and pertinent summary, nor was it clear whether those judgments were ever upheld by the upper courts and thus became binding in their initial wording.', '216. In reply to the Government’s submissions, the applicants likewise submitted numerous decisions delivered by the Supreme Court in 20062008 upholding the lower courts’ convictions under various provisions of the Criminal Code, including Articles 117 § 6, 143 § 2 and 333 § 1. The major part of that voluminous information was not presented in an analytical and pertinent summary and was thus barely comprehensible.', '217. However, amongst those decisions, as the applicants emphasised themselves, there were those concerning the case of G.Z.-dze, which attracted publicity in Georgia. Notably, as disclosed by the relevant case materials, in the course of a verbal altercation with a stranger in the street, the fourteen-year-old boy stabbed the stranger in the right shoulder with a folding pocket knife. A subsequent forensic medical report confirmed the injury inflicted was of a superficial nature and did not cause any serious damage. The act was classified as attempted murder, and the boy was sentenced by the Tbilisi Court of Appeal’s decision of 19 March 2007 to seven years’ imprisonment without remission. The Supreme Court of Georgia left that conviction intact by its final decision of 1 November 2007.']","['2', '38']",['2-1'],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1956. At the time the application was lodged he lived in Elgoibar (Gipuzkoa).', '7. At the time of the events, the applicant was spokesperson for Sozialista Abertzaleak, a left-wing Basque separatist parliamentary group in the Parliament of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country.', '8. On 21 February 2003, following an order issued by central investigating judge no. 6 of the Audiencia Nacional, the premises of the daily newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria were searched and then closed, on account of the newspaper’s alleged links with the terrorist organisation ETA. Ten persons were arrested, including the newspaper’s senior managers (members of the board and the editor-in-chief). After spending five days in secret detention the persons concerned complained that they had been subjected to ill-treatment in police custody.', '9. On 26 February 2003 the President of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country received the King of Spain at the opening of an electricity power station in the province of Biscay.', '10. At a press conference held the same day in San Sebastián, the applicant, as spokesperson for the Sozialista Abertzaleak parliamentary group, outlined his group’s political response to the situation concerning the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria. Replying to a journalist he said, with reference to the King’s visit to the Basque Country, that “it [was] pathetic”, adding that it was “a genuine political disgrace” for the President of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country to be inaugurating the project with Juan Carlos of Bourbon and that “their picture [was] worth a thousand words”. He went on to say that inaugurating a project with the King of the Spaniards, who was the Supreme Head of the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) and the Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish armed forces, was absolutely pitiful. Speaking about the police operation against the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria, he added that the King was in charge of those who had tortured the persons detained in connection with the operation. He spoke in the following terms:', '“How is it possible for them to have their picture taken today in Bilbao with the King of Spain, when the King is the Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish army, in other words the person who is in charge of the torturers, who defends torture and imposes his monarchical regime on our people through torture and violence?”', '11. On 7 April 2003 the public prosecutor lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant for “serious insult against the King” within the meaning of Article 490 § 3 of the Criminal Code read in conjunction with Article 208, on account of his remarks made on 26 February 2003.', '12. In the proceedings before the Basque Country High Court of Justice, which had jurisdiction to try the applicant because of his status as a member of parliament, the applicant argued that his remarks had constituted political criticism directed against the Head of the government of the Basque Country. He added that to say that the King of Spain was the Supreme Head of the Civil Guard did not imply any intention to undermine dignity or honour; it was merely a statement of the political reality in the Spanish State, where the King exercised supreme command over the armed forces. The applicant further argued that there was no insult or attempt to dishonour in saying that the Civil Guard had tortured the persons detained in connection with the closure of the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria because that was the reality, and proceedings had been instituted in that connection before the Madrid investigating judge no. 5. Numerous public figures had also commented on the subject. In sum, the applicant, as a politician, had sought to express political criticism in the context of freedom of expression, one of the foundations of the rule of law and democracy. He pointed out in that regard that politicians had greater freedom of manoeuvre when it came to informing society about matters of public interest.', '13. In a judgment of 18 March 2005, the High Court of Justice found the applicant not guilty of the charges against him. After stating that his remarks had been “clearly offensive, improper, unjust, ignominious and divorced from reality”, the court found as follows:', '“... This is not an issue concerning the private life of the Head of State but one of rejection of the ties of political power deriving from the hereditary nature of the institution which he personally symbolises. ... [C]riticism of a constitutional institution is not excluded from the scope of the right to freedom of expression; in this case the latter has the status of a constitutional right which takes precedence over the right to honour. The Constitution does not guarantee the right to freedom of expression solely in relation to certain points of view that are considered correct, but in relation to all ideas, subject to the limits which it lays down ...”', '14. The High Court of Justice summed up as follows:', '“[T]he [applicant’s] remarks were made in a public, political and institutional setting, regard being had not only to the speaker’s status as a member of parliament but also to the authority to which they were addressed, namely the State’s highest judicial authority, and to the context of political criticism of the [Head of the government of the Basque Country] for his official hospitality in receiving His Majesty King Juan Carlos I in the wake of the closure of the newspaper [Euskaldunon] Egunkaria and the detention of its senior managers, and the latter’s public allegations of illtreatment. This context is therefore unconnected to the innermost core of individual dignity protected by law from any interference by third parties.”', '15. The public prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law, arguing firstly that the law protected the honour of the King as a specific individual possessed of personal dignity, who had been the object of the offence of insult, and secondly that the law was aimed at ensuring respect for the symbolic content of the institution of the Crown as established by the Spanish Constitution and “represented by the Head of State, the symbol of its unity and permanence”. The seriousness of the offence could be inferred from the fact that the legislature had sought to afford increased protection to the dignity of the King, including vis-à-vis other public authorities (Articles 496 and 504 of the Criminal Code). Furthermore, the inviolability of the King, as proclaimed in Article 56 § 3 of the Constitution, demonstrated the unique position occupied by the Crown in the system of the 1978 Spanish Constitution. That constitutional position highlighted the disproportionate nature of the vexatious and insulting remarks made by the applicant. In the view of the public prosecutor, who referred several times to the case-law of the Strasbourg Court, it was clear that the King had been performing official duties and that he was a figure in the public eye; however, that did not deprive him of the right to respect for his honour. In that regard, the public prosecutor pointed out that Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution did not protect a supposed right to proffer insults. Drawing a parallel with the special protection to be afforded under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention to the judiciary, the public prosecutor further argued that the same protection should be afforded to the Head of State, who was the “symbol of the unity and permanence of the State” and was above party politics, from the “destructive and baseless attack” constituted by the applicant’s remarks. Lastly, in the public prosecutor’s view, the applicant’s remarks could be said to amount to “hate speech” within the meaning of the Court’s caselaw, given the existing situation with regard to terrorist attacks.', '16. In two judgments delivered on 31 October 2005, the Supreme Court set aside the judgment of the lower court, making several references to the Court’s case-law. It sentenced the applicant to one year’s imprisonment, suspended his right to stand for election for the duration of the sentence and ordered him to pay costs and expenses, on the ground of his criminal liability for the offence of serious insult against the King. The Supreme Court considered the impugned remarks to have been value judgments rather than statements of fact. The remarks, described as “ignominious” by the lower court, had expressed contempt for the King and the institution he represented, affecting the innermost core of his dignity by accusing him of one of the most serious manifestations of criminal conduct in a State governed by the rule of law. The exercise of the right to freedom of expression had therefore been contrary to the principle of proportionality and had been unnecessary, overstepping the limits beyond which criticism could be deemed to be hurtful or upsetting. The Supreme Court further observed that the context in which the remarks had been made did nothing to alter their offensiveness. Firstly, the proceedings relating to the complaints of ill-treatment of the persons detained in connection with the operation against the newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria had been discontinued for lack of evidence. Secondly, the impugned remarks could not be construed as a reaction or response to a political debate with the King. In view of the seriousness of the insulting comments and the fact that the applicant had deliberately expressed them in public, the Supreme Court sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment.', '17. Judge P.A.I. issued a dissenting opinion in which he argued that the comments complained of had been of a political nature, in view of the applicant’s status as a member of parliament and the context in which they had been made, namely the King’s visit to the Basque Country and the attitude of the Head of the government of the Basque Country in that regard. The judge agreed with the Basque Country High Court of Justice that the remarks had not targeted the King’s private life or his personal honour but had been directed solely at his institutional role as Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish armed forces. The applicant had not claimed that the King was responsible for actual acts of torture, only that he was strictly liable as Head of the State apparatus. The judge pointed out that the limits of freedom of expression were wider with regard to institutions since the latter did not possess honour, an attribute that was confined to individuals.', '18. The applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court alleging, inter alia, a breach of his right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution) and of his right to freedom of ideas (Article 16 of the Constitution).', '19. In the applicant’s view, the Supreme Court’s judgment had incorrectly weighed the competing interests at stake, as the comments complained of had not contained any insulting or vexatious expressions, had been directed principally against the President of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country rather than the King of Spain and, in any event, had reflected the reality of the situation and had not referred to the King’s private life or his attitudes. The statements in question had not been disproportionate in the context in which they had been uttered, namely the warm welcome extended to the King of Spain by the government of the Basque Country in the wake of the closure of the daily newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria and, in connection with that closure, the detention of several individuals who had stated before the courts and the Basque Parliament that they had been tortured.', '20. In a decision (auto) of 3 July 2006, served on 11 July 2006, the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s amparo appeal inadmissible as manifestly devoid of constitutional content. The Constitutional Court noted at the outset that the right to freedom of expression did not encompass a right to proffer insults. It pointed out in that connection that the Constitution did not prohibit the use of hurtful expressions in all circumstances. However, freedom of expression did not protect vexatious expressions which, regardless of their veracity, were offensive and ignominious and were not pertinent for the purpose of conveying the opinions or information in question.', '21. The Constitutional Court considered that the weighing of the competing rights at stake had been carried out in an appropriate manner by the Supreme Court, as the latter had concluded that the impugned remarks had been disproportionate, while taking into account the context in which they had been made, the public nature of the act, the public interest in the subject in question (the use of torture) and the fact that the persons targeted (a politician and the King) were public figures. In the Constitutional Court’s view, there was no denying the ignominious, vexatious and derogatory nature of the impugned remarks, even when directed against a public figure. That finding was all the more valid with regard to the King, who, by virtue of Article 56 § 3 of the Constitution, was “not liable” and was a “symbol of the unity and permanence of the State”. Regard being had to his role as “arbitrator and moderator of the lawful functioning of institutions”, the King occupied a neutral position in political debate. This implied that he was owed institutional respect of a kind that was “substantively” different from that due to other State institutions. The Constitutional Court stated as follows:', '“... [I]n a democratic system which recognises freedom of ideas and freedom of expression, the fact that [the figure of the King] is characterised in this way does not shield him from all criticism ‘in the exercise of his duties or on account of or in connection with them’ ...; however, such criticism may not extend to attributing acts of public authority to the King – which, as indicated above, is prohibited by the Constitution – as a pretext for gratuitous attacks on his dignity or public esteem.”', '22. Lastly, the Constitutional Court held that the applicant’s remarks, on account of their obviously derogatory nature, had clearly gone beyond what could be considered legitimate. It agreed with the Supreme Court that the remarks had expressed open contempt for the King and the institution he embodied, affecting the essential core of his dignity. Hence, such statements could manifestly not fall within the exercise of the right to freedom of expression.', '23. In a decision (auto) of 15 May 2006, the Basque Country High Court of Justice ordered that enforcement of the applicant’s sentence be stayed for three years. According to the Government, his sentence was remitted on 16 July 2009.', '24. The applicant was imprisoned on 8 June 2007 after the Supreme Court upheld a judgment of the Audiencia Nacional of 27 April 2006 sentencing him to fifteen months’ imprisonment for publicly defending terrorism.', '25. He is currently in pre-trial detention in connection with other criminal proceedings.', '26. The relevant provisions of the Spanish Constitution read as follows:', '“Spaniards shall be equal before the law; they may not be discriminated against in any way on account of birth, race, sex, religion, opinion or any other condition or personal or social circumstance.”', '“1. Freedom of ideas, religion and worship shall be guaranteed to individuals and communities without any restrictions on its expression other than those necessary for the maintenance of public order as protected by law.', '...”', '“1.

The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code (as amended by Institutional Act no. 10/1995 of 23 November 1995) read as follows:', '“Acts or expressions which undermine another’s dignity by attacking his or her reputation or self-esteem shall constitute insult.', 'Only insults which, by virtue of their nature, effects and context, are generally acknowledged to be serious shall constitute an offence ...”', '“The offence of serious public insult shall be punishable by a day-fine payable for between six and fourteen months. Where the insult is not proffered publicly, the fine shall be payable for between three and seven months.”', '28. With regard to the offence of insult against the King, Article 490 of the Criminal Code provides for the penalties indicated below:', '“...', '3. Anyone who falsely accuses or insults the King or any of his ascendants or descendants, the Queen consort or the consort of the Queen, the Regent or any member of the Regency, or the Crown Prince, in the exercise of his or her duties or on account of or in connection with them, shall be liable to a term of imprisonment of between six months and two years if the false accusation or insult is of a serious nature, and otherwise to a day-fine payable for between six and twelve months.”', 'This provision is contained in Title XXI of Book II of the Criminal Code (“Offences against the Constitution”), under Chapter II (“Offences against the Crown”).', '29. Articles 496 and 504 of the Criminal Code deal with the offence of serious insult against Parliament, the government or other State institutions. These provisions feature in Title XXI of Book II of the Criminal Code (“Offences against the Constitution”), under Chapter III (“Offences against State institutions and the separation of powers”).', '“Anyone who seriously insults the Cortes Generales [Congress of Deputies and Senate] or the legislative assembly of an Autonomous Community ... shall be liable to a day-fine payable for between twelve and eighteen months ...”', '“Anyone who seriously threatens, falsely accuses or insults the nation’s government, the General Council of the Judiciary, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, or the Governing Council or High Court of Justice of an Autonomous Community shall be liable to a day-fine payable for between twelve and eighteen months ...”', '30. Reference should first be made to the Declaration on freedom of political debate in the media adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 12 February 2004, which provides:', '“The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe,', '...', 'Conscious that some domestic legal systems still grant legal privileges to political figures or public officials against the dissemination of information and opinions about them in the media, which is not compatible with the right to freedom of expression and information as guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention;', '...', 'II.

Because of their dominant position, these institutions as such should not be protected by criminal law against defamatory or insulting statements.

Individuals representing these institutions remain furthermore protected as individuals.', '...', 'VI.

The applicant was born in Pemba, one of the Zanzibar islands, in 1968. Zanzibar is part of the United Republic of Tanzania. It has its own President, parliament and government and enjoys considerable autonomy.', '9. According to the applicant, in 1992 he joined the Civic United Front (“the CUF”), an opposition party in Zanzibar. He was an active member, attending meetings and contributing money to the party funds. In August 1994 the applicant was arrested by Chama Cha Mapinduzi (“the CCM”, the ruling party) officers because of his involvement with the CUF. He was detained at Madema police station in Zanzibar for three months, where he was tortured. He was repeatedly locked in a cell full of water for days at a time so he was unable to lie down. He was hung upside down with his feet tied together until he bled through the nose, and he was also subjected to electric shocks.', '10. In November 1994 the applicant stated that he was released from detention following pressure from CUF leaders on the Tanzanian government. He was admitted to hospital, where a medical officer recorded that the applicant was haemorrhaging severely through the nose as a result of his treatment and had been subjected to harm endangering life.', '11. The applicant stated that his brother had been taken into detention shortly before he was. He had been ill-treated and died in January 1995 in hospital where he had been taken from prison.', '12. Following his release, the applicant stated that he only contributed funds to the CUF. In January 1995 the police came looking for him while he was out. The police detained his wife overnight and questioned his friends. He decided to leave his home and Tanzania, fearing for his safety.', '13. On 9 February 1995 the applicant arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum. That day a pro forma interview was held with an immigration officer, where the applicant was assisted by an interpreter. According to the form, the purpose of the interview was to enable the immigration officer to take down the initial details of the asylum application. When asked what the basis of his asylum claim was, the applicant was noted as having said: “Because of the problems in the country and my safety. I have been threatened a lot by the ruling party so I decided to leave the country.” The applicant stated that he had been a member of the CUF since 1992.', '14. At the full asylum interview held on 15 March 1995, the applicant was recorded as stating that he had had no problem in obtaining a passport as he was a businessman, and that he had organised his passage to the United Kingdom himself. When asked what the basis for his asylum claim was, he stated that he had been taken away and detained for three months, from August to November 1994, at Madema police station, where he had been tortured. He had been locked in a room with a very low ceiling, where he could not stand up, and then placed for one and a half days in a room filled with water up to the chest, where he could not lie down. He was taken out and returned there twice a week. A few days before he was released he was hung upside down and given electric shocks. He had been arrested because he gave money to the CUF. He was told that he had been released because the CUF leaders had approached the authorities in Dar es Salaam. After his release, he was treated in a private clinic. He produced his CUF card. He had been an ordinary member, doing nothing more than give money. He had not taken part in the demonstration which had been allowed. He mentioned that his brother had been arrested in January 1995 and died after being in police custody. His brother had been badly beaten and was vomiting blood, so they had released him to hospital on 20 January 1995 as they knew he was going to die. His uncle had helped him to leave, obtaining an income-tax clearance and an airline ticket. His uncle checked in with the ticket for him and he was able to board the plane.', '15. On 29 June 1995 the Secretary of State refused asylum, finding the applicant’s account implausible and noting inconsistencies in his answers. The applicant’s appeal to a special adjudicator was dismissed on 8 November 1996. During the proceedings the applicant had claimed that the Tanzanian authorities intercepted the letters he was sending home, knew that he had claimed asylum, and had summoned his parents to explain', '“about [their] son who [was] in a foreign country to abuse the government which [was] in power ...”', 'He provided correspondence from the Royal Mail concerning his enquiries about money which had gone missing from a registered letter dated 27 November 1995 which he had sent to his parents in Tanzania.', '16. In his decision the special adjudicator noted inconsistencies between the evidence given by the applicant before him and the answers given in his asylum interviews. He placed considerable weight on the fact that the applicant had not mentioned his arrest and torture at his first asylum interview and did not accept the applicant’s explanation that the interviewing officer told him that it was not necessary to give details at this stage or that he was having difficulties with the interpreter. He also noted that the evidence concerning his brother’s arrest was contradictory and that no documentary evidence such as a death certificate had been produced. He therefore did not accept that the applicant’s brother was arrested, tortured or killed. He also observed that the applicant had not provided documentary evidence that the Zanzibar authorities were accusing him of tarnishing Tanzania’s good name, and therefore did not accept that it existed. Looking at the evidence as a whole, he concluded that there was no well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason established to the required standard.', '17. Leave to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was refused on 10 January 1997.', '18. The applicant obtained a copy of his brother’s death certificate and a medical report which recorded that his brother died on 20 January 1995, after being brought to hospital from prison with a history of severe chest pain and general body weakness associated with a fever. He also obtained the summons from the Pemba police headquarters to his parents dated 25 November 1995 requesting their attendance to explain the applicant’s unlawful conduct in embarrassing the government and country. He made representations to the Secretary of State dated 30 January 1997, providing copies and requesting that his letter be considered as a fresh asylum application.', '19. By letter dated 4 February 1997 the Secretary of State expressed the view that the police summons was self-serving and not significant, while the death certificate did not disclose proof that his brother, who died of a fever, had been murdered by the authorities. He had, accordingly, decided not to treat the representations as a fresh application for asylum, but to reconsider the original asylum application on all the evidence available to him. He refused on that basis to reverse his decision.', '20. By letter dated 4 February 1997 the applicant’s representatives requested, alternatively, that the new material be referred to the special adjudicator under section 21 of the Immigration Act 1971. By letter dated 5 February 1997 the Secretary of State informed them that he had decided not to refer the material in question.', '21. By letter dated 29 April 1997 the applicant’s representatives submitted to the Secretary of State a medical report about the applicant’s treatment following detention in Zanzibar, and requested that the new materials be submitted to the special adjudicator under section 21. They submitted further representations on 26 March 1998.', 'The hospital medical report, dated 8 November 1994, from a medical officer recorded that the applicant had suffered a severe nasal haemorrhage, that this was of a “dangerous harm” degree and that the injury had been inflicted by hanging upside down.', '22. By letter dated 23 April 1998 the Secretary of State informed the applicant that he had considered the new material, but that this evidence did not cause him to reverse his decision to refuse asylum. He noted that the documents would have been available to the applicant at the time of his appeal hearing but were not produced, which cast doubt on their authenticity. Even if the medical certificate and police summons were authentic, however, he saw no reason why the applicant could not return to live safely and without harassment in mainland Tanzania. He refused to make a reference under section 21.', '23. The applicant applied for leave to apply for judicial review of the Secretary of State’s refusal to refer the new material to the special adjudicator. He submitted an expert opinion confirming that the documents were genuine. The Secretary of State submitted that the documents were irrelevant because the applicant could live safely in mainland Tanzania. He relied on a letter from the British High Commission in Tanzania dated 8 April 1998 which stated that in general there was no evidence of politically motivated detentions on the mainland, although there were “more general human rights problems such as arbitrary detentions and poor penal conditions” on the mainland.', '24. On 1 July 1998 the application for leave was rejected by the High Court. Mr Justice Jowitt stated:', '“The Secretary of State’s decision [is] that things have changed and that as matters now stand, whatever was or was not the case in November 1996 and whatever ought or ought not to have been the outcome of the appeal heard then, the applicant can safely return to his home country, provided he goes to the mainland. Having looked at the letter [from the British High Commission], I can see no arguable grounds for saying that the Secretary of State has acted with Wednesbury unreasonableness in concluding that in the light of this new material he has no need to refer the matter to the Special Adjudicator and this application must be refused.”', '25. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal arguing that the Secretary of State’s refusal was wrong in law and “Wednesbury unreasonable” and that, in claiming that the applicant could live safely on the mainland, he was not complying with international obligations by failing to take into account the applicant’s specific case or documentation.', '26. On 1 December 1998 the Court of Appeal refused leave to apply for judicial review. In its judgment it noted that the hospital records showed that his brother had died of fever and did not support the applicant’s evidence that his brother had been tortured. Even assuming that the medical report on the applicant and the summons by the police to his parents were genuine, there was no evidence to suggest that the conclusion reached by the Secretary of State that the applicant could live without harassment on the mainland was wrong.', '27. On 23 December 1998 the applicant was notified that he would be removed to Zanzibar on 11 January 1999.', '28. On 22 February 1999 the applicant’s wife arrived in the United Kingdom and claimed asylum shortly afterwards. It was recorded that she stated in her interview that the police had harassed her due to her husband’s involvement with the CUF. She had been detained for one day in April 1995 and questioned about her husband’s whereabouts. The police came to her house on 12 February 1999, wanting to know if her husband was back in Zanzibar as there was a rumour that the United Kingdom had sent back most of the asylum-seekers from Zanzibar. They were angry because he had claimed asylum and tarnished the name of the President. They threatened to arrest her instead.', '29. Asylum applications are determined by the Secretary of State, pursuant to paragraph 328 of the Immigration Rules and section 3 of the Immigration Act 1971 (“the 1971 Act”). Where leave to enter is refused by the Secretary of State pursuant to section 4 of the 1971 Act, the person may appeal against the refusal to a special adjudicator on the grounds that the removal would be contrary to the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Geneva Convention (section 8 of the 1971 Act).', '30. An appeal lies from the special adjudicator to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal (section 20 of the 1971 Act).', '31. Section 21 of the 1971 Act provides:', '“(1) Where in any case:', '(a) an adjudicator has dismissed an appeal, and there has been no further appeal to the Appeal Tribunal, or the tribunal has dismissed an appeal made to them ...; or', '(b) the Appeal Tribunal has affirmed the determination of an adjudicator dismissing an appeal ... the Secretary of State may at any time refer for consideration under this section any matter relating to the case which was not before the adjudicator or Tribunal ...”', '32. Rule 346 of the Immigration Rules provides that the Secretary of State will treat representations as a fresh application if the claim advanced is sufficiently different from the earlier claim. He disregards, in considering whether to treat the representations as a fresh claim, material which is not significant, or is not credible, or was available to the applicant at the time when the previous application was refused or when any appeal was determined.', '33. There have been a number of domestic cases where special adjudicators have rejected “internal flight” possibilities for CUF members from Zanzibar. In Masoud Mussa v. the Secretary of State (30 July 1998), the Government pointed out that the Secretary of State’s counsel had not been present to argue the point. In Omar Machano Omar v. the Secretary of State (24 June 1998), the asylum claimant was an escaped prisoner from Zanzibar and a target for internal extradition proceedings. In Salim Saleh Salim v. the Secretary of State (15 January 1998), the adjudicator found that there was no evidence before him to show that the claimant would be any safer on the mainland than in Zanzibar.', '34. In the case of Adam Houiji Foum v. the Secretary of State (10 January 2000), the Immigration Appeal Tribunal allowed the appeal of a Tanzanian asylum-seeker who had been involved in CUF activities, on the basis that, as he had suffered torture in Zanzibar and a summons had been issued against him in Tanzania generally, there was a very reasonable prospect that he would be picked up by the police and undergo ill-treatment similar to that previously received in Zanzibar, either at the hands of the Zanzibar authorities or of the police in mainland Tanzania who also exercised brutality on prisoners in their custody. It therefore rejected the “internal flight” option.', '35. Decisions of the Home Secretary to refuse asylum, to make a deportation order or to detain pending deportation are liable to challenge by way of judicial review and may be quashed by reference to the ordinary principles of English public law.', '36. These principles do not permit the courts to make findings of fact on matters within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of State or to substitute their discretion for the minister’s. The courts may quash his decision only if he has failed to interpret or apply English law correctly, if he has failed to take account of issues which he was required by law to address, or if his decision was so irrational or perverse that no reasonable Secretary of State could have made it (Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 King’s Bench Reports 223).', '37. In the recent case of R. v. Home Secretary, ex parte Turgut (28 January 2000), concerning the Secretary of State’s refusal of asylum to a young male Turkish Kurd draft evader, Lord Justice Simon Brown, in the Court of Appeal’s judgment, stated as follows:', '“I therefore conclude that the domestic court’s obligation on an irrationality challenge in an Article 3 case is to subject the Secretary of State’s decision to rigorous examination and this it does by considering the underlying factual material for itself to see whether it compels a different conclusion to that arrived at by the Secretary of State. Only if it does will the challenge succeed.', 'All that said, however, this is not an area in which the Court will pay any especial deference to the Secretary of State’s conclusion on the facts. In the first place, the human right involved here – the right not to be exposed to a real risk of Article 3 treatment – is both absolute and fundamental: it is not a qualified right requiring a balance to be struck with some competing social need. Secondly, the Court here is hardly less well placed than the Secretary of State himself to evaluate the risk once the relevant material is before it. Thirdly, whilst I would reject the applicant’s contention that the Secretary of State has knowingly misrepresented the evidence or shut his eyes to the true position, we must, I think, recognise at least the possibility that he has (even if unconsciously) tended to depreciate the evidence of risk and, throughout the protracted decision-making process, may have tended also to rationalise the further material adduced so as to maintain his pre-existing stance rather than reassess the position with an open mind. In circumstances such as these, what has been called the ‘discretionary area of judgment’ – the area of judgment within which the Court should defer to the Secretary of State as the person primarily entrusted with the decision on the applicant’s removal ... – is decidedly a narrow one.”', '38. In January 1997 the US Department of State released the Tanzania Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996. It stated:', '“The Government’s human rights record did not improve and problems persisted. Although the 1995 multiparty elections represented an important development, citizens’ right to change their government in Zanzibar is severely circumscribed. Although new opposition parties were competitive in many 1995 races and won in some constituencies, police often harassed and intimidated members and supporters of the opposition. Other human rights problems included police beatings and mistreatment of suspects, which sometimes resulted in death. Soldiers attacked civilians, and police in Zanzibar used torture, including beatings and floggings. Prison conditions remained harsh and life threatening. Arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention continued and the inefficient and corrupt judicial system often did not provide expeditious and fair trials ...', 'Since the 1995 election, police in Zanzibar, particularly on Pemba, have regularly detained, arrested and harassed CUF members, and suspected supporters. Despite orders from the Union Government’s Inspector General of Police, officers in Zanzibar continue these activities ...', 'The Wairoba Commission found that pervasive corruption affected the judiciary from clerks to magistrates. Clerks took bribes to decide whether or not to open cases and to hide or misdirect the files of those accused of crimes. Magistrates often accept bribes to determine guilt or innocence, pass sentence, withdraw charges or decide appeals ...', 'There are reports of prisoners waiting several years for trial because they could not pay bribes to police and court officials. Authorities acknowledge that some cases have been pending since 1988. The Government initiated efforts as early as 1991 to highlight judicial corruption and increased its oversight ...', 'In the 2 years since the election, government security forces and CCM gangs harassed and intimidated CUF members on both of the two main Zanzibar islands, Pemba and Ugunja. Because CUF won all 20 seats on Pemba, Pembans living on Ugunja were regarded as CUF supporters and as a result were harassed. CUF members accused police of detaining dozens of its members ... Safety is not ensured in Pemba, where security forces dispersed gatherings, intimidated and roughed up individuals ...”', '39. In the Amnesty International Annual Report 1997, it was stated:', '“Prisoners of conscience were among scores of government opponents arrested and briefly detained on the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. Many were held without charge or trial; others faced criminal charges and were denied bail. Scores of political prisoners were tortured and ill-treated on the islands ...', 'Criminal charges such as sedition, vagrancy and involvement in acts of violence, often accompanied by the denial of bail for periods of two weeks or more, were also used as a method of intimidating government critics or opponents.”', '40. In their 1998 report, Amnesty International stated:', '“In December [1997], 14 possible prisoners of conscience on Zanzibar were charged with treason and refused bail. The men, supporters of the CUF, were arrested and initially charged with sedition in November and December, during the week the CUF won a by-election to the Zanzibar House of Representatives.”', '41. On 8 July 1998 Amnesty International issued a press release expressing concern that the vice-chairperson of the CUF might be arrested on a fabricated treason charge. In Tanzania it noted treason carried a mandatory death penalty. On 24 July 1998 Amnesty called for the immediate release of eighteen leading CUF members or supporters, most of them imprisoned since November 1997 on fabricated treason charges. It expressed concern about their deteriorating health and a denial of adequate medical treatment.', '42. The 1998 US State Department report on Tanzania noted that serious problems remained in that government’s human rights record.', '“... the police regularly threaten, mistreat or beat suspected criminals during and after their apprehension and interrogation. Police also use the same means to obtain information about suspects from family members not in custody ... Police in Zanzibar use torture ... Repeated reports from credible sources indicate that the police use torture, including beatings and floggings in Zanzibar, notably on Pemba Island. Both the Zanzibar and Union Governments have denied these charges. Police have not yet explained the deaths of six detainees in the town of Morogoro who were electrocuted at the end of 1997 ...', 'Prison conditions remained harsh and life-threatening. Government officials acknowledge that prisons are overcrowded and living conditions are poor. Prisons are authorised to hold 21,000 persons but the actual prison population is estimated at 47,000 ... The daily amount of food allotted to prisoners is insufficient to meet their nutritional needs and even this amount is not always provided ... Earlier the Commissioner of Prisons stated that his department received inadequate funds for medicine and medical supplies. Prison dispensaries only offer limited treatment, and friends and family members of prisoners generally must provide medication or the funds with which to purchase it. Serious diseases, such as dysentery, malaria and cholera are common and result in numerous deaths. Guards continued to beat and abuse prisoners.', '... There were no reports of political prisoners on the mainland. At the year’s end, there were 18 political prisoners in Zanzibar.”', '43. The report noted that in January 1998 the police had searched the offices of the CUF party in Tanzania and removed files. In the three years since the election in 1995, government security forces and CCM gangs harassed and intimidated CUF members on both the main Zanzibar islands of Pemba and Ugunja.', '44. The Amnesty International 1999 Report for Tanzania stated that:', '“Eighteen prisoners of conscience, including three arrested during the year, were facing trial for treason on the island of Zanzibar, an offence that carries the death penalty. Scores of other opposition supporters in Zanzibar were imprisoned for short periods; some were possible prisoners of conscience. More than 300 demonstrators arrested on the mainland in the capital Dar es Salaam were held for several weeks and reportedly tortured. Conditions in some prisons were harsh ...”', 'The eighteen prisoners, CUF members, included fifteen arrested in 1997 and three arrested in Zanzibar in May 1998, and many had reportedly fallen ill due to a denial of access to medical treatment. According to the report, the conditions in some mainland prisons amounted to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, which in the case of Mbeya Prison led to forty-seven deaths in the first half of the year.', '45. In its press release of 27 January 2000 Amnesty International, reporting on the imminent trial of the eighteen CUF members, referred to them “as prisoners of conscience who are imprisoned solely on account of their non-violent opinions and peaceful political activities”. It described how between the 1995 and the 1998 elections, numerous CUF supporters had been arrested on trumped-up criminal charges, tortured in custody and imprisoned. On more recent events, it commented:', '“Following lengthy attempts by the Secretary General of the Commonwealth and the United Nations Secretary General to settle the political crisis in Zanzibar, an agreement was finally reached between the CCM and CUF in April 1999. Far-reaching reforms for democratisation, human rights and fair elections were set out in the Commonwealth Agreement, but few have yet been implemented. Although the CUF is allowed to operate more freely, the Zanzibar government continues to press ahead with the trial, intent on convictions and death sentences.”', '46. In the 1999 US State Department report on Tanzania, issued on 25 February 2000, it was reported, inter alia, that the authorities had been responsible for a number of extrajudicial killings and that several prisoners had died as a result of harsh prison conditions, including inadequate nutrition, medical care and sanitation:', '“... the police regularly threaten, mistreat or occasionally beat suspected criminals during and after their apprehension and interrogation ... Repeated reports indicate that the police use torture, including beatings and floggings, in Zanzibar, notably on Pemba island.”', 'The situation in Zanzibar was less favourable in a number of respects. It was stated that, except in Zanzibar, Tanzanian citizens generally enjoyed the right to discuss political alternatives freely and opposition party members openly criticised the government, although the government had used the provision prohibiting “abusive language” against the leadership to detain some opposition figures. Opposition parties had generally been more able to hold rallies, although CUF meetings in Zanzibar had been far more restricted than those of other parties. Police continued to break up meetings attended by persons thought to be opposed to the Zanzibar government. In Pemba the security forces broke up gatherings and intimidated opposition party officials and the government continued to arrest opposition politicians for holding meetings.', '“In the four years since the election, government security forces and CCM gangs harassed and intimidated CUF members on both main Zanzibar islands, Pemba and Ugunja ... The CUF accused police of detaining dozens of its members including several local leaders ... citizen’s safety is not assured in Pemba, where security forces dispersed gatherings and intimidated persons ... Almost all international donors have suspended direct assistance to Zanzibar in response to the authorities’ human rights abuses. Under pressure from the international community, the ruling CCM party and the main opposition party, the CUF, signed a political agreement in June to make the political process in Zanzibar fairer; however the provisions of the agreement were not fully implemented by the year’s end and observers believe that the Government did not act in good faith in the period following the signing of the agreement.”', '47. In a letter dated 8 April 1998 the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam commented that there were concerns about the situation in Zanzibar but that on the mainland there had been no evidence of political killings, disappearances or politically motivated arrests. There were more general human rights problems, such as arbitrary detentions and poor penal conditions, which were systemic and not related to political activity.', '48. In a letter dated 25 May 1998 Michael Hodd of the University of Westminster commented that there was evidence of human rights violations in Zanzibar, including a list of sixty-six missing persons. Although there was a good human rights record in mainland Tanzania, it was possible for the Zanzibar government to demand extradition, which had been successful in the case of Abdallah Kassim Hanga, whom a well-informed source reported as having been beheaded.', '49. According to a report dated 16 March 1999 obtained by the applicant, Professor Parkin, professor of social anthropology at All Souls College, Oxford, an expert on Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, stated that while there was less likelihood of persecution in mainland Tanzania than on Zanzibar, he observed a deteriorating situation also affecting the mainland. He referred to particular members of the Zanzibari CCM visiting the mainland and harassing and persecuting CUF dissidents who had taken refuge there. The Zanzibari CUF leader was living in Dar es Salaam but only ever moved out of his flat surrounded by CUF party aides able to protect him.']",['3'],[],[],['13'],[],[],1

The applicants, mother and son, were born in 1945 and 1975 respectively and live in Kyiv.', ""6. On 16 July 1992 Mrs Y.B., born in 1908, officially registered the first applicant as a permanent tenant in her flat and in March 1993 signed it off to her in a will, purportedly in exchange for the first applicant being her live-in aide. On 5 January 1993 the second applicant, then a minor, was also officially registered as a permanent resident in Mrs Y.B.'s flat as his mother's family member. The applicants moved into the flat, took care of the charges and maintenance fees and did some renovation work."", '7. On 23 August 1994 the Kyiv City Administration promised to provide the applicants with a new flat in view of the fact that a decision had been taken to demolish the building of which Mrs Y.B. was co-owner. That decision, however, was never complied with.', ""8. In 1995 and 1996 the second applicant's wife and two children from her previous relationship, born in 1988 and 1989, were also registered as permanent tenants in the same flat. Subsequently the second applicant adopted the children (in 1996) and divorced their mother (in 1998)."", '9. On 18 December 1998 Mrs Y.B. died.', '10. After her death, the first applicant learned that in 1996 and 1998 Mrs Y.B. had drafted two more wills, signing the same flat off to other individuals, and on 12 March 1999 instituted judicial proceedings seeking to have those two wills annulled. The first applicant claimed that since 1995 Mrs Y.B. had been under severe stress resulting from her participation in an ongoing court dispute with Mrs G.D., a co-owner of the building, and, consequently, her mental health and judgment had deteriorated.', ""11. On 26 February 2001 a panel of experts conducted an assessment of Mrs Y.B.'s mental health and found that in March 1993, December 1995 and October 1998 Mrs Y.B. had suffered from organic psychiatric disorders giving rise to moderate intellectual and memory impairment and paranoia. Consequently, during these periods she had been unable “to understand the meaning of her actions or control them”."", ""12. As a result of those conclusions, on 3 April 2001 the Leningradsky District Prosecutor joined the first applicant's proceedings on behalf of the State, seeking annulment of all Mrs Y.B.'s wills, including the one drafted in 1993 in the first applicant's favour."", ""13. On 8 June 2001 the Leningradsky District Court of Kyiv allowed the prosecutor's claim. The parties' appeals against this judgment were eventually dismissed as inadmissible on procedural grounds and it became final."", ""14. On 29 April 2002 the Svyatoshynsky District Tax Administration registered the State's (the municipality's) title to the late Mrs Y.B.'s flat as intestate estate."", ""15. On 28 May 2002 the Tax Administration instituted court proceedings against the applicants, seeking to annul their tenancy registration as lacking any legal basis on account of the impaired judgment of the former flat owner when authorising it. The Administration further sought to evict the applicants, claiming that their occupancy impeded the authorities' ability to sell the flat at the highest possible price."", '16. The second applicant lodged a counterclaim, seeking to be acknowledged as a lawful tenant of the flat. He maintained, in particular, that he and his mother had occupied it for a considerable period of time in good faith and on lawful grounds and took care of maintenance fees and renovations. In addition, the family had no alternative housing and their eviction would compromise the interests of raising two minor children, who remained in his custody after their mother had left the family.', '17. Subsequently the Svyatoshynsky District Minors Service intervened in the proceedings, requesting the court to consider the interests of the two minor children in retaining the tenancy.', ""18. During the hearing of 15 July 2002 the Svyatoshynsky District Court of Kyiv requested Mr Ts., one of the experts who had conducted the post-mortem assessment of Mrs Y.B.'s mental state in February 2001, to assess whether she had been legally competent to authorise the first applicant's tenancy on 16 July 1992. On the same day Mr Ts. delivered a statement that, based on the results of the post-mortem psychiatric assessment of Mrs Y.B.'s condition in 1993, it was certain that on the date at issue she could not understand the meaning of her actions or control them."", '19. On the same date the court issued a judgment allowing the claim by the Tax Administration. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows:', '“The court, having heard the explanations of the parties, having examined case-file materials, considers it necessary to allow the initial claim ... and to reject the counterclaim, regard being had to the following:', 'On 16 July 1992 and 5 January 1993 respectively, Y. B., who could not understand the meaning of her actions or control them, authorised the registration of Kryvitska G.S. and Kryvitskyy Y.F. as tenants of the part of the building belonging to her ..., having thus concluded a tenancy agreement.', ""On 16 December 1998 she died, and 2/400 of the building, which had belonged to her ..., became property of the State represented by the Svyatoshynskyy District Tax Administration of Kyiv ..., which on 28 May 2002 sought protection of the owner's rights, which should not be infringed by Kryvitskyy Y.F. and Kryvitska G.S., who have occupied the premises, regard being had to the above, arbitrarily, and should be evicted without provision of other housing."", ""In light of the above Kryvitskyy Y.F.'s claim of right to use the premises cannot be allowed ..."", 'Regard being had to the above and referring to Articles 55 and 555 of the Civil Code of Ukraine, Articles 4 and 48 of the Law of Ukraine “On Property”, Articles 116 and 191 of the Housing Code of Ukraine, Articles 15, 30, 62, 75 and 203 of the Code of Civil Procedure of Ukraine, the court', 'HAS DECIDED:', 'To allow the initial claim ...”', ""20. The applicants appealed. They alleged, in particular, that the expert assessment of Mrs Y.B.'s mental health was flawed and superficial, that at the moment of concluding their tenancy agreement they had acted in accordance with the law and in good faith and, under the circumstances of their case, could not have foreseen that the law concerning arbitrary occupation of the premises would be retrospectively applied to them. They further alleged that their eviction would render them homeless and infringe their Constitutional right to respect for their home and, moreover, the second applicant's eviction would jeopardize the rights of the two minor children, who remained in his sole custody."", ""21. On 13 August 2002 the Minors Service informed the Kyiv City Court of Appeal that the children actually lived in the flat and were in the second applicant's custody, since their mother had left to work in Russia."", ""22. On 16 October 2002 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants' appeal, endorsing the first-instance court's reasoning. It also noted that according to an address bureau certificate, the children and their mother were not registered as tenants in the flat at issue. The judgment became binding for enforcement."", ""23. The applicants appealed in cassation, maintaining, in addition to their previous arguments, that the courts had wrongly refused to admit their evidence that the children had remained resident in the flat. On 8 May 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants' request for leave to appeal in cassation, having found that the lower courts had properly assessed the evidence before them and interpreted the applicable law."", '24. On 12 November 2002 Mr Zh., the bailiff assigned to the case, requested the Svyatoshynsky District Court to clarify its judgment of 15 July 2002 in view of the fact that the children were found to be actually living in the flat.', '25. On 14 November 2002 the President of the Svyatoshynskyy District Court wrote a letter to the Chiefs of the Kyiv City Department of Justice and the Svyatoshynsky District Department of Justice, stating that, having requested clarification of an already clear judgment, Mr Zh. had intentionally protracted its enforcement, thus grossly interfering with State interests. He further requested the addressees to prevent such applications in future.', '26. On an unspecified date the applicants requested that their eviction be replaced by monetary compensation.', ""27. On 28 December 2002 the court dismissed the Bailiffs' and the applicants' requests."", '28. In the meantime, on 5 December 2002 the applicants were evicted. According to the applicants, they had to request housing of various relatives and friends and had no stable place of residence following their eviction. In 2006 the second applicant bought a house.', '29. On several occasions the applicants requested the Tax Administration to inform them when the flat would be put on sale, as they were interested in trying to purchase it and received responses that they could be eligible for a purchase only if all co-owners of the building waived their statutory privilege. Subsequently they were informed that in April 2003 the flat had been sold to Mrs G.D., a co-owner of the building.', '30.

001-70241,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2005,CASE OF VASYAGIN v. RUSSIA,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13,Christos Rozakis,"['4. The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Moscow. He is retired.', '5. On 5 October 1993 the applicant bought a motorbike, produced in Belarus. The motorbike was sold by a Russian dealer company under a service warranty. The next day the motorbike got out of order. The service centre, indicated by the dealer company, refused to repair the motorbike.', '6. On 2 December 1993 the applicant brought an action against four defendants: the dealer company, the factory having produced the motorbike, based in Belarus, the service centre, and the Moscow Bureau of Technical Expertise. On 4 October 1994 the Meshchanskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the dealer company to pay damages to the applicant. The defendant appealed. On 28 March 1995 the Moscow City Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the first instance court.', '7. In 1995-1997 hearings were adjourned on five occasions due to both parties’ failure to appear, on two occasions – due to the defendant’s failure to appear, and on six occasions – because of the judge having been busy with other cases. Finally, on 12 November 1997 the Meshchanskiy District Court severed the applicant’s claims against the service centre. At the same time the court dismissed the applicant’s claims against the dealer company. On 12 January 1998 the Moscow City Court upheld this judgment. The proceedings against the service centre continued.', '8. In the proceedings against the service centre no hearings were held between 12 January 1998 and 12 April 1999. In the following months the examination of the case was adjourned on three occasions due to the defendant’s failure to appear.', '9. By a default judgment of 20 December 1999 the Meshchanskiy District Court held against the service centre awarding the applicant damages in the amount of 261,690 Russian roubles (RUR). Since no appeal followed within the time-limits established by law, on 31 December 1999 the judgment became final. The court issued an execution warrant and opened the enforcement proceedings.', '10. On 6 February 2000 the defendant lodged an appeal seeking, inter alia, to restore the time-limits allowed for the appeal. On 9 March 2003 the court decided to restore the time-limits and accepted the statement of appeal for examination on the merits. In the meantime RUR 30,267 were recovered from the service centre on the account of the amount due to the applicant under the judgment of 20 December 1999.', '11. By the decision of 18 May 2000 the Moscow City Court quashed the judgment of 20 December 1999, stating that the first instance court had failed to properly notify the defendant about the hearings. The case was remitted to the first instance court for new examination.', '12. By a judgment of 20 June 2000 the Meshchanskiy District Court dismissed the applicant’s action against the service centre. The court also ordered the applicant to reimburse the amount recovered from the service centre pursuant to the judgment of 20 December 1999.', '13. On 26 July 2000 the Public Prosecutor of the Meshchanskiy District of Moscow lodged with the Moscow City Court an appeal on behalf of the applicant. On 12 September 2000 the Moscow City Court quashed the decision of 20 June 2000 and remitted the case to the first instance.', '14. After the remittal of the case, the proceedings were stayed for a certain period of time. Within this period higher judicial authorities were examining the materials of the case-file for the purpose of bringing a supervisory review appeal against the decision of 12 September 2000. However, no supervisory review proceedings followed.', '15. The first hearing on the merits was scheduled for 2 October 2001. However, on this date the court decided to adjourn the case for two months due to the plaintiff’s failure to appear. In the subsequent months the examination of the case was adjourned on six occasions due to the defendants’ failure to appear or the absence either of the presiding judge (adjourned from 27 November 2001 until 29 January 2002) or the lay judges (adjourned from 20 May 2002 until 26 June 2002).', '16. In a letter of 7 February 2001, the Vice-President of the Moscow City Court informed the President of the Meshchanskiy District Court that the applicant’s claim against the producer factory remained unresolved since 1995.', '17. On 3 October 2002 the first instance court, by a default judgment, satisfied the applicant’s claim against the producer factory and rejected his claim against the dealer company.', '18. The producer factory appealed against this judgment. On 28 January 2003 the Moscow City Court quashed the judgment of 3 October 2002 and remitted the case to the first instance.', '19. In the following months the case was adjourned several times. Thus, on 16 April 2003 the case was adjourned due to the defendant’s failure to appear. On 1 July 2003 the court adjourned the case, ordering the plaintiff (the applicant) to clarify his claims, in particular, to indicate the amounts of damages claimed from each defendant. On 4 August 2003 the case was adjourned because of the judge having been busy with another case.', '20. In August 2003 the applicant complained about the length of proceedings to the Moscow City Court. In a reply letter of 30 September 2003 the Vice-President of the Moscow City Court acknowledged that since 1993 the dispute remained unresolved. The Vice-President reassured the applicant that the Moscow City Court would take charge of this case.', '21. On 3 September 2003 the applicant requested the court to adjourn the next hearing because of his absence from Moscow at the relevant dates. On 29 September 2003 the case was adjourned until 31 October 2003.', '22. On 31 October 2003 the first instance court dismissed the applicant’s complaints against the service centre and the producer factory. The court found that, although the name and address of the service centre had been indicated by the dealer company in the guarantee slip, there existed no contract imposing an obligation on the service centre to repair defective goods sold by the dealer company. As to the producer factory, based in Belarus, the court found that under the applicable Belarus law the producer could not have been held liable directly before the consumer of the goods. On 20 February 2004 the Moscow City Court upheld this decision.', '23. Article 282 of the Code of Civil Procedure of 1964 (in force at the material time) provides that the first instance court decision on the merits of the case can be appealed against (обжалованы в кассационном порядке) by the parties or other participants of the proceedings.']","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Lipetsk.', '6. In November 2000 the authorities opened criminal proceedings against the applicant in respect of three incidents of robbery and theft committed in the Lipetsk and Tambov regions.', '7. On 17 January 2001 separate criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of his involvement in the manslaughter of police officer A. and the robbery of M.', '8. On 23 January 2001 the applicant was arrested and escorted to the Interior Department of the Lipetsk Region. According to him, he was not provided with an explanation of the reason for his arrest, nor was he allowed to inform his family or counsel about it.', '9. In the evening of the same day the applicant was transferred to Dolgorukovskoe police station of the Lipetsk Region. He again unsuccessfully requested that he be allowed to inform his family and counsel. He was apprised that he was suspected of the manslaughter of A. and robbery of M.', '10. The applicant denied involvement in the above crimes, whereupon he was severely beaten by Mr Abakumov (the head of the Investigations department), Mr Kondratov, Mr Trubitsyn, Mr Lukin (the head of the public safety department) and Mr Gerasimov (the chief of the police station) who punched and kicked him on various parts of the body. At the same time Mr Kavyrshin encouraged the officers to continue the attack, and Mr Trubitsyn was hitting the applicant on the soles of the feet with a rubber truncheon. Mr Trubitsyn and Mr Kondratov suspended the applicant several times in the air by his arms tied behind his back. Mr Abakumov, Mr Kondratov, Mr Trubitsyn, Mr Butsan (a deputy chief of the police station), Mr Lukin, Mr Gerasimov and Mr Kavyrshin also forced the applicant to wear a gas mask whose air vent was occasionally blocked off.', '11. Until 5 February 2001 the applicant was subjected to similar treatment by the same police officers on a daily basis. In addition, they threatened to take the applicant’s life by placing a loaded pistol in his mouth, left him for lengthy periods of time wrapped in several mattresses with his legs tied together and his hands cuffed behind his back, forced him to wear a smoke-filled gas mask with a blocked air vent and administered electric shocks to various parts of his body through wires connected to a dynamo.', '12. On an unspecified date the applicant confessed to the manslaughter of A. and robbery of M. On 23 and 27 January 2001 he also waived his right to counsel. According to the applicant, the waiver was the result of coercion by the police officers.', '13. The investigator of the prosecutor’s office of the Lipetsk Region Mr Ibiyev was in charge of investigation of the manslaughter of A. and the robbery of M.', '14. On 30 January 2001 the applicant’s relatives retained counsel Sh. who tried unsuccessfully to see the applicant on 30 and 31 January 2001.', '15. The applicant was first allowed access to counsel on 2 February 2001.', '16. On 7 February 2001 a forensic medical examination of the applicant recorded a bruise on his left shoulder, which might have been inflicted about two weeks prior to the examination.', '17. On 13 and 19 February 2001 respectively the applicant complained to the prosecutor of the Lipetsk Region and his counsel that he had been illtreated from 23 January to 5 February and from 9 to 13 February 2001 at Dolgorukovskoe police station, with the knowledge of the investigator Mr Ibiyev. He wrote that under the duress he had confessed to involvement in the robbery of M. and manslaughter of A. and had slandered his cosuspects.', '18. On 26 May 2001 the criminal proceedings against the applicant for manslaughter and robbery were terminated, following the discovery of other suspects, who were later convicted by a court.', '19. On 14 March 2001 the applicant requested the prosecutor’s office of Yelets to institute criminal proceedings against the aforementioned police officers for ill-treatment.', '20. On 6 July and 14 September 2001 the prosecutor’s office rejected the applicant’s request, finding no evidence that an offence had been committed. The decisions contained, in particular, the results of expert medical examinations and statements obtained from several police officers. These decisions were reversed by the prosecutor’s office of the Lipetsk Region on 7 August and 11 October 2001 respectively, on the ground that the inquiry had been incomplete.', '21. On 11 October 2001 the prosecutor’s office of the Lipetsk Region opened criminal proceedings against the alleged offenders. The applicant was granted victim status.', '22. Between November 2001 and August 2002 the investigator again questioned the police officers, the applicant and his former cellmates and held confrontations between the police and the applicant.', '23. In reply to the applicant’s complaints about delays in the investigation, on 12 April 2002 the office of the Prosecutor General ordered that the investigation be sped up.', '24. On 11 August 2002 the criminal proceedings were again terminated on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that the offence had been committed.', '25. By a letter of 18 October 2002 the office of the Prosecutor General reprimanded the lower office for the discrepancies between the facts of the case and the conclusions reached by the investigator, and for attempts to cover up the violence committed by the police against the applicant.', '26. On 10 November 2002 the prosecutor’s office of the Lipetsk Region quashed the decision of 11 August 2002. The proceedings were resumed.', '27. On 16 May 2003 the police officers of Dolgorukovskoe police station, namely Mr Abakumov, Mr Kondratov, Mr Trubitsyn and Mr Lukin, were charged with abuse of authority associated with the use of violence and weapons and entailing serious consequences, an offence under Article 286 § 3 (a, b, c) of the Criminal Code.', '28. By a letter of 12 February 2004 the office of the Prosecutor General again reprimanded the lower office for poor quality and excessive length of the investigation. It pointed out, in particular, that not all the suspects had been charged and that the charges had been drawn up with certain procedural irregularities. It was suggested that the lower office resume the investigation with a different investigating group.', '29. On 29 and 30 April, 5 May 2004 ten police officers were charged with actions committed in abuse of authority and in violation of the citizens’ rights, involving the use of violence and weapons and entailing grave consequences, an offence under Article 286 § 3 (a, b, c) of the Criminal Code of Russia.', '30. On 20 December 2004 the criminal case against the police officers of Dolgorukovskoe police station was set down for trial before the Yelets Town Court, Lipetsk Region.', '31. On 28 December 2007 the Yelets Town Court found the policemen guilty as charged. The court found, inter alia, that the applicant had been illtreated in the circumstances described above (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above) as a suspect in the manslaughter of A. and the robbery of M. It detailed further that', '“unlawful methods were used to revenge A.’s death as well as with a view to coercion of the suspects to confess in the aforementioned crimes, to confirm them and to waive legal assistance”.', '32. The court sentenced the defendants to terms of imprisonment ranging from four years to five years and eight months, with a subsequent three-year prohibition on serving in law-enforcement agencies.', '33. The court also recognised the applicant’s right to compensation in separate civil proceedings.', '34. On 2 June 2008 the Lipetsk Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal but decided to commute the sentences and eliminate the prohibition on holding certain offices. The court noted that some of the defendants had been awarded medals for excellent police service and that all of them had positive references from their superiors. It therefore considered that it was possible to give them sentences below the statutory minimum. It sentenced six defendants to imprisonment ranging from two years and six months to three years and three months. The remaining four defendants were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one year and six months to two years and six months, but their sentences were suspended and they were placed on probation for two years. Those four defendants were immediately released.', '35. On an unspecified date the applicant sued the Ministry of Finance, the Interior Ministry and Dolgorukovskoe police station for compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage caused by the ill-treatment. He claimed 50,000,000 Russian roubles (RUB).', '36. On 14 May 2009 the Moscow Zamoskvoretskiy District Court allowed the claim in part. It found that the applicant had been subjected to physical and psychological violence and awarded him RUB 100,000 (about 2,300 euros (EUR)) as compensation.', '37. On an unspecified date the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal.', '38. On an unspecified date the remaining criminal charges against the applicant were submitted to the Lipetsk Regional Court for examination on the merits.', '39. On 27 June 2002 the applicant and other defendants were escorted to the Lipetsk Regional Court for a hearing. According to the applicant, he and other defendants decided not to go into the courtroom, in protest against the postponement of the hearing and lack of medical assistance to some of the defendants. The presiding judge ordered that they be brought in by force.', '40. In a report drawn up on the same day the head of the escorts group described the subsequent events in the following way:', '“After a discussion the accused agreed to proceed to the courtroom. While being escorted they attacked the escorting police officers. Physical force and special means were used against them in order to stop the assault and break their resistance.”', '41. On 15 July 2002 the prosecutor’s office of the Sovetskiy District of Lipetsk refused the request of the relatives of the accused for institution of criminal proceedings against the police officers who had escorted and beaten the accused. The decision contained the statements of the relatives who had been eyewitnesses to the events in part, the applicant’s version of the events and the statements of the escorts.', '42. Five eyewitnesses submitted that at a certain moment they had heard a noise from the staircase leading from the basement and had soon seen the accused being driven up the stairs with blows from the escort officers’ truncheons. The applicant’s mother went on to describe the officer who was beating the applicant and added that innumerable blows had been delivered by the officer, who had used his hands, feet and the truncheon.', '43. The applicant’s version of the events read as follows:', '“[The accused] agreed to enter the courtroom under the condition that they would be allowed to see their family members in the lobby... [They] started going up the stairs, but seeing that not all of their families were in the lobby they turned back. [The applicant] was handcuffed to his co-accused B. Then the escorts started pushing them into the courtroom. He does not know who was beating him...After the incident he had bruises on his body”.', '44. The statement by the head of the escort group was similar to the report drawn up by him on the day of the incident. In addition, he specified that', '“[w]hile going up the stairs, the accused P. bolted to the right and the rest attacked the escorting officers.”', '45. The escorts made similar statements. The presiding judge refused to testify.', '46. The decision not to institute criminal proceedings found it established that the escorts had acted on the judge’s order to bring the accused in by force and had not overstepped the lawful boundaries. It also mentioned that the accused had not requested medical assistance or forensic expert examination and therefore it could not be established whether they had sustained any physical harm.', '47. On an unspecified date the applicant challenged in court the decision not to institute criminal proceedings.', '48. On 20 September 2004 the Lipetsk Sovetskiy District Court heard the applicant, who testified that the escorts had beaten him without any defiance or resistance on his part. Having examined the decision not to institute the proceedings and the escorts’ reports, the court found that the impugned decision was well-grounded and disallowed the complaint.', '49. On 19 October 2004 the Lipetsk Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal.', '50. The Government submitted that the materials of the investigation had been studied by the office of the Prosecutor General, which had returned them to the regional office on 22 January 2007 without any comments.', '51. As transpires from the text of the trial judgment (see paragraph 56 below), on 4 April 2001 the applicant was questioned as an accused within the investigation opened on account of three incidents of robbery and theft committed in the Lipetsk and Tambov Regions (see paragraph 6 above). The parties did not submit the records of the interviews given by the applicant either before or after that date.', '52. In October 2001 the criminal case against him was set down for trial.', '53. The applicant pleaded not guilty at the trial and contended that his testimony in relation to the crimes he was being charged with had been obtained under duress at Dolgorukovskoe police station as well as under pressure from other police officers. He emphasised that he had been illtreated at the police station in connection not only with the manslaughter of A. but also with the other charges pending against him. He also asserted that the waivers of legal assistance had been signed by him against his will and that the waiver of 31 January 2001 had been forged by the investigator. His legal counsel had not been informed by the investigator of the investigative actions.', '54. On 28 April 2003 the Lipetsk Regional Court found the applicant guilty of assault, aiding and abetting attempted robbery, and theft, and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. Three of his co-defendants were also found guilty and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.', '55. In determining the criminal charges against the applicant and his codefendants the trial court relied on the statements made by them during the pre-trial investigation, the circumstantial evidence supplied by the victims, the statements of one of the police officers who had questioned the co-accused during the pre-trial investigation, the records of crime scene reconstructions and expert examinations of several items, which had not ruled out the possibility that the physiological evidence found on them belonged to the applicant or his co-defendants.', '56. The trial court rejected the records of interviews given by the applicant as a suspect before 4 April 2001 in respect of the second incident as obtained in violation of the procedural norms, namely without a previous imposition of a measure of restraint on the suspect. It also did not rely in its assessment of evidence on any statements made by the applicant in respect of the first and third incidents.', '57. In respect of the applicant’s claim that the statements made during the pre-trial investigation were false and had been given under duress, the court stated:', '“... The court cannot agree with the[se] arguments ... as the case materials do not contain any objective information on this account ... They are also refuted by the evidence examined in the proceedings and by the fact that the confessions contained such information as could only be known to the perpetrators of the crime.', '[The applicant] made his pre-trial statements of his own will and by his own initiative; [he] had been explained the provisions of Article 51 of the Constitution including his right not to testify against himself ...”', '58. As to the alleged lack of legal assistance at the stage of the initial investigation, the trial court found that counsel had been retained to provide assistance in respect of the investigation of the manslaughter of A., but not in respect of the rest of the charges.', '59. In his appeal to the Supreme Court of Russia the applicant’s legal counsel challenged the judgment on a number of points. He challenged the court’s analysis of the witnesses’ statements and other evidence, maintained that part of the evidence was inadmissible for procedural flaws, lack of legal assistance during the investigation or due to the coercion applied by the police officers.', '60. On 26 November 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment.', '61. The applicant was held in Yelets T-2 prison from 5 February to 13 June 2001. He was also held in Yelets IZ-48/1 detention facility from 13 June 2001 to 27 December 2003 and from 24 February to 29 April 2004. After the conviction he served his sentence in Yelets correctional colony IK-3 from 27 December 2003 to 24 February 2004 and from 29 April to 5 May 2004.', '62. The applicant submitted that in the T-2 and IZ-48/1 detention facilities the cells had been poorly ventilated, their window structures had not allowed access to fresh air, and the lighting had been inadequate. He further submitted that the toilet facilities had not been separated from the living area and that the cells had been infested with rats and mice.', '63. As to the conditions of detention in the correctional colony, the applicant alleged in general terms a lack of proper ventilation, lighting and disinfection, as well as deficiencies in the quality and amount of food supplied.', '64. On an unspecified date the applicant brought proceedings against the T-2 detention facility, seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the poor conditions of detention. In particular, he complained of stuffiness and unpleasant odour in the cells where he had been kept, lack of proper electric lighting and natural light that had allegedly led to deterioration of his eyesight, poor sanitary maintenance of the cells and breach of the statutory standards of catering for the detainees. He also raised numerous other grievances. On 16 May 2006 the Yelets Town Court of the Lipetsk Region heard the applicant and several witnesses in person, considered witness depositions and the regulations pertaining to the subject, and rejected the complaints as unfounded.', '65. It is not clear whether the applicant appealed against the judgment.', '66. The Government submitted that the cell windows of the detention facilities which had housed the applicant had never been fitted with metallic sheets or grilles which could have blocked natural light. Instead, the windows were fitted with white-painted venetian blinds which did not inhibit access of daylight to the cells. These blinds were removed from IZ48/1 and T-2 in late 2002 in accordance with the order of the Prisons Department of the Ministry of Justice of 25 November 2002. The cell windows in the correctional colony were fitted in accordance with the standards proscribed by the decree of the Ministry of Justice of 2 June 2003. During daytime the cells of the detention facilities were lit by 40-watt light bulbs whose number was in proportion with the floor area of the cells.', '67. The cells in IZ-48/1 and T-2 were equipped with combined extractandinput ventilation in working condition. Such ventilation did not exist in the cells of the correctional colony, as the inmates only slept there. All the detention facilities were naturally ventilated by way of vent lights in the windows.', '68. IZ-48/1 and T-2 were equipped with sanitary facilities in working order. The toilets, which were 1.2 to 3 metres from the living area, were fitted with partitions measuring from 1 to 1.8 metres in height, which ensured sufficient privacy. The correctional colony’s quarantine unit and unit 2 had separate sanitary rooms. The cleaning of the sanitary facilities in T-2 and IZ-48/1 was done by the inmates according to the internal regulations. In the correctional colony this cleaning was done twice a day.', '69. There were no discoveries of mice, rats or parasitical insects in the concerned detention facilities during the applicant’s period of detention. In T-2 the disinfection and disinfestation took place on a monthly basis, with additional daily inspection of the cells. In IZ-48/1 and the correctional colony such operations were carried out by a staff disinfector in accordance with a set schedule. In addition, all of the concerned facilities disinfested the inmates’ clothes and bedding on a weekly basis.', '70. As to the catering, the Government submitted that it had been provided in accordance with the statutory standards.', '75. Rubber truncheons may be used in the following cases:', '- to repel an attack on a staff member of a detention facility or on other persons;', '- to suppress mass disorder or put an end to collective violations of detention rules and regulations;', '- to put an end to a refusal to comply with lawful orders of facility administration and warders;', '- to release hostages and liberate buildings, rooms and vehicles taken over by a detainee;', '- to prevent an escape;', '- to prevent a detainee from hurting himself (section 45).', '76. Police officers are only entitled to use physical force, special means and firearms in cases and within procedures established by the Police Act; staff members of police facilities designated for temporary detention of suspects and accused persons may only use such force and special means in cases and within the procedure established by the Custody Act (section 12).', '77. Section 12 of the Police Act provides that a police officer resorting to physical force, special means or a firearm should warn an individual that force/special means/firearms are to be used against him. In cases when a delay in the use of force, special means or firearms may endanger the life and health of civilians or police officers or cause other serious damage such a warning is not necessary. Police officers should ensure that damage caused by the use of force/special means/firearms is minimal and corresponds to the character and extent of the danger that unlawful conduct by a perpetrator may pose and the resistance that the perpetrator offers. Police officers should also ensure that individuals who have been injured as a result of the use of force/special means/firearms receive medical assistance.', '78. By virtue of section 13 of the Police Act police officers may use physical force, including combat methods, to prevent criminal and administrative offences, to arrest individuals who have committed such offences, to overcome resistance to lawful orders, or if non-violent methods do not ensure compliance with responsibilities entrusted to the police.', '79. Sections 14 and 15 of the Police Act lay down an exhaustive list of cases when special means, including rubber truncheons and handcuffs, and firearms may be used. In particular, rubber truncheons may be used to repel an attack on civilians or police officers, to overcome resistance offered to a police officer and to repress mass disorder and put an end to collective actions disrupting work of transport, means of communication and legal entities.

The applicant was born in 1943 and lives in Braunschweig.', '8. The applicant and his late wife B.K., born in 1950, had lived together since 1978 and married in 1980. From 2002 onwards, B.K. had been suffering from total sensorimotor quadriplegia after falling in front of her doorstep. She was almost completely paralysed and needed artificial ventilation and constant care and assistance from nursing staff. She further suffered from spasms. According to the medical assessment, she had a life expectancy of at least fifteen more years. She wished to end what was, in her view, an undignified life by committing suicide with the applicant’s help. The couple contacted the Swiss assisted-suicide organisation, Dignitas, for assistance.', '9. In November 2004 B.K. requested the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte – “the Federal Institute”) to grant her authorisation to obtain 15 grams of pentobarbital of sodium, a lethal dose of medication that would enable her to commit suicide at her home in Braunschweig.', '10. On 16 December 2004 the Federal Institute refused to grant her that authorisation, relying on section 5(1) (6) of the German Narcotics Act (Betäubungsmittelgesetz – see “Relevant domestic law” below). It found that her wish to commit suicide was diametrically opposed to the purpose of the Narcotics Act, which was aimed at securing the necessary medical care for the individuals concerned. Authorisation could therefore only be granted for life-supporting or life-sustaining purposes and not for the purpose of helping a person to end his or her life.', '11. On 14 January 2005 the applicant and his wife lodged an administrative appeal with the Federal Institute.', '12. In February 2005 the applicant and his wife, who had to be transported lying on her back on a stretcher, travelled for approximately ten hours over a distance of more than 700 kilometres from Braunschweig to Zurich in Switzerland. On 12 February 2005 B.K. committed suicide there, assisted by Dignitas.', '13. On 3 March 2005 the Federal Institute confirmed its earlier decision. In addition, it expressed doubts as to whether a State-approved right of an individual to commit suicide could be derived from Article 8. In any event, Article 8 could not be interpreted as imposing an obligation on the State to facilitate the act of suicide with narcotic drugs by granting authorisation to acquire a lethal dose of medication. A right to commit suicide would be inconsistent with the higher-ranking principle enshrined in Article 2 § 2 of the German Basic Law (see “Relevant domestic law” below), which laid down the “comprehensive” obligation of the State to protect life, inter alia by refusing to grant authorisation to obtain a lethal dose of a drug for the purpose of committing suicide.', '14. Finally, the Federal Institute “informed” the applicant that he had no standing to lodge an administrative appeal as he lacked the need for legal protection (Rechtsschutzbedürfnis). In particular, the applicant could not improve his own position through an appeal, as his legal position had not been the subject of the administrative proceedings.', '15. On 4 April 2005 the applicant lodged an action for a declaration that the decision of the Federal Institute had been unlawful (Fortsetzungsfeststellungsklage) and that it thus had a duty to grant his wife the requested authorisation.', '16. On 21 February 2006 the Cologne Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) declared the applicant’s action inadmissible. It found that he lacked standing to lodge the action as he could not claim to be the victim of a violation of his own rights. The Federal Institute’s refusal to grant his wife authorisation to obtain a lethal dose of medication did not interfere with his right to protection of his marriage and family life as guaranteed by Article 6 § 1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – see “Relevant domestic law” below). Any other interpretation would lead to the assumption that each infringement of the rights of one spouse would automatically also be an infringement of the rights of the other spouse. That assumption would water down the separate legal personality of each spouse, which was clearly not the purpose of Article 6 § 1 of the Basic Law. Furthermore, the contested decisions did not interfere with his own right to respect for family life under Article 8 of the Convention, as they did not affect the way in which the applicant and his wife lived together.', '17. Moreover, the applicant could not rely on his wife’s rights, as the right to be granted authorisation to obtain the requested dose of drugs was of an eminently personal and non-transferable nature. Even assuming that there had been a violation of his late wife’s human dignity by the Federal Institute’s refusal, according to the Federal Constitutional Court’s case-law (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) the refusal could not produce effects beyond her life as it did not contain elements of disparagement capable of impairing the applicant’s wife’s image in the eyes of posterity.', '18. Finally, the court held that in any event the refusal of the Federal Institute to grant the applicant’s wife the requested authorisation had been lawful and in compliance with Article 8 of the Convention. In particular, any interference with her right to respect for private life was necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health and life and thus also for the protection of the rights of others. Referring to the Court’s judgment in the case of Pretty (see Pretty v. the United Kingdom, no. 2346/02, § 74, ECHR 2002III), the court held that the domestic authorities had a wide margin of appreciation to assess the danger and risks of abuse. Therefore, the fact that the provisions of the Narcotics Act permitted exceptions only for what was medically needed could not be considered disproportionate.', '19. On 22 June 2007 the North-Rhine Westphalia Administrative Court of Appeal (Oberverwaltungsgericht) dismissed the applicant’s request for leave to appeal. It found, in particular, that the right to protection of marriage and family life under Article 6 § 1 of the Basic Law and Article 8 § 1 of the Convention did not confer a right to have the spouses’ marriage terminated by the suicide of one of them. Moreover, it considered that the decisions of the Federal Institute had not interfered with the applicant’s right to respect for private life within the meaning of Article 8 § 1 of the Convention. Even if the right to die had existed, its very personal character would not allow third persons to infer from Article 6 § 1 of the Basic Law or Article 8 § 1 of the Convention a right to facilitate another person’s suicide. Finally, the applicant could not rely on Article 13 as he had no arguable claim to be the victim of a violation of a right guaranteed under the Convention.', '20. On 4 November 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, no. 1 BvR 1832/07) declared a constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant inadmissible as he could not rely on a posthumous right of his wife to human dignity. It held that the posthumous protection of human dignity extended only to violations of the general right to respect, which was intrinsic to all human beings, and of the moral, personal and social value which a person had acquired throughout his or her own life. However, such violations were not at stake in respect of the applicant’s wife. Furthermore, the applicant was not entitled to lodge a constitutional complaint as legal successor to his deceased wife. In particular, it was not possible to lodge a constitutional complaint to assert another person’s human dignity or other non-transferable rights. A legal successor could only introduce a constitutional complaint in cases, which primarily involved pecuniary claims and where the complaint was aimed at pursuing the successor’s own interests.', '21. Article 6 § 1 of the Basic Law provides that marriage and family enjoy the special protection of the State.', 'Under Article 2 § 2 of the Basic Law every person has the right to life and physical integrity.', 'The Federal Constitutional Court has accepted the posthumous protection of human dignity in cases where the image of the deceased person had been impaired in the eyes of posterity by ostracism, defamation, mockery or other forms of disparagement (see decision of 5 April 2001, no. 1 BvR 932/94).', '22. The Narcotics Act governs the control of narcotic drugs. Three annexes to the Act enumerate the substances, which are considered as drugs, including pentobarbital of sodium in Annex III.', 'According to section 4 (1) no. 3 (a) of the Narcotics Act it is permissible to obtain the substances listed in Annex III if they are prescribed by a medical practitioner. In all other cases, section 3(1)(1) of the Act provides that the cultivation, manufacture, import, export, acquisition, trade and sale of drugs are subject to authorisation from the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices.', 'In accordance with section 5(1)(6) of the Act, no such authorisation can be granted if the nature and purpose of the proposed use of the drug contravenes the purposes of the Narcotics Act, namely, to secure the necessary medical care of the population, to eliminate drug abuse and to prevent drug addiction.', 'Doctors may only prescribe pentobarbital of sodium if the use thereof on or in the human body is justified (section 13 (1)(1) of the Narcotics Act).', '23. Section 216 of the Criminal Code reads as follows:', '“(1) If a person is induced to kill by the express and earnest request of the victim the penalty shall be imprisonment from six months to five years.', '(2) Attempts shall be punishable”', 'Committing suicide autonomously is exempt from punishment under German criminal law. It follows that the act of assisting an autonomous suicide does not fall within the ambit of section 216 of the Criminal Code and is exempt from punishment. However, a person can be held criminally responsible under the Narcotics Act for having provided a lethal drug to an individual wishing to end his or her life.', 'According to the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (compare judgment of 13 September 1994, 1 StR 357/94) the discontinuation of a lifeprolonging treatment of a terminally ill patient with the patient’s consent does not engage criminal responsibility. This applies irrespective of the fact that the interruption of the treatment has to be effected by actively stopping and switching off the medical device (Federal Court of Justice, judgment of 25 June 2010, 2 StR 454/09).', '24. The professional codes of conduct are drawn up by the medical associations under the supervision of the health authorities. The codes are largely similar to the Model Professional Code for German Doctors, section 16 of which provides as follows:', '“(1) Doctors may – prioritising the will of the patient – refrain from life-prolonging measures and limit their activities to the mitigation of symptoms only if postponement of an inevitable death would merely constitute an unacceptable prolongation of suffering for the dying person.', '(2) Doctors may not actively curtail the life of the dying person. They may not put their own interests, or the interests of third parties, above the well-being of the patient.”', 'Contraventions against the Professional Code of Conduct are sanctioned by disciplinary measures culminating in a withdrawal of the licence to practise medicine.', 'In connection with the demand for doctor-assisted suicide, the 112th German Medical Assembly of May 2009 resolved that doctors should provide assistance in and during the process of dying, but should not help patients to die, as the involvement of a doctor in suicide would contravene medical ethics.', '25. Recommendation no. 1418 (1999) of the Council of Europe, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:', '“9. The assembly therefore recommends that the Committee of Ministers encourage the member states of the Council of Europe to respect and protect the dignity of terminally ill and dying persons in all respects:', 'a. by recognising and protecting a terminally ill or dying person’s rights to comprehensive palliative care, while taking the necessary measures:', '(...)', 'b. by protecting the terminally ill or dying person’s right to self-determination, while taking the necessary measures:', '(...)', 'iii. to ensure that no terminally ill or dying person is treated against his or her will while ensuring that he or she is neither influenced nor pressured by another person. Furthermore, safeguards are to be envisaged to ensure that their wishes are not formed under economic pressure;', 'iv. to ensure that a currently incapacitated terminally ill or dying person’s advance directive or living will refusing special medical treatments is observed...', 'v. to ensure that – notwithstanding the physician’s ultimate responsibility – the expressed wishes of a terminally ill or dying person with regards to particular forms of treatment are taken into account, provided they do not violate human dignity;', 'vi. to ensure that in situations where an advance directive of living will does not exist, the patient’s right to life is not infringed upon. A catalogue of treatments which under no conditions may be withheld or withdrawn is to be defined.', 'c. by upholding the prohibition against intentionally taking the life of terminally ill or dying person’s while:', '(i) recognising that the right to life, especially with regard to a terminally ill or dying person, is guaranteed by the member states, in accordance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states that “no one shall be deprived of his life intentionally”;', '(ii) recognising that a terminally ill or dying person’s wish to die never constitutes any legal claim to die at the hand of another person;', '(iii) recognising that a terminally ill or dying person’s wish to die cannot of itself constitute a legal justification to carry out actions intended to bring about death.”', '26. Comparative research in respect of forty-two Council of Europe Member States shows that in thirty-six countries (Albania, Andorra, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, San Marino, Spain, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom) any form of assistance to suicide is strictly prohibited and criminalised by law. In Sweden and Estonia, assistance to suicide is not a criminal offence; however, Estonian medical practitioners are not entitled to prescribe a drug in order to facilitate suicide. Conversely, only four member States (Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg) allow medical practitioners to prescribe lethal drugs, subject to specific safeguards (compare Haas v. Switzerland, no. 31322/07, §§ 30-31 and 55, 20 January 2011).']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

A personal file shall be opened in the establishment in which the person is to be detained in which shall be registered or placed all documents received from or sent to the court together with periodic reports on the effects of the treatment on the dangerousness of the detainee.', '2. The governor of the establishment shall send the periodic reports to the sentence-supervision court annually and when justified by the circumstances or requested by the court.”', ""“1. Up until two months prior to the date scheduled for the mandatory review of the detainee's situation, the sentence-supervision court shall order"", '(a) a psychiatric or character report, if possible in the establishment where the detainee is detained, which must be submitted to the court within thirty days;', '(b) of its own motion, or at the request of the public prosecutor, the detainee or the lawyer, measures likely to assist it in reaching a decision.', ""2. Up until the same date the social rehabilitation services shall send a report on the detainee's family and professional environment."", ""3. The mandatory review of the detainee's situation shall be conducted after hearing submissions from the public prosecutor, the lawyer and the detainee; the latter must be present, save where his state of health renders such hearing purposeless or impossible."", '...”', ""34. Article 62 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which applies as an alternative provision in proceedings before the Sentence-Supervision Court, provides – exceptionally – in urgent cases, where it is not possible to find a member or trainee member of the Bar, that the judge may officially assign an appropriate person without legal qualifications to represent the accused. In judgment no. 59/99 of 2 February 1999 (Boletim do Ministério da Justiça no. 484, p. 48), the Constitutional Court held that the appointment of a court-registry official as the accused's defence counsel did not infringe the rights of the defence, as guaranteed by Article 32 of the Constitution.""]",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Casoria.', '5. On 12 December 1992 the applicant and two others, all of whom were charged with fraudulent bankruptcy, were committed for trial in the Naples District Court. After numerous adjournments on account of failure to serve proper notice or lawyers’ strikes, a hearing was held on 23 September 1997. At the hearing the lawyer retained by Mr Sannino produced a list of witnesses he wanted to be summoned to appear in court. They were mainly people who would say that the applicant had been less directly involved in the management of X, a commercial company, after February 1989. The president of the court granted the request.', '6. At a hearing on 18 November 1997, Mr Sannino was represented by a different lawyer of his choosing, Mr G., whom he had retained on 13 September 1996. Mr G. produced the list of witnesses again. The court again granted leave for the persons named in the list to be summoned. A number of witnesses were examined on 3 November 1998 in the presence of the applicant and Mr G.', '7. In a note deposited with the registry of the Naples District Court on 18 January 1999, Mr G. announced that he was withdrawing from the case. He said that the applicant had been informed accordingly by registered letter sent on 18 January 1999. On 19 January 1999 the court assigned the applicant a defence lawyer, Mr B.', '8. On 25 January 1999 Mr B. was informed of the date of the next hearing (17 February 1999). The note he received did not, however, mention that he had been officially assigned to represent Mr Sannino. No notification was sent to Mr Sannino.', '9. Mr B. did not appear at the hearing on 17 February 1999, but the applicant did. The court ordered Mr B. to be replaced by another official defence lawyer, Mr M., and adjourned the case to 16 March 1999.', '10. On that date Mr B. again failed to appear, but the applicant was present. The court ordered Mr B. to be replaced by another official defence lawyer, Mr A. One of the witnesses called by the prosecution was examined by the prosecution’s representative and cross-examined by the lawyer of one of the applicant’s co-defendants. The court adjourned the proceedings to 5 May 1999 and ordered the other witnesses to be summoned.', '11. On that date Mr B. again failed to appear, but the applicant was present. The court ordered Mr B. to be replaced by another official defence lawyer, Mr O. Mr Sannino made a number of spontaneous statements. A witness called by the prosecution was examined. Having regard to the absence of two other prosecution witnesses, the court adjourned its examination of the case to 16 June 1999. The hearing was not held on that date and the proceedings were adjourned on account of the European parliamentary elections.', '12. Further hearings were held on 2 November and 17 December 1999 and on 18 January and 29 March 2000, to which the witnesses on the applicant’s list were not summoned. Mr B., who had still not appeared, was replaced by a different court-appointed defence lawyer each time.', '13. The record of the hearing on 2 November 1999 mentions that the applicant was present, which the applicant himself denies. He states that he attended his trial for the last time on 5 May 1999 and that after the adjournment of 16 June 1999 he was not notified of the date of the next hearing (2 November 1999). A notice of hearing had in fact been issued to a person who did not have authorisation (persona non abilitata) to receive notices. The Government produced a note (relata di notifica) before the Court, drawn up by a court bailiff, according to which notice of the hearing on 2 November 1999 had been served personally on 23 July 1999 on a person identifying himself as Giuseppe Sannino. The applicant maintains that the signature appearing on the note is not his and that on 23 July 1999 he was not at home, but at the Monteprandone Hotel in San Benedetto del Tronto, as had been proved by his lawyer in the appeals lodged after his conviction. Furthermore, he alleges, the indication that the notice of hearing was served on him personally was added by the court bailiff more than five years after the material time, “at the request of the office of the co-Agent at the Permanent Representation of Italy”.', '14. A final hearing was held on 12 April 2000. Neither the applicant nor Mr B. appeared. Mr B. was replaced by a court-appointed lawyer. Witnesses were examined.', '15. In a judgment of 12 April 2000, the text of which was deposited with the court’s registry on 19 April 2000, the Naples District Court sentenced the applicant to two years’ imprisonment.', '16. The applicant was not officially informed that the judgment against him had been deposited with the registry. He submits that, not having been aware of the conviction, he was unable to avail himself of his right to appeal within the statutory thirty-day period.', '17. He claims that he did not learn of his conviction – which had become final on 29 May 2000 – until 11 May 2001, when he asked for a copy of his criminal record.', '18. The applicant also learnt that Mr B. had been appointed to represent him, whereupon he contacted him.', '19. Through Mr B. the applicant lodged an application on 15 November 2001 for leave to appeal out of time. He claims that the notice of the date of the hearing of 2 November 1999 was void on the ground that the court bailiff’s report did not refer to the standing of the person on whom it had been served. Moreover, Mr B.’s appointment was – he alleges – unlawful because his name did not appear on the list of official defence lawyers. In any event Mr B. had never been informed of his appointment. In the applicant’s submission, the time-limit for lodging an appeal had therefore never started running.', '20. At the same time, again through Mr B., the applicant appealed against the judgment of 12 April 2000. He sought an acquittal on the merits and requested the investigation to be reopened for the purpose of hearing evidence from the witnesses indicated in the defence’s list.', '21. By an order of 8 March 2002, the Naples District Court dismissed the application for leave to appeal out of time. It observed that the applicant referred to matters regarding the conduct of the trial at first instance that should have been raised prior to the date on which the judgment of 12 April 2000 had become final. Leave to appeal out of time was granted only where the convicted person proved that he had been prevented by a case of force majeure from taking certain steps within the statutory time-limit, and not where he alleged procedural defects. In those conditions it was not necessary to ascertain whether the facts of which the applicant complained were genuine.', '22. On 29 March 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. He alleged that the Naples District Court had wrongly construed the relevant provisions of domestic law, namely, Articles 175 and 670 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP” – see “Relevant domestic law” below). He stated that, through no fault of his own, he had not been aware of the judgment.', '23. In a judgment of 4 March 2003, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 26 March 2003, the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible. It observed that the applicant was complaining of flaws in the appointment of his court-appointed defence counsel and the service of the notice of the date of the hearing of 2 November 1999. Those flaws could have resulted in certain measures being annulled on grounds of procedural errors, but had been cured (sanate) when the conviction had become final.', '24. On 29 April 2002 the Naples public prosecutor’s office ordered execution of the sentence imposed on the applicant by the judgment of 12 April 2000. Execution was stayed, however.', '25. On 11 June 2002 the applicant requested the application of an alternative measure to detention, namely, probation (affidamento in prova al servizio sociale). By an order of 28 June 2005, the Naples Post-Sentencing Court granted the applicant’s request. On 5 September 2005 the applicant declared that he accepted the obligations stipulated in the probation order, namely, not to leave the district (comune) of Casoria without prior authorisation of the judge supervising enforcement of sentences; to devote himself fully to his work at the M. company; not to leave his house before 8 a.m. and not to return after 8 p.m; not to associate with reoffenders; and to report to the police station at least three times per week.', '26. Article 175 §§ 2 and 3 of the CCP provides for the possibility of applying for leave to appeal out of time. The relevant parts of that provision were worded as follows at the material time:', '“In the event of conviction in absentia ..., the defendant may request the reopening of the time allowed for appeal against the judgment where he can establish that he had no effective knowledge [effettiva conoscenza] [of it] ... [and] on condition that no appeal has been lodged by his lawyer and there has been no negligence on his part or, in the case of a conviction in absentia having been served ... on his lawyer ..., that he did not deliberately refuse to take cognisance of the procedural steps.', 'A request for the reopening of the time allowed for appeal must be lodged within ten days of the date ... on which the defendant learnt [of the judgment], failing which it shall be declared inadmissible.”', '27. The validity of a conviction may be contested by means of an objection to execution under Article 670 § 1 of the CCP, the relevant parts of which provide:', '“Where the judge supervising enforcement establishes that a judgment is invalid or has not become enforceable, he shall, [after] assessing on the merits [nel merito] whether the safeguards in place for a convicted person deemed to be untraceable have been observed, ... suspend its enforcement, ordering, where necessary, that the person be released and that defects in the service of process be remedied. In such cases the time allowed for appealing shall begin to run again.”', '28. Under Article 97 §§ 1, 4, 5 and 6 of the CCP:', '“1. A defendant who has not appointed a lawyer of his own choosing or finds himself without one shall be assisted by a court-appointed defence lawyer.', '...', '4. Where defence counsel’s presence is necessary and [the lawyer] chosen by the defendant or the court-appointed lawyer ... has not been found, has not appeared or has withdrawn from the case, the judge shall appoint as his replacement another defence lawyer immediately available [reperibile], to whom the provisions of Article 102 shall apply [under that provision, the replacement lawyer exercises the rights of the defence counsel and is subject to the same obligations]. ...', '5. The court-appointed defence lawyer shall defend his client [prestare il patrocinio] and shall not be replaced other than for a legitimate reason [giustificato motivo].', '6. The court-appointed lawyer shall cease to act if [the defendant] appoints a lawyer of his own choosing.”', '29. A defence lawyer who has just been appointed may request an adjournment of the hearing date. Article 108 § 1 of the CCP provides, inter alia:', '“Where a defence lawyer withdraws from the case, has his appointment revoked or is incompatible or abandons the case, the defendant’s new lawyer or the court-appointed [defence lawyer] can request sufficient time [congruo], of no less than seven days, in which to study the file and acquaint himself with the facts of the case.”', '30. In accordance with Article 148 § 5 of the CCP, the reading out of decisions to persons present in the courtroom and the information given to them orally by the judge “shall replace formal notice [sostituiscono le notificazioni], on condition that they are noted in the record of hearing”.', '31. After production of the evidence requested by the parties, the judge may, if he considers it “absolutely necessary”, order that further evidence be adduced (Article 507 § 1 of the CCP).']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

On 24 September 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a criminal gang specialising in the theft of cars. On 23 November 2006 the applicant was convicted and on 25 April 2007 his conviction was upheld on appeal by the Chişinău Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. During the criminal proceedings against him the applicant was detained in the following detention facilities:', '- 26 November 2003 – 2 December 2003: Prison no. 13;', '- 2 December 2003 – 14 January 2004: detention facility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs;', '- 14 January 2004 – 16 February 2004: Prison no. 13;', '- 16 February 2004 – 25 February 2004: detention facility of the Ministry of Internal Affairs;', '- 25 February 2004 – 4 January 2007: Prison no. 13;', '- 4 January 2007 – 1 March 2007: Prison no. 16;', '- 1 March 2007 – 1 April 2008: Prison no. 13;', '- 1 April 2008 – 2 June 2010: Prison no. 8;', '- 2 June 2010 – 4 February 2011: Prison no. 12;', '- 4 February 2011 – present: Prison no. 8.', '6. According to the applicant the conditions of detention in Prison no. 13 and Prison no. 8 were very poor and amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. In respect of Prison no. 13, the applicant submitted that the cells were overcrowded and humid and there was no ventilation. He also complained about the quality and quantity of the food. As to Prison no. 8, he submitted that it was located on territory controlled by the Transdniestrian separatist authorities but was itself under the control of the Moldovan constitutional authorities. The separatist authorities had cut off the power and water supplies and disconnected the prison from the sewage network. As a result the inmates had electrical power for only three hours per day and the water was limited to fifteen litres per day, plus another fifty litres once a week for showers and washing clothes.', '7. The relevant parts of the Report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) concerning a visit to Moldova between 14 au 24 September 2007 read as follows (unofficial translation):', '“84. Penitentiary establishment No. 8 in Bender had been the subject of three visits by the CPT since 2003, following the decision of the municipal authorities of Bender to deprive the establishment of running water and electricity supply (and, as of 2005, to disconnect it from the city’s sewage disposal system). The seriousness of the situation confronting the establishment led the Committee to state in the report on its visit in March 2006 that, unless the above-mentioned problems were resolved, prisoners should be relocated elsewhere. In their response to that report, the Moldovan authorities indicated that they considered the situation at Penitentiary establishment No. 8 in Bender to be under control and saw no reasons for the relocation of prisoners to other establishments.', '85. When re-visited by the CPT’s delegation on 21 September 2007, the establishment was holding 99 prisoners (compared with 101 on 18 March 2006). The delegation was informed that some 35 inmates had been released since March 2006, and approximately the same number of new prisoners had been admitted. The great majority of the prisoners currently held at the establishment originated from the Transdniestrian region or nearby locations. The delegation gained the impression that all prisoners who had been admitted in the last year had themselves asked for a transfer to Bender, in particular because of wishing to be closer to their families. An examination of the documentation confirmed that newly admitted prisoners had been expressly informed of the conditions prevailing at the establishment (i.e. absence of running water, electricity and sewage disposal) and had confirmed with their signature their wish to be transferred there. Further, it appeared that the few inmates who had requested transfer to other establishments had received satisfaction.', '86. As regards material conditions, in terms of living space per prisoner (some 6 m²), state of repair and decoration, the dormitories in which inmates were accommodated offered conditions superior to those witnessed at any other penitentiary establishment seen by the CPT in Moldova. Further, prisoners stated that the food they received was better than that provided elsewhere. Moreover, no problems were reported as regards the heating.', 'However, in the absence of any progress in the stand-off between the municipal authorities of Bender and the Moldovan authorities, electricity continued to be produced by generators and was available 3 to 4 hours a day in the evenings, enabling inmates inter alia to watch TV. Further, water was delivered regularly by a lorrycistern and was distributed into reservoirs supplying the kitchen and the bathroom; inmates could take a shower once a week. As for toilets, cesspools had been installed in the basements of the unused buildings.', '87. Prisoners could circulate freely around the establishment’s extensive premises and engage in outdoor sports. However, there was a shortage of organised activities. Some 36 prisoners were employed in the establishment’s general services (kitchen, cleaning, repairs, etc.). Further, the establishment’s director spoke of plans to set up a carpentry workshop; however, it was unclear when these plans would materialise.', '88. The delegation was informed that relations with the municipal authorities of Bender had become less tense in the last year. As a result, staff travelling across the border between Moldova and the Transdniestrian region were reportedly able to come to work on a regular basis.', '89. To sum up, it is clear that the Moldovan authorities have continued to take steps to alleviate, as far as possible, the difficult situation facing Penitentiary establishment No. 8 in Bender and to ensure that the health and welfare of prisoners are protected. Further, there are signs of a more pragmatic approach on the part of both parties concerned by the stand-off. This is encouraging.']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1958 and 1931 respectively and live in Beryozovka, the Odessa region. The first applicant is a farmer who specialises in arable crops. The second applicant is his mother, a pensioner.', '6. On 24 January 2001 the first applicant was stopped by tax police officers when driving a lorry leased from his mother. On checking the lorry the officers discovered 500 kilos of wheat, 1,400 kilos of flour and 3,000 kilos of wheat middlings for which the applicant had no proper documents. The police officers drew up a report on an administrative offence and seized the lorry and the load pending adjudication of the case by the court.', '7. On 26 January 2001 the Trostyanets District Court (the “District Court”) found that the first applicant had transported the property of a third person for sale without a relevant business permit and was therefore guilty of unlawful business activity (an administrative offence). The District Court fined the applicant 51 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) and ordered the confiscation of the flour and wheat middlings. It further held that the 500 kilos of wheat were not subject to forfeiture as they belonged to the first applicant.', '8. According to the applicants, after the judgment of 26 January 2001 they applied on several occasions to the Trostyanets Town Tax Office (the “Tax Office”), requesting that the lorry and the wheat load, which were not covered by the confiscation order, be returned to them. Their requests were rejected however.', '9. On an unspecified date the confiscated products were sold and the funds were transferred to the State budget.', '10. On 19 June 2001 the President of the Vinnytsya Region Court (subsequently renamed as the Vinnytsya Regional Court of Appeal), following an extraordinary review, quashed the judgment of 26 January 2001, stating that the conviction of the first applicant and the imposed penalties had been unsubstantiated. He therefore closed the case.', '11. On 15 August 2001 the Tax Office returned the lorry and the wheat load to the applicants. According to the applicants the wheat load had deteriorated significantly and the lorry was damaged when returned.', '12. On 3 January 2002 the applicants lodged a claim with the Vinnytsya Region Court of Appeal against the District Court and the Tax Office seeking damages for the wrongful conviction; for the groundless seizure and lengthy detention of their property; and for the deterioration of their property when in charge of the Tax Office. They claimed in particular that the Tax Office unlawfully retained the lorry and the wheat load despite the fact that those objects were not covered by the confiscation order; and that the lorry and the wheat load had significantly deteriorated when returned.', '13. On 20 January 2002 the Vinnytsya Regional Court of Appeal declared the claim inadmissible, stating, in particular:', '“According to Article 62 of the Constitution, compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused in the course of the administration of justice can be paid by the State to a person who has been groundlessly sentenced provided that the judgment in a criminal case has been quashed as unfair.', 'However, even in such a case the damage is compensated by the State, and not by a court or a judge.', 'Therefore, the court (or judge) as a body (or individual) administering justice cannot be a defendant in civil litigation, as the law provides another mechanism for correcting mistakes and irregularities committed in the course of the administration of justice.”', 'The court did not give any reasons why the part of the applicants’ claim submitted against the Tax Office could not be considered by the court.', '14. By a letter of 23 March 2002 the Deputy Chairman of the State Tax Administration confirmed to the first applicant that he could claim compensation for damage, allegedly inflicted by the Tax Office, by filing a relevant civil suit with a court.', '15. On an unspecified date the State Tax Administration, having made an internal inquiry, established that the Tax Office had failed to take the necessary steps to return to the owners the lorry and the wheat load in time. It further concluded that disciplinary measures were needless since the relevant official had retired.', '16. On 7 May 2002 the applicants lodged with the Supreme Court a cassation appeal against the decision of 20 January 2002, contending that the refusal to consider their claim against the District Court and the Tax Office had been unlawful.', '17. On 21 August 2002, following their request of 5 August 2002, the Tax Office reimbursed to the applicants the value of the confiscated products.', '18. On 15 November 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicants’ cassation appeal against the decision of 20 January 2002, finding that there had been no procedural irregularities. The applicants were not present at the hearing. By a letter of 10 December 2002 the Supreme Court informed the applicants of that decision.', '19. Section 55 of the Constitution provides, inter alia, that everyone is guaranteed the right to challenge in court the decisions, actions or omissions of bodies of State power, bodies of local self-government, officials and officers.', '20. Section 56 of the Constitution provides that everyone has the right to receive compensation from the State or municipal authorities for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage incurred as a result of the unlawful actions or omissions of State bodies, municipal authorities or their officials in the course of the exercise of their powers.', '21. Section 62 of the Constitution concerns the presumption of innocence and provides, inter alia, that if the sentence in a criminal case is quashed as unfair the State must provide compensation for any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage resulting from the groundless conviction.', '22. Section 442 of the Code provided that compensation was to be paid for damage caused by the acts of State entities and public officials in the course of the exercise of their administrative powers in accordance with the general rules, unless the law provided otherwise.', '23. Section 265 of the Code provided, inter alia, that objects and documents used to commit an administrative offence could be seized by the competent authorities pending adjudication of the administrative case. Depending on the outcome of the administrative proceedings the seized objects and documents were thereafter to be either confiscated, destroyed, or returned to the relevant persons.', '24. Section 287 of the Code provided that a decision imposing an administrative penalty could be appealed, except for decisions given by the first-instance court. The latter were final and were not subject to the ordinary administrative appeal procedure, unless the legislation provided otherwise.', '25. Section 3 of the Act provided, inter alia, that court judgments in administrative cases were to be enforced by the State Bailiffs’ Service as regards pecuniary penalties.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was not an eyewitness to his brother's arrest and the following account is based on the witness statements collected by him later."", ""8. On the night of 23 October 1998 the applicant's brother Suleyman Tsechoyev was arrested in the family house situated at 40, Shosseynaya Street, in the settlement of Sagopshi in the Malgobek district of Ingushetia. The arrest was apparently carried out by the officers of the North Caucasus Regional Department for the Fight against Organised Crime (Северокавказское Региональное Управление по Борьбе с Организованной Преступностью – “the RUBOP”). The applicant submitted that at the time of the arrest the officers did not introduce themselves and did not present any documents or justification for their action. Nor did they inform the family where they were taking Mr Tsechoyev."", ""9. On 28 October 1998 the applicant, alerted by his mother, arrived at Sagopshi. His relatives told him that there had been no news of Suleyman Tsechoyev's whereabouts."", '10. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 3 November 1998 Suleyman Tsechoyev had been charged with aiding and abetting the kidnapping of Magomed K. on 5 September 1998, together with two other men and unidentified persons from Chechnya. The kidnapped man had been taken to Chechnya in two VAZ cars.', '11. On 6 November 1998 the applicant, together with his sister, met with Mr Magomed Ye., the deputy prosecutor of Malgobek. The latter informed them that their brother had been arrested on his orders by officers of the RUBOP and was being detained in the town of Nazran, Ingushetia. Mr Magomed Ye. refused to tell the applicant and his sister where exactly their brother was detained and what charges had been brought against him.', '12. On 20 November 1998 the applicant found out that his brother had been detained at the temporary detention centre (“the IVS”) of the Malgobek district police department (ROVD).', '13. The applicant hired a lawyer, who unsuccessfully tried to reach Suleyman Tsechoyev at the detention centre.', '14. In the beginning of December 1998 the applicant had a meeting with Mr Magomed Ye. The latter allegedly told him that he would release his brother in exchange for 6,000 US dollars (USD) and threatened to have Suleyman Tsechoyev transferred to the headquarters of the RUBOP in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, where he would be subjected to severe illtreatment, if the applicant refused to pay the money. The applicant refused to pay.', '15. On 24 February 1999 the applicant saw his brother at the IVS. Suleyman Tsechoyev told the applicant that he had been pressured to confess to the crime and that he had been threatened with transfer to the RUBOP headquarters in Nalchik.', ""16. On 25 February 1999 the applicant returned to the detention centre to see his brother. He was told by the employees that the night before, at around 10 p.m., Suleyman Tsechoyev had been taken to the prosecutor's office and that after that, at about midnight, he had been taken away in a vehicle in the direction of Nalchik."", ""17. The Government confirmed that on 23 October 1998 Suleyman Tsechoyev had been detained by the law-enforcement bodies in accordance with the provisions of the criminal procedural legislation in force at the material time. He had been detained in connection with the investigation into Mr Magomed K.'s abduction that had been opened on 15 September 1998 and registered under file number 98540062. The decision to place Suleyman Tsechoyev under arrest had been unsuccessfully appealed against to a court. The Government submitted that the term of detention for Mr Tsechoyev had been extended on several occasions, the last of which had been on 25 May 1999; his detention had been authorised until 24 October 1999."", ""18. The applicant and his relatives had no news of Suleyman Tsechoyev after 25 February 1999. On 16 March 1999 a man who introduced himself as “Aslan” contacted one of the applicant's relatives. According to “Aslan”, he had been detained with Suleyman Tsechoyev in cell no. 8 in pre-trial detention centre no. 1 (SIZO-1) in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria. The applicant's brother had been detained there under a false identity and had been in poor health."", ""19. On 17 March 1999 the applicant, together with his lawyer Mr Magomed Ga., went to Nalchik to visit his brother. The applicant's lawyer was granted permission to see Suleyman Tsechoyev. According to the lawyer, Suleyman Tsechoyev was in poor health and had no access to medical treatment."", '20. On 22 March 1999 the head of the SIZO-1 medical unit provided the applicant with a handwritten statement. According to it, Suleyman Tsechoyev had been brought to SIZO-1 on 26 February 1999 with numerous bruises, abrasions, scratches on his limbs and injuries to the chest.', ""21. On 30 July 1999 the applicant and his sister obtained the Malgobek district prosecutor's permission to visit their brother. Suleyman Tsechoyev told them that he had been pressured to confess to the involvement in the abduction of Mr Magomed K. and that he had been ordered to convince his relatives to pay USD 6, 000 for his release. Suleyman Tsechoyev told his relatives that he had been subjected to severe beatings in the building of the RUBOP situated at 49 Naumova Street in Nalchik. Finally, he insisted that the applicant and his other relatives should not pay money for his release. It does not appear that any complaints have been lodged in this respect."", '22. On 23 August 1999, at about 9 a.m., a group of four men wearing police uniforms arrived at SIZO-1 in a VAZ-2106 car. The men identified themselves as officers of the Malgobek ROVD in Ingushetia. Two of them entered the premises of the centre and produced the following documents authorising the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS:', 'a) a letter from the acting prosecutor of Malgobek Mr U. B., dated 21 August 1999, requesting that Suleyman Tsechoyev be handed over to four officers of the Malgobek ROVD: Anzor K., Islam O., Kambulat K. and Ruslan B;', 'b) a procedural decision in criminal case no. 98540062, dated 21 August 1999, concerning the transfer of the accused Suleyman Tsechoyev for investigative measures from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS;', 'c) an authority form, dated 23 August 1999, issued by the head of the Malgobek ROVD to officers of the Malgobek ROVD, Anzor K., Islam O., Kambulat K. and Ruslan B., concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev to the Malgobek IVS.', ""23. The documents were produced to the employees of SIZO-1, officers Sh. and U., who handed Suleyman Tsechoyev over to the two men. The latter took the applicant's brother away in an unknown direction."", ""24. On 24 August 1999 Suleyman Tsechoyev's body was found in the Mayskiy district of Kabardino-Balkaria with gunshot wounds to the head."", ""25. On 7 September 1999 two RUBOP officers arrived at the applicant's house. They told him that a body whose fingerprints were consistent with those of Suleyman Tsechoyev had been found in Kabardino-Balkaria and asked him to identify it."", '26. On 8 September 1999 the applicant and his sister identified the body as that of Suleyman Tsechoyev.', '27. On 8 September 1999 the Kabardino-Balkaria forensic assessments office issued a report (no. 79). According to this, Suleyman Tsechoyev had died on an unspecified date from an open gunshot wound to the head.', '28. It can be seen from the documents submitted by the Government that on 23 October 1999 the criminal proceedings in respect of Suleyman Tsechoyev were terminated in view of his death.', '29. On 2 December 1999 the Malgobek town civil registration office issued a death certificate for Suleyman Tsechoyev. It stated that death had occurred on 23 August 1999.', ""30. The description of the events of the night of 23 October 1998 and the subsequent developments is based on the following documents: the applicant's accounts given on 10 and 16 February, 28 July and 29 August 2005; an account by the applicant's sister Ms L.B., given on 4 August 2005; an account by the applicant's neighbour R.G., given on 15 August 2005; a hand-drawn map of the premises of the applicant's house in Sagopshi and copies of the documents submitted with the application."", ""31. The Russian press widely reported the kidnapping for ransom of Magomed K., whose younger brother Musa K. had occupied a top executive position in Lukoil, one of Russia's largest oil companies, at the relevant time. It appears from the reports that Magomed K. had been freed from UrusMartan, Chechnya, some time in 1999 as a result of a raid carried out by his relatives, including Musa K., and that several well-known Chechen “field commanders” involved in the kidnapping were killed. Numerous publications also reported Suleyman Tsechoyev's murder and linked it to the kidnapping of Magomed K. Mr Magomed Ye., former deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek district, was quoted in many of these publications and wrote several articles himself."", '32. It can be seen from the information submitted by the Government that the official investigation into the kidnapping of Magomed K. was closed in November 2001.', ""33. The Government, in response to the Court's request, submitted 380 pages from the investigation file, as well as additional information about its progress. They stated that disclosure of the remaining documents from the file could be harmful to the continuing investigation and sought application of Rule 33 § 3 of the Rules of Court to the submitted documents."", '34. The applicant, in turn, submitted some additional information about his contacts with the investigation. The relevant information may be summarised as follows.', ""35. On 24 August 1999 the prosecutor's office of the Mayskiy district of Kabardino-Balkaria instituted an investigation under Article 105 § 1 of the Criminal Code (murder) into the death of an unknown man whose body had been found in the vicinity of Aleksandrovskaya with gunshot wounds to the head. The case file was given number 16/24-99 (in the submitted materials the number is also referred to as 16/24)."", ""36. On 9 September 1999 the investigation into the murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev was transferred to the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office. The applicant's family was informed of this by a letter from the Prosecutor General's Office."", ""37. On 9 December 1999 the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation in respect of Mr Magomed Ye. under Article 285 § 3 of the Criminal Code (abuse of power entailing serious consequences), no. 99540071. On 15 March 2000 the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened an additional investigation into abuse of power by Magomed Ye. under file number 2054007."", ""38. On 23 May 2000 the three cases were joined under file number 16/24-99 at the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office."", '39. On 9 July 2001 (in accordance with the decision of 4 September 2002 suspending the investigation, see paragraph 46 below) the investigation in respect of Mr Magomed Ye., his relatives and members of the K. family (twelve persons altogether) for abuse of power was closed.', '40. On 12 July 2001 criminal charges against Magomed Ye. for murder and kidnapping were dropped for want of evidence.', '41. On 15 July 2001 the investigation into the murder was suspended in view of the failure to identify the suspects.', ""42. On 23 July 2001 the department of the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office concluded that the investigation had been incomplete. The decisions of 12 and 15 July 2001 were quashed and the investigation was remitted to an investigator of that department with a number of specific directions."", ""43. In December 2001 the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office created a special investigative group charged with solving the crime."", '44. On 15 May 2002 charges of involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Mr Magomed Ye. were dropped for want of evidence. On the same day proceedings were suspended for lack of suspects.', ""45. On 4 June 2002 the Russian Deputy General Prosecutor quashed the decisions of 9 July 2001 and 15 May 2002 and appointed a new investigative group, headed by the deputy head of the Northern Caucasus department of the General Prosecutor's Office."", ""46. On 4 September 2002 the investigation in criminal case no. 16/2499 was suspended owing to the failure to identify the perpetrators. On the same date the North Caucasus department of the Prosecutor General's Office informed the applicant of the decision."", '47. On 24 August 1999 the investigators carried out an examination of the site, compiled a description of the body and collected three cartridges. Two days later an additional examination of the site resulted in the finding of another cartridge and four bullets.', '48. On 25 August 1999 a forensic expert from the Mayskoye police department carried out an examination of the body and an autopsy. The expert found, inter alia, that the body bore six gunshot wounds to the left side of the head, each of which could have been lethal. The shots had been fired from a close range within a short period of time. The expert noted several bruises and abrasions on the face and hands, especially around the wrists, which had been caused within a period of twenty-four hours before death; he also noted traces indicating that the body had been dragged along immediately after the death had occurred. The expert concluded that death had occurred two or three days before the examination of the body.', '49. On 23 September 1999 the ballistic expert reported that the four cartridges and bullets had been fired from one “Makarov” 9 mm calibre hand pistol. This conclusion was confirmed by a ballistic expert report of 14 November 1999, carried out by the expert department of the Ministry of the Interior of Kabardino-Balkaria.', ""50. On 9 September 1999 the investigator of the Mayskoye district prosecutor's office questioned the applicant. He stated that his brother had been detained on 23 October 1998 on the orders of the deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek district, Mr Magomed Ye., on suspicion of involvement in kidnapping. The applicant stated that on several occasions his brother had been transferred from one detention place to another. He had last seen him in June 1999 and Suleyman had complained that for a long time no investigative action had taken place. He also stated that in the beginning of September 1999 the investigator working on the kidnapping case had told him that he had ordered his brother's transfer to Malgobek and that he would soon be taken there. The applicant named several persons who could have been responsible for his brother's death, including former police officer Musa Kh., a cousin of the former deputy Malgobek district prosecutor Ibragim Ye., and Musa K."", ""51. On 30 September 1999 the investigator of the KabardinoBalkaria prosecutor's office again questioned the applicant, who gave detailed submissions relating the account of his brother's arrest and detention as summarised above. The applicant told the investigator that his brother had close friends in Urus-Martan, Chechnya, where he regularly travelled. He also stated that he suspected Magomed Ye. of masterminding and carrying out the operation aimed at abducting Suleyman Tsechoyev from the pretrial detention centre. He stated that Magomed Ye. had possessed the knowledge required to produce the papers necessary to organise the prisoner's transfer, that he had the necessary computer and other technical skills and that he had been rewarded by the relatives of Magomed K. In particular, the applicant stated that he was aware that Magomed Ye. had obtained from those relatives a VAZ vehicle, a computer, a mobile phone and that he had bought a flat in Nalchik, Kabardino-Balkaria, with money received from them. Furthermore, the applicant accused Magomed Ye. of being present when his brother had been beaten by relatives of Magomed K. outside Malgobek in February 1999. He again accused the K. family of organising his brother's murder and said that the crime could have been carried out by Magomed Ye., Musa Kh, Zaurbek Kh. and Mukhszhir Ye."", ""52. On the same day the applicant's sister L.B. told the investigator that she had visited her brother in prison, that he had not complained of anything but had denied that he had been involved in the kidnapping. She also named Magomed Ye. and Musa K., brother of the kidnapped Magomed K., as the possible perpetrators of the killing."", ""53. On 30 September 1999 the applicant and his sister L. B. were granted the status of victims in the criminal proceedings relating to their brother's murder. On 17 April 2000 the applicant was granted the status of victim in the criminal investigation carried out “into the unlawful actions of the former deputy prosecutor of the Malgobek town, Mr M[agomed] Ye.”"", '54. On 11 November 1999 the applicant and L. B. wrote to the Malgobek district prosecutor. They accused Mr Magomed Ye. of allowing the beating of their brother on the night of 24 to 25 February 1999 by two relatives of Ye. and by the relatives of Magomed K. They again submitted that Ye. had obtained property from the family of Magomed K. in return for his “assistance” in the solving of his kidnapping.', ""55. On 28 November 1999 the applicant's sister told the investigators that on 3 April 1999 she had visited her brother in prison and that on that day she had noticed marks from handcuffs and traces of beatings on his face. She also submitted that Suleyman Tsechoyev had told her that during the night of 24 February 1999 Magomed Ye. and his relatives, together with relatives of Magomed K., had taken him outside of Malgobek and beaten him in an attempt to obtain a confession regarding the kidnapping."", ""56. On 15 December 1999 the applicant gave detailed submissions to an investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office relating the arrest and detention of his brother, as described above. In addition, he submitted that on 3 April 1999 his brother had told him in great detail what had happened on the night of 24 to 25 February 1999 and named other persons who had been detained with him and questioned by the relatives of Magomed K. He also allegedly told him that he had been taken to several detention centres in the Northern Caucasus prior to being admitted to the pre-trial detention centre no. 1 in Nalchik because he had suffered from the beatings and the officials had refused to accept him. The applicant named Mr Magomed Ye. as the individual responsible for the ill-treatment of his brother and, ultimately, for organising his transfer to the murderers. He stressed that the documents authorising his brother's removal from the prison in Nalchik had been produced by someone who had detailed knowledge of the requirements for such documents and that the forgery had necessitated considerable computer skills. The applicant also submitted that on 28 August 1999 he had gone to the SIZO no. 1 in Nalchik and left a food parcel for his brother, which had been accepted. At that time he had not been informed that his brother was no longer detained there."", ""57. On 17 December 1999 the applicant's sister repeated her previous statements. She stated, further, that in May and October 1999 Mr Ye. had threatened to kill her brother, the applicant."", ""58. On 17 December 1999 the applicant's mother gave statements similar to those of the applicant and her daughter."", ""59. On 21 April 2000 the applicant was questioned by an investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office again. He repeated his allegations against Magomed Ye."", ""60. On 16 October 2001 the investigator from the Ingushetia prosecutor's office questioned the applicant again. He supplemented his previous statements and claimed that Mr Magomed Ye. had been acting in cooperation with the relatives of Magomed K. from the very early stages of the investigation. He stated that as early as September 1998 a number of men, whose names he had supplied to the investigation, had been arrested and then transferred to private residences where they had been beaten and tortured with the aim of extracting confessions. According to the applicant, Mr Magomed Ye. had participated in these actions and filmed them. The applicant also claimed that in February 1999 Mr Ye. had asked his mother and sister to pay USD 6,000 in return for his brother's release. He also submitted additional details about the circumstances of his brother's beatings on 24 February 1999."", ""61. The investigators questioned the staff at the pre-trial detention centre in Nalchik who had been on duty on 23 August 1999. On 10 September 1999 two officers stated that they had inspected the papers of the two men who had presented themselves as police officers from the Malgobek ROVD and had not found them suspicious. They had organised the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev to the two men in accordance with the usual procedure. One of the men bore the distinction of a Senior Lieutenant, the other of a non-commissioned officer of the Ministry of the Interior. The men had spoken Ingush between themselves; one of them had had a Motorolla radio receiver but had not used it during the encounter. One of the officers gave a detailed physical description of the two men and said that he would be prepared to identify them. The deputy head of the detention centre, Mr Zaurbi Sh., told the investigators that he had checked the names of the two men and the papers for the prisoner's transfer. He had not inspected their documents because, according to the relevant procedure, the identity documents should have been left at the entrance to the building."", ""62. Several of Suleyman Tsechoyev's co-detainees in the pretrial detention centre in Nalchik stated on 10 September 1999 that the deceased had not raised any complaints, that he had been visited by a lawyer and by his brother and that in August 1999 he had been taken away, apparently for transfer to Ingushetia."", ""63. On 12 October 1999 the acting prosecutor of the Malgobek district told the investigators that he had ordered Mr Tsechoyev's transfer to Malgobek on 5 August 1999, but for unknown reasons that order had not been complied with. The documents which had enabled Mr Tsechoyev to be kidnapped had been forged and their numbers corresponded to other documents. The persons indicated in the escort documents had not worked at the Malgbek ROVD. In June 2002 he gave a further statement, describing Mr Magomed Ye. as an honest and motivated officer who had been falsely accused by the applicant and his relatives."", '64. On 15 November 1999 an officer from the Nalchik pre-trial detention centre identified a man from a photo as one of those who had collected Suleyman Tsechoyev on 23 August 1999. Later that man, a worker in a gas plant, submitted reliable evidence that he had not been in Kabardino-Balkaria at the time, as supported by documents and witness statements collected by the investigation.', ""65. On 22 December 1999 the head of the Malgobek ROVD stated that Suleyman Tsechoyev had been detained at the Malgobek IVS from September 1998 to February 1999. He was shown the registration log of the IVS, according to which on 24 February 1999 Mr Tsechoyev had been taken out of the IVS at 11.40 p.m. by the local police officer Musa Kh. The head of the ROVD explained that he had been informed late at night by the officer on duty that the deputy district prosecutor had ordered that Mr Tsechoyev be brought to his office for questioning. At first the head of the ROVD had refused, but Mr Ye. had called him and insisted, threatening to open a criminal investigation if he did not comply. Mr Ye. explained that he had senior officers of the Ministry of the Interior in his office and that it was possible that Mr Tsechoyev would be transferred to Kabardino-Balkaria for further investigation. The head of the ROVD then agreed, but instructed his staff to obtain Mr Ye.'s signature to the effect that he had accepted the detainee. He could not explain why a district police officer, Mr Musa Kh., had signed. When questioned about Suleyman Tsechoyev's abduction and murder, the head of the police confirmed that the men identified in the escort documents had never served at the ROVD and that he had not issued the documents in question."", ""66. In addition to the above investigative documents, copies of which the Government submitted to the Court, it can be seen from their memorandum of 2 October 2008 that the investigators also questioned five acting and former officers of the Malgobek prosecutor's office, all of whom denied that they had been aware of any connection between the K. family and Magomed Ye. One of these officers, quoted by the Government, stated that Suleyman Tsechoyev had been a member of the bandit group based in UrusMartan, along with three other men who had been charged with kidnappings."", '67. The Government also submitted a copy of the record of interview of Zaurbek Kh., who stated that he had permanently lived in Moscow and had been there throughout the summer of 1999. Zaurbek Kh. denied having known Suleyman Tsechoyev; as to Magomed Ye., the witness stated that he had gone to the same school but had not kept in contact in recent years.', ""68. On 16 November 1999 the investigators in criminal case no. 16/2499 carried out an expert assessment of three documents concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 on 23 August 1999. The criminology expert of Kabardino-Balkaria concluded that the imprint of the Malgobek district prosecutor's office's seal had been reproduced with the aid of a factory-made stamp, but not the one used by the district prosecutor's office. The imprint of the Malgobek ROVD seal had been reproduced with the aid of a colour printer. A graphology expert report reported difficulties in analysing short notes with dates and signatures on the documents, but concluded that some of the notes could have been made by Mr Magomed Ye., his brother and by the acting Malgobek prosecutor."", '69. On 14 December 1999 the Central North-Caucasus forensic laboratory issued an additional expert assessment. It concluded that the signatures on all the documents concerning the transfer of Suleyman Tsechoyev from SIZO-1 to the Malgobek IVS had been forged, and that the date and signature on one of the documents had been written by Mr Magomed Ye.', '70. In October 2001 the investigators questioned a number of experts from the Central North-Caucasus forensic laboratory seeking an explanation for the differences in the reports. The experts referred to the incomplete conclusions of some of the studies.', '71. On 12 November 2001 the Russian Federal Forensic Assessments Office of the Ministry of Justice concluded that it was impossible to establish with certainty whether the handwritten words on the document in question had been written by Mr Magomed Ye. or not.', ""72. According to the documents contained in the criminal investigation file, at some point in 2001 documents constituting the basis for examination and a part of the original expert report had been stolen or changed. A separate criminal investigation was carried out, during which several officers from the prosecutor's office and the Ministry of the Interior were questioned. The investigation collected the copies of the original documents from the Russian Federal Bureau of Forensic Studies. Magomed Ye. was questioned as a suspect. On 15 May 2002 the investigation against him was closed for want of incriminating evidence."", ""73. On 7 October 1999 the investigator from the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office questioned Magomed Ye. The latter confirmed that he had headed the group at the Malgobek prosecutor's office which had investigated the kidnapping of Magomed K. He had authorised Suleyman Tsechoyev's detention in relation to that crime. According to him, Mr Tsechoyev had been suspected of involvement in other crimes committed in the region, which was the reason for his transfer to Nalchik and Pyatigorsk. Mr Ye. denied that he had been involved in the kidnapping and murder of Suleyman Tsechoyev. He stated that he had never seen the documents authorising the latter's removal from the pre-trial detention centre in Nalchik in August 1999. Mr Ye. stated that he had quit his job at the prosecutor's office in March 1999 and now lived in Moscow. He had learnt of Suleyman Tsechoyev's death from his father in September 1999. He denied that he had previously allowed the relatives of Magomed K. access to Suleyman Tsechoyev."", '74. In October 1999 the investigators carried out a series of identification parades, during which the officers of the Nalchik pretrial detention centre failed to identify Mr Magomed Ye., his brothers and cousins as the persons who had taken away Suleyman Tsechoyev.', ""75. On 11 January 2000 the Kabardino-Balkaria prosecutor's office brought charges against Mr Magomed Ye. He was charged in absentia with complicity in Suleyman Tsechoyev's kidnapping and murder and forgery of official documents. On the same day Mr Magomed Ye. was ordered to be arrested and declared a fugitive from justice, and his name was put on the wanted list."", '76. On 26 February 2000 Mr Ye. was detained and questioned as a suspect. He again denied any connection with the murder and requested a number of additional investigative measures.', ""77. The investigators obtained the documents according to which in March 1999 Mr Magomed Ye. had complained to his superior about the false accusations brought against him by the relatives of Suleyman Tsechoyev and requested the district prosecutor of Malgobek to open a criminal investigation for libel. At the same time, pending completion of the investigation, he requested to be relieved from the duty of investigating the case. On 31 March 1999 Magomed Ye. resigned from the prosecutor's office."", ""78. On 10 March 2000 the Nalchik Town Court released Mr Magomed Ye. from detention, having found that there were no reasons to suspect him of absconding from justice. The court noted that Mr Ye. had always appeared at the prosecutor's office when summoned to do so, resided at his declared place of residence in Moscow and had other family reasons not to abscond."", '79. In April 2000 a waitress in a roadside café in KabardinoBalkaria told the investigators that between 21 and 25 August 1999 she had seen Mr Magomed Ye. During a confrontation carried out on 24 January 2002 she retracted her statements and explained that she had last seen him in March 1999, and that in August 1999 she had seen another person whom she had confused with Mr Ye. She gave detailed submissions in this respect. Two other men and Magomed Ye. gave concordant statements.', '80. In July 2001 the investigators questioned witnesses and obtained documents to the effect that in August 1999 Mr Ye. had been working daily for a private company in Moscow.', '81. In April 2002 Magomed Ye. gave an additional statement as a suspect. He again denied any involvement in the imputed crime, denied having ever received or used a VAZ vehicle and denied receiving any money or property from the K. family.', '82. In their memorandum of 2 October 2008 the Government stated, without providing copies of such documents or the dates when they were obtained, that the investigators also questioned four members of the K. family who denied having any relations with Magomed Ye. or giving him money or property. These and other witnesses suggested that the libel campaign against Magomed Ye. had been inspired by members of a fundamentalist bandit group based in Urus-Martan, Chechnya, who had committed numerous kidnappings for ransom. The Kabardino-Balkaria Land Registry reported that Magomed Ye. had owned no real estate in that region.', ""83. In their memorandum of 2 October 2008 the Government also stated, without providing copies of such documents or the dates when they were obtained, that the investigators had also questioned the brother and cousin of Magomed Ye.: police officers named by the applicant as possible perpetrators of the crime. They denied their involvement in the events. The police department of Malgobek confirmed that Magomed Ye.'s cousin had been working daily between July and September 1999. Police officers Musa Kh. and Zaurbek Kh. were also questioned at some point and denied having any connection with the murder. The Government also referred to records of interviews of four members of the K. family who stated that they had no relations with Magomed Ye. outside the official framework of the investigation and that they had not given him money or property."", ""84. As can be seen from the statements collected in January 2008 from the applicant and his father, some time in 2001 police officer Musa Kh. had been charged with false imprisonment and abuse of power in relation to the taking of Suleyman Tsechoyev from the Malgobek IVS in the late hours on 24 February 1999. He had been found guilty and given a suspended sentence; the applicant did not appeal against the sentence. It also appears from these statements that the applicant and Musa Kh. had reached an informal agreement prior to the trial and that the applicant had “accepted” Musa Kh.'s “apology” and declaration that he had not been involved in his brother's murder. No other documents or information relating to this process have been submitted by the parties."", ""85. It can be seen from the submitted documents that in 2001 Musa K., the brother of the kidnapped Magomed K., complained to the prosecutor's office that he had been libelled by the applicant. It appears that in June 2001 the indictment was sent to the court, which at some point acquitted the applicant."", '86. The investigators into the kidnapping of Magomed K. suspected and arrested several other men in addition to Suleyman Tsechoyev. Later, three of them were charged with other kidnappings; one of them was found guilty and sentenced in 2001; and two others were charged in absentia and their names put on the wanted list. One of them told the investigators that the applicant had threatened to denounce him to the law-enforcement bodies in order to give incriminating evidence against Magomed Ye. and Musa K.', '87. On 26 February 2002 the criminal investigation was closed regarding the part concerning the actions of the officers of the Nalchik pretrial detention centre, on grounds of absence of corpus delicti.', ""88. On the same day the investigator from the department of the General Prosecutor's Office in the North Caucasus closed the criminal proceedings against Magomed Ye. for want of evidence. He noted that it had turned out to be impossible to identify the persons who had abducted and killed Suleyman Tsechoyev; that the conclusions of the graphology expert reports were contradictory and could not be construed as a single body of incriminating evidence against Mr Magomed Ye.; that by the time of the abduction he had no longer been employed at the prosecutor's office for more than six months and there was no evidence that he had continued to be aware of or to influence the proceedings; that between March and September 1999 he had remained in Moscow, as confirmed by witness statements and documents; that the allegations that he had obtained money or property from the K. family had proved to be unfounded; and, finally, that there were reasons to suspect that the applicant had personal motives, since he was being prosecuted for libel against the K. family and had threatened a witness in order to obtain evidence incriminating Magomed Ye."", ""89. On 22 May 2001 the Prosecutor General's Office informed the applicant that on 11 April 2001 the investigation in criminal case no. 16/2499 had been transferred to the department of the Prosecutor General's office in the North Caucasus. According to the letter, Mr Ye. had absconded from the authorities and his name had been put on the wanted list."", '90. On 7 January 2002 the applicant and his relatives complained of the ineffectiveness of the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99 to the Prosecutor General. In his letter the applicant also alleged that some of the evidence in the criminal case-file materials had been forged by the investigators.', ""91. On 22 February 2002 the Prosecutor General's Office replied to the applicant. The letter stated that in connection with the forgery of the evidence in criminal case no. 16/24-99, they had opened criminal case no. 18/24411-01 on 14 September 2001."", ""92. On 15 or 24 May 2002 (the letter has two dates) the department of the Prosecutor General's Office in the North Caucasus informed the applicant that on 15 May 2002 the authorities had terminated the criminal proceedings against Mr Ye. owing to the failure to prove his involvement in the abduction of Suleyman Tsechoyev. On the same date the investigation had been suspended owing to the failure to identify the perpetrators."", '93. On 20 June 2002 the applicant and his relatives wrote to the Prosecutor General complaining of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation into the murder.', ""94. On 9 August 2002 the applicant's family received a letter from the Prosecutor General's Office. The letter stated that on an unspecified date the investigation of criminal case no. 16/24-99 had been resumed."", ""95. On 28 February 2003 the applicant complained about his brother's murder to the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. In his letter he complained of the ineffectiveness of the investigation into the crime and the decisions suspending it. The applicant requested the authorities to resume the investigation and carry out an additional examination of the evidence in criminal case no. 16/24-99. In particular, he complained that the investigation had failed to compile a composite sketch of the two men who had collected his brother from the pre-trial detention centre and to compare the handwriting of the kidnappers with those of all the officers of the Ministry of the Interior in Ingushetia and KabardinoBalkaria, as well as of the regional department of the RUBOP in the Northern Caucasus."", ""96. On 5 March 2003 the Prosecutor General's Office, upon the applicant's request, forwarded him a copy of the decision of 4 September 2002 suspending the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99."", '97. It does not appear that the applicant or the investigators took any steps between 5 March 2003 and 20 May 2005.', ""98. On 20 May 2005 the applicant's representatives wrote to the Prosecutor General. They requested information concerning the progress reached in the investigation in criminal case no. 16/24-99 and enquired whether the investigators had carried out any expert or forensic examinations in the case. It does not appear that the applicant's representatives received any response to this request."", '99. On 21 August 2007 the Deputy Prosecutor General quashed the decision suspending the proceedings. On 25 December 2007 Mr Magomed Ye. was placed under an obligation not to leave his place of residence in Moscow.', '100. In January 2008 the investigator questioned the applicant, his sister and his mother in Malgobek. They denied that Suleyman Tsechoyev had any connections to illegal armed groups in Chechnya or in Ingushetia, pointed out that he had never been charged with any such crime before and affirmed that there was no evidence to support that allegation. They again insisted that Magomed Ye. had been connected with the abduction and murder of their brother, in view of his involvement in the arrest and beatings.', '101. On 21 May 2008 the father of Musa and Magomed K. gave a statement in which he denied that his family had ever given any money or valuables to Magomed Ye. or his family.', '102. In his submissions the applicant also described attacks by unspecified persons on himself, his relative and his house.', ""103. Accordingly, the applicant submitted that on 13 July 2001 he and Mrs U. had been wounded during an attempt to arrest them by officers from the RUBOP of Kabardino-Balkaria. On the same day the Ingushetia prosecutor's office opened a criminal investigation into violent acts against public officers."", '104. However, in January 2002 the investigation was adjourned in view of the failure to identify the suspect. In March 2004 criminal charges against the applicant were dropped; Mrs U. was granted victim status.', '105. The applicant and Mrs U. sought damages for the injuries and moral suffering inflicted by the RUBOP and the Federal Treasury. They also contested the lawfulness of the order to deliver the applicant to an investigator which had served as the basis for the attempt to arrest him.', ""106. In October 2004 the Malgobek Town Court refused to grant their claim, referring to the absence of any definitive outcome of the criminal investigation and the applicant's failure to appeal against the decision to adjourn the proceedings. An appeal by the applicant was dismissed without consideration for failure to observe the requisite time-limits; he tried to have the time-limits restored but it appears that his complaint to the Supreme Court of Ingushetia remained unexamined."", ""107. No complaints were brought following those developments, but the applicant relied on the above proceedings to explain his inaction between 2003 and 2005 vis-à-vis the domestic criminal investigation into his brother's murder."", '108. The applicant submitted, referring to numerous publications concerning the subject, that following the events described above Mr Magomed Ye. had become a well-known political figure in Ingushetia. As a successful businessman and journalist, he had founded an Internet site (www.Ingushetiya.ru) in 2001 which had quickly become an important media forum for the opposition forces. In 2008 Mr Magomed Ye. had become one of the organisers of the “I did not vote” campaign aimed at denouncing electoral fraud in Ingushetia during the Russian presidential elections. In June 2008 a district court in Moscow classified the site as “extremist” and demanded its closure. The order could not be implemented because the site was hosted in the United States.', '109. On 31 August 2008 Mr Magomed Ye. was detained on arrival at the airport in Nazran, Ingushetia, and shot dead in the police car. In December 2009 a court in Ingushetia found one officer of the Ministry of the Interior of Ingushetia guilty of causing death by negligence and gave him a suspended sentence. In August 2010 this officer was killed by unknown gunmen in Ingushetia. On 25 October 2009 another former coowner of the Ingushetia.ru site, Mr Maksharip A., was killed by unknown gunmen in Kabardino-Balkaria.']",['2'],[],[],['2'],[],[],1

The first applicant, born in 1981, is the widower of the late Ms Fatsima Aleksandrovich, a Belarus national of Roma ethnicity, who was born in 1979 and died in 2002. The second applicant is her son, born in 2000. The applicants are Russian nationals living in the Pskov Region.', '6. The applicants provided the following account of the circumstances surrounding Ms Aleksandrovich’s arrest and death which was not disputed by the Government.', '7. At 8.30 a.m. on 20 May 2002 Ms Aleksandrovich was travelling on a bus in Pskov with the first applicant’s sister, Ms Vera Kleyn. Ms P., a police officer who worked for the passport service of the Pskov police department, was travelling on the same bus when she realised that her purse was missing. She told her colleague, police officer Mr M., that her purse was gone. Mr M. searched the bus and found the purse under a seat. Ms Aleksandrovich being of Roma ethnicity, Mr M. assumed that she had stolen the purse and arrested her. She asked why, but Mr M. hit her on the head and said, “Only a Gypsy could steal the purse, who else?” Ms Vera Kleyn was not arrested.', '8. Ms Aleksandrovich was taken to the Pskov regional police station. The acting head of the station asked the senior operational officer of the property offences investigations division Mr I. to interview her. When asked about her identity, Ms Aleksandrovich claimed to be one Ilona Kozlovskaya, born in 1990. According to Mr I., she was nervous, complained of stomach pain and often asked for permission to use the toilet. Several times he had to take her to the toilet located on the second floor (in Russian called “third floor”) of the police station, where female police officers Ms M. or Ms F. stayed with her. The last visit was just before 11.30 a.m. Since there were no female officers to accompany Ms Aleksandrovich, Mr I. let her go inside alone and waited by the door of the toilet.', '9. The door of the toilet was not locked. A witness, Ms Sh., who was in the toilet, saw Ms Aleksandrovich and stated that she was moaning with pain and holding her stomach. Ms Sh. left the toilet shortly after this.', '10. At 11.30 a.m. on 20 May 2002 an officer on duty found Ms Aleksandrovich unconscious on the ground in the yard of the Pskov regional police station. It appeared that she had jumped out of the toilet window. An ambulance took her to the Pskov regional hospital, where she died on 24 May 2002 without regaining consciousness.', '11. Between 11.31 and 11.45 a.m. on 20 May 2002 the investigator from the Pskov regional police station compiled a report on an examination of the crime scene, which was carried out in the presence of two attesting witnesses (понятые). Photographs were taken of Ms Aleksandrovich’s body, the building, the yard, and the toilet door and window.', '12. On 24 May 2002 the senior investigator with the Pskov prosecutor’s office ordered an inquest into the circumstances of Ms Aleksandrovich’s death and an autopsy on her body.', '13. The medical report was completed on 10 June 2002. It concluded that she had died as a result of a cerebral trauma and numerous bodily injuries. The expert found: haemorrhages of the soft tissue of the head with cerebral trauma; fracture of the left side of 12th neck vertebra; fracture of the side growths of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th vertebrae; internal tear of the right kidney; extensive haemorrhages of the soft tissue of the left side of the vertebrae; swelling of the left eyelid; swelling of the right forearm; bruises on the extremities. These injuries had been caused by the impact of blunt objects and could have been the result of striking such objects following a fall from the third floor.', '14. On 24 June 2002 the senior investigator issued a decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings into Ms Aleksandrovich’s death. He had collected statements from police officers Mr M., Ms P., Mr I., Ms F. and Ms M. and the witness Ms Sh., and found as follows:', '“As at the moment of Ms Aleksandrovich’s fall out of the window of the toilet situated on the third floor of the Pskov regional police department, there was no one in the toilet but the deceased, the possibility is excluded of actual physical action by anyone wishing to take her life. The actions by Mr M. and Mr I. preceding Ms Aleksandrovich’s death had been taken as part of their official duties ... Thus, Mr M. acted in keeping with the requirements of the Police Act, which required him to take measures to prevent and to stop administrative offences or crimes. In the circumstances the measures were taken on the basis of the statement by Ms P., who identified Ms Aleksandrovich as the person who had attempted to steal her purse. Mr I. ... took measures to establish Ms Aleksandrovich’s identity. The period between the time of arrest and the time of her fall was no more than the three-hour limit set out in the Administrative Offences Code. During the interview Mr I. did not put any pressure on Ms Aleksandrovich. He had not known her before and he took measures to give assistance to Ms Aleksandrovich, who was unwell, as well as to prevent her from behaving inappropriately.”', '15. Some eighteen months later, on 26 December 2003, Ms Tseytlina, acting as counsel for the first applicant, lodged an appeal with the Pskov Town Court against the decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings.', '16. On 19 January 2004 the Pskov Town Court allowed the complaint. It found that the inquest had been incomplete, that Ms Aleksandrovich’s identity had not been conclusively established, that the collected samples and histological studies had not been examined, and that the causation of the multiple injuries had not been explained.', '17. On 9 February 2004 the Pskov town prosecutor revoked the decision of 24 June 2002 and asked the investigator Mr Ts. to carry out a further inquiry.', '18. On 13 February 2004 Mr Ts. issued two decisions. One decision refused to institute criminal proceedings in connection with Ms Aleksandrovich’s death; the other decision commissioned a new medical study into the reasons for the bodily injuries and death of Ms Aleksandrovich. Further to the applicants’ complaint, the Pskov town prosecutor set aside the decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings as taken prematurely in the absence of the findings of the medical examination.', '19. On 12 March 2004 the medical expert produced his report. It stated that all the injuries had been caused within a short period of time a few days before the death, possibly on 20 May 2002. The injuries could have resulted from a fall from a height of 9.6 m because of their condensed localisation and great magnitude. No signs of a multi-phased fall or contact with any other objects could be detected.', '20. On the same day Mr Ts. issued a new decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings in connection with Ms Aleksandrovich’s death. He noted in particular that the first applicant had been invited to make a statement but had never appeared.', '21. On 26 October 2004 counsel for the first applicant lodged an appeal against the investigator’s decision with the Pskov Town Court.', '22. On 6 June 2005 the Pskov Town Court dismissed the appeal as unsubstantiated. It found that there was no evidence, medical or otherwise, to support the theory that the injuries had been caused by ill-treatment rather than by a fall from the window.', '23. Following an appeal by the first applicant, on 13 July 2005 the Pskov Regional Court quashed the Town Court’s decision. It noted that, under Russian law, experts and witnesses may only be held criminally liable for perjury if they have been examined as part of a criminal case. As criminal proceedings were never instituted, the first applicant’s access to justice was barred. It also noted that police officers are responsible for the life and health of those individuals who, like Ms Aleksandrovich, have been taken to a police station under constraint. The Regional Court remitted the matter for a new examination by a different bench of the Town Court.', '24. On 29 July 2005 the Pskov Town Court, during a new examination, found the investigator’s decision unlawful, for the following reasons:', '“Establishment of the circumstances and cause of Ms Aleksandrovich’s death, as well as the mechanism of causation of injuries on her body, is only possible by means of investigative actions and expert examinations carried out as part of a pending criminal case.', 'In addition, the official who refused to institute criminal proceedings did not give a legal opinion on the actions of police officers, who have a duty to supervise individuals who have been forcibly taken to the police station, with a view, in particular, to preventing self-harm.”', '25. The Town Court instructed the prosecutor to carry out a further inquiry. The prosecutor lodged an appeal against the decision but subsequently withdrew it.', '26. On 12 January 2006 the Pskov town prosecutor revoked the decision of 12 March 2004 and ordered an additional inquiry.', '27. On 16 January 2006 the investigator Mr Ts. issued a further decision refusing to institute criminal proceedings. That decision summarised the existing evidence and reached the conclusion that:', '“...During the last visit to the toilet [Mr I.] could not find – for objective reasons – any female police officers who would be free from their duties, and Ms Aleksandrovich was in the toilet alone. It follows that the fall from the window situated on the second floor of the Pskov regional police station was the result of a deliberate action on the part of Ms Aleksandrovich.”', '28. A criminal case may be instituted on the basis of, in particular, a complaint or report by a citizen (Article 108 (1)) or the finding of indications of a criminal offence by an investigator or prosecutor (Article 108 (6)).', '29. A prosecutor, investigator, police officer or a judge ought to receive reports about any committed or planned crime and act on them within three days of receipt or, in exceptional cases, ten days. They may obtain necessary materials or explanations but not carry out any investigative acts. They should take the decision to open a criminal case, to refuse to institute criminal proceedings, or to refer the case to the competent authority and notify the complainant thereof (Article 109).', '30. A prosecutor, investigator, police officer or judge should institute a criminal case if there is a motive and grounds for opening criminal proceedings (Article 112).', '31. The victim (потерпевший) shall have the right to take part in criminal prosecution of the defendant (Article 22). The decision to recognise the procedural status of a victim may be taken by an investigator or a judge (Article 42 § 1).', '32. The victim has in particular the following rights: to submit statements and evidence, to take part in investigative acts which are carried out at his request, to read the findings of a forensic study, to obtain copies of decisions concerning the institution of criminal proceedings and their discontinuation or adjournment, and to participate in the trial and appeal proceedings (Article 42 § 2 (2, 4, 9, 11, 13 and 14)).']",['2'],['2-1'],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Espoo. He is an attorney.', '5. The applicant was suspected of aiding and abetting aggravated embezzlement. He was first questioned by the police on 28 September 1998. He was subsequently questioned again in connection with two other similar offences.', '6. On 14 December 2000 the public prosecutor brought charges against him and another defendant, R, in the Helsinki District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten). The court held its first session on 29 November 2001. In the course of the proceedings, the court was presented with written evidence, including 94 documents submitted by the applicant. It also received testimony from both defendants and twelve witnesses, four of whom were called by the applicant. The evidence included a written statement and the oral testimony of the Bankruptcy Ombudsman. On 10 May 2002 the court gave its judgment. It found that on 30 September 1994 the applicant had, as a receiver of a bankrupt’s estate, unlawfully transferred a substantial sum of money from the estate’s bank account to the account of his own law firm. The court also found that, on the same date, he had aided and abetted his associate R in the commission of two similar offences. The court convicted the applicant of aggravated embezzlement and two counts of aiding and abetting aggravated embezzlement and sentenced him to a suspended term of one year and four months’ imprisonment. R was found guilty of having made unlawful money transfers on several separate occasions between 29 April 1993 and 31 May 1996. He was convicted of two counts of aggravated embezzlement, as well as aiding and abetting the applicant’s aggravated embezzlement.', '7. The applicant, R, and the prosecutor all appealed against the judgment to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten). At the applicant’s request, the court had extended by some five weeks the time-limit for lodging his appeal. In his letter of appeal, lodged on 16 July 2002, the applicant claimed that he had only transferred funds to which he believed he was entitled as a retainer and that he had, therefore, lacked criminal intent. He made similar claims in connection with the two counts of aiding and abetting R’s offences. He also referred, inter alia, to the written statement of the Bankruptcy Ombudsman, in which the latter had considered it possible that the applicant had, in fact, lacked criminal intent in regard to the alleged embezzlement. On 15 and 17 November 2004 the Court of Appeal held an oral hearing. By its judgment of 13 January 2005 it upheld the applicant’s conviction but changed his sentence to one year and ten months’ unconditional imprisonment. In its reasons the court had regard, inter alia, to the Bankruptcy Ombudsman’s testimony. The Ombudsman had noted, inter alia, that at the time of drawing up his written statement he had not had all the information about the applicant’s actions in the matter or, at least, had not paid attention to it. He had also testified that the receiver of a bankrupt’s estate did not have a right to withdraw money from the estate’s account without consent.', '8. On 4 May 2005 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal.', '9. Chapter 6, section 7, subsection 3 of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen; as amended by Act No. 515/2003 which took effect on 1 January 2004) reads:', '“In addition to what is provided above in section 6, grounds for mitigating the sentence that are also to be taken into consideration are', '...', '(3) a considerably long period that has passed since the commission of the offence;', 'if the punishment that accords with established practice would for these reasons lead to an unreasonable or exceptionally detrimental result.”', '10. In its judgment of 11 June 2004 (KKO 2004:58), the Supreme Court noted that, although there were no legal provisions justifying the dismissal of a criminal charge due to unreasonably long proceedings, such a dismissal or declaring a case inadmissible might in some exceptional circumstances, for example if their duration ruled out a good defence, be the only effective remedy satisfying the requirements of Article 13 of the Convention. That was, however, not the case here. In considering whether there were grounds for applying Chapter 6, section 7, subsection 3 of the Penal Code, the Supreme Court held that it had to be decided in casu whether the duration of the proceedings (here over 5.5 years) had been unreasonable. It concluded that in this case there were no grounds not to impose a sentence or to mitigate the sentence owing to the duration of the proceedings.']",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Norway.', '10. By an indictment of 23 June 1993, the applicant and his father were charged under Articles 195 § 1 (sexual relations with a minor) and 207 (sexual relations with a close relative) of the Criminal Code (straffeloven) with having committed sexual offences during the periods from 1985 to 1989 and 1988 to 1991 respectively against the applicant’s daughter, L., who was born on 18 October 1981.', '11. By a judgment of 1 June 1994, the Eidsivating High Court (lagmannsrett), sitting with three judges and a jury, noted that the jury had answered the questions on the charges in the negative and therefore acquitted the applicant and his father. No appeal was lodged against the judgment, which consequently gained legal force.', '12. Subsequently, on 29 August 1994, the applicant and his father filed a petition with the High Court requesting compensation under Articles 444 and 446 of the 1981 Code of Criminal Procedure (straffeprosessloven) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the criminal proceedings against them. The father sought, in the alternative, compensation under Articles 445 and 446.', '13. In the compensation proceedings, the High Court, sitting with the same judges as in the trial, received written pleadings but did not hold an oral hearing. By a decision (kjennelse) of 25 January 1995, it rejected the applicant’s claim but awarded his father 30,000 Norwegian kroner in compensation under Articles 444 and 446.', 'In the introduction to its decision, the High Court reiterated certain information derived from the criminal proceedings, notably the specific contents of the charges of sexual abuse, the jury’s verdict and the acquittal by the High Court.', 'As regards the applicant’s claim, the High Court stated, inter alia:', '“The High Court notes that, pursuant to Articles 444 or 446 ... of the Code of Criminal Procedure, it is a condition for obtaining compensation that it must be shown to be probable that the accused did not carry out the act which formed the basis of the charge. Accordingly, in order to award compensation it must be shown on the balance of probabilities that the accused did not commit the acts in respect of which he has been acquitted.', 'The High Court finds it probable that the victim [L.], born on 18 October 1981, has been subjected to sexual abuse in the form of sexual intercourse. Reference is made to the medical examination carried out ... on 21 November 1991 ...', '[L.’s] father and mother separated in 1989 when the mother moved to Oslo together with [L.] ... As a witness, the mother made statements about [L.’s behaviour] before as well as after the separation. This could indicate that she has been subjected to sexual abuse. The child’s behaviour resulted in the mother contacting the ... institute in the summer of 1991 where [L.] underwent individual and family therapy, as did her mother and her cohabitant.', 'As a witness during the trial, Ms Anne Okstad, a psychologist, ... explained [L.’s] behaviour. In the light of this and of talks and symbolic games with [L.], Ms Okstad concluded that there was no doubt that [L.] had been subjected to sexual abuse.', 'The question is therefore now whether on the balance of probabilities other persons than the defendants are behind the abuses. In this respect the judicial examinations of [L.] are of central importance and the witness evidence as to what [L.] has stated is significant. From the outset there had been no concrete information in this case about other offenders. [L.] has been subjected to judicial examinations three times ... In connection with the first examination the judge recorded that no information had been submitted which could justify a concrete suspicion of sexual abuse having been committed against [L.]. During the second examination [the applicant] was mentioned in connection with a description of immoral sexual relations and during the third examination even the grandfather was mentioned. During the examinations the information was submitted, without spontaneity, in part under pressure from the examining judge, and in part through writing down names and events on pieces of paper.', 'According to the mother’s and her partner’s statements, [L.] had referred to both [the applicant] and the grandfather. It appeared as if the child had been under pressure to speak in order to enable the family to calm down. Ms Okstad stated that [L.], in the course of a realistic conversation, had referred to ‘intrusions, pawing, threats and aggression by [the applicant]’ and that she had spontaneously confirmed that abuse had taken place several times. She also appeared to have been agitated both during and after these conversations.', 'Considering the case as a whole, the High Court does not find it shown on the balance of probabilities that [the applicant] did not engage in sexual intercourse with his daughter. ...', '[The applicant’s] claim for compensation is thus dismissed. In the light of this conclusion, there is no reason to order the reimbursement of his costs.”', '14. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett). On 20 April 1995 the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court (Høyesteretts kjæremålsutvalg) upheld the High Court’s decision, stating, inter alia:', '“The High Court has correctly taken as its starting-point the view that under Articles 444 and 446 ... of the Code of Criminal Procedure it is a condition that it must be shown to be probable that the accused did not carry out the act which formed the basis for the charge against him and that this implies that on the balance of probabilities [sannsynlighetsovervekt] the accused did not commit the acts in respect of which he was acquitted. In this connection the Committee refers to [its decision reported in] Norsk Retstidende 1994, p. 721, where the first voting judge stated, with the approval of the other judges, inter alia:', '’Compensation pursuant to Article 444, first sentence, must – when the accused is acquitted or the case against him is discontinued – cover the financial losses he has suffered if “it has been shown to be probable [gjort sannsynlig]” that he has not carried out the act which formed the basis for the charges. It is the accused who carries the burden of proof that he did not carry out the act. It is sufficient that it is more probable than not. I do not agree with counsel for the defence in that the accused has discharged the burden of proof where both alternatives, on the basis of the available evidence, appear to be equally likely. In this assessment the ordinary standards of evidence must apply and the requirements in respect of the strength of the evidence must then to some extent be adapted to the ability of the accused to show that he did not carry out the act. Given the manner in which the provision has been formulated, the situation may easily arise that an acquittal is not sufficient to justify a compensation claim where the accused is unable to discharge the burden of proof. I should like to stress that the refusal of a compensation claim does not imply that the previous acquittal is undermined or that the acquittal is open to doubt. The compensation claim must be determined on an independent basis and the rules of evidence applying in such compensation cases do not differ from those which apply to ordinary compensation claims. The legislator has as a starting-point opted for a solution whereby the financial burden caused by the institution of criminal proceedings which are discontinued or which end with an acquittal must be borne by the accused unless he is able to show that it is probable that he did not commit the act.’', 'The High Court has found it probable that [the applicant’s] daughter was subjected to sexual abuse ... Considering the case as a whole, the High Court has further concluded that it has not been shown that on the balance of probabilities [the applicant] did not engage in sexual intercourse with his daughter. The Appeals Leave Committee finds no reason to depart from the High Court’s assessment of the evidence, which is based on the judges’ participation at the trial hearing in this case, where it must be deemed vital that the court had the opportunity to hear directly the accused and the witnesses – something which the Committee is not empowered to do ...', 'The Appeals Leave Committee accordingly finds that the evidence is not such as to fulfil the conditions for compensation under Article 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; nor, as a consequence, are the conditions for awarding damages under Article 446 satisfied.”', '15. Under the Norwegian jury system, when an accused is acquitted the jury is not entitled to disclose whether any of its members held a different opinion, and no records are kept which could disclose that a negative answer as to the applicant’s guilt was not unanimous. Only two conclusions are possible in a criminal case – guilt or acquittal (see Articles 365, 366, 372 and 373 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). There is no third alternative, such as that formerly known in some other European countries, where a criminal charge could result in the finding that there was not sufficient evidence to establish guilt.', '16. Articles 444 to 446 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide for compensation where a person has been acquitted or the proceedings have been discontinued. The provisions read as follows:', '“If a person charged is acquitted or the proceedings against him are discontinued, he may claim compensation from the State for any damage that he has sustained as a result of the prosecution if it is shown to be probable that he did not carry out the act that formed the basis for the charge. If a sentence of imprisonment or other custodial sanction has already been served, any damage resulting from this shall be compensated without regard to what has been shown to be probable.', 'Compensation shall not be awarded where the person charged, by making a confession or otherwise, has wilfully instigated the prosecution or the conviction.', 'If he has otherwise contributed to the damage by negligence, the compensation may be reduced or dispensed with entirely.”', '“Even if the conditions prescribed in Article 444 are not fulfilled, the court may award the person charged compensation for special or disproportionate damage as a consequence of the criminal proceedings whenever this appears to be reasonable in the circumstances.”', '“If the conditions relating to compensation prescribed in Articles 444 or 445 are fulfilled, the court may, when special reasons so indicate, award the person charged a suitable amount as redress for the indignity or other damage of a noneconomic nature that he has suffered as a result of the prosecution.”', '17. In addition, there are certain formal conditions set out in Article 447 for the submission and examination of a compensation claim made under Articles 444 to 446:', '“Any claim for compensation or redress must be submitted not later than three months after the person charged has been informed of the decision that finally settles the case. The provisions of Article 318, first paragraph, shall apply correspondingly.', 'If the case has been concluded without any judicial examination of the evidence relating to the issue of guilt, the claim shall be submitted to a court of summary jurisdiction.', 'Otherwise the claim shall be submitted to the court that is to conduct or has last conducted any such trial. If the claim is submitted to the district court or the city court, but has not been decided when an appeal against the assessment of evidence in relation to the issue of guilt proceeds to an appeal hearing, the court of appeal shall also decide the question of compensation. When examining the claim, the court shall as far as possible sit with the same judges who decided the criminal case. In the court of appeal, lay judges or the selected jurors who join the court pursuant to Article 376 (e) shall not take part unless the decision is made at the same court sitting as that at which judgment is given in the case.”', '18. Compensation after acquittal or discontinuation of the proceedings is not automatic and is not awarded unless the conditions in the above-cited Articles are met.', '19. When compensation is awarded to persons who are considered innocent as they have been acquitted or the proceedings against them have been discontinued, Articles 445 and 446 are the general provisions and, de facto, the main provisions providing for compensation.', '20. In the present case the applicant, unlike his father, did not seek compensation under Articles 445 and 446. Instead, the applicant claimed compensation under the special provision in Article 444, together with Article 446. Under this provision, the State may be liable to pay compensation even in the absence of any proof of negligence or fault on the part of the authorities. The liability of the State to pay compensation is strict where it has been shown to be probable that the claimant did not carry out the act with which he or she was charged. In the assessment of that probability, none of the other constitutive elements of a criminal offence, such as criminal intent, is in issue.', '21. According to the case-law of the Norwegian Supreme Court, the evidentiary standard applying in respect of liability to pay compensation under Article 444 differs from that applying to criminal liability. Whereas in criminal proceedings it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the impugned act, in compensation proceedings it is for the claimant to show that, on the balance of probabilities, it was more than 50% probable that he or she did not carry out the act that formed the basis of the charge. The requirement of proof in compensation cases may nevertheless be adjusted (i.e. to less than 50%) in the light of the claimant’s ability to adduce evidence, especially where a long time has elapsed since the alleged criminal act. The competent court has to make a new assessment, independently of the acquittal, of all the evidence available in order to establish whether it is probable that the claimant did not carry out the act which formed the basis of the charge.', '22. It is not a requirement for obtaining compensation that the claimant should adduce new evidence. The compensation claim may thus be made with reference to the evidence made available in the criminal proceedings or obtained by the court of its own motion.', '23. In 1996 the Norwegian Council on Criminal Law (Straffelovrådet) made a recommendation to the Ministry of Justice that Articles 444 to 446 of the Code of Criminal Procedure be amended in a number of respects, including the abolition of the condition whereby the claimant had to prove that on the balance of probabilities he or she had not carried out the act giving rise to the charge. Nevertheless, the Council was of the view that the provisions in force were not inconsistent with Norway’s obligations under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, as interpreted by the Court in its case-law (see Norges Offentlige Utredninger (Norwegian Official Reports), “Erstatning i anledning straffeforfølgning” (“Compensation in connection with criminal proceedings”), 1996:18, pp. 20-22, 36, 52). On 15 May 2002 a government bill was presented to Parliament (Ot.prp.nr.77, 2001-2002), proposing, inter alia, the repeal of that condition.']",['6'],['6-2'],[],[],[],[],1

On 2 September 1993 security forces from the Şırnak central gendarmerie command apprehended the applicants. An arrest protocol of the same day stated that the applicants had been arrested on the grounds that they were wanted for the offences of aiding and sheltering members of the PKK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan) terrorist organisation and acting as couriers in the organisation as well as supplying logistic support to the organisation. The applicants were then placed in custody.', '9. On 22 September 1993 two officers interrogated the applicants at the Şırnak central gendarmerie command. During their interrogation the applicants both confessed that they had been involved in the PKK since 1988 and that they had supplied food and money to PKK militants. The applicant Abdülaziz Ecer stated that he had placed his son, Mustafa Ecer, at the disposal of the PKK rather than paying them a levy. The applicant Mehmet Zeyrek told the officers that he had been carrying provisions on mules to PKK militants and that he had last carried a battery for them in August 1993.', '10. The applicants were then confronted with a witness, İkram Yamaner, who had been arrested on charges of aiding and sheltering members of the PKK between April 1990 and July 1992. İkram Yamaner identified the applicants and stated that they had been supplying food and clothes to members of the PKK when he was in the organisation.', '11. On 23 September 1993 the Şırnak public prosecutor questioned the applicants in relation to their activities in the PKK. He first informed the applicants of the nature and cause of the accusations against them and then read out the statements they had made to the officers during their detention in custody. The applicants denied the accuracy of the statements read out by the public prosecutor. They alleged that they had no connection with the PKK and that they had never supplied provisions to members of the organisation. Abdülaziz Ecer asserted that his son, Mustafa Ecer, had been abducted by the PKK and had been forced to join the organisation, contrary to what was written down by the gendarme officers during his questioning at the Şırnak gendarmerie command.', 'On the same day, 23 September 1993, the applicants were brought before the Şırnak Magistrates’ Court (sulh ceza mahkemesi). Before the court the applicants denied their involvement in the PKK and claimed that they were innocent of the charges. The court ordered the applicants’ detention on remand.', '12. On 24 September 1993 the Şırnak public prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the investigation file to the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Diyarbakır National Security Court.', '13. On 19 October 1993 the Principal Public Prosecutor filed an indictment with the Diyarbakır National Security Court accusing the applicants of having assisted and given shelter to members of the PKK between 1988 and 1989. The public prosecutor alleged that the applicants had supplied food to members of the armed gang in a rural area. He further asserted that the applicant Abdülaziz Ecer had stored food in his shop for members of the gang and that he had helped and sheltered them by means of his contacts with his son, currently an active militant in the gang. The public prosecutor relied on the applicants’ confessions at the Şırnak central gendarmerie command and the evidence given by the witness İkram Yamaner, as well as the documents contained in the investigation file.', 'The public prosecutor requested that the applicants be punished in accordance with Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code and section 5 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713 of 12 April 1991, “the 1991 Act”; see paragraph 19 below).', '14. In the proceedings before the Diyarbakır National Security Court the applicants denied the statements they had made during their detention in custody. They both alleged that the gendarme officers had prepared those statements and that they had signed without reading them.', 'The applicants further maintained that they did not know of İkram Yamaner, with whom they had allegedly been confronted, since they had been kept blindfolded during their questioning while in custody. They asked the court to rule that they were innocent of the charges.', '15. On 12 May 1994 the Diyarbakır National Security Court convicted the applicants on account of their assistance to the PKK in 1988 and 1989, sentenced them to three years and nine months’ imprisonment and debarred them from public service for three years. In assessing the penalty to be imposed, the court first found that a sentence of three years’ imprisonment would be appropriate under Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code; it then applied section 5 of the 1991 Act, according to which this sentence had to be increased by half, that is, to four years and six months’ imprisonment; finally the court applied Article 59 of the Turkish Criminal Code, thereby reducing the sentence by one-sixth and thus decreasing the overall length to three years and nine months’ imprisonment. The court held, in particular:', '“Offence: Aiding and sheltering members of the illegal PKK organisation', 'Date of the offence: 1988 and 1989', '...', 'Assessment of the evidence:', '1. The defendant Mehmet Zeyrek', 'In his statements to the gendarmes, he said that he had been influenced by the propaganda spread by members of the PKK during their frequent visits to [his] village in 1989. Having seen that the organisation worked for them he had begun aiding [the PKK]. He had given his relative Behiye Zeyrek to the organisation rather than paying them a levy. He knew some of the members of the organisation with the code names Hamit, Mahmut, Sorej, Rojger and Ahmet. He met them in the Besta region, at the Kaniye Rengin point, at the Zirvi stream and on the outskirts of the Elma mountain. He knew a few of the warriors. [He stated further] that, on the instructions of the organisation and the instructions he had received from leaders of the groups during his meetings, he had carried provisions to them on his mules. Nobody had helped him to join the organisation. Members of the organisation had spread propaganda [in favour of the PKK] in the past, but they did not do it later as everybody knew the organisation. He also stated that some time before he had carried a battery and some provisions to a militant with the code name Hamza at the coalmine across from the Milli [gendarmerie] station.', 'In his statements to the public prosecutor, he denied the [accuracy of] his statements to the gendarmes; he claimed that he did not know a person with the code name Ahmet, that the latter had not told the truth about him but had slandered him. He [maintained] that he had not carried provisions to [members of] the organisation. He denied that he had placed Behiye Zeyrek at the disposal of the PKK rather than paying them a levy. He alleged that he did not know of her whereabouts.', 'In his statements to the Şırnak Magistrates’ Court, he submitted that he had never supplied aid to the PKK terrorist organisation, that he had never carried provisions to [PKK militants], that he had never met members of the [PKK]. [He claimed] that he is innocent of the charges.', 'In his statements to our court, the defendant denied the charges of aiding and sheltering [members of] the PKK. He alleged that he did not know of İkram Yamaner who was mentioned in the bill of indictment. He claimed that he is innocent of the charges.', 'According to the identification and confrontation protocol contained in dossier no. 9, when the defendant Mehmet Zeyrek was shown to İkram Yamaner with the code name Ahmet, the latter stated that he knew of Mehmet Zeyrek. He submitted that [Mehmet Zeyrek] used to come to see members of the organisation with the code names Erdal, Mehmet, Hamit and Serxabun and that he had often brought provisions on ten to fifteen mules to the Besta region, the Elma mountain, the Zirvi stream and to the Keniya Rengin point. [The witness] further stated that he had shown [to security forces] the places where these provisions were stored. He claimed that the defendant [Mehmet Zeyrek] was an important militant in the organisation.', 'When İkram Yamaner gave evidence as a witness before our court, he stated that the defendant had met senior members of the organisation, that he was a permanent member of the organisation and that he had frequently been in contact with [a militant] with the code name Erdal. [He further stated] that the defendant had supplied provisions such as food, drinks and weapons to the organisation.', 'It was established that the defendant had supplied provisions to members of the armed organisation who used to come to his village and that he had further supplied them provisions in rural areas. These acts of the defendant constitute the offence of knowingly aiding and sheltering members of an armed gang, [namely] the illegal PKK terrorist organisation. The court therefore concludes that there exist the actus reus and mens rea elements of the offence. His defence in this respect was rejected.', 'The defendant’s good conduct during the hearing was considered to be a mitigating circumstance.', '2. The defendant Abdülaziz Ecer', 'In his statements to the gendarmes he said that he had joined the PKK in early 1988 following the advice given by those in charge of the Besta region with the code names Amid and Mahmut during their visit to his village. He first placed his son Mustafa Ecer at the disposal of the organisation in order to help it. His son is currently an active armed militant in the organisation. He worked as a shopkeeper in the Geçitboyu village of the province of Şırnak and later on he stopped working. Apart from his son with the code name Amid, he knew [militants] with the code names Mahmut, Sorej and Ahmet as well as Aydın and Kalender. Since he worked as a shopkeeper, he allowed members of the organisation to take as many provisions as they wanted. Sometimes he was given money by members of the organisation with which he bought provisions such as flour, sugar and butter. He kept these provisions in his shop until he delivered them [to the militants]. He supplied aid to the organisation on the instructions of an armed militant in the organisation from his village with the code name Cafer Demir. He gave packs of cigarettes to a member of the organisation with the code name Ahmet. [The defendant] further stated that he had been given money by a member of the organisation with the code name Mahmut who wanted him to buy 1000 bags of flour. He delivered [to the organisation] thirty mule-loads of provisions such as flour, butter, sugar, lentils, socks and peşmerge clothing.', 'In his statements to the public prosecutor, he claimed that he had not helped members of the organisation and that he had not supplied any materials to the organisation. He alleged that he did not know of İkram Yamaner who had the code name Ahmet. He denied the latter’s allegations and submitted that he had no links with the organisation.', 'In his statements to the Şırnak Magistrates’ Court, [the defendant] alleged that he had not given aid to the PKK terrorist organisation, that he had not bought provisions for members of the organisation and that he had not bought flour for them either. He denied the charges against him.', 'In his oral evidence before our court, [the defendant] denied the charges brought against him. He submitted that Mustafa Ecer, who was mentioned in the bill of indictment, was his son. He had not seen him for five years. He heard [through some people] that his son had died. He claimed that he had not given aid to members of the PKK by means of sheltering them or supplying them with provisions.', 'According to the identification and confrontation protocol contained in dossier no. 9, when the defendant Abdülaziz Ecer was shown to İkram Yamaner with the code name Ahmet, the latter stated that he knew of Abdülaziz Ecer and that he had visited him at his home [while] he was working as a shopkeeper in the village. The team commander with the code name Mahmut gave some money to Abdülaziz Ecer and asked him to buy 1000 bags of flour. The defendant used a room at the back of his house and opposite his shop as a depot. The defendant supplied provisions to the organisation and brought 600 pairs of shoes with the brand name of Mekap. The defendant’s son with the code name Erdal is an active militant in the organisation whose real name he did not know. İkram Yamaner further stated that he had been a team commander and that the defendant had brought them twenty bags of sugar, flour, butter and lentils and thirty mule-loads of provisions.', 'İkram Yamaner, in his capacity as a witness before our court, stated that the defendant had supplied provisions such as food, drink and arms to the organisation. He further stated that the defendant was an active militant in the organisation and that he had frequently seen the defendant while he was in the organisation.', 'It was established that the defendant had supplied provisions to members of the armed organisation who used to come to his village, the village of Geçitkaya, and that he had further supplied them provisions in rural areas. Further, the defendant stored provisions in his shop for members of the gang. He met members of the gang with the help of his son, Mustafa Ecer, who is currently in the organisation and supplied them with the materials they needed. By these acts, the defendant is guilty of the offence of knowingly aiding and sheltering members of an armed gang, [namely] the illegal PKK terrorist organisation. The court therefore concludes that there exist the actus reus and mens rea elements of the offence. His defence in this respect was rejected.', 'The defendant’s good conduct during the hearing was considered to be a mitigating circumstance.”', '16. On 11 July 1994 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Court of Cassation, challenging the judgment of the Diyarbakır National Security Court. In particular, they alleged that the National Security Court had violated the principle of non-retrospective application of the criminal law since it had applied section 5 of the 1991 Act to increase the basic penalty under Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code by half. The applicants submitted that they had been convicted of acts committed in 1988 and 1989 as indicated in the bill of indictment. They maintained that the witness, İkram Yamaner, who testified against them and who had been apprehended in 1991, had said that 1988 and 1989 were the dates of the offences. The applicants finally argued that the court should not have admitted the statements made to the gendarmes as evidence since they had retracted them, asserting that they had been extracted under duress.', '17. On 21 February 1995 the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal. It upheld the cogency of the National Security Court’s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence. The Court of Cassation did not deal specifically with the applicants’ complaint relating to the retroactive application of the 1991 Act to their case.', '18. On 22 May 1995 the applicants applied to the Principal Public Prosecutor’s Office at the Court of Cassation requesting the rectification of the decision of 21 February 1995. On 19 June 1995 their request was dismissed by the Principal Public Prosecutor on the grounds that the Court of Cassation had examined all the points raised by the applicants and there was no other reason requiring the rectification of the decision.', '19. Article 169 of the Turkish Criminal Code provides:', '“Any person who, knowing that such an armed gang or organisation is illegal, assists it, harbours its members, provides it with food, weapons and ammunition or clothes or facilitates its operations in any manner whatsoever shall be sentenced to not less than three and not more than five years’ imprisonment ...”', 'According to the Government, the act of assisting and giving shelter to members of an illegal organisation has the character of continuity and the offence is a continuing one.', '20. Under section 4 of the 1991 Act, the offence defined in Article 169 of the Criminal Code is classified in the category of “acts committed to further the purposes of terrorism”.', 'Pursuant to section 5 of the 1991 Act, the penalty laid down in the Criminal Code as punishment for the offence defined in section 4 of the Act is increased by one half.', '21.

The applicants are members of one family. Mr Maksut Netkaliyevich Tuleshov, born in 1953 (the first applicant), and Mrs Aslganym Kalikovna Tuleshova, born in 1955 (the second applicant), are husband and wife; Mr Viktor Maksutovich Tuleshov, born in 1979, and Mr Sergey Maksutovich Tuleshov, born in 1977, are their sons; Mr Kalik Isayev, born in 1929, is the second applicant's father. They, and three other children of the first and the second applicants, live together in one household in the town of Marx of Saratov Region."", '7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '8. In 1993 Mr Kh bought a house from company B. It was a former shop at 8 Third Avenue, Marx, which Kh intended to convert into a dwelling. The house was free from any third party claim.', '9. In 1996 the Marx Town Court of the Saratov Region examined an unrelated commercial dispute between company B and a third party and found that B had failed to perform as stipulated in their contract. The house was listed as pledged property in the contract and the court ordered its sale. Apparently the court was not aware that the house had already been sold to Kh.', ""10. The sale was administered by the court bailiff. The price was set at 13,600,000 roubles (RUR), the pre-redenomination equivalent of RUR 13,600, or approximately 2,800 US dollars. The first applicant offered to buy the house, and on 12 April 1996 the Marx Town Court approved the sale. This decision took effect on 23 April 1996. The first applicant was registered with the real estate registry (Бюро технической инвентаризации) as the owner of the house. Apparently the first applicant was not aware of Kh's right to the house and Kh was not aware of the sale to the first applicant."", '11. On 22 July 1996 the Marx local administration granted a reconstruction permit by virtue of which the first applicant converted the shop into a dwelling of about 78 square metres. He moved into it with seven members of his family including the other applicants.', '12. In 1998 Kh seized the Marx Town Court with a property claim in respect of the house and challenged its sale by the bailiff. The first applicant lodged a counterclaim invoking his title to the house.', ""13. On 28 June 1999 the Marx Town Court found that the bailiff had sold the house to the first applicant unlawfully and declared the sale null and void. It annulled the first applicant's title and ordered his and his family's eviction. The first applicant was awarded RUR 13,600 as reimbursement of the house purchase price by company B and the other party to the contract mentioned in paragraph 9 above, and RUR 113,161 of reconstruction costs payable by Kh."", '14. On the same day the applicants were served with an eviction order.', '15. The first applicant and Kh appealed.', '16. Company B and the other party both failed to pay the amount due to the applicant under the judgment (RUR 13,600) as they became insolvent.', '17. On 27 August 1999 the Saratov Regional Court upheld the first instance judgment as to the substance, but reversed the award of the reconstruction costs because such a claim had never been made by the applicants.', '18. On 15 November 1999 the Presidium of the Saratov Regional Court quashed on supervisory review the decision of 12 April 1996 by which the sale of the house to the first applicant had been ordered.', ""19. On 9 August 2000 the Marx Town Court, apparently following the first applicant's request for supervisory review, appointed an expert to assess the market value of the house. The evaluation report issued on the same date estimated it as RUR 245,000 (then an equivalent of about 9,738 euros (EUR)). On 31 August 2000 the Saratov Regional Court rejected the request for supervisory review."", '20. On 14 March 2001 the applicants brought proceedings for damages against Kh, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Administration Department. They claimed pecuniary damages of RUR 317,654 including the reconstruction costs (RUR 146,461), the sum of RUR 13,600, i.e. the money which had not been paid by the insolvent debtors, and non-pecuniary damages of RUR 210,000. In support of their pecuniary claims they referred to the expert evaluation of 9 August 2000. The court joined Kh to the proceedings as a co-defendant.', ""21. On 14 December 2001 the Marx Town Court examined the case. It found that Kh had never authorised the reconstruction works on his premises and, relying on Article 1069 of the Civil Code, held that these expenses were incurred as a result of the authorities' unlawful conduct and must be reimbursed by the State. The first applicant was awarded RUR 89,522 (then the equivalent of about EUR 3,305) to be paid by the Ministry of Finance. In so far as the applicants claimed the reimbursement of RUR 13,600, the court held that the first applicant “had not made sufficient effort to recover the debt” from company B and the other party. The remaining pecuniary and non-pecuniary claims including those by the other applicants were dismissed on the grounds that the applicants had not adduced sufficient proof of the amount they claimed as damages."", '22. On 15 February 2002 the Saratov Regional Court upheld the judgment of 14 December 2001.', '23. On 26 November 2002 the applicants were ordered to leave the house by 6 December 2002.', '24. The applicants challenged the eviction order claiming that the award had not been paid and that no other dwelling had been made available to them.', ""25. On 9 December 2002 the Marx Town Court of the Saratov Region dismissed the applicants' challenge to the eviction order. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Saratov Regional Court on 17 January 2003."", '26. On 27 March 2003 the Marx Town Court of the Saratov Region examined another request by the applicants and adjourned the eviction until 4 April 2003. The applicants appealed claiming that this was insufficient and requested an adjournment until social housing could be allocated. The extension was refused.', '27. Between April and July 2003 the applicants were served the eviction order three times, each time with a new deadline. The applicants unsuccessfully challenged the order every time it was served.', '28. On 12 September 2003 the bailiff of the Tsentralnyy District Court of Moscow informed the first applicant that the bailiff service was no longer competent to enforce awards against the State. He instructed the first applicant to claim his award under the judgment of 14 December 2001 directly from the Ministry of Finance.', '29. On 12 October 2003 the applicants and the rest of the family were evicted from the house.', '30. On 19 November 2003 they were granted social housing in a municipal hostel where they have been living since then. For eight family members they were allocated a 45 square metres flat comprising three rooms. The toilet, bathroom and cooking facilities are shared with other flats on the same floor, and the residence has central heating but no gas or hot water supply. The applicants received this accommodation under the terms of a social tenancy and have to pay rent. At present ten family members live in this dwelling.', ""31. On 18 February 2004 the Ministry of Finance informed the second applicant that the payment due to the first applicant pursuant to the judgment had been suspended because the enforcement documents had been sent to the Ministry's Legal Department “for the inspection of the materials of the [applicants'] court dispute”. It promised to “keep the applicants informed about the outcome of the challenge and its legal assessment”."", '32. On 16 November 2004 the Ministry of Finance paid the applicant RUR 89,522 (then the equivalent of about EUR 2,405).', '33. On 15 May 2006 the applicants obtained an expert evaluation of the market value of their social housing, which was estimated at RUR 70,000 (then the equivalent of about EUR 2,017).', '34. Article 1064 § 1 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that the damage caused to the person or property of a citizen must be compensated in full by the person who caused the damage. Pursuant to Article 1069, a State agency or a State official is liable to a citizen for damage caused by their unlawful actions or failure to act. Such damage is to be compensated at the expense of the federal or regional treasury.', '35. Articles 151 and 1099-1101 of the Civil Code provide for compensation for non-pecuniary damage. Article 1099 states, in particular, that non-pecuniary damage shall be compensated irrespective of any award for pecuniary damage.', '36. The officially fixed reference rates of the market value of residential real estate are periodically published by the State Construction Agency (Госстрой) and are mandatory for the calculation of State-funded housing subsidies. Directive No. 158 of 29 August 2003 stated that in the last quarter of 2003 the average price of residential real estate in the Saratov Region was RUR 8,200 (then the equivalent of about EUR 248) per square metre.']",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

According to the applicant, towards the end of November 1992 the lance-corporal hit him on the side of the head with his fist, causing him to fall and strike his head on the ground. On 30 November 1992, several days after the attack, the applicant reported sick and told the medical officer that the injury to his face had been caused by falling off a horse. On 26 February 1993 the applicant, who alleges to have feared a further physical attack, went absent without leave. On 17 March 1993 he wrote to the commanding officer (“CO”) of the regiment (a lieutenant-colonel), stating, inter alia, that “[his] inability to express sufficient enthusiasm during training sometimes resulted in physical abuse by certain NCOs [non-commissioned officers]”, and asking to terminate his service. He received no reply to this letter.', ""10. The applicant was arrested by the civilian police on 16 October 1996 and taken to the HCMR's barracks at Hyde Park, London. The following day he was charged with being absent without leave contrary to section 38(a) of the Army Act 1955. On 18 October 1996 he was remanded in close arrest by Major Kelly, acting as subordinate CO. On the “Eight Day Delay Report” dated 24 October 1996, the reason for the detention is stated: “Likely to absent himself ... – has already offered bribe to JNCO on guard to release him.” On 31 October 1996 he appeared before the CO and was remanded by him in close arrest for an abstract of evidence. He was subsequently released by the CO into open arrest on 11 November 1996. The CO remanded him for trial by district court martial on 13 March 1997."", '11. In a statement dated 4 November 1996 to the Ministry of Defence Police, the applicant stated that the attack by the lance-corporal had occurred in the week prior to his going absent without leave, while in a statement dated 29 January 1997 he stated that the attack occurred sometime in February 1993. The police found that the lance-corporal had left the army and took statements from other soldiers who had been on the same riding course as the applicant. They found that there was no evidence to support his complaint. The applicant subsequently signed a statement saying, inter alia: “I have come to the conclusion that I just want to get out of the army and get on with my life ... Even though this assault happened, I do not want the Ministry of Defence Police ... to take any further action concerning the incident.”', ""12. Following the applicant's remand for trial, the CO appointed Captain A. as “defending officer”. Captain A. was an army officer with no legal training, serving as a troop commander with the HCMR. The applicant applied to the Army Criminal Legal Aid Authority (“the Legal Aid Authority”) for legal aid to enable him to be represented by a solicitor. On the application form he stated that his weekly income after deduction of tax, rent and national insurance was 158.13 pounds sterling (GBP), and that he had no savings or other property of value. The form was countersigned by his CO. By a letter dated 26 March 1997, the Legal Aid Authority replied that a charge of absence without leave did not normally warrant legal representation but that either the CO or the applicant should write setting out his reasons if he considered that, exceptionally, legal aid should be granted. The applicant's solicitor wrote to the Legal Aid Authority on 18 April 1997 pointing out that the applicant faced a custodial sentence and needed to be represented. The Legal Aid Authority offered the applicant legal aid subject to a down-payment of GBP 240 in a letter dated 21 April 1997. The Government maintain that he could have paid in ten weekly instalments of GBP 24 each, but this is disputed by the applicant. On 30 April 1997 the applicant's solicitor wrote asking the Legal Aid Authority to reconsider the down-payment condition, but on 2 May 1997, before the Legal Aid Authority had replied, the applicant refused the offer of legal aid and was not, therefore, represented by a solicitor at the court martial."", '13. Also on 2 May 1997, the applicant signed a document, addressed “to whom it may concern”, in which he made the following statement:', '“This is to certify that I, 25009734 Tpr Morris D of The Life Guards no longer wish to be represented at my pending District Court Martial other than by my Defending Officer, Captain [A.].', 'I have made this decision of my own free will. I understand that all previous correspondence with regard to my application for legal representation will now be ignored.”', ""14. The applicant's court martial took place at Chelsea Barracks on 28 May 1997. The court was composed as follows: a president, Lieutenant-Colonel A.D. Hall of the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, who was a permanent president of courts martial (appointed to his post in January 1997 and due to remain until his retirement in September 2001); Captain R. Reid of the Royal Army Medical Corps, Aldershot; Captain W.D. Perks of the Second Battalion, Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment (Volunteers), Reading; and a legally qualified civilian judge advocate (see paragraph 26 below). All three military officers were outside the command area in which the applicant was serving. The president worked from home when not attending court-martial hearings."", ""15. Captain A. represented the applicant, who pleaded guilty to the charge of being absent without leave between 25 February 1993 and 16 October 1996. The applicant's letter of 17 March 1993 to his CO was handed to the court, but no other mention was made of the bullying allegedly suffered by him. The applicant was sentenced to dismissal from the army and nine months' detention."", '16. After the hearing, Captain A. erroneously advised the applicant that if he appealed against the sentence he risked the commencement date for his sentence being put back to the date of dismissal of the appeal. On 31 May 1997 the applicant instructed a solicitor to represent him. On 19 June 1997 the solicitor lodged a petition with the Defence Council in its role as the “reviewing authority” (see paragraph 29 below), relying on the facts that the applicant had had no legal representation before the court martial and that his allegations of assault were not presented to the court, either by way of a defence of duress (which applies when a person charged with a criminal offence can show that, at the relevant time, he reasonably believed that he would be killed or seriously injured if he did not commit the offence) or in mitigation of sentence. The petition asserted that it was unlikely that the defending officer understood that the applicant might have had a defence on the basis of duress and that the defending officer had indicated that he had been “ordered” not to allude to the allegations at the court martial without indicating who had so ordered him. It also mentioned instructions which the defending officer had given about what the applicant ought to do in the event that the court martial should, of its own volition, ask the applicant about the allegations which had been made. It also indicated that the defending officer had advised the applicant that, “if he appealed, his sentence might well be increased”. On the same day the petition was introduced, the solicitor wrote to Captain A. asking for his comments on it and reminding him that he was subject to the rules of client privilege and should not disclose details of his dealings with the applicant to any third party. Despite this, Captain A. provided a statement to the Defence Council, in which he said, inter alia:', ""“As [the applicant's] Troop Leader I was asked to represent him at Court Martial, this was the first Court Martial I have attended in any capacity. Although I have had experience in civil cases at both Magistrates' and Crown Courts. ..."", '[The applicant] had indicated to me that he had gone absent from the Army for more than one reason. As expressed in his letter of 17 March 1993. He was showing reservations about his enthusiasm, commitment and devotion to duty. ...', '[T]he petition states that I assumed the petitioner had no choice but to plead guilty, as he had been Absent Without Leave. I was unaware that he could have entered a plea of not guilty to the charge on the basis of duress. [The applicant] and I did not discuss the allegations of bullying in any great detail. This was because these allegations had been withdrawn by him under interview by MOD Police.', '[The applicant] indicated to me that he wanted to drop all the references to the violence by the NCO during his training. This was in order that the trial date would be set significantly earlier and that the trial would be substantially shorter. This led me to advise [the applicant] to plead guilty as charged, as I had felt that this gave him his best opportunity to be discharged from the Army at the earliest date which was, after all, his overall aim. ...', 'I discussed with the Adjutant my role as the Defending Officer. We talked about the procedural steps of the court martial and my conduct leading up to the trial. It was confirmed to me that a guilty plea would produce an earlier trial date than that of not guilty.', 'I advised [the applicant] that references to his allegations of bullying could prolong and complicate his court martial. The mention of bullying would be introduced as part of his letter to his commanding officer dated 17 March 1993, which he agreed could be put forward for the court as mitigation. [The applicant] agreed that he did not wish to answer questions about his previous allegations, which he had dropped.', 'I therefore advised him to refer such questions to me and I would state to the court that this was an avenue down which he did not wish to proceed. ...”', '17. The petition was refused by the reviewing authority on 14 July 1997, in the following terms:', '“The Reviewing Authority has considered the petition submitted by your above-named client, and has denied it for the following reasons.', 'The down payment for Legal Aid was carefully calculated, and was well in line with the amount the petitioner would have had to pay under the civil system. The certificate signed by him shows clearly that he had decided not to proceed with his application for legal representation. We cannot accept that [the applicant] was in any way forced to accept this decision. He also appears to have been content to accept Captain [A.] as his defending officer.', 'The complaints about the petitioner being bullied were investigated by the SIB and the allegations could not be substantiated. Indeed it came to light during this investigation that the petitioner had told [another soldier] that he planned to go absent because he was merely tired of the training and the long hours being worked. In view of the SIB report, the Reviewing Authority must accept that the allegation that the petitioner was subjected to violence by a Non-Commissioned Officer cannot be substantiated, and cannot be regarded as a mitigating factor.', 'In considering your complaint that, had the petitioner been advised by a qualified solicitor, he would have been able to plead not guilty on the basis of duress, we had to rely on the advice given by the Judge Advocate General. He stated that a person is subject to duress when words or conduct from another person cause him to fear that he will be killed or seriously injured, if he does not commit the offence. Clearly, the petitioner could never have reasonably believed that he had cause to fear that he would be killed or seriously injured.', 'The Reviewing Authority notes that the petitioner had dropped his allegations of being subjected to violence by the time he appeared in Court. All Captain [A.] intended to do was to inform the Court that the petitioner did not wish to proceed with these allegations. In fact the Court was made aware of them because the letter from (sic) the Commanding Officer was read out to them.', ""We accept that Captain [A.] was mistaken in referring the petitioner to the booklet 'Appeals and Petitions after conviction by Army Court Martial', which was out of date after 1 April 1997. In addition the wrong paragraph was used in his advice to the petitioner. However as we have now received a petition, in spite of this mistaken advice, we believe that no harm has been done. ...”"", '18. On 26 July 1997 the applicant lodged an application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court. Leave to appeal was refused by the single judge on 22 October 1997, on the grounds that the defence of duress had not been open to the applicant, that he had been properly advised to plead guilty, and that the sentence was not manifestly excessive.', '19. The Armed Forces Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) came into effect on 1 April 1997, amending the Armed Forces Act 1955 (“the 1955 Act”).', ""20. Under the 1996 Act, the initial decision whether or not to bring a prosecution is taken by the higher authority, who is a senior officer who must decide whether any case referred to him by the accused's commanding officer should be dealt with summarily, referred to the prosecuting authority, or dropped. Once the higher authority has taken this decision, he has no further involvement in the case."", ""21. Where the accused is a member of the army, the role of prosecutor is performed by the Army Prosecuting Authority (“the prosecuting authority”). Following the higher authority's decision to refer a case to it, the prosecuting authority has absolute discretion, applying similar criteria as those applied in civilian cases by the Crown Prosecution Service, to decide whether or not to prosecute, what type of court martial would be appropriate and precisely what charges should be brought. In addition, it conducts the prosecution (1996 Act, Schedule I, Part II). The prosecution is brought on behalf of the Attorney-General. The current prosecuting authority is the Director of Army Legal Services. In his role as prosecuting authority, the Director of Army Legal Services is answerable to the Attorney-General, while in his coexisting role as the army's senior lawyer he is answerable to the Adjutant General (the army's principal personnel and training officer, responsible, inter alia, for army disciplinary policy and a member of the Army Board). In pursuit of his latter role, the Director of Army Legal Services provides some military legal advice to the army chain of command. He does not advise the disciplinary chain of command of the army, this role being reserved to the Brigadier Advisory."", '22. The Army Criminal Legal Aid Authority is also the responsibility of the Adjutant General.', '23. The Court-Martial Administration Office (now the Army Court Service), independent of both the higher authority and the prosecuting authority, is responsible for making the arrangements for courts martial, including arranging venue and timing, ensuring that a judge advocate and any court officials required will be available, securing the attendance of witnesses and selecting members of the court. Its officers are appointed by the Defence Council. Before commencement of the court-martial hearing, the power to dissolve it is vested in the responsible court-administration officer. Until early 2001 the person in charge of the Court-Martial Administration Office was a retired officer. The Army Court Service was then created in its place, the head of which is now a serving brigadier.', ""24. At the relevant time, a district court martial (“DCM”) was required to consist of a permanent president of courts martial, not less than two serving military officers of at least two years' military experience and a judge advocate (section 84D of the 1955 Act as amended by the 1996 Act). The court-administration officer, commanding officers of the accused, members of the higher authority, investigating officers and all other officers involved in inquiring into the charges concerned were all barred from selection to the court martial (section 84C(4) of the 1955 Act as amended by the 1996 Act). The Courts Martial (Army) Rules 1997 further provide that an officer serving under the command of: (i) the higher authority referring the case; (ii) the prosecuting authority; or (iii) the court-administration officer are ineligible for selection. The Queen's Regulations provide that a court martial is, so far as practicable, to be composed of officers from different units."", ""25. The post of permanent president of courts martial (“the permanent president”) was first created in 1941. Permanent presidents were routinely appointed thereafter to sit on DCMs whenever one was available until suspension of the post in 2000, around the time of a ruling by Assistant Judge Advocate Pearson on 6 March 2000 in McKendry (see paragraph 31 below) that the appointment of permanent presidents meant that courts martial did not have the necessary impartiality and independence for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention. Permanent presidents were selected from the ranks of serving army officers of suitable age and rank. Until around the end of 1996, permanent presidents of courts martial held the rank of major. Thereafter their rank was raised to lieutenant-colonel, which resulted in permanent presidents routinely outranking the other serving officers on a DCM, who were never above the rank of major. Legal qualifications or experience were not required. Their appointment was usually expected to be for a period in excess of three years and was almost without exception the officer's last posting before his retirement from the army. The Military Secretary (a senior subordinate of the Adjutant General) had power to terminate the appointment of a permanent president, but this has never happened in practice."", ""26. Judge advocates are appointed by the Lord Chancellor and are civilians who must have at least seven years' experience as an advocate or five years' experience as a barrister. A judge advocate's rulings on points of law are binding on the court and he delivers a summing-up in open court before the court martial retires to consider its verdict. Once the court martial hearing has commenced, the power to dissolve it is vested in the judge advocate. He has a vote on sentence, but not on verdict. Under the 1996 Act, the Judge Advocate General lost his previous role of providing general legal advice to the Secretary of State for Defence (Schedule I, Part III, sections 19, 25 and 27)."", '27. Each member of a court martial has to swear the following oath:', '“I swear by Almighty God that I will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence, and that I will duly administer justice according to the Army Act 1955 without partiality, favour or affection, and I do further swear that I will not on any account at any time whatsoever disclose or discover the vote or opinion of the president or any member of this court martial, unless thereunto required in the due course of law.”', '28. Decisions on verdict and sentence are reached by majority vote (section 96 of the 1955 Act). The casting vote on sentence, if needed, rests with the president of the court martial, who also gives reasons for the sentence in open court. The members of the court are required to speak, and at the close of deliberations to vote on verdict and sentence, in ascending order of seniority.', ""29. All guilty verdicts reached and sentences imposed by a court martial must be reviewed by the “reviewing authority” (section 113 of the 1955 Act as amended by the 1996 Act). Although the ultimate responsibility rests with the Defence Council, the review is as a matter of practice generally delegated to a senior subordinate of the Adjutant General. Post-trial advice received by the reviewing authority from a judge advocate (different from the one who officiated at the court martial) is disclosed to the accused, who has the right to present a petition to the authority. The reviewing authority may quash any guilty verdict and associated sentence or make any finding of guilt which could have been made by the court martial, and may substitute any sentence (not being, in the authority's opinion, more severe than that originally passed) which was open to the court martial (section 113AA of the 1955 Act as amended by the 1996 Act). The reviewing authority gives a reasoned decision and its verdict and sentence are treated for all purposes as if they were reached or imposed by the court martial."", '30. There is a right of appeal against both conviction and sentence to the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (a civilian court of appeal) (section 8 of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968). An appeal will be allowed where the court finds that the conviction is unsafe, but dismissed in all other cases. The court has power, inter alia, to call for the production of evidence and witnesses whether or not produced at the court martial (section 28 of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968).', ""31. The role of permanent president was examined by the Courts-Martial Appeal Court (which has the same composition as the civilian Court of Appeal) in R. v. Spear and another and in R. v. Boyd ([2001] Court of Appeal, Criminal Division (England and Wales) 2). The court dismissed the appellants' complaint that the position of permanent presidents on courts martial violated Article 6 § 1 of the Convention because permanent presidents lacked the necessary independence and impartiality. The court declined to follow the reasoning of Assistant Judge Advocate Pearson in McKendry. Lord Justice Laws, delivering the judgment of the court, said:"", ""“24. Mr Mackenzie of course relies on the decision of Assistant Judge Advocate General Pearson in McKendry. His judgment was given as we have said on 6 March 2000, by way of a ruling in a then current court martial upon objections raised on behalf of the defence to the PPCM [Permanent President] sitting as a member of the court. The judge advocate's essential reasoning appears at pp. 8-9 of the transcript, after he had correctly directed himself as to the Article 6 standards to be applied (the numbering attached to the judge advocate general's text is ours, not his):"", ""'1. I am concerned as to the terms of appointment of these Permanent Presidents. It seems to me that there is no fixed time limit other than a time which may be quite short – two, three or four years; certainly two years is probably too short to ensure full independence, four years may be suitable – I express no comment on that."", '2. I am concerned as to their training. This reference to their visiting the APA [Army Prosecuting Authority], I suspect that is mistyping, nevertheless it is there in their current job description and I must be concerned with the perception of bias, and it does not look appropriate, in my view, for Permanent Presidents to be told they should attend a briefing from the Prosecuting Authority.', '3. I am concerned obviously with their potential removal. Clearly anybody exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions should be free from arbitrary removal, and there should be some sort of guarantee that the removal would only be on the basis of some sort of misconduct within that particular office. There is no security, therefore, it would seem to me, that applies to Permanent Presidents at the present time in their role.', '4. I am also obviously concerned with the question of reporting, whether it be annual – which I doubt; it is more likely to be every two years, or perhaps on the renewal of their appointment – I cannot say, but certainly there is some reporting that appears to take place, and it seems to me again that is a significant difficulty which affects the perception of independence.', ""Now, I have specified those three [in fact, four] as being the main concerns that I have ... those particular concerns are sufficient in my view for me to rule that in the particular circumstances of the system as it now stands, the appointments of Permanent Presidents do not give rise to an independent and impartial tribunal.'"", ""The judge advocate was at pains to insist that his ruling was 'limited to this particular case'; but its reasoning plainly applies at least to all DCMs presided over by a PPCM."", ""25. Mr Mackenzie sought to build on the reasoning in McKendry with a series of further points ... In particular, he submitted that (a) there were no objective regulatory provisions governing the PPCM's appointment, beyond the ordinary procedures for staff appointments; (b) 'the medium rank of PPCM prevents such officers from being immune from general Army influence' ...; (c) the PPCM is senior in rank to the other officers on the court martial ..., and would be likely to exert a substantial influence over them."", '26. It is convenient to deal with this last point first. In McKendry the judge advocate stated at 6C-D (referring to junior members of a DCM):', ""'Speaking for myself, having of course sat in on many, many sentencing matters with Permanent Presidents, I can say that I have found that the junior members ... the fact that they happen to be junior in rank, has not prevented them from being very robust in their sentencing arguments.'"", ""As judge advocate he would not, of course, have participated in the court's deliberations upon conviction. It is to be noted that by paragraph 70(4) of the Court Martial (Army) Rules 1997 the junior officer is required to speak first in the course of any court martial's deliberations. The provision is plainly intended to ensure that junior members' genuine opinions are put forward."", ""27. Upon this point, Mr Mackenzie's argument does not go to the particular position of the PPCM at all, but rather to the differences in rank among the members of the court martial, whether the president is a PPCM or not. As such we doubt whether it is open to him. But we are clear in any event that there is no merit in it. If the argument were right, it would presumably mean that Article 6(1) required that the members of a court martial should be officers of the same rank. That cannot be the law. The notion, were it accepted, that it is reasonable to fear that between joint decision-makers of different rank there is a systematic likelihood that the more junior may be unduly influenced by the perceived views of the more senior would, surely, be an unlooked for and unwelcome side-effect of the Convention's beneficent regime. We consider it perfectly reasonable to suppose that junior officers would regard it as their duty to speak with their own voice, and that the modern culture of the Service would promote that very point of view. We do not think it would be reasonable for the accused soldier to entertain any different perception. This point is a bad one."", ""28. The argument as to the PPCM's medium rank and 'general Army influence' falls to be disposed of in like manner. But there is another point to be made. The way this argument is formulated – 'the medium rank of PPCM prevents such officers from being immune from general Army influence' – amounts, looked at rigorously, to an allegation of actual bias (whether unconscious or not). It is not, or not only, a matter of the appearance of the thing or of the presence or absence of objective guarantees. It is a delicate way of saying that such medium-ranking officers are relatively prone to take a prosecution line. That is quite a serious allegation, for which there is not a whisper of any supporting evidence. And in our view it is simply patronising to suggest that an officer in the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel ... will have his judgment on the concrete facts of a particular case affected by anything so amorphous as 'general Army influence'."", ""29. In our judgment Mr Mackenzie's further submission about the absence of any specific regulatory provision goes nowhere, unless it supports an argument to the effect that the PPCMs lack sufficient tenure in office for this court to be satisfied that the Article 6 requirements of independence and impartiality are met. ..."", ""30. ... we should dispose of point (2) in McKendry. This rested in the judge advocate's understanding that Army PPCMs were required, as a training exercise, to visit and be briefed by the Army Prosecuting Authority. In fact the judge advocate himself reported (4E) the assurance given to him that no such visits took place. Lt Col Stone states in terms that he has never visited the APA. From the judge advocate's reasoning in McKendry it looks as if there must have been some rogue document or documents in circulation; but there is obviously nothing of substance in the point.”"", ""32. Lord Justice Laws concluded as follows on the appellants' complaint about the position of permanent presidents (at paragraph 33):"", ""“... We consider that the conditions upon which PPCMs have been appointed, and held office, have involved no violation of Article 6(1), and in particular there was no violation on the facts of these cases. We should first collect the facts which have weighed with us. (1) The PPCMs effectively operated outside the ordinary chain of command. They advisedly lived their professional lives largely in isolation from their Service colleagues. (2) While Mr Havers rightly accepted that there was no 'written guarantee' against removal, there is in fact no record of a PPCM ever having been removed from that position. Removal from office, we may readily infer, would only take place in highly exceptional circumstances which have never eventuated. (3) The appointment was the officer's last posting, offering no prospect of promotion or preferment thereafter. Neither of the PPCMs in these cases entertained any such prospect, hope or expectation. ... (4) The term of these PPCMs' appointments was for no less than four years ... (5) There have been no reports on Army PPCMs since April 1997. ...”"", '33. In R. v. Généreux ([1992] 1 Supreme Court Reports 259), the Supreme Court of Canada examined, inter alia, the compatibility of a Canadian general court martial with section 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides:', '“11. Any person charged with an offence has the right', '...', '(d) to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.”', '34. A general court martial consisted of between five and nine voting members, who were joined by a judge advocate who was called upon to determine questions of law or mixed law and fact during the trial. The judge advocate was appointed to the general court martial by the Judge Advocate General on an ad hoc basis.', '35. The Supreme Court concluded that the judge advocate did not possess sufficient security of tenure to satisfy the requirement of “independence” under section 11(d) of the Charter. Lamer CJ, delivering the leading judgment of the court, commented as follows:', ""“... the judge advocate was appointed solely on a case by case basis. As a result, there was no objective guarantee that his or her career as a military judge would not be affected by decisions tending in favour of the accused rather than the prosecution. A reasonable person might well have entertained an apprehension that a legal officer's occupation as a military judge would be affected by his or her performance in earlier cases ... [or] that the person chosen as judge advocate had been selected because he or she had satisfied the interests of the executive, or at least has not seriously disappointed the executive's expectations, in previous proceedings. ..."", 'Military judges who act periodically as judge advocates must therefore have a tenure that is beyond the interference of the executive for a fixed period of time.”', ""He went on to note that amendments to Canadian court-martial procedures, which had come into force subsequent to the proceedings at issue in the case, had corrected deficiencies in the judge advocate's security of tenure, providing for appointment for a period of between two and four years.""]",['6'],['6-1'],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],1

The applicant was born in 1975 in Sri Lanka. He currently lives in London. He is of Tamil ethnicity.', '7. The applicant entered the United Kingdom clandestinely on 17 August 1999 and claimed asylum the next day. He stated that he feared ill-treatment in Sri Lanka by the Sri Lankan army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (“the LTTE”). He explained that he had been arrested and detained by the army on six occasions between 1990 and 1997 on suspicion of involvement with the LTTE. Following his last detention he went into hiding until his family managed to fund his journey to the United Kingdom. He feared the LTTE on account of their adverse interest in his father who had done some work for the army. They had also tried to recruit the applicant on two occasions in 1997 and 1998.', '8. His claim was refused by the Secretary of State on 30 October 2002. His appeal against that decision was heard and dismissed by an Adjudicator on 27 July 2003. It was found that the applicant’s account was credible: namely, he had been arrested by the army on some six occasions between 1990 and 1997 on suspicion of his involvement with the LTTE. He was detained for less than twenty-four hours on the first occasion and for two days on the last. There was no evidence as to how long the other periods of detention had lasted. On each occasion he was released without charge. During one or possibly more of these periods of detention he was ill-treated and his legs had scars from being beaten with batons. According to the Adjudicator, it may have been that the arrests took place in the course of round-ups. During the 1997 detention the applicant was photographed and his fingerprints were taken and his father signed certain papers in order to secure his release. He went into hiding in a temple and wanted to leave Sri Lanka at that stage but it took time for his mother to obtain money from his brother to pay the agent for his departure.', '9. However, the Adjudicator found that the applicant’s fear of ill-treatment by the army upon his return was unjustified. It was noted that, since his departure from Sri Lanka, there had been a ceasefire between the army and the LTTE for a considerable time, checkpoints had been dismantled, and the LTTE had been able to open political offices and roads in the north. It was unlikely that he would attract any interest on the part of the authorities upon his return. Even if the record of his arrests was found it would be seen that he had been held for short periods and released without charge on each occasion. There was no record that he had ever been involved with the LTTE or that he had ever been wanted by the authorities. There was no reason why he should be strip-searched on return and, even if his scars were found, they would not cause the authorities to take an interest in him, certainly not to the extent of detaining and ill-treating him.', '10. As to his fear of the LTTE, the Adjudicator appeared to accept that the applicant’s brother had done non-combative work for the LTTE, though he was never a member. He, the brother, had been arrested by the army but never charged and had left Sri Lanka for Saudi Arabia in 1997. It was found unlikely that the LTTE would still have any interest in the applicant and if he was settled in Colombo it would be unlikely that they could track him down. In any event, he could apply to the authorities for protection. As to his argument that he was in need of psychiatric treatment as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, it was found that adequate treatment would be available in Sri Lanka.', '11. He was issued with removal directions for 1 April 2006 and made further representations attempting to lodge a fresh asylum application on 29 March 2006. On 3 April 2006 the Secretary of State refused to consider his further representations as amounting to a new asylum application. The general situation in Sri Lanka did not indicate any personal risk of ill-treatment and there was no evidence that he would be personally affected upon return. The fact that he had been away from Sri Lanka for the past seven and a half years suggested that he would hardly be of any interest to the Sri Lankan authorities.', '12. His application for permission to apply for judicial review was refused on 23 May 2006 on the papers by Mr Justice Collins who stated:', '“There is no question but that the situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated over the past few months and to such an extent that there is a real prospect [that the full scale war between the LTTE and the authorities will recommence. However, that does not of itself mean that no-one can be returned. The adjudicator accepted the claimant’s account but noted that he had only been detained for short periods, possibly in general round ups, and had not assisted the LTTE. All this was over 7 years ago.', 'In the circumstances, it is not possible to say what has been happening creates a real risk of relevant ill-treatment for this claimant. Thus I do not think there is any arguable error of law in the defendant’s decision.”', '13. The applicant’s renewed application was refused by Mr Justice Burnton at an oral hearing on 18 August 2006.', '14. The applicant was then issued with removal directions for 10 January 2007. On 9 January 2007, he made further representations to the Secretary of State arguing, inter alia, that removal would be incompatible with his rights guaranteed by the Convention. When the Secretary of State did not respond, on 10 January 2007 the applicant sought to challenge this failure by judicial review.', '15. It appears that the same day, the Secretary of State did in fact reject these representations as not amounting to a fresh claim. The Secretary of State relied on the findings of the Adjudicator and the observations of Mr Justice Collins of 23 May 2006. The Secretary of State also considered a paper submitted by the applicant which had been issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on 22 December 2006, entitled “the UNHCR Position on the International Protection Needs of Asylum Seekers from Sri Lanka” (“the UNHCR Position Paper” see paragraphs 65–68 below). He found, however, that the paper was general in nature and therefore little weight could be attached to it. Consideration was given to the applicant’s claim that the political and security situation in Sri Lanka had worsened and whilst it was acknowledged that there had been some problems with the peace process, the LTTE and the Sri Lankan authorities were committed to peace and working towards an agreement. Notwithstanding two bomb attacks in Colombo, there was a “distinct geographical limitation” to recent incidents and it was open to the applicant to avoid the northern and eastern areas affected by the continuing operations of the Sri Lankan armed forces and the LTTE. The majority of Tamils could live in Colombo and the south without harassment. Recent security operations in Colombo were also noted but it was not considered that Tamils in Colombo were at risk of persecution due to their ethnicity or political opinions. The majority of people detained had been quickly released following identity checks. In terms of internal relocation, it was not unduly harsh to return failed asylum-seekers there. While there had been increasing levels of disappearances in Sri Lanka, progress had been made by the creation of an independent body to observe government investigations. The Secretary of State concluded that the points made in the applicant’s submissions had not been previously considered, but taken with the materials considered in the original refusal of the applicant’s asylum claim and the determination of his appeal by the Adjudicator, the new materials would not have created a realistic prospect of success and the submissions did not therefore amount to a fresh asylum claim.', '16. The applicant then made an out of hours application for an injunction to the High Court. This was granted by Mr Justice Underhill and the removal directions in place for the same evening were cancelled. In his subsequent order of 15 January 2007, Mr Justice Underhill stated:', '“I considered the Secretary of State’s careful letter [of 10 January 2007] and am mindful of the fact that [the applicant] has had a previous application for judicial review dismissed. But in my view it is sufficiently arguable that the recent further deterioration in the situation in Sri Lanka may justify a fresh claim to make it just for removal to be deferred until this issue can be properly considered. I note in particular para. 34 (a) of the recent UNHCR report [which contained the UNHCR’s recommendations in respect of Tamils from the north or east – see paragraphs 65 – 68 below]. I am aware that there are other pending applications for permission to apply for judicial review raising the same issue.”', '17. On 14 February 2007 Mrs Justice Black refused the applicant’s application for permission to seek judicial review of the Secretary of State’s alleged failure to consider and determine the new representations made on 9 January 2007. She stated:', '“In fact [the Secretary of State] did consider the further representations and, in a letter of 10 January 2007, refused to treat them as a fresh claim. Strictly speaking that disposes of the proposed [judicial review] application.', 'However, it is clear that the claimant seeks in fact to advance a more fundamental challenge to the removal directions on the basis that the situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated since the matter was last considered and has reached a point where the claimant would be at risk on return. Reliance is placed on a UNHCR document dated 22 December 2006 setting out the dangerous situation in Sri Lanka...Underhill J granted an injunction prohibiting removal on 15 January 2007, apparently referring to the deterioration in the situation in Sri Lanka and particularly para 34(a) of the UNHCR report. It is understandable why he took this view.', 'However, now that some detail of the claimant’s immigration history is available, it does not appear that he had advanced anything significantly different in the letter of 9 January 2007 from that which was considered when representations were made on his behalf in March 2006 and in particular during the JR proceedings that concluded with an oral permission hearing on 18 August 2006. There is material in the January 2007 letter in addition to the UNHCR report which is later but there is also material that in fact relates to the first half of 2006...Whilst I note with anxiety para 34(a) of the UNHCR report as Mr Justice Underhill did (and the contents of that report generally), in the light of the reasoning concerning this particular claimant who has been assessed by the adjudicator as not of interest to the authorities, the material does not amount to sufficient in my view to justify granted permission to commence a judicial review of the decision of 10 January 2007.', 'The injunction granted by Underhill J will, however, be continued until either the time for renewal orally has expired without such an application being made or determination of the oral permission hearing if there is one.”', '18. The applicant then sought to renew his application for permission to apply for judicial review, submitting detailed amended grounds for his application on 21 February 2007. The oral hearing of the renewed application was listed for 17 May 2007 but the applicant, appearing in person at the hearing, withdrew his application.', '19. In a subsequent letter of 5 November 2007 from the applicant’s solicitors at the time of the judicial review proceedings to his current representatives before this Court, the former stated that the reason the judicial review application was withdrawn was that they, the solicitors, were without instructions from the applicant. They were informed by counsel that this was a “pre-LP” case (see paragraphs 30–46 below) and counsel felt that there were insufficient merits in the case to proceed to the oral hearing.', '20. The Secretary of State issued the applicant with removal directions to Sri Lanka for 25 June 2007. On that date the President of the Chamber decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and indicated to the Government of the United Kingdom that the applicant should not be expelled until further notice (see paragraph 5 above).', '21. In 2007, the Court received an increasing number of requests for interim measures from Tamils who were being returned to Sri Lanka from the United Kingdom and other Contracting States. By October 2007, the President of the Chamber had applied Rule 39 in twenty-two cases where Tamils sought to prevent their removal to Sri Lanka from the United Kingdom. On 23 October 2007, the Section Registrar wrote to the Government Agent, noting the increasing number of such Rule 39 applications. Having regard to the security situation in Sri Lanka, he further noted that Rule 39 had been applied on each occasion an interim measure had been requested by an ethnic Tamil. The letter continued:', '“The Acting President has consulted the Judges of the Section about his concerns including as regards the strain which the processing of numerous Rule 39 applications places on judicial time and resources. The Court has concluded that, pending the adoption of a lead judgment in one or more of the applications already communicated, Rule 39 should continue to be applied in any case brought by a Tamil seeking to prevent his removal.', 'The Section has also expressed the hope that, rather than the Acting President being required to apply Rule 39 in each individual case, your Government will assist the Court by refraining for the time being from issuing removal directions in respect of Tamils who claim that their return to Sri Lanka might expose them to the risk of treatment in violation of the Convention.”', 'In his reply of 31 October 2007, the Agent set out the conclusions of the Home Office’s Operational Guidance Note of 9 March 2007 on Sri Lanka and the findings of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in LP. He concluded that in light of this information, the Government did not consider that the current situation in Sri Lanka warranted the suspension of removals of all Tamils who claimed that their return would expose them to a risk of ill-treatment. Each case had to be assessed on its merits against the available evidence. The Government was accordingly not in a position to assist the Court by refraining from issuing removal directions in all such cases on a voluntary basis. Finally, he stated that the Government would continue to make every effort to comply with any Rule 39 indications made by the Court in accordance with their obligations under the Convention and their long-standing practice. However, in the circumstances, the Government suggested that the difficulties posed by the increasing numbers of Rule 39 requests by Tamils could best be addressed through the adoption of a lead judgment by the Court. The Government stood ready to co-operate with the Court to bring such a case to an early conclusion.', '22. The Court has since applied Rule 39 in respect of three hundred and forty-two Tamil applicants who claim that their return to Sri Lanka from the United Kingdom would expose them to ill-treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.', '23. Sections 1(4) and 3(2) of the Immigration Act 1971 provide for the making of Immigration Rules by the Secretary of State. Paragraph 353 of the Immigration Rules (HC 395, as amended by HC 1112) states that:', '“When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim. The submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered. The submissions will only be significantly different if the content:', '(i) had not already been considered; and', '(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection.”', '24. At the material time, the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Commencement No. 4) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2003, when taken with section 101 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and Part IV Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, provided for a right of appeal from an Adjudicator’s determination to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. An appeal had to be on a point of law and the permission of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal was required.', '25. At present, by section 94(2) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, when a person has made either an asylum claim or a human rights claim, or both, an appeal may not be brought while the person is in the United Kingdom if the Secretary of State certifies that the claim or claims are clearly unfounded. Under section 94(3), if the Secretary of State is satisfied that a claimant is entitled to reside in any of the States listed in the section 94(4), he shall certify the claim under subsection (2) unless satisfied that it is not clearly unfounded. Section 94(4) provides such a list of States and subsection (5) gives the Secretary of State the power to add a State, or part of a State, to the list in subsection (4) if satisfied that: there is in general in that State or part no serious risk of persecution of persons entitled to reside in that State or part; and removal to that State or part of persons entitled to reside there will not in general contravene the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Convention. Subsection (6) gives him the power to remove States from the list.', '26. Sri Lanka was added to the list by the Asylum (Designated States) (No. 2) Order 2003 (Statutory Instrument 2003/1919) which entered into force on 22 July 2003. It was removed from the list by the Asylum (Designated States) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2006 which entered into force on 13 December 2006. Paragraph 7.4 of the Explanatory Memorandum to the order cites the latest available information about the situation in Sri Lanka and in particular the deterioration in conditions as one of the factors for the Secretary of State’s decision to remove it from the list.', '27. Section 2 of the Human Rights Act 1998 provides that, in determining any question that arises in connection with a Convention right, courts and tribunals must take into account any case-law from this Court so far as, in the opinion of the court or tribunal, it is relevant to the proceedings in which that question has arisen. Section 6(1) provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right.', '28. Judicial review in England and Wales is regulated by Part 54 of the Civil Procedure Rules. Rule 54.1(2) defines a claim for judicial review as a claim to review the lawfulness of an enactment or a decision, action or failure to act in relation to the exercise of a public function. An application for judicial review has two stages. The first is an application for permission to apply for judicial review; the second, if permission is granted, is a substantive application for judicial review. Where permission is refused without a hearing, under Rule 54.12(3) and (4) the claimant may not appeal but may within seven days request the decision to be reconsidered at a hearing. Rule 52.15 provides that where permission to apply for judicial review has been refused at a hearing in the High Court, the person seeking that permission may within seven days apply to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal.', '29. Appeals from decisions of the Secretary of State in asylum, immigration and nationality matters are now heard by the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (“the AIT”), which replaces the former system of Adjudicators and the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Paragraph 18 of the Practice Directions governing the operation of the AIT defines country guidance determinations of the AIT as follows:', '“18.2 A reported determination of the [AIT] or of the IAT [the former Immigration Appeal Tribunal] bearing the letters “CG” shall be treated as an authoritative finding on the country guidance issue identified in the determination, based upon the evidence before the members of the [AIT] or the IAT that determined the appeal. As a result, unless it has been expressly superseded or replaced by any later “CG” determination, or is inconsistent with other authority that is binding on the [AIT], such a country guidance case is authoritative in any subsequent appeal, so far as that appeal:', '(a) relates to the country guidance issue in question; and', '(b) depends upon the same or similar evidence.', '...', '18.4 Because of the principle that like cases should be treated in like manner, any failure to follow a clear, apparently applicable country guidance case or to show why it does not apply to the case in question is likely to be regarded as grounds for review or appeal on a point of law.”', '30. In the above country guidance determination promulgated on 6 August 2007, the AIT considered the case of a Tamil, LP, from Jaffna in the north of Sri Lanka. He had experienced problems with the LTTE and the Sri Lankan authorities and fled Sri Lanka on 29 December 1999 but had been refused asylum in the United Kingdom by the Secretary of State. Since the case had been identified as a country guidance determination, the AIT heard evidence from a number of experts on the situation in Sri Lanka and the treatment of Tamils there. It also considered the UNCHR Position Paper (see paragraphs 65–68 below) and considered evidence on the Sri Lankan authorities’ treatment of returned failed asylum seekers at Colombo airport, including a series of letters from the British High Commission in Colombo and a report of the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board (see paragraphs 60–63 and 74 below). In dismissing LP’s appeal on asylum grounds but allowing it on the basis of Article 3 of the Convention, the AIT gave the following guidance in the headnote to its determination:', '“(1) Tamils are not per se at risk of serious harm from the Sri Lankan authorities in Colombo. A number of factors may increase the risk, including but not limited to: a previous record as a suspected or actual LTTE member; a previous criminal record and/or outstanding arrest warrant; bail jumping and/or escaping from custody; having signed a confession or similar document; having been asked by the security forces to become an informer; the presence of scarring; return from London or other centre of LTTE fundraising; illegal departure from Sri Lanka; lack of an ID card or other documentation; having made an asylum claim abroad; having relatives in the LTTE. In every case, those factors and the weight to be ascribed to them, individually and cumulatively, must be considered in the light of the facts of each case but they are not intended to be a check list.', '(2) If a person is actively wanted by the police and/or named on a Watched or Wanted list held at Colombo airport, they may be at risk of detention at the airport.', '(3) Otherwise, the majority of returning failed asylum seekers are processed relatively quickly and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment.', '(4) Tamils in Colombo are at increased risk of being stopped at checkpoints, in a cordon and search operation, or of being the subject of a raid on a Lodge where they are staying. In general, the risk again is no more than harassment and should not cause any lasting difficulty, but Tamils who have recently returned to Sri Lanka and have not yet renewed their Sri Lankan identity documents will be subject to more investigation and the factors listed above may then come into play.', '(5) Returning Tamils should be able to establish the fact of their recent return during the short period necessary for new identity documents to be procured.', '(6) A person who cannot establish that he is at real risk of persecution in his home area is not a refugee; but his appeal may succeed under article 3 of the ECHR, or he may be entitled to humanitarian protection if he can establish he would be at risk in the part of the country to which he will be returned.', '(7) The weight to be given to expert evidence (individual or country) and country background evidence is dependent upon the quality of the raw data from which it is drawn and the quality of the filtering process to which that data has been subjected. Sources should be given whenever possible.', '(8) The determinations about Sri Lanka listed in para 229 [of the determination – see below] are replaced as country guidance by this determination. They continue to be reported cases.”', '31. In its consideration of the expert evidence before it, the AIT heard argument on the correct approach to the UNHCR Position Paper (see paragraphs 65 – 68 below). It stated that:', '“203. The UNHCR report was very topical and up to date. We agree with the general submission made by [counsel for the Secretary of State] that the protection agenda of the UNHCR is a wider one than the mere assessment of refugee or subsidiary protection status. However, these reports are prepared by persons with direct experience of the core issues involved and thus we accord them substantive weight in this case.”', '32. The AIT then considered each of the twelve risk factors that had been identified by the appellant, LP, and which it had summarised in its headnote. In respect of Tamil ethnicity, the AIT recalled that Tamils comprised more than 10 percent of the population of Colombo, which called for caution when assessing risk in Sri Lanka, especially Colombo. There was a need for knowledge of where applicants came from in Sri Lanka and their involvement or lack of it with Tamil organisations, whether voluntary, involuntary or otherwise. It found that there were different risk profiles for sub-groups of those with Tamil ethnicity (Sri Lankan Tamils coming from the north or east compared with “Indian”, “Plantation” or “Hill” Tamils). Age and gender had to be taken into account and young male Tamils in Sri Lanka, particularly in Colombo, were at a relatively higher level of risk. There was a higher propensity on the part of the Sri Lanka authorities to target young men and women from the north and the east in a period of virtual civil war.', '33. In respect of a previous record as a suspected or actual LTTE member or supporter, it was of vital importance to establish an applicant’s profile and the credibility of his background in some depth. If he or she was not credible as to his claim to come from the north or east, which left a situation where he could be a Tamil from Colombo with little or no involvement with the LTTE, there could be little risk.', '34. A previous criminal record and/or arrest warrant was, in the AIT’s view, a significant factor that needed to be taken into account in the assessment of the totality of the risk but did not mean, of itself, that the applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution or other significant harm on return to Sri Lanka for that reason alone. The issue was to establish the credibility of the criminal record, or an arrest warrant, and decide whether it was reasonably likely to exist in respect of the applicant.', '35. Those who had jumped bail or absconded from police custody, the AIT noted:', '“We agree with the logic that those who have been released after going to court and released from custody on formal bail are reasonably likely, on the evidence, to be not only recorded on the police records as bail jumpers but obviously on the court records as well. Thus we would identify those in the situation such as this appellant who have been found to have been to court in Colombo, and subsequently released on formal bail, as having a profile that could place them at a higher level of risk of being identified from police computers at the airport. Their treatment thereafter will of course depend upon the basis that they were detained in the first place. It is important to note that we did not have before us any information as to the treatment of bail jumpers from the ordinary criminal justice system, and there may be many of them, when they again come to the attention of the authorities, be they Tamil or Singhalese. We had no evidence that Tamil bail jumpers are treated differently from Singhalese ones. Clearly punishment for jumping bail will not make someone a refugee. As we have said, the risk of detention and maltreatment will depend on the profile of the individual applicant.”', 'For those who had not been brought to court and had possibly been released from detention after payment of a bribe, much would depend on the evidence relating to the formality of the detention. If the detention was informal and there were no records of a bribe, the risk level would be likely to be below that of a real risk. On this risk factor, the AIT concluded:', '“While we would agree that there may well be situations where Tamils, with little or no profile related to the LTTE, or other ‘terrorist’ groups, could be briefly detained and harassed, as no doubt happens in round ups in Colombo and elsewhere, we consider it illogical to assume that an escapee, from Sri Lankan government detention, or a bail jumper from the Sri Lankan court system, would be merely ‘harassed’ given the climate of torture with impunity that is repeatedly confirmed as existent in the background material from all sources. We consider, (as we think it does in the appellant’s particular case), that the totality of the evidence may point to a real risk, in some cases, of persecution or really serious harm when a recorded escapee or bail jumper is discovered, on return to Sri Lanka.”', '36. When an applicant had signed a confession, this could be a significant risk factor and the AIT noted expert evidence to the effect that many Tamils were released after signing statements made in Sinhala that they often did not understand. The factor had to be considered in the totality of the risk. Equally, when an applicant had refused requests by the security services to become an informer against the LTTE, there was a higher risk that they would be assumed to be a collaborator of the LTTE but such evidence had to be taken into account with the totality of the evidence and merely establishing that an applicant had refused to become an informer would not be in every case the basis for a valid asylum claim on its own.', '37. On the risk arising from the presence of scarring on an applicant, the AIT stated:', '“217. The background evidence on the issue of scarring has fluctuated. Up until the time of the ceasefire it was generally accepted as something which the Sri Lankan authorities noted and took into account both at the airport and on detention and in strip searches of suspected Tamil LTTE supporters. Their perception that it may indicate training by the LTTE, or participation in active warfare, was self-evident, and simply was ‘good’ policing, as appeared to be suggested by the Inspector General of Police in his discussions with Dr Smith [one of the experts on Sri Lanka from whom the AIT heard evidence]. On the same logic it was also valid to conclude that the impact of scarring was of far less interest during the period 2002 – late 2005 while the ceasefire agreement was having some effective impact. The evidence that was provided in this case, including that from Dr Smith following his discussions with the Inspector General of Police (paragraph 80 of his report), the BHC [British High Commission] letter of 24 August 2006, and the COIR [United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Country of Origin Information Report on Sri Lanka] all indicate that scarring may again be relevant. We agree with the comments in Dr Smith’s report, that the issue of scarring was considered by the police to be a very serious indicator of whether a Tamil might have been involved in the LTTE. However, on the evidence now before us we consider that the scarring issue should be one that only has significance when there are other factors that would bring an applicant to the attention of the authorities, either at the airport or subsequently in Colombo, such as being wanted on an outstanding arrest warrant or a lack of identity. We therefore agree with the COIR remarks that it may be a relevant, but not an overriding, factor. Thus, whilst the presence of scarring may promote interest in a young Tamil under investigation by the Sri Lankan authorities, we do not consider that, merely because a young Tamil has scars, he will automatically be ill-treated in detention.”', '38. In respect of the risk arising from return from London or another centre of LTTE activity or fund-raising, the AIT heard evidence from the Metropolitan Police on LTTE activities and fund-raising in London. It concluded that this factor was highly case-specific and any applicant would need to show the extent to which the Sri Lankan High Commission in the United Kingdom was aware of his activities and was thus likely to have passed the information on to Colombo when the applicant was being deported or removed.', '39. Illegal departure from Sri Lanka did not of necessity establish a well founded fear of persecution or serious harm, although in the “heightened level of insecurity” in Sri Lanka it would add to the risk profile. Similarly, given the number of “cordon and search” operations by the Sri Lankan Government, the lack of a valid identity card could contribute towards an increased level of risk. In the AIT’s view, it had to be coupled with other risk factors for those of Tamil ethnicity but it was a contributing factor. An applicant would need to show why he would be at continuing risk and that he could not reasonably be expected to obtain a new identity card.', '40. In respect of the risk factor of having made an asylum claim abroad, the AIT relied, inter alia, on a letter dated 24 August 2006 from the British High Commission in Colombo (see also paragraphs 60–63 below) which had stated that lists of failed asylum seekers could form part of search operations in Colombo (at paragraphs 65 and 221 of the determination). The AIT found that it was a reasonable inference that application forms for replacement passports and travel documents might alert the Sri Lankan High Commission in London and that information could be passed on. However, the AIT did not consider having made a failed asylum claim abroad to be an issue that alone would place a returnee at real risk on return. It would be a contributing factor that would need other, perhaps more compelling factors before a real risk could be established.', '41. The AIT considered that the fact of having relatives in the LTTE was a logical factor but needed to be taking into account with the totality of other evidence and the profile of other family members. On its own, without established and credible evidence of the details of the other family members and their known role or involvement with the LTTE, it would be of limited weight. When assessing those who have relatives who were members of the LTTE, it was not only important to consider the relationship, and the involvement of the relative but whether, and to what extent, knowledge of the relative’s activities were likely to have been known to the security forces in Sri Lanka. This would vary depending on the relative’s profile and whether or not he or she had been previously detained. The question of how the authorities would know that an individual was so related might also be of concern.', '42. In its conclusion on the risk profile for Tamils, the AIT stated:', '“227. Our assessment of the various risk factors above has highlighted that each case must be determined on its own facts. It may be that in some credible cases one of these individual risk factors on its own will establish a real risk of persecution or serious harm on return by the Sri Lankan authorities for Sri Lankan Tamils who are failed asylum seekers from the United Kingdom. For those with a lower profile, assessed on one or a combination of the risk factors we have noted however, such as this appellant, their specific profiles must be assessed in each situation and set against the above non-exhaustive and non-conclusive, set of risk factors and the volatile country situation. As can be noted, several factors, such as being subject to an outstanding arrest warrant, or a proven bail jumper from a formal bail hearing may establish a much higher level of propensity to risk than various other factors. In this situation therefore, the assessment exercise is a much larger and more detailed one than may have been the situation up to 2002 and certainly during the period of the cease fire agreement (‘CFA’). The current worsening situation in Sri Lanka requires serious consideration of all of the above factors, a review of up to date country of origin information set against the very carefully assessed profile of the appellant.”', '43. In addressing the general situation in Sri Lanka at the time and the possible of relocation of Tamils from the north or east to Colombo, the AIT stated:', '“232. It has been accepted during the course of this determination that the general security situation in Sri Lanka has deteriorated following the effective breakdown of the ceasefire and the increase in terrorist activity by the LTTE. That has resulted in increased vigilance on the part of the Sri Lankan authorities and with it a greater scope for human rights abuses and persecution.', '233. When assessing the risk to an individual it should be borne in mind that much of the background material about Sri Lanka, and the increase in violent activity, relates to the north and east. There are particular problems in the east because of the defection of the Karuna faction from LTTE ranks. This determination does not suggest that it would in every case be unsafe to expect a returning Tamil to return to his or her home area in the north or the east. Rather it looks at the position in Colombo whether that be for a Tamil who was from Colombo in the first place, or a person who could relocate there.', '234. Tamils make up over 10% of the population of Colombo. Despite evidence of some forms of discrimination, the evidence does not show they face serious hardships merely because they are Tamils. As a result, other considerations apart and subject to individual assessment of each applicant’s specific case, it cannot be argued that, even if he faces serious harm in his home area, as a general presumption it is unduly harsh to expect a Tamil to relocate to Colombo, or that it would be a breach of Article 3 to expect him or her to do so, or that doing so would put him or her at real risk of serious harm entitling them to humanitarian protection.”', '44. Having reiterated that the list of factors was “not a checklist nor is it intended to be exhaustive” and that the factors should be considered individually and cumulatively (at paragraph 238 of the determination), the Tribunal again summarised the factors it had considered. It had heard evidence on procedures at Colombo airport, including the series of letters from the British High Commission in Colombo (see paragraphs 60–63 below), and the counsel for the Secretary of State had acknowledged there was no dispute that records were kept at the airport and that interviews were conducted there (at paragraph 159 of the determination). In its summary of its conclusions, the AIT therefore added:', '“239. When examining the risk factors it is of course necessary to also consider the likelihood of an appellant being either apprehended at the airport or subsequently within Colombo. We have referred earlier to the Wanted and Watched lists held at the airport and concluded that those who are actively wanted by the police or who are on a watch list for a significant offence may be at risk of being detained at the airport. Otherwise the strong preponderance of the evidence is that the majority of returning failed asylum seekers are processed relatively quickly and with no difficulty beyond some possible harassment.”', '45. On the facts of LP’s case, the AIT noted that his credibility had been accepted, in particular that he was a “bail-jumper” from court-directed bail in Colombo and that on return to Colombo airport he would have been at real risk of being investigated. That investigation by the Sri Lankan authorities would lead, in LP’s particular circumstances, to the real risk of his being seriously maltreated while in detention and thus the AIT allowed his appeal on Article 3 grounds.', '46. In its previous determination in PT (Risk –bribery – release) Sri Lanka CG [2002] UKIAT 03444, the AIT had held first that paying a bribe did not itself amount to an assisted escape from custody which would make the applicant of interest to the authorities. Second, it had held that scarring was a factor that should not be assessed in isolation but in light of the general security situation and the processing of returnees at Colombo airport. The AIT in LP confirmed both these rulings.', '47. In PS the Immigration Appeal Tribunal, allowed an appeal by the Secretary of State against the decision of the Adjudicator who had found that the respondent, a Sri Lankan Tamil from western Sri Lanka, would be at risk from the LTTE if returned and that there would not be sufficient protection by the Sri Lankan authorities. He and his cousin had been coerced by the LTTE into transporting goods by sea for them and arrested and interrogated under torture by the Sri Lankan navy. He had told them where the goods were and was released after payment of a bribe. The LTTE sought the applicant and his cousin and killed his cousin. The respondent was again arrested on suspicion of LTTE involvement and again released after paying a bribe, at which point he fled to the United Kingdom. It was accepted on appeal that given the ceasefire in place at the material time, there was no risk to the respondent from the Sri Lankan authorities. As to the risk to him from the LTTE and the sufficiency of protection offered by the Sri Lankan authorities, IAT found that he could safely and reasonably relocate from his home area of Puttalam, western Sri Lanka to Colombo. The IAT stated:', '“71. As we have already observed, those whom the LTTE has on the objective evidence targeted in Colombo since the ceasefire have all been high profile opposition activists, or those whom they would see are renegades or traitors to the LTTE. Whether it could be successfully argued that even those of so high a profile would not be provided with a sufficiency of protection in Colombo in the Horvath sense [Horvath v. the Secretary of State for the Home Department – see paragraph 49 below], may be doubted, but what seems to us quite clear on the background evidence is that there is no arguable basis for saying that the Sri Lankan state does not provide a sufficiency of protection to the generality of Tamils having a localised fear of the LTTE in their home area who do not reach a similar high profile.', '...', '73. We cannot, of course, say that the safety of the respondent is guaranteed if he is now returned to Sri Lanka, but there is simply no objective evidence to support a claim that ethnic Tamils with his characteristics are in fact currently at risk from the LTTE in Colombo, or that, if they are, it is a risk in respect of which the Sri Lankan state does not provide a sufficiency of protection applying the ratio in Horvath.”', '48. In this country guidance determination, the AIT considered, inter alia, the correct approach to reports by the UNHCR. It observed:', '“108. The extensive reliance upon UNHCR material makes a few observations germane. The value of the UNHCR material is first that where it has observers on the ground, it is in a good position to provide first hand information as to what in fact is happening. The process then whereby its observations of what is happening become position papers or recommendations is likely to increase the objectivity and soundness of its observations in that respect. It has a special role in relation to the Geneva Convention.', '...', '109. But their comments have their limitations and these need equally to be understood. The UNHCR often speaks of inhibitions on the return, usually forced, of failed asylum seekers, who have been rejected after a proper consideration of their claims. It follows that the UNHCR is not then commenting on the return of refugees at all; it is acknowledging that they would not face persecution for a Convention reason and it is going beyond its special remit under the Geneva Convention. This is not a question of picking up on loose language. The UNHCR is perfectly capable of using language which shows that it is or is not dealing with the risk of persecution for a Convention reason, and sometimes does so. These are considered papers after all.', '...', '112. But the assessment of whether someone can be returned in those circumstances is one which has to be treated with real care, if it is sought to apply it to non Refugee Convention international obligations, especially ECHR. The measure which the UNHCR uses is unclear; indeed, realistically, it may be using no particular measure. Instead, it is using its own language to convey its own sense of the severity of the problem, the degree of risk faced and the quality of the evidence which it has to underpin its assessment. It is often guarded and cautious rather than assertive because of the frailties of its knowledge and the variability of the circumstances.', '113. This is not to advocate an unduly nuanced reading of its material, let alone an unduly legalistic reading. It is to require that the material be read for what it actually conveys about the level of risk, of what treatment and of what severity and with what certainty as to the available evidence. But there may be times when a lack of information or evidence permits or requires inferences to be drawn as to its significance, which is for the decision-maker to draw. There is often other relevant material as well.', '114. UNHCR’s language is not framed by reference to the ECHR and to the high threshold of Article 3 as elaborated in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg Court and of the United Kingdom. That is not a criticism – it is not an expert legal adviser to the United Kingdom courts and couches its papers in its own language. So its more general humanitarian assessments of international protection needs should be read with care, so as to avoid giving them an authority in relation to the United Kingdom’s obligations under the ECHR which they do not claim. They may give part of the picture, but the language and threshold of their assessments show that the UNHCR quite often adopts a standard which is not that of the United Kingdom’s ECHR obligations.', '115. UNHCR papers are often not the only ones which Adjudicators or the Tribunal has to consider. Other organisations may have first-hand sources and differ from UNHCR; experts may bring a further perspective. A considered UNHCR paper is therefore entitled to weight but may well not be decisive.”', '49. In this case, the House of Lords considered the asylum claim of a Roma citizen of Slovakia on the ground, among others, that he feared persecution in Slovakia by “skinheads”, against whom the Slovak police failed to provide adequate protection for Roma. In dismissing the applicant’s appeal, the House of Lords held that in determining whether there was sufficient protection against persecution in the person’s country of origin it was sufficient that there was in that country a system of criminal law which made violent attacks by the persecutors punishable and a reasonable willingness to enforce that law on the part of the law enforcement agencies.', '50. Applications for permission to apply for judicial review were lodged by five Sri Lankan Tamils who sought to challenge the Secretary of State’s decision either to reject representations made by them as not amounting to a fresh asylum claim or, in one case, to certify that his claim was clearly unfounded (see paragraph 25 above). The applications were considered in the High Court by Mr Justice Collins on 12 November 2007 in the light of the exchange of letters between the Section Registrar and Agent of the Government set out at paragraph 21 above. He adjourned one application, granted permission in two cases and refused permission in the remaining two. Before considering the merits of the individual cases before him, Mr Justice Collins considered the risk factors set out by the AIT in LP. He stated:', '“10. Although those have been described as risk factors, they obviously vary in their significance. For example, Tamil ethnicity is obviously a highly relevant consideration, since the LTTE is a Tamil organisation and the battle is by the LTTE on behalf of the Tamils who seek specific objectives as Tamils. However, Tamil ethnicity by itself does not create a real risk of ill-treatment. Accordingly, some of these so-called risk factors are in reality, as it seems to me, background (as it has been described) factors; that is to say they do not in themselves indicate a real risk, but they are matters which, if there is a factor which does give rise to a real risk that the individual will be suspected of involvement in the LTTE, adds to the significance of that. Thus Tamil ethnicity, return from London, illegal departure from Sri Lanka, lack of ID card or other documentation (unless it is such a lack beyond the period that the individual would be expected to take to obtain an ID card after return) and having made an asylum claim abroad, all are no doubt factors which may be held against an individual, but none of them, as far as I can see in themselves, or even cumulatively, would create a real risk. However, it is obvious that a previous record as a suspected or actual member or supporter, provided that it was at a level which would mean that the authorities would retain an interest would be likely to create a risk. I say that because it was made clear in LP itself that an individual who had a past low-level involvement which might have led to some detention, would not necessarily be regarded as a real risk so far as ill-treatment was concerned, although clearly the circumstances of the previous record might point in a different direction. A previous criminal record and an outstanding arrest warrant clearly are highly material and clearly capable, I would have thought, of producing a real risk.', '11. Bail jumping and/or escaping from custody, again on the face of it are highly material. But it depends, as the Tribunal [the AIT] itself indicated, on what is covered by escaping from custody. Frequently custody was brought to an end by the payment of a bribe. That is commonplace (or was commonplace, perhaps still is) in the Sri Lankan situation. Generally release on the payment of a bribe without more would not indicate that there was an ongoing risk because the release would be likely to be recorded as a release because there was nothing further to be held against the individual. It is hardly likely that whoever took the bribe would stick his neck out by effectively admitting that there should not have been a release but for the bribe, although it might of course be different if there had been a release on formal bail. Police have the power to grant bail, but it can be done, it was said, either formally or informally. Frequently perhaps what is talked of as release on bail is no more than release by the police officer in question with some conditions apparently attached. Again one would have to look at the individual circumstances to see whether the nature of the release was such as to lead to a risk that he would still be regarded as someone under suspicion.', '12. A signed confession or similar document obviously would be an important consideration.', '13. Having been asked by the security forces to become an informer can be of some importance. It might indicate that the individual was regarded as someone who was indeed involved in the LTTE but was prepared, to save his own skin or for whatever reason, to provide information to the authorities. What would happen on occasions – and indeed one of the cases, as I shall indicate, contained this element – was that the release was on the basis that he would be an informant but in fact he did not carry out his side of the bargain, if that is the right way of putting it. The suggestion is that that failure would mean that he was likely to be recorded as someone who would arouse suspicion.', '14. The Tribunal indicated that the presence of scarring in itself would not necessarily produce a real risk, but is something that would be added to and confirmatory of another factor which did give rise to a risk. It was generally speaking to be regarded as a confirmatory rather than a free-standing risk element.', '15. Finally having relatives in the LTTE is something that one can well understand might produce suspicion.', '16. The test therefore, as I see it, is whether there are factors in an individual case, one or more, which might indicate that authorities would regard the individual as someone who may well have been involved with the LTTE in a sufficiently significant fashion to warrant his detention or interrogation. If interrogation and detention are likely, then, in the context of the approach of the authorities in Sri Lanka, torture would be a real risk and thus a breach of Article 3 might occur. It is plain from LP and it is clear overall that a blanket ban on return to Sri Lanka simply because an individual is a Tamil cannot be supported. If the European Court is approaching it in that way, then in my view it should not be and it is not in accordance with what is required by the Convention.', '17. The authorities in this country, the courts and the Tribunal, give very careful consideration to whether it is indeed appropriate to accept that a return of a Tamil to Sri Lanka can be made because there is no real risk that he will suffer any form of relevant ill-treatment. This country has not accepted the blanket approach which is advocated to an extent by the UNHCR, albeit there is no question but that its factual conclusions on matters where investigations have been carried out should be given weight.”', '51. Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 (on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted) has the objective, inter alia, of ensuring EU Member States apply common criteria for the identification of persons genuinely in need of international protection (recital six of the preamble). In addition to regulating refugee status, it makes provision for granting subsidiary protection status. Article 2(e) defines a person eligible for subsidiary protection status as someone who would face a real risk of suffering serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. Serious harm is defined in Article 15 as consisting of: (a) death penalty or execution; (b) torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of an applicant in the country of origin; or (c) serious and individual threat to a civilian’s life or person by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.', '52. On 17 October 2007, the Dutch Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), when considering the case of M. and N. Elgafaji v. Staatssecretaris van Justitie (the Deputy Minister of Justice), lodged a reference for a preliminary ruling with the Court of Justice of the European Communities asking, inter alia, whether Article 15(c) of the Directive offered supplementary or other protection to Article 3 of the Convention.', '53. Sri Lanka secured independence from the United Kingdom in 1948. Demographical information varies but its population is approximately 19.9 million. The majority are Sinhalese (73.8–82 per cent). Significant minorities include Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims, 7.2–7.9 per cent); Indian Tamils (4.6–5.1 per cent); and Sri Lankan Tamils (3.9–4.3 per cent). The majority of Tamils live in the north and east of the country but a significant minority live outside those regions. Colombo has a population of approximately 2.25 million and approximately 248,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and 25,000 Indian Tamils live there (see United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Country of Origin Information Report on Sri Lanka, 3 March 2008 (“the March 2008 COI Report”), at paragraphs 1.03, 3.01, 20.11, and 20.14 with further references).', '54. The internal conflict in Sri Lanka began over twenty years ago and has continued intermittently ever since. The conflict is largely between the LTTE, who seek independence for Tamils, and Government forces. A ceasefire was signed between the Government and the LTTE in February 2002 and a peace process started. In 2004, after divisions appeared with the LTTE, the ceasefire came under increasing pressure. The most serious threat to the peace process was the assassination in August 2005 of Lakshman Kadirgamar, the Sri Lankan Minister of Foreign Affairs, after which violence in the country escalated and there were renewed clashes between Government forces and the LTTE (see the March 2008 COI Report at paragraphs 3.13–3.42 with further references).', '55. Mr Kadirgamar’s assassination prompted the Sri Lankan Government to declare a state of emergency and introduce Emergency Regulations which gave the Government, the armed forces and law enforcement agencies broad counter-terrorism powers, including special powers of arrest and detention up to one year (see the March 2008 COI report at paragraphs 8.15–8.23 and 12.01–12.12 with further references). The regulations are reinforced by further such powers provided for in the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which was reinstated in December 2006 (see, inter alia, BBC News website story of 6 December 2006 and the 2006 United States of America Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, quoted at paragraphs 3.26 and 8.15 of the COI Report respectively). Young Tamil men who are suspected of being LTTE members or supporters appear to be the primary target of arrests (see, inter alia, paragraph 3.7.18 of the United Kingdom Border and Immigration Agency Operational Guidance Note on Sri Lanka, set out at paragraph 58 below). The Emergency Regulations have been regularly extended, most recently on 6 February 2008 (see the same report at p. 10).', '56. On 3 January 2008, the Government gave notice of their intention to withdraw from the ceasefire agreement. The withdrawal took effect on 16 January 2008 (the March 2008 COI Report at paragraphs 4.08 et seq.).', '57. Operational guidance notes (OGN) are prepared by the Border and Immigration Agency of the Home Office. They provide a brief summary of the general, political and human rights situation in the country and describe common types of claim. They aim to provide clear guidance on whether the main types of claim are likely to justify the grant of asylum, humanitarian protection or discretionary leave.', '58. The OGN on Sri Lanka of 5 November 2007 (which updated and replaced the previous note of 9 March 2007, the conclusions of which were virtually identical) contained the following conclusions on the main kinds of asylum, human rights and humanitarian protection claims made by those entitled to reside in Sri Lanka:', '“[At. 3.6.19 on claims made by those fearing reprisals from the LTTE] We do not accept UNHCR’s position that there is no internal flight alternative for individuals fleeing targeted violence and human rights abuses by the LTTE due to difficulties in travel because of the reinstatement of checkpoints and because of the inability of the authorities to provide ‘assured protection’ given the reach of the LTTE. UNHCR’s reliance on the concept of ‘assured protection’ is not a fundamental requirement of the Refugee Convention. In referring to ‘assured protection’, UNHCR are using a higher standard than the sufficiency of protection standard required by the Refugee Convention...Moreover, asylum and human rights claims are not decided on the basis of a general approach, they are based on the circumstances of the particular individual and the specific risk to that individual. It is important that case owners give individual consideration to whether the applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution for a convention reason or are otherwise vulnerable that they may engage our obligations under the ECHR. Applicants who fear persecution at the hands of the LTTE in LTTE dominated areas are able to relocate to Colombo, or other Government controlled areas and it would not normally be found to be unduly harsh for claimants to relocate in this way. Similarly, the Government is willing to offer to protection to [sic] those who have relocated from LTTE controlled areas and who still fear reprisals from the LTTE.', '...', '[At 3.7.18 on claims made by those fearing persecution by the Sri Lankan authorities] Following the announcement of the cease-fire in February 2002, the Sri Lankan authorities de-proscribed the LTTE and suspended arrests made under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA). The emergency regulations imposed in August 2005 which continue to be in place allow for the arrest of individuals by members of the armed forces and those detained may be held for up to one year. Young Tamil men who are suspected of being LTTE members or supporters appear to be the primary target of arrests.', 'However, most are reportedly released quickly and it can therefore still be said that generally the authorities in Sri Lanka are not concerned with those individuals with past low-level support for the LTTE. Claims under this category are therefore likely to be clearly unfounded and fall to be certified as such.', '3.7.19 Those individuals who may be of continuing interest to the authorities would be those wanted for serious offences. These cases will be exceptional, and will normally be high-profile members of the LTTE who are still active and influential, and wanted by the authorities. Such individuals may face prosecution on return, although there is no evidence to suggest that they would not be treated fairly and properly under Sri Lankan law. Claims made under this category are therefore not likely to lead to a grant of asylum or Humanitarian Protection but taking into account the continuing interest of the authorities in those of high profile, and the introduction of the emergency regulations such claims cannot be considered to be clearly unfounded.', '...', '3.7.20 There cannot be said to be a general sufficiency of protection available to those applicants who express fear of state officials after having made complaints to the Sri Lankan authorities with regard to, for example, the use of torture. However, internal relocation to LTTE areas may be an option where, in the particular circumstances of the applicant’s case, it is not considered unduly harsh for the victim to exercise this. The grant of asylum or Humanitarian Protection is unlikely therefore to be appropriate where there is an option of internal relocation. Such claims should only be certified as clearly unfounded if internal relocation is clearly an option.”', '59. The OGN also found that with the introduction of the Emergency Regulations in August 2005, round ups and arrests of Tamils in “cordon and search operations” had taken place. Citing a report of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it stated that most of those detained, generally young Tamil males, were taken into custody because they were unable to produce identification or explain the reason for being in a particular area. It also quoted the website “TamilNet” which had reported a number of large scale arrests between May and July 2007 of Tamil civilians in Wellawatte and Colombo city who were taken into custody on account of failure to prove identity or provide reasons for their stay in the location. Finally, the OGN stated that according to a letter dated 11 September 2007 from the British High Commission in Colombo, the operations did appear to target those in casual employment or with temporary accommodation, but whilst a proportion of those detained did end up in longer term detention, most were released quickly (at a paragraph 3.6.11 of the OGN).', '60. The March 2008 COI Report (at paragraphs 32.09 – 32.22), set out a number of extracts from a series of letters from the British High Commission in Colombo, which addressed the treatment of failed asylum seekers. At paragraph 32.09, the COI Report included an excerpt from a High Commission letter of 25 January 2008, which noted:', '“The BHC Risk Assessment Officer has recently visited the headquarters of CID [Criminal Investigations Department] in Colombo, and the ALO [Airline Liaison Officer] works closely with CID at Bandaranaike Airport. Both RAO and ALO recall that they have never seen any CID officers use a computer, and comment that neither their HQ nor airport offices has computers installed. The ALO added that CID officers at the airport record details in a notebook, whilst the RAO stated that officers in Colombo had typewriters on their desks.”', 'The same paragraph of the COI Report noted that in a letter of 24 August 2006, the High Commission had previously reported:', '“The Sri Lankan authorities have a good IT system to track arrivals and departures at the main airport and are able to track, in most cases, whether an individual is in the country or not.”', '61. According to the COI Report (at paragraphs 32.12 and 32.13), in a letter dated 26 September 2005 the High Commission stated:', '“We have spoken to the International Organisation of Migration locally about returns. They say that to their knowledge most returns are detained briefly and then released to their families. Our Airline Liaison Officer has contacted the Canadian, Australian and German Missions here, to ask about their experiences with returns. All of their experiences are similar. In August [2005] a charter plane returned approximately 40 failed asylum seekers from Germany. The Sri Lankan Police (CID) have told us that these were processed by them ‘in a few hours’. In general, the Sri Lankan Immigration Services and CID are informed in advance of the passenger’s arrival. The passenger is handed over to Immigration who briefly interview them and then hand them to CID. In most cases a record is kept by both of the returnees arrival and they are then allowed to proceed. Usually family are at the airport to meet them. In a few cases CID have detained people where there was an existing warrant for their arrest when they left Sri Lanka. DII (Directorate of Internal Intelligence) may also have an interest in these individuals and keep records on them. There is no reason to think that they have any information regarding asylum claims in the UK or elsewhere. There does not appear to be any involvement in the process by the Sri Lankan Army.', '...', 'The role of scarring is extremely difficult to assess, I have not found any detailed reports, but anecdotal evidence is that it can play a part in rousing suspicion. The key issue is not what triggers suspicion, but how suspects are treated. Membership of the LTTE and fundraising for the organisation are no longer criminal offences in Sri Lanka (although they are in the UK) so even if the authorities acted on their suspicion Sri Lankan law gives them limited powers to act. Unarmed members of the LTTE are permitted to operate in government areas under the 2002 ceasefire agreement.”', '62. Paragraphs 32.14 and 32.15 of the COI report then quote the High Commission as stating in its letter of 24 August 2006 that:', '“There is strong anecdotal evidence that scarring has been used in the past to identify suspects. In my own conversations with the police and in the media the authorities have openly referred to physical examinations being used to identify whether suspects have undergone military style training. A UK based member of staff who was present during the processing of two recent returns at Colombo airport on 04/08 and 23/08 [2006] reported however that no such examinations took place, and that the returnees, both ethnic Tamils from the north of Sri Lanka, were able to make onward journeys with little delay. His observations support more recent claims from contacts in government ministries that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently. At the very least it appears to only take place when there is another reason to suspect the individual rather than a routine measure for immigration returnees.', '...', 'Our own experience of the return of failed asylum seekers and the shared information of other missions, particularly the Canadians, and the International Organisation of Migration is quite clear. As we have reported earlier [26 September 2005] the vast majority are questioned for a short period of time to establish identity and possibly on security issues and then released. Normally only when there is an outstanding arrest warrant are individuals detained for longer periods.”', '63. Finally, at paragraphs 32.20–32.22 the COI Report contained excerpts from the letter of 25 January 2008 which read as follows:', '“The Government of Sri Lanka’s decision to abrogate the ceasefire agreement will reduce further the provision [of] information regarding the treatment of returnees. Ceasefire monitors from Norway and the Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission (SLMM) will have no further role and will be unable to provide any information regarding returnees.', '...', 'The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) have advised the High Commission that whilst they monitor the persons who return from the UK under the Voluntary Assisted Return Programme (VARP) for up to 2 years, they do not monitor those who are forcibly returned. I was advised that even amongst the VARP returnees there were 2 cases in the last year where individuals have been arrested and detained. The first was a young Tamil male from Jaffna who was going through a reintegration programme in Colombo. Some 6 months after his return, he was stopped at a police checkpoint and detained, as he could provide no evidence of family in the capital. He was held at Boossa prison for one month before release, but is now back in the reintegration programme. The 2nd case also involved a Tamil male who was in the reintegration programme in Colombo. The circumstances of his arrest were somewhat different in that he had travelled to India on forged documentation and was apprehended by CID on his return to Colombo and detained. It could therefore be argued that there might have indeed been justification for this.', '...', 'IOM have also become involved with returnees who have forcibly been removed from the UK, providing post-arrival assistance. Ostensibly, this is to provide travel assistance to a chosen address. At time of writing IOM had been notified of 32 potential removals under this arrangement, of which they received only 8 returnees. Whilst a majority of the ones that did not arrive undoubtedly earned last minute reprieves in the UK by one means or another, IOM could not be 100% certain that some were not detained on arrival at Colombo Airport. IOM are under instructions not to approach these returnees until they have gone through all of the arrival procedures. FCO Migration Directorate has recently installed a Migration Delivery Officer at the High Commission in Colombo. His role will include liaison between the UK Border & Immigration Agency, the Sri Lankan Department of Immigration & Emigration and IOM, and will assist in the monitoring of such persons following their removal from the UK.”', '64. According to information provided to the Court by the Government, of above thirty-two returns, twenty-two were cancelled for a number of reasons such as judicial review proceedings being lodged, injunctions being granted by the High Court and this Court making indications under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. Eight of the returnees were successfully met outside the airport by IOM. In the remaining two cases, removals were made but the individuals concerned did not make themselves known to the IOM officer on arrival in Colombo. The Government had established that one of the two was in the Netherlands and they continued to make enquiries into the whereabouts of the other individual concerned.', '65. On 22 December 2006, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees published the above paper, observing that there had been several major developments in the country which fundamentally affected the international protection needs of individuals from Sri Lanka who sought, or who had sought, asylum abroad. After surveying the escalation in fighting between Government forces and the LTTE and its impact on the civilian population, the paper turned to the human rights situation. Tamils from the north and east were at risk of targeted violations of their human rights from all parties to the armed conflict, including harassment, intimidation, arrest, detention, torture, abduction and killing at the hands of government forces, the LTTE and paramilitary or armed groups. Where an individual sought to escape from the LTTE, even if they reached government-controlled areas, this did not necessarily mean that he or she would be able to secure the protection of the authorities given the LTTE’s capacity to track down and target its opponents throughout the country. The position paper also considered the human rights situation for Tamils in Colombo and stated:', '“23. Tamils in Colombo and its outskirts, where there are large Tamil communities, are at heightened risk of security checks, arbitrary personal and house to house searches, harassment, restrictions on freedom of movement, and other forms of abuse since the imposition of new security regulations in April and December 2006.', '24. Under emergency regulations, the police are empowered to register all persons within the jurisdiction of each police station. These regulations, which were enacted during the height of the conflict in the 1990s, remain in place and require all residents to register with their local police station. Such registration, which is taking place in Colombo, enables the police to have accurate information on the ethnicity and location of all inhabitants of Colombo.', '25. Tamils in Colombo are especially vulnerable to abductions, disappearances and killings. Such actions are allegedly conducted by the paramilitary ‘white vans’ suspected to be associated with the security forces, as well as by the Karuna faction and the LTTE. According to press reports, some 25 Tamils were abducted in Colombo and its suburbs between 20 August and 2 September 2006, with only two of these people confirmed released. The whereabouts and fate of the rest remain unknown. Young Tamil professionals including several women, businessmen, as well as Tamil political figures and activists with a pro-Tamil stance can be specifically targeted (footnotes omitted).”', '66. The paper also noted that Muslims from the east were also particularly vulnerable to human rights abuses from the parties to the conflict and that Sinhalese from the north and east were vulnerable to the generalised violence there. For the latter, there was protection from generalised violence in government-controlled areas but no protection from the LTTE, if they were targeted by it.', '67. UNHCR recommended that all asylum claims of Tamils from the north or east should be favourably considered. Where individual acts of harassment did not in and of themselves constitute persecution, taken together they could cumulatively amount to a serious violation of human rights and therefore be persecutory. Where an individual did not fulfil the refugee criteria under the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951, a complementary form of protection was to be granted. Tamils from Colombo were to be recognised as refugees if subjected to targeted violations of human rights by the LTTE, the authorities or paramilitary groups. Again, where individual acts of harassment did not in and of themselves constitute persecution, taken together they could cumulatively amount to a serious violation of human rights and therefore be persecutory. A similar recommendation was made for Muslims. For Sinhalese, those who were targets of persecution from the LTTE or other non-state agents should be accorded recognition as refugees.', '68. For those asylum seekers from Sri Lanka whose claims had previously been examined and had been found not to be in need of international protection, the Position Paper recommended a review of their claims in light of the new circumstances it had described.', '69. After her visit to Sri Lanka in October 2007, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, issued a press statement on 13 October 2007 in which she noted:', '“Sri Lanka has many of the elements needed for a strong national protection system. It has ratified most of the international human rights treaties. It has justiciable human rights guarantees in the Constitution. It has longstanding democratic and legal traditions. It has had a national human rights commission for more than a decade. Sri Lanka has an active media and benefits from a committed civil society.', 'However, in the context of the armed conflict and of the emergency measures taken against terrorism, the weakness of the rule of law and prevalence of impunity is alarming. There is a large number of reported killings, abductions and disappearances which remain unresolved. This is particularly worrying in a country that has had a long, traumatic experience of unresolved disappearances and no shortage of recommendations from past Commissions of Inquiry on how to safeguard against such violations. While the Government pointed to several initiatives it has taken to address these issues, there has yet to be an adequate and credible public accounting for the vast majority of these incidents. In the absence of more vigorous investigations, prosecutions and convictions, it is hard to see how this will come to an end.', '...', 'Throughout my discussions, government representatives have insisted that national mechanisms are adequate for the protection of human rights, but require capacity building and further support from the international community. In contrast, people from across a broad political spectrum and from various communities have expressed to me a lack of confidence and trust in the ability of existing relevant institutions to adequately safeguard against the most serious human rights abuses.', 'In my view the current human rights protection gap in Sri Lanka is not solely a question of capacity. While training and international expertise are needed in specific areas, and I understand would be welcomed by the Government, I am convinced that one of the major human rights shortcomings in Sri Lanka is rooted in the absence of reliable and authoritative information on the credible allegations of human rights abuses.”', '70. After his visit to Sri Lanka on 1–8 October 2007, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture issued a press release (dated 29 October 2007) in which he concluded:', '“Though the Government has disagreed, in my opinion the high number of indictments for torture filed by the Attorney General’s Office, the number of successful fundamental rights cases decided by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka, as well as the high number of complaints that the National Human Rights Commission continues to receive on an almost daily basis indicates that torture is widely practiced in Sri Lanka. Moreover, I observe that this practice is prone to become routine in the context of counter-terrorism operations, in particular by the TID [Terrorism Investigation Department].', 'Over the course of my visits to police stations and prisons, I received numerous consistent and credible allegations from detainees who reported that they were ill-treated by the police during inquiries in order to extract confessions, or to obtain information in relation to other criminal offences. Similar allegations were received with respect to the army. Methods reported included beating with various weapons, beating on the soles of the feet (falaqa), blows to the ears (‘telephono’), positional abuse when handcuffed or bound, suspension in various positions, including strappado, ‘butchery’, ‘reversed butchery’, and ‘parrot’s perch’ (or dharma chakara), burning with metal objects and cigarettes, asphyxiation with plastic bags with chilli pepper or gasoline, and various forms of genital torture. This array of torture finds its fullest manifestation at the TID detention facility in Boossa.', 'Intimidation of victims by police officers to refrain from making complaints against them was commonly reported, as were allegations of threats of further violence, or threatening to fabricate criminal cases of possession of narcotics or dangerous weapons. Detainees regularly reported that habeas corpus hearings before a magistrate either involved no real opportunity to complain about police torture given that they were often escorted to courts by the very same perpetrators, or that the magistrate did not inquire into whether the suspect was mistreated in custody. Medical examinations were frequently alleged to take place in the presence of the perpetrators, or directed to junior doctors with little experience in documentation of injuries.”', '71. In its 2007 Country Report on Human Rights Practices – Sri Lanka, dated 11 March 2008, the State Department observed:', '“The government’s respect for human rights continued to decline due in part to the escalation of the armed conflict. While ethnic Tamils composed approximately 16 percent of the overall population, the overwhelming majority of victims of human rights violations, such as killings and disappearances, were young male Tamils. Credible reports cited unlawful killings by government agents, assassinations by unknown perpetrators, politically motivated killings and child soldier recruitment by paramilitary forces associated with the government, disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detention, poor prison conditions, denial of fair public trial, government corruption and lack of transparency, infringement of religious freedom, infringement of freedom of movement, and discrimination against minorities. There were numerous reports that the army, police, and pro-government paramilitary groups participated in armed attacks against civilians and practiced torture, kidnapping, hostage-taking, and extortion with impunity. The situation deteriorated particularly in the government-controlled Jaffna peninsula. By year’s end extrajudicial killings occurred in Jaffna nearly on a daily basis and allegedly perpetrated by military intelligence units or associated paramilitaries. There were few arrests and no prosecutions as a result of these abuses, although a number of older cases continued to make slow progress through the judicial system. Government security forces used the broad 2005 emergency regulations to detain civilians arbitrarily, including journalists and members of civil society.', 'The LTTE, which maintained control of large sections of the north, continued to attack civilians and engage in torture and arbitrary arrest and detention; denied fair, public trials; arbitrarily interfered with privacy; denied freedoms of speech, press, and assembly and association; and forced recruitment, including of children. The LTTE was also active in areas it did not control and during the year carried out at least one politically motivated killing in Trincomalee, a politically motivated suicide attack in Colombo, a suicide attack against a government army base near Batticaloa, a bombing of civilian shoppers in a suburb of Colombo, and bombings of civilian buses in the south.”', '72. In the section of the report entitled “Arrest and Detention”, the State Department noted, inter alia:', '“Between November 30 and December 3, in response to two LTTE bomb attacks in and around Colombo, the police conducted random cordon and search operations and arrested nearly 2,500 Tamils in the capital and an estimated 3,500 countrywide. The detained, mostly male Tamil civilians were reportedly arrested based solely on their Tamil surnames. The vast majority of the detainees were soon released. The Supreme Court ordered the government to release the detainees on bail if they were no longer required for questioning. By year’s end only 12 of the 372 arrestees held in the Boossa detention camp were still in custody.”', '73. The report also documented the arrest of forty-eight Tamils in a lodge in a Colombo suburb on 6 October 2007 after the Supreme Court had intervened to prevent the police carrying out such forcible removals in June (see paragraph 79 below).', '74. On 22 December 2006, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada published the following “response to information request” on the treatment of failed asylum seekers returning to Sri Lanka, which provides:', '“In 19 December 2006 correspondence to the Research Directorate, an official at the Canadian High Commission in Colombo provided corroborating information [in reference to the letter from the British High Commission in Colombo dated 26 September 2005: see paragraphs 60–63 above] on the return of failed asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, stating that', '[r]eturnees, if identified to the airlines as such by immigration authorities who are removing them to Sri Lanka, have an established process awaiting them upon arrival. First, the Chief Immigration Officer (arrivals) documents the arrival of the person, takes a statement, and determines whether the returnee should be granted entry as a Sri Lankan national. Next an officer of the State Intelligence Service (SIS) documents the arrival and takes a statement. Finally, an officer of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Sri Lanka Police documents the arrival, checks for outstanding warrants and takes a statement. If there is an outstanding warrant for arrest, the returnee may be arrested. Otherwise, the returnee is free to go.', 'Persons with previous problems with the authorities', 'An October 2006 report published by Hotham Mission’s Asylum Seeker Project (ASP), an Australian non-governmental organization (NGO) that ‘works with asylum seekers in the community’ (Hotham Mission n.d.), similarly notes that persons returning to Sri Lanka who have had previous problems with the government of Sri Lanka may be detained by the police upon their arrival (47). According to the report, persons who have been detained or questioned in the past are more likely to be arrested and, because of the state of emergency and ongoing conflict in the country, ‘may face further human rights violations, such as torture’ (Hotham Mission Oct. 2006, 47). The report also notes that Sri Lanka’s National Intelligence Bureau keeps records on people dating back more than ten years and, since 2004, has been using a national computerized database (ibid.).', 'Persons travelling without valid identity documents', 'Persons who leave Sri Lanka using false documents or who enter the country under irregular or suspicious circumstances are reportedly more likely to be singled out and questioned under the country’s current state of emergency (ibid.; see also Daily News 15 Sept. 2006). The state of emergency reportedly permits the Sri Lankan authorities to make arrests without warrant and to detain persons for up to 12 months without trial (US 8 Mar. 2006). Under Section 45 of the country’s Immigrants and Emigrants Act, amended in 1998, persons found guilty of travelling with forged documents may be subject to a fine of between 50,000 and 200,000 Sri Lankan Rupees (LKR) [approximately CAD 533 (XE.com 12 Dec. 2006a) to CAD 2,133 (ibid. 12 Dec. 2006b)] and a jail term ranging from one to five years (Sri Lanka 1998).', 'Tamil asylum seekers with scars', 'Cited in an October 2006 UK Home Office report, a 1 January 2005 position paper by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicates that Tamil asylum seekers with scars may be more likely to be questioned and experience ‘ill-treatment’ by the Sri Lankan security forces upon their return to Sri Lanka (31 Oct. 2006, 126). The paper states that', '[the] UNHCR maintains its position ... that ‘Tamil asylum seekers with scars, should they be returned to Sri Lanka, may be more prone to adverse identification by the security forces and taken for rigorous questioning and potential ill-treatment’ ... Please note that the UNHCR’s comments are strictly limited to the risk of adverse identification, rigorous questioning, and potential ill-treatment of returned persons with scars upon their arrival at the airport, not the potential risk of arrest subsequent to the initial interrogation at the airport. (UK 31 Oct. 2006, 126)', 'A 24 August 2006 letter from the British High Commission in Colombo, cited in the October 2006 UK report suggests, however, that physical examinations of returnees conducted by the authorities are less common or have ceased altogether. The letter states that', '[t]here is strong anecdotal evidence that scarring has been used in the past to identify suspects. In ... conversations with the police and in the media, the authorities have openly referred to physical examinations being used to identify whether suspects have undergone military style training. ... [R]ecent claims from contacts in government ministries [indicate] that this practice has either ceased or is used less frequently. At the very least, it appears to only take place when there is another reason to suspect the individual rather than [as part of] a routine measure for immigration returnees. (UK 31 Oct. 2006, 127)', 'Further information from 2005 and 2006 on whether Tamils asylum seekers with scars would be targeted by Sri Lankan security forces upon their return could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.', 'Persons with an affiliation to the LTTE or other political groups', 'The October 2006 Hotham Mission report cites information obtained during consultations with the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM), a body of international observers that monitors the ceasefire agreement between the Sri Lankan government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (SLMM n.d.), concerning the return of failed asylum seekers (47). The SLMM indicates that if a person returning to Sri Lanka has any previous affiliation with the LTTE, they may be targeted by the police (ibid.). The organization also notes that if a person has previous affiliations to certain individuals or political groups, they may be targeted by the LTTE (ibid.). The SLMM provides the example of persons who have been members of the People’s Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), an inactive Tamil militant organization (SATP n.d.), who were still being targeted by the LTTE in Sri Lanka at the time the Hotham Mission report was published (Hotham Mission Oct. 2006, 47).', 'Persons returning from abroad', 'Persons returning from abroad may also be subject to extortion (Sri Lanka 27 Nov. 2006; Hotham Mission Oct. 2006, 49). According to the Hotham Mission report, in some instances, returnees have been pressured into paying immigration officials to be able to pass through the airport without incident (ibid.). The report also indicates that, across Sri Lanka, wealthy businessmen are being kidnapped for ransom and that ‘people returning from overseas may be a target, as it will be assumed that they have money’ (ibid.).', 'A 27 November 2006 article by the Media Centre for National Security, a division of Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Defence, Public Security, Law and Order, provides a listing of ‘extortion rates of the LTTE.’ According to the article, the LTTE charges 500 LKR [approximately CAD 5.30] per journey to persons returning from abroad (Sri Lanka 27 Nov. 2006).', 'Returnees from Canada', 'In 19 December 2006 correspondence, an official at the Canadian High Commission in Sri Lanka indicated that', '‘[s]ince 2004 ... no returnees from Canada have been arrested or experienced negative repercussions at the airport or after exiting the airport grounds in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan authorities who have dealt with the returnees have carried out their duties in a professional manner in compliance with international norms.’”', '75. In November 2006, the President of Sri Lanka appointed a Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into sixteen incidents of alleged serious violations of human rights, including abductions, disappearances and extra-judicial killings. The President subsequently invited eleven eminent persons to form the Independent International Group of Eminent Persons (“the IIGEP”) to observe the Commission’s work and to comment on the transparency of its investigations and inquiries and their conformity with international norms and standards. By a public statement released on 6 March 2008, the IIGEP announced its decision to terminate its operation in Sri Lanka, concluding that the proceedings had fallen far short of the transparency and compliance with basic international norms and standards pertaining to investigations and inquiries.', '76. In its 2007 Annual Report (“The State of the World’s Human Rights”), Amnesty International noted that in 2006 the human rights situation in Sri Lanka had deteriorated dramatically. Unlawful killings, recruitment of child soldiers, abductions, enforced disappearances and other human rights violations and war crimes had increased. Civilians had been attacked by both sides as fighting escalated between the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE. Hundreds of civilians had been killed and injured and more than 215,000 people displaced by the end of 2006. Homes, schools and places of worship had been destroyed. Although both sides maintained they were adhering to the ceasefire agreement, by mid-2006 it had in effect been abandoned. A pattern of enforced disappearances in the north and east re-emerged. There were reports of torture in police custody; perpetrators continued to benefit from impunity.', '77. In its 2008 Annual Report of the same title, Amnesty International further noted that “2007 was characterized by impunity for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law”. It stated that “soaring human rights abuses” included hundreds of enforced disappearances, unlawful killings of humanitarian workers, arbitrary arrests and torture. The report also stated that the Sri Lankan police had conducted mass arrests of more than 1,000 Tamils, allegedly in response to the suicide bombings carried out in Colombo on 28 November 2007. The arrests said to have been made on arbitrary and discriminatory grounds using sweeping powers granted by the Emergency Regulations. The report also quoted unnamed reports as stating that “Tamils were bundled in bus loads and taken for interrogation”. The report further alleged that more than four hundred of those arrested, including fifty women, were taken to the Boosa Camp near Galle and held in poor conditions of detention.', '78. In the above report of August 2007, Human Rights Watch characterised Sri Lanka as being in the midst of a human rights crisis and found responsibility lay with both the Government and the LTTE. The report catalogued instances of human rights abuses during the armed conflict, including abductions, disappearances and arbitrary arrests and detentions. It also found there to have been a crackdown on dissent, a culture of impunity for human rights violations and an abuse of the Emergency Regulations introduced by the Government (see paragraph 55 above). It found that ethic Tamils had suffered the brunt of abuses but members of the Muslim and Sinhalese ethnic groups had also been the victims of Government human rights violations. The report also noted that the Government had detained an undetermined number of people (reaching into the hundreds) under the Emergency Regulations, with young Tamil males being the primary targets. The report also noted that on the Government’s own figures, Tamils constituted the overwhelming majority of those detained. Large-scale arrests were said to be particularly common after attacks attributed to the LTTE.', '79. The report also recorded attempts in early June 2007 by the Sri Lankan police to evict Tamils staying at lodges in and around Colombo and to transport them to LTTE controlled areas. On 8 June 2007, the Supreme Court issued an order preventing the police and others from continuing the expulsions or restricting the free movement of Tamils in and out of Colombo.', '80. In a further report published in March 2008, Human Rights Watch documented ninety-nine instances of disappearances, which it alleged were, for the most part, attributable to Government security forces. The report stated that the vast majority of the victims were ethnic Tamils, although Muslims and Sinhalese had also been targeted, with individual being targeted primarily because of their alleged membership in or affiliation to the LTTE. Young Tamil men were among the most frequent targets, though civil society activists were also among those who had disappeared. The report characterised the Government’s investigation and response to the disappearances as “grossly inadequate”.', '81. In a report of 20 February 2008, entitled “Sri Lanka’s Return to War: Limiting the Damage, Asia Report No. 146”, the International Crisis Group commented on the rising ethnic tensions in Sri Lanka since the collapse of the ceasefire and in particular observed:', '“With the collapse of the ceasefire, the LTTE’s return to terror attacks and the government’s counter-terrorism measures, fear and inter-ethnic tension have grown significantly. Tamils increasingly see themselves, not the Tigers, as the government’s target. The decision in June 2007 to evict some 375 Tamils from hotels and boarding houses in Colombo and bus them ‘home’ to the north and east and to the central hill country was a major blow to confidence. This was followed by mass round-ups of more than 2,500 in Colombo in early December after a series of bomb attacks blamed on the Tigers. [the accompanying footnote refers to a Government press release of 5 December 2007] The arrests were disorganised and indiscriminate, affecting many long-established residents of the capital with proper identification. More than 400 were sent to detention centres in the south. Most were released within a week, but the experience was a shock. Many felt such ‘security measures’ were meant to send a message that all Tamils pose a security threat and are unwelcome in Colombo or Sinhalese areas. Tamils from the north and east are particularly vulnerable (footnotes omitted).”', '82. The report also observed that violations of civil and political rights were widespread, with the majority and worst in the north and east of the country. There were daily occurrences of political killings and disappearances. Both sides were responsible but additionally on the government side there appeared to be no prosecutions for human rights violations and an unwillingness on the part of the police to investigate killings, disappearances and abductions. Other government institutions were “equally ineffective”.', '83. The Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture is a United Kingdom registered charity which provides medical and other rehabilitative support for victims of torture. In a 2007 report, submitted by the Government as part of their observations in the present case, and entitled “Torture once again rampant in the Sri Lanka conflict”, the Foundation summarised the work it had done with Sri Lankan clients. The report stated that the overwhelming majority of Sri Lankans seen by the Foundation were Tamil and the majority of them were young males. The report stated that its findings “challenged the UK Government’s readiness to return unsuccessful asylum applications to Sri Lanka where they might face further abuse”.', '84. On 19 August 2007, the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Sinhala website quoted Amnesty International as stating that three Tamil men had been held incommunicado in Colombo after having been returned there from Thailand. A Sri Lankan police spokesman was also quoted as stating that the men had been detained on immigration charges but refuted the allegation that they were being held incommunicado. Amnesty International also stated that the applications for political asylum in Thailand by the three men were refused by UNHCR. The story was recorded in the March 2008 COI Report at paragraph 8.16 and at paragraph 8.15 of the previous, November 2007 version of the same report.', '85. From a press release available on the official website of the Government of Sri Lanka, the Chief Government Whip, Jeyaraj Fernandopulle, gave the following information at a press briefing on 4 December 2007. The Government had released 2,352 persons out of a total of 2,554 persons taken into custody during search operations conducted the previous weekend. 1,959 had been released on the day of arrest and another 393 were released following identification. The remaining 202 persons had been remanded or kept under detention orders.']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Violation of Art. 2;No violation of Art. 14;No violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza;Simon Brown,"['11. On 11 November 1982 Gervaise McKerr was driving a green Ford Escort, registration no. UPF 775. There were two passengers in the car: Eugen Toman and Sean Burns. None of the men was armed. At Tullygally Road, East Lurgan, at least 109 rounds were fired into the car by police officers of a specially trained mobile support unit of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). All three men were killed.', '12. The facts relating to the death of Gervaise McKerr remain in dispute despite over ten years of inquest proceedings, three criminal prosecutions and other related legal proceedings.', '13. On 11 November 1982 steps were taken by Chief Inspector Whirter to preserve the scene of the shooting. A doctor attended the scene and conducted a preliminary examination of the bodies. On 12 November 1982 a forensic expert from the Northern Ireland Forensic Science Laboratory conducted a detailed examination of the scene and Professor Marshall carried out post-mortem examinations of the bodies. Photographs were taken of the scene and the bodies, and maps drawn up. On the same day the scene of crimes officer took possession of the police officers’ rifles, a submachine gun and pistol. About eighty-four of the cartridges fired at the scene were recovered (leaving twenty-five unaccounted for). The police made house-to-house enquiries in the vicinity, in conjunction with an appeal in the press for any witnesses to come forward, and a meeting was organised with a local councillor.', '14. As part of the investigation, on 15 November 1982, Detective Chief Inspector Scott interviewed three RUC officers from the five-member mobile support unit. Sergeant M., Constable B. and Constable R. made written statements. These statements described the incident but did not mention that the deceased were the subject of surveillance by Special Branch officers and were believed to have set out to commit a murder. The officers had received instructions from the deputy head of Special Branch not to refer to the fact that they were Special Branch officers or that they had intelligence made available to them in advance of the incident. It was later alleged that this was in order to prevent the availability of advance intelligence becoming public knowledge and hampering efforts to fight terrorism.', '15. On 18 January 1983 the three officers, M., B. and R., were interviewed again in the light of the available forensic evidence. Written records were made of these interviews.', '16. The results of the RUC investigation were sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) to consider whether any prosecution should be brought. The DPP requested that further inquiries be made. On 19 and 20 July 1983 the three officers were interviewed, and on this occasion they stated that they had been briefed that the three deceased were the subject of surveillance and were believed to have set out to commit a murder.', '17. Shortly afterwards, the DPP decided that charges should be brought against these three officers (“the three defendants”). The indictment was issued on 8 March 1984 and, as amended on 29 May 1984, charged B. with the murder of Eugene Toman, and M. and R. with aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring B. to commit that offence.', '18. The trial of the three defendants took place in Belfast between 29 May and 5 June 1984 before Lord Justice Gibson, sitting without a jury. The prosecution case involved twenty-seven witnesses appearing at the trial to give evidence, while statements from a further eleven witnesses were read out. Over seventy-five exhibits were submitted in evidence.', '19. At the close of the prosecution case Lord Justice Gibson found that the evidence against the three defendants did not establish their guilt and, concluding that there was no case to answer, acquitted them. In his judgment giving his reasons for this conclusion, he stated:', '“The accused were tasked to arrest Toman and Burns on suspicion of having committed terrorist acts, including murder, and to prevent them carrying out a further murder which the police authorities had reason to believe was about to be attempted.', 'Each of the accused was so advised by his superiors and was further informed that the suspects would probably be armed and that they were both dedicated and dangerous terrorists who had let it be known that they would not be arrested alive. If they were arrested therefore it would be known to all concerned that firearms would probably have to be used to effect their arrest.', 'The degree of danger of the operation which was anticipated may be judged by the fact that the three accused were issued with one submachine gun, two Ruger rifles, three semi-automatic pistols and a total of almost 200 rounds of ammunition.', 'The deceased were under surveillance and according to information received they set off in a car driven by McKerr with the object of carrying out the proposed murder. A road block was then set up by the police in order to stop and arrest them.', 'They broke through the road block at high speed endangering the life of a police officer in so doing. The accused who were in a car nearby immediately gave chase. Shots were discharged after the escaping car.', 'At this point I had to be careful in assessing the evidence to leave out of account any self serving parts of statements made by the accused.', 'It was a dark wet November night and the forensic evidence satisfies me that bullets striking the rear window and other metal parts at the rear of the car would in such conditions emit flashes which could readily be mistaken for the muzzle flashes of guns fired from the back of the car especially after the rear window was broken as it was.', '... I have no doubt that it was a reasonable conclusion that the accused were being fired at. In fact none of the persons escaping did have any firearms but each of the accused opened fire from their car as they travelled at high speed along the Tullygally East Road ...', 'I have no doubt that at this stage each of the accused was acting lawfully in shooting at the three deceased as being the only practicable means of effecting their arrest and if need be of killing them in order to stop their escape and prevent the perpetration of murder ...', 'Quite apart from any question of self defence which may have been raised as a result of the apparent gun flashes from the car, the car, driven by McKerr, was driven at high speed. It failed to negotiate a turn to the right to a slip road and it came to a rest a matter of 40 to 50 feet up the slip road just off the left hand verge and on the sloping ground giving a drop of some four feet. The car in which the three accused were pulled up on the other side of the road. All jumped out.', 'Without reference to the statements of the accused and relying exclusively on other Crown evidence it is clear that the passenger door of the car ... opened. The front passenger was Toman and in the rear seat was Burns.', 'The evidence of [the forensic expert], which I accept, was that the ... experiments which he carried out [showed that] the opening of the passenger door from inside produced two distinct metallic sounds, the first like the slide of a gun hitting the back blade; the second like the slide hitting the front blade. These sounds were heard by him distinctly at a distance of twenty feet.', 'The Crown case is that after the door was opened ... some or all of the accused struck Toman in the back as he stood outside the car killing him instantly. ... the passenger side of the car would have been in shadow. In my view it matters not whether the accused on hearing the noise of the door being opened concluded that this was what was happening or whether they thought that one of the occupants of the car was preparing to open fire on them.', 'In either event the act of shooting was not murder. In any event the noise established that one or more of the occupants was alighting. If the noise was taken to be indicating that the front passenger was preparing to get out of the car that could only be interpreted as an attempt to get down the hill to escape into the country beyond or being an attempt to take up a position behind the car with the intention of opening fire. If on the other hand the noise was taken to be the operation of a gun slide it was unmistakable that a gunman proposed to open fire and immediate retaliatory action was required.', 'As seen and understood by the accused the car contained three men, at least two murderous gunmen who had not merely given no indication of submission but seemed prepared to shoot it out or at least escape in the dark. In those circumstances to open fire was to my mind the most obvious and only means of self defence and the only step consistent with their duty. Apart from running away it was the only reasonable course open to them.', 'It was in my view the use by them of such as was reasonable in the circumstances as appreciated by them, including their understanding of the mortal danger in which they were to effect arrests even though it may be by killing and to prevent the commission of the contemplated murder.', 'Their use of gunfire into the car was therefore plainly lawful within the terms of Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 as well as being the commensurate force for their own self-defence. ...', 'There was no time to my mind to weigh up the possibilities. At all costs and at all possible speed the danger had to be eliminated otherwise the consequences might have been fatal to themselves.', 'As I have read the papers and as I understand the evidence there never was the slimmest chance that the Crown could have hoped to secure a conviction. ...”', '20. The judge concluded with these comments:', '“I speak not of the inevitable concerns and worries of the accused or the additional danger that they are now likely to be in because their identities and appearances have been publicly exposed by this trial. I am thinking of the very widespread effects among other members of the police and indeed of the armed forces generally when a policeman or a soldier is ordered to arrest a dangerous criminal and ... to bring him back. How is he to consider his conduct?', 'May it not be that some may now ask ‘Am I to risk my life carrying out this order knowing that if I survive my reward will be a further risk of life imprisonment as a murderer’. One would hope that they will accept the first risk as part of their duty but should they not also be entitled to expect that if they do so they will have the protection of the law unless it should appear with total blindness they may have overstepped the bounds of the criminal law.', 'As far as the three deceased men who unhappily forfeited their lives are concerned they died not because they were victims of murder but because knowing that two of them were wanted by the police on a charge of multiple murder and many other crimes they decided not to stop when confronted by the police and to risk all in an attempt to escape. It was a gamble which failed.', 'There is just one final observation which I would like to make. ... I want to make clear that having heard the entire Crown case exposed in open court I regard each of the accused as absolutely blameless in this matter.', 'I consider that in fairness to them that finding also ought to be recorded together with my commendation for their courage and determination in bringing the three deceased men to justice, in this case to the final court of justice.”', 'Shortly after giving judgment, Lord Justice Gibson made a statement in open court:', '“Having regard to the widespread publicity which parts of my judgment have received and the observations which have been made upon it in the press and elsewhere, I have considered it desirable to clarify my views on two matters.', 'First, I would point out that my observations related to the particular circumstances of that occasion and ought not to be read out of context. I would wish most emphatically to repudiate any idea that I would approve or that the law would countenance what has been described as a shoot-to-kill policy on the part of the police.', 'Like every other member of the public they have no right, in any circumstances, to use more force than appears to be reasonably necessary having regard to all the circumstances understood by them.', '... I understand that in some quarters certain further words of mine have been thought to mean that I was contemplating that the police force might be regarded as entitled to mete out summary justice by means of the bullet.', 'I do not believe that on any fair analysis my words were capable of that interpretation. Indeed, nothing was further from my mind, nor would I or any other judge contemplate for a second that such a view was tenable.”', '21. In November and December 1982 there had been two further fatal shooting incidents involving the RUC in Armagh – the killing of Michael Tighe and serious wounding of Martin McAuley on 24 November 1982, and the killing of Seamus Grew and Roddy Carroll on 12 December 1982. None of the deceased was armed.', '22. On 11 April 1984 the DPP exercised his statutory powers under Article 6(3) of the Prosecution of Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 to request the Chief Constable of the RUC to conduct further investigations into the three cases. The Government stated that he did so as it appeared that, in certain statements of evidence, material and important facts had been omitted and matters which were untrue and misleading in material and important respects had been included. He also requested that he be provided with full information about the circumstances in which false and misleading evidence had been provided by any officer of the RUC and an investigation into whether there was evidence to suggest that any person was guilty of an offence of perverting the course of justice or any other offence in connection with the investigation of the three shooting incidents.', '23. On 24 May 1984 John Stalker, then Deputy Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police, was appointed by the Chief Constable of the RUC to carry out the investigation, which was to investigate the circumstances in which certain members of the RUC had provided false or misleading evidence or purported evidence, and to investigate the conduct of members of the RUC in connection with the inquiries into the incidents.', '24. In October 1984, three months after the defendants were acquitted, they were interviewed by the Stalker team, which included Detective Chief Superintendent Thorburn. Written records were kept of these statements. B. also made a written statement. According to his book John Stalker (see paragraph 31 below), on 26 June 1985, Mr Stalker wrote to the Chief Constable of the RUC, Sir John Hermon, informing him of fresh evidence pointing to offences of unlawful killings by RUC officers. On 18 September 1985 Mr Stalker sent his Interim Report to the RUC [according to the RUC report on the Stalker book (see paragraph 33) this report consisted of 3,609 pages, in twenty separate volumes, including one album of maps and photographs] and, on 15 February 1986, Sir John Hermon sent the report to the DPP for Northern Ireland. On 4 March 1986 the DPP instructed Sir John Hermon to release Special Branch files to Mr Stalker, which documents had been withheld on grounds of national security. The documents were handed over to Mr Stalker on or about 30 April 1986.', '25. On 29 May 1986 Mr Stalker was removed from the inquiry and replaced by Colin Sampson, Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police, who was also asked to investigate allegations of impropriety against Mr Stalker concerning matters unrelated to the present case.', '26. On 6 August 1986 Mr Sampson completed his investigation into Mr Stalker and, on 22 August 1986, Mr Stalker was reinstated by the Police Committee. He did not, however, return to the inquiry.', '27. On 26 November 1986 Mr Stalker’s deputy on the inquiry, John Thorburn, left the police and, on 13 March 1987, Mr Stalker himself also left.', '28. Mr Sampson delivered his report to Sir John Hermon and the DPP in three sections, on 22 October 1986, 23 March and 10 April 1997.', '29. On 25 January 1988 Sir Patrick Mayhew, the then Attorney-General, made a statement in Parliament in which he said, inter alia:', '“In regard to the shooting incidents ... the [DPP] had considered all the facts and information ascertained and reported by Mr Stalker and Mr Sampson, and he has re-examined the original RUC investigation files. He has concluded that the evidence does not warrant any further prosecution in respect of the shootings which occurred on 11 November 1982 and 12 December 1982 and which have already been the subject of prosecutions. ...', 'The [DPP] has however concluded that there is evidence of the commission of offences of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice or of obstructing a constable in the execution of his duty, and that this evidence is sufficient to require consideration of whether prosecutions are required in the public interest and he has consulted me accordingly.', 'I have therefore taken steps to acquaint myself with all the relevant circumstances, including matters concerning the public interest and, in particular, considerations of national security that might properly affect the decision whether or not to institute proceedings.', 'I have informed the Director fully with regard to my consultations as to the public interest, and in the light of all the facts and information brought to his notice, the [DPP] has concluded, with my full agreement, that it would not be proper to institute any criminal proceedings. He has given directions accordingly.”', '30. Eight officers were, according to the Government, the subject of disciplinary proceedings, and received admonitions and advice as to their future conduct.', '31. In the book John Stalker, published by Mr Stalker in 1988, the following descriptions of his investigation into the three shooting incidents appeared:', '“The Stalker inquiry discovered that the three victims of the shooting had been under surveillance for many hours by the police who planned to intercept them at a place different from where the killings occurred. No serious attempt to attract the attention of the driver was made, and no policeman was struck by the car. Immediately after the incident the police officers drove from the scene with their weapons and returned to their base for a debriefing by senior Special Branch Officers. Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) were denied access for many days to the police officers involved and to their car, clothes and weapons for forensic examination. On the night of the killings, CID officers were given incorrect information about where the shootings began and part of the forensic examination was conducted in the wrong place. Many cartridge cases of rounds fired were never found.”', '“We believed ... that at least one officer had been in an entirely different position from that which he had claimed to be in when some fatal shots were fired. I also established that the police pursuit took place in a different manner from that described. But most damning of all, almost 21 months after the shooting we found fragments of the bullet that undoubtedly killed the driver still embedded in the car. That crucial evidence had lain undiscovered by the RUC and Forensic Science service ... My conclusion in relation to the missing cartridge cases was that as many as twenty were deliberately removed from the scene. I could only presume that this was in order to mislead the forensic scientists and to hide the true nature and extent of the shooting.”', '“I had to regard the investigation of the matter as slipshod and in some aspects woefully inadequate. I was left with two alternative conclusions, either that some RUC detectives were amateur and inefficient at even the most basic of murder investigation routines; or that they had been deliberately inept.”', '“Even though six deaths had occurred over a five week period ... and involved in each case officers from the same specialist squad, no co-ordinated investigation had ever been attempted. It seemed that the investigating officers had never spoken to each other. Worse still, despite the obvious political and public implications, no senior officer had seen fit to draw the reports together.”', '“We had expected a particularly high level of enquiry in view of the nature of the deaths, but this was shamefully absent. The files were little more than a collection of statements, apparently prepared for a coroner’s enquiry. They bore no resemblance to my idea of a murder prosecution file. Even on the most cursory of readings I could see clearly why the prosecutions had failed.”', '32. According to The Times of 9 February 1988, Mr Stalker also stated:', '“I never did find evidence of a shoot-to-kill policy as such. There was no written instruction, nothing pinned up on a noticeboard. But there was a clear understanding on the part of the men whose job it was to pull the trigger that that was what was expected of them.”', '33. In 1990 the RUC issued a response to the book by Mr Stalker. It stated in its introduction that the book contained many inaccuracies and distortions and gave a misleading impression. Their document aimed to highlight a selected number of misrepresentations. It was stated, in contradiction to Mr Stalker’s assertions, that it was wrong to allege that the three investigations were carried out under different detectives as the same detective superintendent was in charge of two of the investigations; that the investigation files were presented to the DPP in the format approved by him; that it was already established in a police statement of 13 November 1982 that no police officer had been struck by the car driven by Gervaise McKerr; that it had been advisable, for the safety of the three officers, that they leave the scene immediately; that their weapons had been seized without delay by the scene of crimes officers; that no incorrect information was given to the investigating officers concerning where the shooting occurred, although uniformed officers had mistakenly positioned the tape on the junction and it was repositioned accurately shortly afterwards; it was accepted that all the cartridges were not recovered but due to the torrential rain at the time some could have been washed down the drains; the area had nonetheless been swept over for two days with metal detectors.', 'Criticisms were also made that Mr Stalker had gone outside his remit to reinvestigate the shooting incidents as well as a terrorist incident on 27 October 1982 in which three police officers had been killed and that his report, when submitted, lacked the clarity and precision normally associated with criminal investigations.', '34. The Government have also submitted that on 23 June 1992 Mr Thorburn, on the occasion of his withdrawal of a libel action against the RUC Chief Constable, made a statement in which he took the opportunity to submit publicly that he was satisfied that the RUC had not pursued a shoot- to-kill policy in 1982 and that the RUC Chief Constable had not condoned or authorised any deliberate or reckless killings by his officers. Other members of the Stalker/Sampson inquiry team also stated in June 1990 that “the Greater Manchester officers wish to stress that the Stalker/Sampson Enquiry found no evidence of a ‘Shoot to Kill policy’ ”.', '35. An inquest into the deaths was opened by the Armagh coroner, Mr Curran, on 4 June 1984 at the conclusion of the criminal trial. On or about 22 August 1984 Mr Curran resigned. The applicant alleged that this was due to irregularities in the RUC files concerning the deaths. The inquest was due to be heard in September 1984 before Mr Elliott but was adjourned on the application of Mrs Creaney’s legal representatives. The coroner then waited until after the conclusion of the Stalker/Sampson investigation before scheduling the inquest to reopen on 14 November 1988.', '36. The coroner was provided with all the witness statements, forensic evidence, maps and photographs which were obtained as part of the RUC investigation and the Stalker/Sampson investigations. Parts of some of the witness statements were deleted in the public interest for reasons of national security.', '37. On 27 October 1988 the coroner held a preliminary meeting, attended by the legal representatives of the interested parties, including the relatives of the deceased, at which he stated that he intended to admit in evidence the written statement of Sergeant M. and officers B. and R.', '38. On 9 November 1988 Tom King, the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, issued a Public Interest Immunity Certificate (“PII Certificate”) which, the applicant alleged, prevented the disclosure of a substantial amount of information that would otherwise have been available to the inquest due to open five days later. The certificate covered any information or documents which might reveal, inter alia:', '– details of RUC counter-terrorist capabilities, including methods of operation, specialist training and equipment;', '– details of the intelligence which gave rise to the belief that there was a conspiracy to murder an off-duty member of the security forces and the methods by which such intelligence was gleaned; and', '– certain details of surveillance mounted by the RUC as part of the operation during which McKerr, Toman and Burns were killed.', '39. On 14 November 1988 the inquest opened. The coroner admitted unsworn evidence by the three officers M., B. and R., who had declined to appear to give evidence at the inquest.', '40. On 17 November 1988 an adjournment was granted at the request of Mrs Creaney’s solicitor who took proceedings for judicial review to challenge the admission of the unsworn statements. The application was refused on 22 November 1988 by Mr Justice Carswell. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held on 20 December 1988 that the Coroners’ Practice and Procedure Rules (which conferred on the coroner the discretion to admit the statements) were ultra vires since M., B. and R. were compellable witnesses. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was granted to the Crown on 19 April 1989. On 8 March 1990 the House of Lords overturned the judgment, holding that the Coroners’ Rules of Practice and Procedure were not ultra vires and that these officers could not be compelled to attend the inquest.', '41. The inquest proceedings, due to recommence on 23 April 1990, were adjourned further while Mrs Creaney commenced a second set of judicial review proceedings challenging the admission of the statements of the three officers. Mr Justice Carswell on 11 May 1990 and the Court of Appeal on 27 June 1990 rejected the application as raising no new issues.', '42. On 20 July 1990 Mrs Creaney’s legal representatives wrote to the coroner requesting that the inquest not be resumed pending an appeal in judicial review proceedings relating to an inquest into the deaths of three other persons (the Devine case, where relatives of the deceased had challenged the power of the coroner to admit written statements from the soldiers who had shot the deceased). The request was granted. Judgment was given by the Court of Appeal in that case on 6 December 1990 and by the House of Lords on 6 February 1992, upholding the power of coroners to admit written statements.', '43. On 5 May 1992 a second inquest resumed under Coroner John Leckey. The coroner stated in his address to the jury:', '“The purpose of an Inquest is the investigation in public of all the facts and circumstances surrounding an unnatural death. It follows, therefore, that an inquest is usually unnecessary when those facts have already been investigated and made public in a criminal court on a prosecution for homicide. You may recall that in 1984 three police officers were prosecuted for the murder of one of the deceased, Eugene Toman, but were acquitted. In the course of their trial there was a very full examination of the facts surrounding the three deaths and had there not been another factor to consider, I would have decided that an Inquest was unnecessary. That factor, which makes the investigation of these deaths wholly exceptional, is a subsequent investigation carried out by the Greater Manchester Police: the so-called Stalker Inquiry. The statements they took have been made available to me and the public has a proper interest in knowing whether any further evidence came to light. For that reason and that reason alone, I am holding Inquests.”', '44. The inquest continued until 29 May 1992, in public, before a jury, and involved the hearing of about nineteen witnesses over thirteen days. Mrs Creaney was represented by a barrister, who cross-examined the witnesses and made extensive legal submissions. The RUC were also represented.', '45. On 28 May 1992 a witness, officer D., said that he had had recourse to the statement he had made to the RUC on 13 November 1982, prior to giving evidence at the inquest. Counsel for Mrs Creaney asked to see this statement but the coroner refused his request, as the witness did not have it about his person and it was the property of the RUC. On 29 May 1992, at the applicant’s request, the inquest was adjourned. The same day, Mrs Creaney’s solicitor sought leave in the High Court for judicial review of, inter alia, the coroner’s decision refusing access to witness D.’s statement. Leave for judicial review was initially refused on 2 June 1992 but finally granted by the Court of Appeal on 8 June 1992.', '46. On 21 December 1992 Judge Nicholson ruled that Mrs Creaney had no right to see the statement and also declined to rule that she could have a list of the jurors, although he strongly recommended that the names of the jurors be read out in open court on resumption of the inquest. On 28 May 1993 the Court of Appeal overturned the former decision, holding that counsel was entitled to see the witness statement of 13 November 1982 and that the coroner could order production of the statement from the RUC, and, if it was not produced, could issue a subpoena.', '47. On 2 November 1992 the coroner wrote to Detective Chief Superintendent McIvor of the RUC, recalling that, prior to the adjournment of the inquest, he had expressed his view that four Greater Manchester Police witnesses (including John Thorburn, Mr Stalker’s deputy on the inquiry) should be granted access to documents and papers relating to their investigation as members of the Greater Manchester Police Inquiry. Chief Superintendent McIvor replied that none of the police officers mentioned had requested access and that he therefore presumed they had been able to brief themselves on papers in their own possession.', '48. On 16 November 1992 Mr Thorburn wrote to the Chief Constable of the Greater Manchester Police requesting access to the statement file and forensic evidence relating to the killing at Tullygally Road on 11 November 1982. By letter of 25 January 1993, the coroner was informed that the Chief Constable of the RUC had advised the Greater Manchester Police that Mr Thorburn should not be allowed access to the documents requested. He was also informed that the documents were part of the inquiry and were therefore the property of the RUC, to which all subsequent requests should therefore be addressed.', '49. Following a meeting on 9 September 1993 with the representatives of the interested parties, including Mrs Creaney, the coroner served a subpoena on the Chief Constable of the RUC requiring him to attend with reports on the Stalker/Sampson investigations.', '50. On 21 December 1993 the legal adviser of the RUC wrote to the coroner stating that he had now been informed by the Greater Manchester Police that they did not hold any papers other than those held by the RUC, which, apart from the Stalker and Sampson reports, the coroner already had in his possession. He also raised the fact that the documents were likely to be covered by public interest immunity. By letter of 4 January 1994 the coroner referred to a conversation of 21 December 1993 with the legal adviser of the RUC, wishing to formally put on record his surprise at hearing that documents in the possession of the Greater Manchester Police had been destroyed. The RUC legal adviser replied on 12 January 1994, stating that he had never said that documents had been destroyed. On 13 January 1994 the coroner requested the legal adviser to confirm that all documents referred to in the schedule to the subpoena were in existence and to identify their location.', '51. By letter dated 17 February 1994 the RUC legal adviser informed the coroner that, contrary to information previously given to him, a number of filing cabinets containing documents from the inquiry had been located with the Greater Manchester Police. These had been handed over to the RUC and were in his view covered by the PII Certificate.', '52. Meanwhile, on 31 January 1994 the inquest was closed and the jury discharged. The inquest was reopened on 22 March 1994. In reopening the inquest, the coroner informed Mrs Creaney’s solicitors by letter dated 21 February 1994 that:', '“Re: inquests into the deaths of –', '(1) James Gervaise McKerr, Eugene Toman and John Frederick Burns', '... A criminal trial arose out of each of these incidents and normally where that occurs an Inquest is unnecessary as all the facts are likely to have been fully investigated in public at the trial.', 'However, as you are aware, the circumstances surrounding these deaths was the subject of an investigation carried out by ... Mr John Stalker ... and Mr Colin Sampson ... between May 1984 and April 1987. Their reports were subsequently submitted to the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. I am of the opinion that the public has a proper interest in knowing whether any further evidence came to light subject to this evidence being within the proper scope of an Inquest. Were it not for this unique aspect of the investigation into the deaths I would not hold Inquests but would proceed to register the deaths.', 'The purpose of formally opening these Inquests is to determine whether it will be possible for me to achieve my aim. One of the witnesses whom it is my present intention to call is ex-Detective Chief Superintendent John Thorburn ... who played a leading role in the ... investigation. He would be in a position to give material evidence only if he had access in advance of the Inquest to certain working papers and other documents which are presently in the custody of the Chief Constable. After a lapse of seven years it is important that he has the opportunity to refresh his memory by carefully re-examining these so that the evidence that he gives will be as accurate as possible ...”', '53. The coroner issued a fresh subpoena on 24 February 1994 requiring Sir Hugh Annesley, Chief Constable of the RUC, to attend before him in connection with the inquest and to produce:', '(i) a copy of the Stalker Interim Report (including statement files, exhibits and forensic file);', '(ii) a copy of the draft and final Sampson Report (including documents and statement files);', '(iii) a copy of the draft and final Stalker Report (including statements, exhibits, and forensic files);', '(iv) thirteen files of action sheets;', '(v) computer disks;', '(vi) photographs and maps;', '(vii) press cuttings, a file and videos of TV programmes;', '(viii) interview notes of RUC officers;', '(ix) trial transcripts;', '(x) a book of handwritten notes of trials;', '(xi) three interview indexes;', '(xii) original RUC documents (ref. Ballynerry Road);', '(xiii) fifteen document files designated B105, 119-129, 134, 137-146, 149 and 153; and', '(xiv) presentation documents.', '54. On 20 April 1994 the Chief Constable of the RUC issued a summons to have the subpoena set aside on the grounds that he had no personal knowledge of the facts at issue at the inquest and should not therefore be required to give evidence; that the documents sought under the subpoena should not be disclosed as they consisted of documents which ought not to be disclosed in the public interest and to which a claim of public interest immunity properly attached; and that in the circumstances the issue of the subpoena was oppressive, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court.', '55. On 4 May 1994 the coroner served an affidavit stating that he did not require the Chief Constable to give any evidence in respect of his personal knowledge but required him to produce the Stalker and Sampson reports that were in his custody. He stated that he required the production of these reports for the sole purpose of enabling ex-Detective Chief Superintendent John Thorburn, who played a leading role in the investigations connected with, and in the preparation of, the reports, to refresh his memory, so that the evidence he gave at the inquest would be as accurate as possible. He further stated the following:', '“8. I am of the opinion that the public has a proper interest in knowing whether any further evidence touching the causes of the material deaths came to light as a result of the said investigations, subject, of course, to that evidence being within the proper scope of the Inquests.', '9. Were it not for this unique aspect of the investigation into the deaths (being the investigations which led to the production of the said Reports), I would not hold Inquests, but would proceed to register the material deaths.', '10. I have issued the material Writs of Subpoena only because the Royal Ulster Constabulary has refused Mr Thorburn access to the original investigation papers.', '11. Accordingly, if the material Writs of Subpoena are set aside, so that the said Reports are not available for the purposes of the Inquests, I will consider that there will be no useful purposes to be served in proceeding with the Inquests, and I will close them, and proceed to register the material deaths.”', '56. On 5 May 1994 Sir Patrick Mayhew (then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland) issued a further PII Certificate stating that the disclosure of the Stalker and Sampson reports would cause serious damage to the public interest and that he considered it his duty to issue the Certificate in order to protect the public interest, in summary constituting the following:', '“(a) the need to protect the operational efficiency of the special units of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Armed Forces and the Security Service;', '(b) the need to protect the integrity of intelligence operations;', '(c) the need to protect the future usefulness of Royal Ulster Constabulary, Armed Forces and Security Service personnel;', '(d) the need to protect the lives and safety of Royal Ulster Constabulary, Armed Forces and Security Service personnel and their families, and the lives and safety of persons, and their families, who have provided or may provide information and intelligence to the security forces.”', '57. The Secretary of State emphasised the need, first, to protect the integrity of the process of criminal investigations and the making of decisions as to prosecutions and, secondly, the need to preserve the efficacy of the Crown’s efforts to counter terrorism and the safety from terrorist attack of persons involved in those efforts. As regards the work of special units of the RUC, he stated that these units and personnel carried out security, intelligence and surveillance work. The work of all these units required secrecy if it was to be effective. The disclosure of, or evidence about, the identity of members of the special units of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Armed Forces and the Security Service could substantially impair their capability to perform the tasks assigned to them and could put their lives at risk.', '58. On 16 May 1994 the Chief Constable swore a further affidavit in which he stated that he had been informed that copies of all witness statements, forensic evidence photographs and maps from the first two RUC investigations and the Stalker and Sampson inquiries had been provided to the coroner subject to certain deletions from various statements and transcripts. He stated that the coroner was therefore in possession of all the documentary evidence from the three investigations and should be in a position to identify any further evidence which came to light during the Stalker and Sampson inquiries. On 20 May 1994 the Chief Constable applied to the High Court for the writ of subpoena to be set aside.', '59. On 25 May 1994 the coroner swore a further affidavit stating that he was satisfied that relevant new material germane to the inquests had been found by the police during the Stalker and Sampson inquiries and that he had spoken to Mr Thorburn (Mr Stalker’s deputy) and Mr Shaw (Mr Sampson’s deputy), who informed him that they required access to the documents in issue in order to identify the headings of the new material and give accurate evidence thereon.', '60. On 11 July 1994 Judge Nicholson set aside the subpoenas on the grounds that they were not necessary to the proper purpose of the inquest and that the materials in question should not be disclosed in view of the PII Certificate. He stated, inter alia:', '“... [The Coroner] stated that his enquiries satisfied him that there was relevant new material in the Reports. The source of this information must have been Mr Thorburn or Mr Shaw ...', 'It is not disputed by counsel for the Coroner that all witness statements have been given to the Coroner. There remain recommendations, expressions of opinion, comments, criticisms and the like. I can think of nothing else.', 'This leads me to the conclusion that the Coroner is seeking material about the ‘broad circumstances’ in which the killings took place in order to deal with rumours and suspicions that there was a ‘shoot to kill’ policy. ...', 'The recent decision of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland indicates that he is not entitled to do so. There is nothing to prevent him from calling Mr Thorburn or Mr Shaw if they can give relevant evidence touching the deaths of the deceased. But in my opinion it is not proper for Mr Thorburn to give an ‘overview’ to the jury. ...', 'The Reports are not relevant to the Coroner’s inquiry and the overriding public interest in the integrity of the criminal process makes it ‘oppressive and an abuse of the process of the Court’ to permit production of the Reports for the purpose sought by the Coroner. The writs of subpoena should be set aside for these reasons.', 'This is not a reflection or criticism of the Coroner. I am satisfied that he is genuinely concerned to deal openly with the fears and suspicions that there was a ‘shoot to kill’ policy. But the Coroner’s court is not the proper forum in which this kind of issue can properly be dealt with.', 'The third question with which I propose to deal with briefly is the claim to public interest immunity in the interests of national security ...', 'I accept that there is evidence that national security would be imperilled by the production of these two Reports. Were Mr Thorburn to use them to refresh his memory, other parties to the inquest would be entitled to call for them. ...”', '61. On 8 September 1994 the coroner issued a ruling abandoning the inquest into Gervaise McKerr’s death, stating:', '“I am satisfied that my aim in deciding to hold Inquests for the reasons I expressed to the jury when I opened the Inquests into the deaths of Toman, Burns and McKerr is no longer achievable.”', '62. On 19 August 1991 Mrs Creaney issued a writ of summons against the Chief Constable of the RUC in the High Court, claiming damages under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act (Northern Ireland) and the Fatal Accidents (Northern Ireland) Act 1977 for personal injuries, loss and damage sustained by her husband, his estate and dependants by reason of the assault, battery, conspiracy, negligence, nuisance and trespass to the person by the police officers involved in the security operation on 11 November 1982.', '63. No further steps to proceed with these claims were taken by Mrs Creaney or, since her death, by the applicant.', '64. Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 provides, inter alia:', '“1. A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting the arrest or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or persons unlawfully at large.”', 'Self-defence or the defence of others is contained within the concept of the prevention of crime (see, for example, Smith and Hogan on criminal law).', '65. The conduct of inquests in Northern Ireland is governed by the Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 and the Coroners (Practice and Procedure) Rules (Northern Ireland) 1963. These provide the framework for a procedure within which deaths by violence or in suspicious circumstances are notified to the coroner, who then has the power to hold an inquest, with or without a jury, for the purpose of ascertaining, with the assistance as appropriate of the evidence of witnesses and reports, inter alia, of post- mortem and forensic examinations, who the deceased was and how, when and where he died.', '66. According to the Coroners Act, every medical practitioner, registrar of deaths or funeral undertaker who has reason to believe a person died directly or indirectly by violence is under an obligation to inform the coroner (section 7). Every medical practitioner who performs a post-mortem examination has to notify the coroner of the result in writing (section 29). Whenever a dead body is found, or an unexplained death or death in suspicious circumstances occurs, the police of the district are required to give notice to the coroner (section 8).', '67. Rules 12 and 13 of the Coroners Rules give the coroner power to adjourn an inquest where a person may be or has been charged with murder or other specified criminal offences in relation to the deceased.', '68. Where the coroner decides to hold an inquest with a jury, persons are called from the Jury List, compiled by random computer selection from the electoral register for the district on the same basis as in criminal trials.', '69. The matters in issue at an inquest are governed by Rules 15 and 16 of the Coroners Rules:', '“15. The proceedings and evidence at an inquest shall be directed solely to ascertaining the following matters, namely: –', '(a) who the deceased was;', '(b) how, when and where the deceased came by his death;', '(c) the particulars for the time being required by the Births and Deaths Registration (Northern Ireland) Order 1976 to be registered concerning his death.', '16. Neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on questions of criminal or civil liability or on any matters other than those referred to in the last foregoing Rule.”', '70. The forms of verdict used in Northern Ireland accord with this recommendation, recording the name and other particulars of the deceased, a statement of the cause of death (for example, bullet wounds) and findings as to when and where the deceased met his death. In England and Wales, the form of verdict appended to the English Coroners Rules contains a section marked “Conclusions of the jury/coroner as to the death” in which conclusions such as “lawfully killed” or “killed unlawfully” are inserted. These findings involve expressing an opinion on criminal liability in that they involve a finding as to whether the death resulted from a criminal act, but no finding is made that any identified person was criminally liable. The jury in England and Wales may also append recommendations to their verdict.', '71. However, in Northern Ireland, the coroner is under a duty (section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1972) to furnish a written report to the DPP where the circumstances of any death appear to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed.', '72. Until recently, legal aid was not available for inquests as they did not involve the determination of civil liabilities or criminal charges. Legislation which would have provided for legal aid at the hearing of inquests (the Legal Aid, Advice and Assistance (Northern Ireland) Order 1981, Schedule 1, paragraph 5) has not been brought into force. However, on 25 July 2000 the Lord Chancellor announced the establishment of an extra-statutory ex gratia scheme to make public funding available for representation for proceedings before coroners in exceptional inquests in Northern Ireland. In March 2001 he published for consultation the criteria to be used in deciding whether applications for representation at inquests should receive public funding. These included, inter alia, consideration of financial eligibility, whether an effective investigation by the State was needed and whether the inquest was the only way to conduct it, whether the applicant required representation to be able to participate effectively in the inquest and whether the applicant had a sufficiently close relationship with the deceased.', '73. The coroner enjoys the power to summon witnesses whose presence he deems necessary at the inquest (section 17 of the Coroners Act) and he may allow any interested person to examine a witness (Rule 7). In both England and Wales and Northern Ireland, a witness is entitled to rely on the privilege against self-incrimination. In Northern Ireland, this privilege is reinforced by Rule 9(2) which provides that a person suspected of causing death may not be compelled to give evidence at the inquest.', '74. In relation to both documentary evidence and the oral evidence of witnesses, inquests, like criminal trials, are subject to the law of public interest immunity, which recognises and gives effect to the public interest, such as national security, in the non-disclosure of certain information or certain documents or classes of document. A claim of public interest immunity must be supported by a certificate.', '75. Rules 15 and 16 (see above) follow from the recommendation of the Brodrick Committee on Death Certification and Coroners:', '“... the function of an inquest should be simply to seek out and record as many of the facts concerning the death as the public interest requires, without deducing from those facts any determination of blame ... In many cases, perhaps the majority, the facts themselves will demonstrate quite clearly whether anyone bears any responsibility for the death; there is a difference between a form of proceeding which affords to others the opportunity to judge an issue and one which appears to judge the issue itself.”', '76. Domestic courts have made, inter alia, the following comments:', '“... It is noteworthy that the task is not to ascertain how the deceased died, which might raise general and far-reaching issues, but ‘how ... the deceased came by his death’, a far more limited question directed to the means by which the deceased came by his death.', '... [previous judgments] make it clear that when the Brodrick Committee stated that one of the purposes of an inquest is ‘To allay rumours or suspicions’ this purpose should be confined to allaying rumours and suspicions of how the deceased came by his death and not to allaying rumours or suspicions about the broad circumstances in which the deceased came by his death.” (Sir Thomas Bingham, MR, Court of Appeal, R. v. the Coroner for North Humberside and Scunthorpe, ex parte Roy Jamieson, April 1994, unreported)', '“The cases establish that although the word ‘how’ is to be widely interpreted, it means ‘by what means’ rather than in what broad circumstances ... In short, the inquiry must focus on matters directly causative of death and must, indeed, be confined to those matters alone ...” (Simon Brown LJ, Court of Appeal, R. v. Coroner for Western District of East Sussex, ex parte Homberg and Others (1994) 158 Justice of the Peace Reports 357)', '“... it should not be forgotten that an inquest is a fact finding exercise and not a method of apportioning guilt. The procedure and rules of evidence which are suitable for one are unsuitable for the other. In an inquest it should never be forgotten that there are no parties, no indictment, there is no prosecution, there is no defence, there is no trial, simply an attempt to establish the facts. It is an inquisitorial process, a process of investigation quite unlike a trial ...', 'It is well recognised that a purpose of an inquest is that rumour may be allayed. But that does not mean it is the duty of the Coroner to investigate at an inquest every rumour or allegation that may be brought to his attention. It is ... his duty to discharge his statutory role – the scope of his enquiry must not be allowed to drift into the uncharted seas of rumour and allegation. He will proceed safely and properly if he investigates the facts which it appears are relevant to the statutory issues before him.” (Lord Lane, Court of Appeal, R. v. South London Coroner, ex parte Thompson (1982) 126 Solicitors’ Journal 625)', '77. There was no requirement prior to 1999 for the families at inquests to receive copies of the written statements or documents submitted to the coroner during the inquest. Coroners generally adopted the practice of disclosing the statements or documents during the inquest proceedings, as the relevant witness came forward to give evidence.', '78. Following the recommendation of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, Home Office Circular no. 20/99 (concerning deaths in custody or deaths resulting from the actions of a police officer in purported execution of his duty) advised chief constables of police forces in England and Wales to make arrangements in such cases for the pre-inquest disclosure of documentary evidence to interested parties. This was to “help provide reassurance to the family of the deceased and other interested persons that a full and open police investigation has been conducted, and that they and their legal representatives will not be disadvantaged at the inquest”. It was recommended that such disclosure should take place twenty-eight days before the inquest.', '79. Paragraph 7 of the circular stated:', '“The courts have established that statements taken by the police and other documentary material produced by the police during the investigation of a death in police custody are the property of the force commissioning the investigation. The Coroner has no power to order the pre-inquest disclosure of such material ... Disclosure will therefore be on a voluntary basis.”', 'Paragraph 9 listed some kinds of material which require particular consideration before being disclosed, for example:', '– where disclosure of documents might have a prejudicial effect on possible subsequent proceedings (criminal, civil or disciplinary);', '– where the material concerns sensitive or personal information about the deceased or unsubstantiated allegations which might cause distress to the family; and', '– personal information about third parties not material to the inquest.', 'Paragraph 11 envisaged that there would be non-disclosure of the investigating officer’s report although it might be possible to disclose it in those cases which the Chief Constable considered appropriate.', '80. The police complaints procedure was governed at the relevant time by the Police (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (“the 1987 Order”). This replaced the Police Complaints Board, which had been set up in 1977 by the Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC). Since 1 October 2000, the ICPC has been replaced by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland appointed under the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998.', '81. The ICPC was an independent body, consisting of a chairman, two deputy chairmen and at least four other members. Where a complaint against the police was being investigated by a police officer or where the Chief Constable or Secretary of State considered that a criminal offence might have been committed by a police officer, the case was referred to the ICPC.', '82. Under Article 9(1)(a) of the 1987 Order, the ICPC was required to supervise the investigation of any complaint alleging that the conduct of a RUC officer had resulted in death or serious injury. Its approval was required for the appointment of the police officer to conduct the investigation and it could require the investigating officer to be replaced (Article 9(5)(b)). For a supervised investigation, a report by the investigating officer was submitted to the ICPC at the same time as to the Chief Constable. Pursuant to Article 9(8) of the 1987 Order, the ICPC issued a statement as to whether the investigation had been conducted to its satisfaction and, if not, specifying any respect in which it had not been so conducted.', '83. Under Article 10 of the 1987 Order, the Chief Constable was required to determine whether the report indicated that a criminal offence had been committed by a member of the police force. If he so decided and considered that the officer ought to be charged, he was required to send a copy of the report to the DPP. If the DPP decided not to prefer criminal charges, the Chief Constable was required to send a memorandum to the ICPC indicating whether he intended to bring disciplinary proceedings against the officer (Article 10(5)), save where disciplinary proceedings had been brought and the police officer had admitted the charges (Article 11(1)). Where the Chief Constable considered that a criminal offence had been committed but that the offence was not such that the police officer should be charged or where he considered that no criminal offence had been committed, he was required to send a memorandum indicating whether he intended to bring disciplinary charges and, if not, his reasons for not proposing to do so (Article 11(6) and (7)).', '84. If the ICPC considered that a police officer subject to investigation ought to be charged with a criminal offence, it could direct the Chief Constable to send the DPP a copy of the report on that investigation (Article 12(2)). It could also recommend or direct the Chief Constable to prefer such disciplinary charges as the ICPC specified (Article 13(1) and (3)).', '85. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), appointed pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1972 (“the 1972 Order”), is an independent officer with at least ten years’ experience of the practice of law in Northern Ireland who is appointed by the Attorney-General and who holds office until retirement, subject only to dismissal for misconduct. His duties under Article 5 of the 1972 Order are, inter alia:', '“(a) to consider, or cause to be considered, with a view to his initiating or continuing in Northern Ireland any criminal proceedings or the bringing of any appeal or other proceedings in or in connection with any criminal cause or matter in Northern Ireland, any facts or information brought to his notice, whether by the Chief Constable acting in pursuance of Article 6(3) of this Order or by the Attorney General or by any other authority or person;', '(b) to examine or cause to be examined all documents that are required under Article 6 of this Order to be transmitted or furnished to him and where it appears to him to be necessary or appropriate to do so to cause any matter arising thereon to be further investigated;', '(c) where he thinks proper to initiate, undertake and carry on, on behalf of the Crown, proceedings for indictable offences and for such summary offences or classes of summary offences as he considers should be dealt with by him.”', '86. Article 6 of the 1972 Order requires, inter alia, coroners and the Chief Constable of the RUC to provide information to the DPP as follows:', '“(2) Where the circumstances of any death investigated or being investigated by a coroner appear to him to disclose that a criminal offence may have been committed he shall as soon as practicable furnish to the [DPP] a written report of those circumstances.', '(3) It shall be the duty of the Chief Constable, from time to time, to furnish to the [DPP] facts and information with respect to –', '(a) indictable offences [such as murder] alleged to have been committed against the law of Northern Ireland; ...', 'and at the request of the [DPP], to ascertain and furnish to the [DPP] information regarding any matter which may appear to the [DPP] to require investigation on the ground that it may involve an offence against the law of Northern Ireland or information which may appear to the [DPP] to be necessary for the discharge of his functions under this Order.”', '87. According to the Government’s observations submitted on 18 June 1998, it had been the practice of successive DPPs to refrain from giving reasons for decisions not to institute or proceed with criminal prosecutions other than in the most general terms. This practice was based upon the consideration that:', '(i) if reasons were given in one or more cases, they would be required to be given in all. Otherwise, erroneous conclusions might be drawn in relation to those cases where reasons were refused, involving either unjust implications regarding the guilt of some individuals or suspicions of malpractice;', '(ii) the reason not to prosecute might often be the unavailability of a particular item of evidence essential to establish the case (for example, sudden death or flight of a witness or intimidation). To indicate such a factor as the sole reason for not prosecuting might lead to assumptions of guilt in the public estimation;', '(iii) the publication of the reasons might cause pain or damage to persons other than the suspect (for example, the assessment of the credibility or mental condition of the victim or other witnesses);', '(iv) in a substantial category of cases, decisions not to prosecute were based on the DPP’s assessment of the public interest. Where the sole reason not to prosecute was the age, mental or physical health of the suspect, publication would not be appropriate and could lead to unjust implications;', '(v) there might be considerations of national security which affected the safety of individuals (for example, where no prosecution could safely or fairly be brought without disclosing information which would be of assistance to terrorist organisations, would impair the effectiveness of the counter-terrorist operations of the security forces or endanger the lives of such personnel and their families or informants).', '88. Decisions of the DPP not to prosecute have been subject to applications for judicial review in the High Court.', 'In R. v. DPP, ex parte C (1995) 1 Criminal Appeal Reports 141, Lord Justice Kennedy held, concerning a decision of the DPP not to prosecute in an alleged case of buggery:', '“From all of those decisions it seems to me that in the context of the present case this court can be persuaded to act if and only if it is demonstrated to us that the Director of Public Prosecutions acting through the Crown Prosecution Service arrived at the decision not to prosecute:', '(1) because of some unlawful policy (such as the hypothetical decision in Blackburn not to prosecute where the value of goods stolen was below £100);', '(2) because the Director of Public Prosecutions failed to act in accordance with his own settled policy as set out in the code; or', '(3) because the decision was perverse. It was a decision at which no reasonable prosecutor could have arrived.”', '89. In the case of R. v. the DPP and Others, ex parte Timothy Jones, the Divisional Court on 22 March 2000 quashed a decision not to prosecute for alleged gross negligence causing a death in dock unloading on the basis that the reasons given by the DPP – that the evidence was not sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of satisfying a jury – required further explanation.', '90. R. v. DPP, ex parte Patricia Manning and Elizabeth Manning (decision of the Divisional Court of 17 May 2000), concerned the DPP’s decision not to prosecute any prison officer for manslaughter in respect of the death of a prisoner, although the inquest jury had reached a verdict of unlawful death – there was evidence that prison officers had used a neck lock which was forbidden and dangerous. The DPP reviewing the case still concluded that the Crown would be unable to establish manslaughter from gross negligence. The Lord Chief Justice noted:', '“Authority makes clear that a decision by the Director not to prosecute is susceptible to judicial review: see, for example, R. v. Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte C [1995] 1 Cr. App. R. 136. But, as the decided cases also make clear, the power of review is one to be sparingly exercised. The reasons for this are clear. The primary decision to prosecute or not to prosecute is entrusted by Parliament to the Director as head of an independent, professional prosecuting service, answerable to the Attorney General in his role as guardian of the public interest, and to no-one else. It makes no difference that in practice the decision will ordinarily be taken by a senior member of the CPS, as it was here, and not by the Director personally. In any borderline case the decision may be one of acute difficulty, since while a defendant whom a jury would be likely to convict should properly be brought to justice and tried, a defendant whom a jury would be likely to acquit should not be subjected to the trauma inherent in a criminal trial. If, in a case such as the present, the Director’s provisional decision is not to prosecute, that decision will be subject to review by Senior Treasury Counsel who will exercise an independent professional judgment. The Director and his officials (and Senior Treasury Counsel when consulted) will bring to their task of deciding whether to prosecute an experience and expertise which most courts called upon to review their decisions could not match. In most cases the decision will turn not on an analysis of the relevant legal principles but on the exercise of an informed judgment of how a case against a particular defendant, if brought, would be likely to fare in the context of a criminal trial before (in a serious case such as this) a jury. This exercise of judgment involves an assessment of the strength, by the end of the trial, of the evidence against the defendant and of the likely defences. It will often be impossible to stigmatise a judgment on such matters as wrong even if one disagrees with it. So the courts will not easily find that a decision not to prosecute is bad in law, on which basis alone the court is entitled to interfere. At the same time, the standard of review should not be set too high, since judicial review is the only means by which the citizen can seek redress against a decision not to prosecute and if the test were too exacting an effective remedy would be denied.”', 'As regards whether the DPP had a duty to give reasons, the Lord Chief Justice said:', '“It is not contended that the Director is subject to an obligation to give reasons in every case in which he decides not to prosecute. Even in the small and very narrowly defined cases which meet Mr Blake’s conditions set out above, we do not understand domestic law or the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights to impose an absolute and unqualified obligation to give reasons for a decision not to prosecute. But the right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights. It is put at the forefront of the Convention. The power to derogate from it is very limited. The death of a person in the custody of the State must always arouse concern, as recognised by section 8(1)(c), (3)(b) and (6) of the Coroner’s Act 1988, and if the death resulted from violence inflicted by agents of the State that concern must be profound. The holding of an inquest in public by an independent judicial official, the coroner, in which interested parties are able to participate must in our view be regarded as a full and effective inquiry (see McCann v. United Kingdom [1996] 21 EHRR 97, paragraphs 159 to 164). Where such an inquest following a proper direction to the jury culminates in a lawful verdict of unlawful killing implicating a person who, although not named in the verdict, is clearly identified, who is living and whose whereabouts are known, the ordinary expectation would naturally be that a prosecution would follow. In the absence of compelling grounds for not giving reasons, we would expect the Director to give reasons in such a case: to meet the reasonable expectation of interested parties that either a prosecution would follow or a reasonable explanation for not prosecuting be given, to vindicate the Director’s decision by showing that solid grounds exist for what might otherwise appear to be a surprising or even inexplicable decision and to meet the European Court’s expectation that if a prosecution is not to follow a plausible explanation will be given. We would be very surprised if such a general practice were not welcome to Members of Parliament whose constituents have died in such circumstances. We readily accept that such reasons would have to be drawn with care and skill so as to respect third party and public interests and avoid undue prejudice to those who would have no opportunity to defend themselves. We also accept that time and skill would be needed to prepare a summary which was reasonably brief but did not distort the true basis of the decision. But the number of cases which meet Mr Blake’s conditions is very small (we were told that since 1981, including deaths in police custody, there have been seven such cases), and the time and expense involved could scarcely be greater than that involved in resisting an application for judicial review. In any event it would seem to be wrong in principle to require the citizen to make a complaint of unlawfulness against the Director in order to obtain a response which good administrative practice would in the ordinary course require.”', 'On this basis, the court reviewed whether the reasons given by the DPP in that case were in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and capable of supporting a decision not to prosecute. It found that the decision had failed to take relevant matters into account and that this vitiated the decision not to prosecute. The decision was quashed and the DPP was required to reconsider his decision whether or not to prosecute.', '91. On 7 June 2000 in the case of an application by David Adams for judicial review, the High Court in Northern Ireland considered the applicant’s claim that the DPP had failed to give adequate and intelligible reasons for his decision not to prosecute any police officer concerned in the arrest during which he had suffered serious injuries and for which in civil proceedings he had obtained an award of damages against the police. It noted that there was no statutory obligation on the DPP under the 1972 Order to give reasons and considered that no duty to give reasons could be implied. The fact that the DPP in England and Wales had in a number of cases furnished detailed reasons, whether from increasing concern for transparency or in the interests of the victim’s families, was a matter for his discretion. It concluded on the basis of authorities that only in exceptional cases such as the Manning case (see paragraph 90 above) would the DPP be required to furnish reasons to a victim for failing to prosecute and that review should be limited to where the principles identified by Lord Justice Kennedy (see paragraph 88 above) were infringed. Notwithstanding the findings in the civil case, it was not persuaded that the DPP had acted in such an aberrant, inexplicable or irrational manner that the case cried out for reasons to be furnished as to why he had so acted.', '92. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (UN Force and Firearms Principles) were adopted on 7 September 1990 by the 8th United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.', '93. Paragraph 9 of the UN Force and Firearms Principles provides, inter alia, that the “intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life”.', '94. Other relevant provisions read as follows:', '“... law enforcement officials shall identify themselves as such and shall give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warnings to be observed, unless to do so would unduly place the law enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the incident.”', '“... Governments and law enforcement agencies shall ensure that an effective review process is available and that independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to exercise jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances. In cases of death and serious injury or other grave consequences, a detailed report shall be sent promptly to the competent authorities responsible for administrative review and judicial control.”', '“Persons affected by the use of force and firearms or their legal representatives shall have access to an independent process, including a judicial process. In the event of the death of such persons, this provision shall apply to their dependants accordingly.”', '95. Paragraph 9 of the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (UN Principles on Extra-legal Executions), adopted on 24 May 1989 by the Economic and Social Council in Resolution 1989/65, provides, inter alia:', '“There shall be a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where complaints by relatives or other reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances. ...”', '96. Paragraphs 10 to 17 of the UN Principles on Extra-legal Executions contain a series of detailed requirements that should be observed by investigative procedures into such deaths.', 'Paragraph 10 states, inter alia:', '“The investigative authority shall have the power to obtain all the information necessary to the inquiry. Those persons conducting the inquiry ... shall also have the authority to oblige officials allegedly involved in any such executions to appear and testify. ...”', 'Paragraph 11 specifies:', '“In cases in which the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of a lack of expertise or impartiality, because of the importance of the matter or because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse, and in cases where there are complaints from the family of the victim about these inadequacies or other substantial reasons, Governments shall pursue investigations through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure. Members of such a commission shall be chosen for their recognised impartiality, competence and independence as individuals. In particular, they shall be independent of any institution, agency or person that may be the subject of the inquiry. The commission shall have the authority to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry and shall conduct the inquiry as provided in these Principles.”', 'Paragraph 16 provides, inter alia:', '“Families of the deceased and their legal representatives shall be informed of, and have access to, any hearing as well as all information relevant to the investigation and shall be entitled to present other evidence. ...”', 'Paragraph 17 provides, inter alia:', '“A written report shall be made within a reasonable time on the methods and findings of such investigations. The report shall be made public immediately and shall include the scope of the inquiry, procedures, methods used to evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and recommendations based on findings of fact and on applicable law. ...”', '97. The “Minnesota Protocol” (model protocol for a legal investigation of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, contained in the United Nations Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions) provides, inter alia, in Section B on the “Purposes of an inquiry”:', '“As set out in paragraph 9 of the Principles, the broad purpose of an inquiry is to discover the truth about the events leading to the suspicious death of a victim. To fulfil that purpose, those conducting the inquiry shall, at a minimum, seek:', '(a) to identify the victim;', '(b) to recover and preserve evidentiary material related to the death to aid in any potential prosecution of those responsible;', '(c) to identify possible witnesses and obtain statements from them concerning the death;', '(d) to determine the cause, manner, location and time of death, as well as any pattern or practice that may have brought about the death;', '(e) to distinguish between natural death, accidental death, suicide and homicide;', '(f) to identify and apprehend the person(s) involved in the death;', '(g) to bring the suspected perpetrator(s) before a competent court established by law.”', 'In Section D, it is stated that “in cases where government involvement is suspected, an objective and impartial investigation may not be possible unless a special commission of inquiry is established”.', '98. In the report on its visit to the United Kingdom and the Isle of Man from 8 to 17 September 1997, published on 13 January 2000, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) reviewed the system of preferring criminal and disciplinary charges against police officers accused of ill-treatment. It commented, inter alia, on the statistically few criminal prosecutions and disciplinary proceedings which were brought, and identified certain aspects of the procedures which cast doubt on their effectiveness.', 'The chief officers appointed officers from the same force to conduct the investigations, save in exceptional cases where they appointed an officer from another force, and the majority of investigations were unsupervised by the Police Complaints Authority.', 'The report stated in paragraph 55 et seq.:', '“As already indicated, the CPT itself entertains reservations about whether the PCA [Police Complaints Authority], even equipped with the enhanced powers which have been proposed, will be capable of persuading public opinion that complaints against the police are vigorously investigated. In the view of the CPT, the creation of a fully-fledged independent investigating agency would be a most welcome development. Such a body should certainly, like the PCA, have the power to direct that disciplinary proceedings be instigated against police officers. Further, in the interests of bolstering public confidence, it might also be thought appropriate that such a body be invested with the power to remit a case directly to the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for consideration of whether or not criminal proceedings should be brought.', 'In any event, the CPT recommends that the role of the ‘chief officer’ within the existing system be reviewed. To take the example of one Metropolitan Police officer to whom certain of the chief officer’s functions have been delegated (the Director of the CIB [Criminal Investigations Bureau]), he is currently expected to: seek dispensations from the PCA; appoint investigating police officers and assume managerial responsibility for their work; determine whether an investigating officer’s report indicates that a criminal offence may have been committed; decide whether to bring disciplinary proceedings against a police officer on the basis of an investigating officer’s report, and liaise with the PCA on this question; determine which disciplinary charges should be brought against an officer who is to face charges; in civil cases, negotiate settlement strategies and authorise payments into court. It is doubtful whether it is realistic to expect any single official to be able to perform all of these functions in an entirely independent and impartial way.', '57. ... Reference should also be made to the high degree of public interest in CPS decisions regarding the prosecution of police officers (especially in cases involving allegations of serious misconduct). Confidence about the manner in which such decisions are reached would certainly be strengthened were the CPS to be obliged to give detailed reasons in cases where it was decided that no criminal proceedings should be brought. The CPT recommends that such a requirement be introduced.”']",['2'],[],[],"['13', '14']",[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1963 and 1959 respectively and live in Vienna.', ""7. The applicants live together in a homosexual relationship. The second applicant is a civil servant and, for the purpose of accident and sickness insurance cover, he is insured with the Civil Servants Insurance Corporation (“the CSIC”) (Versicherungsanstalt Öffentlicher Bediensteter). On 1 July 1997 the first applicant asked the CSIC to recognise him as the dependent (Angehöriger) and to extend the second applicant's insurance cover to include him. He submitted that section 56(6) of the Civil Servants Sickness and Accident Insurance Act (“the CSSAIA”) (Beamten-Kranken- und Unfallversicherungsgesetz) only referred to persons of the opposite sex living with the principally insured person and running the common household without receiving any payment. But, because there were no good reasons for excluding persons living in a homosexual relationship from the privilege of extended insurance cover, section 56(6) should be interpreted as also including homosexual partners."", '8. On 2 September 1997 the CSIC dismissed the request, holding that, because the first applicant was of the same sex as the second applicant, his request had to be dismissed. This decision was served on the second applicant who, on 1 October 1997, filed an objection.', '9. On 21 November 1997 the Mayor of Vienna, acting as the Regional Governor, quashed the decision on procedural grounds. He held that the CSIC should have served its decision on the first applicant.', '10. On 13 January 1998 the CSIC dismissed a request by the first applicant and this time served the decision on him. The first applicant filed objections.', ""11. The mayor of Vienna confirmed the CSIC's decision on 19 March 1998. Thereupon the first applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court in which he argued that the exclusion, under section 56(6) of the CSSAIA, of homosexual couples from the extension of insurance cover was in breach of Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 8, of the Convention and was therefore unconstitutional."", ""12. On 15 June 1998 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the first applicant's complaint. Referring to its previous case-law, the Constitutional Court found that, in the issue at hand, the legislator had had a very wide margin in which to reach a decision and the decision taken had been within that margin."", '13. On an unspecified date the Constitutional Court granted a request by the first applicant for the case to be transferred to the Administrative Court. On 7 September 1998 the first applicant supplemented his complaint to the Administrative Court.', ""14. On 4 October 2001 the Administrative Court dismissed the first applicant's complaint. It found that the authorities had correctly concluded that section 56(6) of the CSSAIA only applied to heterosexual partnerships. There was no issue under Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 8, of the Convention, because Article 8 did not guarantee specific social rights, and the case at issue did not therefore fall within the ambit of that provision. The exclusion of homosexual partnerships from the scope of section 56(6) of the CSSAIA also complied with the principle of equality because that difference in treatment was justified. While it was true that, where persons of different sex living together in a household in which one of them was running that household while not being gainfully employed, it was, as a rule, safe to conclude that they were cohabiting in a partnership, that was not the case if two persons of the same sex were living together in a household. In the absence of any possibility to register a homosexual partnership, it would have been necessary to undertake delicate enquiries into the most intimate sphere of the person concerned. That difference in the factual situation justified different treatment in law."", '15. In proceedings instituted by the Constitutional Court to examine the constitutionality of two similar provisions to section 56(6) of the CSSAIA relating to extending insurance cover to relatives, on 10 October 2005 the Constitutional Court decided to quash section 123(8b) of the General Social Security Act (“the GSSA”) (Allgemeines Sozial-versicherungsgesetz) and section 83(3) of the Social Security Act for Trade and Commerce (“the TCSSA”) (Gewerbliches Sozialversicherungsgesetz). The Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Karner v. Austria (see Karner v. Austria, no. 40016/98, 24 July 2003) and held that the two provisions in which the extension of insurance cover to unrelated persons living with the insured were discriminatory because they were restricted to persons of the opposite sex.', '16. On 1 August 2006 the Social Rights Amendment Act (“the SRAA”) (Sozialrechts-Änderungsgesetz) entered into force amending in particular the GSSA, the TCSSA and also section 56 of the CSSAIA. A second amendment to section 56 of the CSSAIA entered into force on 1 July 2007.', '17. Before 1 August 2006 section 56(6) of the Civil Servants Sickness and Accident Insurance Act (Beamten-, Kranken- und Unfallversicherungs-gesetz), in so far as relevant, provided as follows:', '“(1) Relatives are entitled to benefits, if they have their ordinary residence in Austria and are neither health insured under the provisions of this Act nor any other provision of law ...', '...', '(6) A person belonging to the group of parents, ... step-parents and foster parents, children, ... stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren or brothers and sisters of the insured or a person of the opposite sex who is not related to him or her who has been living with him or her in the same household for at least ten months and since then has been doing the domestic work for the insured without payment, unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work, shall be regarded as a member of the household. Only one person can be a member in this sense.”', '18. After the amendment to the Civil Servants Sickness and Accident Insurance Act on 1 August 2006, section 56(6) remained the same, but a new paragraph (6a) was introduced. It read as follows;', '“A person who is not a relative of the insured and who has been living with him or her in the same household for at least ten month and since then is doing the domestic work for him or her without payment, unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work, shall be regarded as a member of the common household, if', '(a) he or she is bringing up one or more children living in the same household ... or did so for at least four years;', '(b) he or she is entitled to benefits for the payment of nursing care (at least level 4) pursuant to section 5 of the Federal Nursing Care Benefits Act or pursuant to the provisions of the Regional Nursing Care Benefits Act;', '(c) he or she is doing nursing work for the insured who is entitled to benefits (at least level 4) for the payment of nursing care pursuant to the Federal Nursing Care Benefits Act or pursuant to the provisions of the Regional Nursing Care Benefits Act.”', '19. On 1 July 2007 a further amendment to the Civil Servants Sickness and Accident Insurance Act entered into force. Section 56(6) no longer applied to non-related persons, but only to relatives of the insured. The newly introduced paragraph 6a was only slightly modified. These provisions, in so far as relevant, read as follows:', '“(6) A person belonging to the group of parents, ... step-parents and foster parents, children, ... stepchildren and foster children, grandchildren or brothers and sisters of the insured who has been living with him or her in the same household for at least ten months and since then has been doing the domestic work for the insured without payment, unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work, shall be regarded as a member of the household. He or she shall also be considered a member if he or she is no longer able to do the domestic work. Only one person can be a member in this sense.', '(6a) A person who is not a relative of the insured and who has been living with him or her in the same household for at least ten month and since then has been doing the domestic work for him or her without payment, unless there is a spouse living in the same household who is able to work, shall be regarded as a member of the common household, if', '(a) he or she is bringing up one or more children living in the same household ... or did so for at least four years, or', '(b) he or she is doing nursing work for the insured who is entitled to public benefits at least level 4 pursuant to the Federal Nursing Care Benefits Act or pursuant to the provisions of the Regional Nursing Care Benefits Act.”', '20. The last amendment to the Civil Servants Sickness and Accident Insurance Act which entered into force on 1 July 2007 was accompanied by a transitory provision. Section 217(3) and (4) read as follows:', '“(3) Persons of the opposite sex and not related to the insured, who, pursuant to section 56(6) as in force on 30 June 2007, had been entitled to benefits as relatives and who on that date had already reached twenty-seven years of age remain entitled to benefits as relatives until the relevant circumstances change.', '(4) Persons of the opposite sex and not related to the insured, who, pursuant to section 56(6) as in force on 30 June 2007, had been entitled to benefits as relatives and who on that date had not yet reached twenty-seven years of age remain entitled to benefits as relatives until the relevant circumstances change, but at most until 31 December 2010.”']","['14', '8']",[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Istanbul. He is the widower of the deceased Sariye Yılmaz. He introduced this application on his own behalf and on behalf of his family and deceased spouse. At the time of the events at issue the applicant was residing in the village of Bayırlı (Karıncak) attached to the Lice district.', ""10. In June 1996 the commander of the Lice Gendarme Station, Hacı İlbaş, ordered all the villagers from Bayırlı village to evacuate their homes. This instruction was communicated to the villagers by the headman (muhtar) of the village. In response, the villagers requested the commander's permission to remain in the village long enough to harvest their crops."", '11. Commander Hacı İlbaş began to pressurise and intimidate the villagers. No cars were allowed in or out of the village. The livestock was taken away from the villagers. A food embargo was imposed. At the beginning of October 1996 soldiers told the villagers that should they fail to evacuate the village by 15 October, their houses would be burned down.', ""12. On 7 October 1996 an armed clash broke out between members of the PKK (proscribed as a terrorist organisation under Turkish law) and the security forces stationed on Cüm Hill, which is situated between the applicant's village and Lice."", ""13. When the clash was over, at about 3 a.m. soldiers who were stationed at the Lice Boarding School fired four artillery shells towards the village. A piece of shrapnel wounded one of the villagers, Hürriyet Doğan, in the foot. Hearing Hürriyet Doğan's screams, the applicant attempted to leave his house to help her. However his wife, Sariye Yılmaz, tried to pull him back. At that moment a second artillery shell landed six to seven metres from their house and a piece of shrapnel struck the applicant's wife in the abdomen."", '14. Around 5 p.m., when the shooting was over, the applicant and his elder brother, Adil Yılmaz, together with some other relatives, Mehmet Tataş, Ramazan Yaşar, Abdullah Doğan and a group of women set out for Lice in order to take Sariye Yılmaz to the local health clinic. She died on the way.', ""15. On 7 October 1996 a group of terrorists attacked the security forces which were stationed near the village of Bayırlı in the Lice district. At around 4.30 a.m. terrorists tried to escape through the village. When they arrived in Bayırlı the terrorists fired randomly at the houses. The applicant's wife and another villager were wounded in the incident. The security forces identified the footprints of members of the PKK in the village."", ""16. When the applicant and his relatives were returning to their village they were stopped on Cüm Hill by the security forces. The senior lieutenant examined the corpse of the applicant's wife. According to the applicant, the senior lieutenant drafted a report which stated that Sariye Yılmaz had died due to a shrapnel wound caused by an artillery shell fired by the soldiers. However, the applicant did not submit this report to the Court and the Government claimed that it did not exist."", 'The applicant requested to have an autopsy performed before burying the corpse. The senior lieutenant told him that there was no need to carry out an autopsy and reassured him that his report would be given to the relevant authorities.', ""17. On 7 October 1996 Sergeant Nuri Yüksel and a unit of soldiers arrived in the village to investigate the circumstances of the incident. Four villagers, namely Abdullah Doğan, Hürriyet Doğan, Ahmet Doğan and Sait Doğan, gave statements to the sergeant. They all stated that at around 3 a.m., 25 to 30 terrorists arrived in the village and indiscriminately opened fire with rockets and long-barrel guns. Hürriyet Doğan had been wounded and the applicant's wife had died in the incident."", '18. According to the applicant, he expressly told the sergeant that the artillery shell that caused the death of his wife had been fired by the soldiers. He also told the sergeant that the senior lieutenant had seen the corpse and confirmed this fact in his report. The sergeant contacted the senior lieutenant by radio. According to the applicant, the senior lieutenant verbally confirmed his version of the facts.', '19. The sergeant drew a sketch map of the scene of the incident and drafted two incident reports. The more detailed report stated as follows:', ""“... When the members of the PKK failed to strike the security forces, they ran away towards Bayırlı village. When they entered the village, they yelled 'you still have not evacuated the village! Because of you very many of us have been wounded and we have lost very many soldiers!' and they started to shoot at random using heavy weapons and missile launchers. ... two persons were wounded. Two of the places where the missiles fell, as well as bullet marks on the houses, have been noted. Moreover, according to the footprints left by the PKK members they ran off towards the forest near the village. As far as it could be construed by looking at the footprints, they were around 25-30 people. ...”"", 'The houses of the applicant and the other witnesses, the sites where the shells fell and the footprints of members of the PKK were indicated in the sketch map. All the statements and reports were co-signed by Sergeant Nuri Yüksel and non-commissioned officer Yusuf Denden.', ""20. Upon the applicant's request to have an autopsy carried out on the corpse, the sergeant told him that this was not possible, as the public prosecutor and the doctor refused to come to the village for security reasons. He reassured the applicant that he would make sure that the senior lieutenant's report was forwarded to the public prosecutor. Later on the same day, the applicant buried his wife."", ""21. On 8 October 1996 Feyzi Doğan, the father of Hürriyet Doğan, and the applicant gave statements to the sergeant. The applicant's statement was as follows:"", ""“On 7 October 1996, at around 3 a.m., I heard guns being fired from the direction of Cüm Hill, which is located to the south of our village. Everybody was sleeping. I went out of the house. It was silent in the village. At around 4 a.m. I heard [people] screaming in the village. These sounds were coming from a distance. Then I heard firing coming from the village. My wife came outside to look for me. There was random gun fire. My wife was wounded in the abdomen. I took her into the house but I wasn't able to do anything as the shooting continued. I waited at home until 5 a.m. When the shooting was over I called my relatives and we set off for Lice in order to take my wife to the hospital. She died when we reached Cüm Hill. After a short while another group of people who was transporting Hürriyet Doğan came along. They went to Lice. We returned to Bayırlı village. We buried my wife in the village ...”"", ""“... terrorists were shouting in the middle of the village. After yelling 'you still have not evacuated the village! Because of you very many of us have been wounded and we have lost very many soldiers!' They started to shoot at random. ... My daughter Hürriyet Doğan was wounded in her foot. I saw three of the terrorists with my own eyes. I believe there were in total twenty to thirty people. ... After we waited for a while we set off for Lice. ... When we were almost on Cüm Hill we saw another wounded person being transported. ... I am complaining about those terrorists who attacked our village and who are responsible for wounding my daughter.”"", '22. A preliminary investigation into the incident was initiated by the Lice Public Prosecutor.', ""23. On 10 October 1996 the applicant went to see the Lice Gendarmerie Commander, Hacı İlbaş. The applicant alleged that Hacı İlbaş prepared a petition for him, the contents of which laid blame on the PKK for the incident. He refused to sign it. On 15 October 1996 Hacı İlbaş sent all the documents concerning the incident to the office of the Lice Public Prosecutor along with an explanatory letter. In his letter he explained that the death of Sariye Yılmaz and Hürriyet Doğan's injuries were the result of random shooting by the terrorists. The annexed documents consisted of five witness statements, two incident reports and one medical report about Hürriyet Doğan's state of health, drafted on 7 October 1997 by a doctor at the Lice Health Clinic."", '24. On 16 October 1996 the applicant filed petitions with the offices of the Diyarbakır District Governor and the State of Emergency Region Governor. He stated that his wife had died during an artillery attack launched from the direction of the Lice Boarding School. A senior lieutenant, after examining the corpse, confirmed that she had been killed by artillery fire. He further stated that he had had to move to Diyarbakır with his seven children following the evacuation of his village. The applicant requested that an investigation be initiated in order to find those responsible. He also requested compensation.', '25. On 19 October 1996 the applicant filed similar petitions with the Diyarbakır State Security Court and the Lice Public Prosecutor. On the same day he went to see the Lice Public Prosecutor and the Lice District Governor personally.', ""26. On 21 October 1996 the applicant submitted a petition to the Lice Governorship about the death of Sariye Yılmaz. In the petition he stated that his wife died on 7 October 1996 during an operation carried out against terrorists. Moreover, he stated that neither the public prosecutor nor a doctor had examined the corpse. The Lice Governor transferred the applicant's petition to the Registry Office. On the same day the Registry Office requested the Lice District Gendarmerie to provide information about the death of Sariye Yılmaz."", '27. On 23 October 1996 the Lice District Gendarmerie informed the Registry Office in a letter that Sariye Yılmaz had been wounded on 7 October 1996 due to random shooting by terrorists who entered the village, that she died while being transferred to a hospital and that she had been buried in the village cemetery. The district gendarmerie had also provided the Registry Office with reports and written statements which confirmed the accuracy of these findings.', ""28. Following the applicant's petitions filed with the Lice Public Prosecutor and the Lice District Governor, the Lice Social Help and Solidarity Fund decided to grant the applicant the sum of 15,000,000 Turkish liras. This sum was paid to the applicant on 1 November 1996."", '29. On 5 November 1996 the applicant filed petitions with the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In these petitions he maintained that his wife died during an artillery attack by the security forces and he requested that an investigation be initiated into the killing of his wife. He stated that he was stunned to find out that in the case file at the office of the Lice Public Prosecutor the perpetrators of the incident were stated to be members of the PKK. Moreover, he maintained that he had had to move to Diyarbakır with his seven children following the evacuation of his village. The applicant also informed the authorities in his petition that he would lodge an application with the European Commission of Human Rights.', ""30. On 13 December 1996 the Lice Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction as the death of the applicant's wife fell within the jurisdiction of the Diyarbakır State Security Court. In his decision the public prosecutor maintained that after engaging in a combat with the security forces, terrorists retreated to Bayırlı village. When they arrived in the village they started shooting at random using large weapons to force the villagers to evacuate. The applicant's wife was killed as a result of this random shooting."", '31. On 17 December 1996 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court also issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case file back to the office of the Lice Public Prosecutor. The decision on lack of jurisdiction indicated that Sariye Yılmaz was killed by an artillery shell fired from the Lice Boarding School.', ""32. On 25 March 1997 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court, seeing that an investigation had already been initiated by his office into the same incident, decided to join the two case files within the jurisdiction of the Lice Public Prosecutor's Office. The decision joining the case files named the defendant(s) as “member(s) of the illegal PKK organisation” and the offence as “engaging in acts aimed at the separation of a part of the territory of the State”."", '33. On 20 February 1998 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court issued a search warrant for the terrorist(s) who wounded Hürriyet Doğan and killed Sariye Yılmaz on 7 October 1996. According to this order the Lice Public Prosecutor, together with the Lice District Gendarmerie and the Diyarbakır Security Directorate, had to carry out a rigorous investigation so as to identify the perpetrator(s) by the date fixed for the expiry of the warrant. He further requested to be kept informed of the outcome of the investigation every three months.', ""34. On 9 September 1998 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court requested from the Registry Office a copy of Sariye Yilmaz's details of birth. On 21 September 1998 the Registry Office submitted the information requested."", '35. By a letter dated 5 October 1999, the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court requested the Lice Public Prosecutor to conduct an investigation in order to identify the officials who had failed to carry out an autopsy on Sariye Yılmaz.', ""36. By a letter dated 6 October 1999 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court, referring to the applicant's application to the European Commission of Human Rights, requested authorisation from the Ministry of Justice to initiate an investigation against the Lice Public Prosecutor who had failed to organise an autopsy on the applicant's wife's body."", '37. On 1 November 1999 and on 13 December 2000 the public prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court renewed the warrant issued on 20 February 1998.', ""38. On 12 February 2001, in accordance with Law no. 4616, the Lice Public Prosecutor postponed the criminal proceedings initiated against Sergeant Nuri Yüksel and the non-commissioned officer Yusuf Denden who had allegedly failed to carry out an autopsy on the applicant's wife's body."", ""39. On 23 July 2001, upon the Lice District Governor's inquiry, the Lice Gendarmerie Commander sent him a letter stating that it was clear from the incident report and the witness statements that the applicant's wife was killed by members of the PKK. He maintained that there was no documentation in their files which proved that, after examining the corpse of the applicant's wife, a senior lieutenant drafted a report in which the cause of death was described as resulting from artillery shell fire. Moreover, he stated that the letter sent by them to the Registry Office in which the PKK was stated to be responsible for the death of Sariye Yılmaz, had not been found in their files. However, he indicated that this letter could be located at the Registry Office."", ""40. On 3 August 2001 a letter from the gendarmerie headquarters in Ankara was sent to the Ministry of Interior Affaires. The letter was a reply to an inquiry made by the Ministry of Foreign Affaires following the communication of the applicant's case by the Court to the respondent Government. It was stated in the letter that on 7 October 1996, following an armed clash between terrorists and the security forces, terrorists fled to Bayırlı village and killed the applicant's wife by firing at random with rockets and long-barrel guns in the middle of the village. Moreover, it was incorrect that a senior lieutenant had examined the corpse of the applicant's wife and drafted a report which concluded that she had died due to a shrapnel wound caused by an artillery shell fired by soldiers. Such a report did not exist. It was apparent from the witness statements and from the incident report that the perpetrators of the incident were members of the PKK. It was also stated in the letter that the Lice Gendarmerie Command submitted the document concerning the death of Sariye Yılmaz to the Registry Office."", '41.

The applicant church is a San Marinese church institution.', '9. On 7 March 1985 the San Marinese government issued an expropriation order in respect of certain plots of land belonging to the applicant church. The latter was awarded 114,790,590 Italian lire (about 59,284 euros) in compensation. The land, which was earmarked for urban development projects that were scheduled for completion by 31 December 1987, was only partially used. On 16 February 1987 the applicant church applied to the government seeking to recover possession of the unused land. On 20 October 1987 the government refused the application on the ground that the land in question could still be used in the interests of the community.', '10. On 10 November 1988, relying on section 14(3) of Law no. 18 of 25 March 1980 (“Law no. 18/1980”), which provides that expropriation orders lapse in the event of expiry of the deadline set for completion of the relevant work, the applicant church brought an action before the first-instance civil judge (Commissario della Legge) to recover possession. The first hearing, which was set for 19 January 1989, could not be held on that date as the government had not been notified. The government joined the proceedings on 5 May 1989. At a hearing on 23 September 1989, the government requested that a particular witness be heard. That request was granted on 12 January 1990. On the date in question, namely 5 April 1990, the witness failed to attend the hearing. On 26 September 1990 the government waived its right to have the witness heard. The parties submitted their written pleadings on 23 May 1991. Preparation of the case was concluded on 14 November 1991.', '11. By a judgment of 14 January 1992, deposited at the registry on the same date, the court dismissed the applicant church’s request on the grounds that, firstly, the expropriation order of 20 October 1987 was an administrative act and thus fell outside the civil court’s jurisdiction and, secondly, that the applicant church could not bring an action to recover possession, since the disputed land had been lawfully expropriated and had not been obtained by the State without title.', '12. On 12 March 1992 the applicant church brought an action before the judge of civil appeals (Giudice delle Appellazioni Civili) to establish title to land, seeking to obtain restitution of the land in question in accordance with section 14(3) of Law no. 18/1980. It also alleged that the authorities’ conduct had breached Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. The first hearing was held on 9 April 1992. On 21 May 1992 the applicant church filed a number of documents. On 29 May 1992 the proceedings were adjourned on the ground that an attempt to reach a friendly settlement was in progress. On 2 December 1992, noting that the negotiations had failed, the Commissario della Legge, the official responsible for preparing appeal cases, ordered that the proceedings be resumed. At a hearing on 25 February 1993, the applicant church requested that an expert be appointed and a witness questioned in order to determine exactly which parts of the land had not been used. By decisions of 2 March and 6 April 1993, the Commissario della Legge allowed both requests. Evidence was heard from the witness on 24 June 1993 and the expert report was filed on 7 November 1993. The parties lodged their final submissions on 10 February and 24 March 1994. Preparation of the case was concluded on 27 April 1994.', '13. In December 1994 the appeal Judge C.P. died. No other judge could replace him, as the organisational structure of the court of civil appeals provided for only one judge. On 17 January 1995 the General Grand Council (Consiglio Grande e Generale) enacted Law no. 2/1995, section 1 of which provided: “If the judge of civil appeals dies or if, following a serious impediment, he or she is unable to perform the duties of investigating judge, those duties shall be carried out by one of the judges of criminal appeals, who shall carry out any urgent measures until such time as a replacement is appointed or the serious impediment is removed ...”', '14. On 25 April 1995 the General Grand Council appointed Judge P.G.P. to replace the deceased judge. However, P.G.P. asked the Council of the XII for leave to withdraw from the proceedings in question on the ground that he had been involved as the first-instance civil judge. Under section 17 of Law no. 2/1995, the Council of the XII, which acted as a third-instance judicial body in cases where the appeal court did not uphold the decision of the first-instance court, was also responsible at the material time for ruling on requests to withdraw or applications challenging a judge.', '15. On 26 September 1995 the Council of the XII granted the request and sent the case in question to P.G., an appeal judge in criminal cases (Giudice delle Appellazioni per le cause penali).', '16. He dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 18 December 1998, which was deposited at the registry on the same date. He found that section 14(3) of Law no. 18/1980 provided that expropriation orders would lapse where the deadline for execution of the relevant work had expired, but not in the event of failure to use all of the expropriated assets; that, in any event, the administrative courts had jurisdiction to rule on the merits of expropriation proceedings; and that the appellant sought restitution of its title to the assets, whereas at first instance it had sought merely to recover possession of the land. He concluded that the request could not be granted since, according to the established case-law, “requests made for the first time on appeal [were] manifestly inadmissible” (judgment of the Giudice delle Appellazioni Civili, 20 July 1970, no. 147).', '17. In the meantime, after a new land-use plan had taken effect, changing the designated use of the land in question from industrial to agricultural, the applicant church had asked the government on 3 March 1992 to return its assets. On 24 November 1992, having received no reply, it sent the government a formal notice asking it to adopt the necessary measures for restitution. On 20 April 1993 it applied to the first-instance administrative court. A hearing took place on 3 August 1993. By a judgment of 17 August 1993, deposited at the registry on the same date, the court stated that it did not have jurisdiction to “recognise the existence of a possible right to restitution of unused land”, as the administrative courts could only examine legitimate interests. It found that the General Grand Council alone was entitled to rule on what was to be done with the said property. Noting finally that the new land-use plan had changed the designated use of the unused land, it declared the expropriation order of 7 March 1985 void in so far as it had lapsed in respect of that particular property, but pointed out that declaring it void did not create a right to reconveyance.', '18. The government then lodged an appeal, disputing the existence of an implied refusal which would legitimise an application to the first-instance administrative courts, and also the latter’s jurisdiction to declare the expropriation order partially void. The appeal hearing, initially fixed for 13 January 1994, was adjourned to 24 May 1994 because the judge of administrative appeals was unable to attend. He allowed the appeal in a judgment of 26 May 1994, which was deposited at the registry on the same date. The judge found that the State had acquired ownership of the plots of land in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law, on payment of compensation for expropriation, and that no legislative provision obliged the government to return that property. Accordingly, he concluded that the applicant church’s request of 20 April 1993 was inadmissible, since the government’s behaviour could not be described as an implied refusal. Finally, he stated that, in declaring the expropriation order partially void – an order which, moreover, had never been contested – the first-instance administrative court had exceeded its jurisdiction, which only permitted it, where appropriate, to declare unlawful the government’s alleged implied refusal.', '19. On an unspecified date, the administrative court of appeal ordered that the case file be sent to the Council of the XII. After taking expert advice, that body gives rulings in administrative disputes where first-instance and appeal judgments reach opposite conclusions (section 21 of Law no. 68 of 28 June 1989 establishing the administrative courts). On 27 September 1994 the Council of the XII upheld the appeal court’s judgment, thus endorsing the expert’s conclusion that, while the public-interest declaration in connection with the urban development work had transformed Beneficio Cappella Paolini’s right of property into a mere legitimate interest, section 14(3) of Law no. 15/1980 conferred not only a legitimate interest in the lawfulness of the authorities’ actions but an actual right to apply to the civil courts and obtain a declaration that the expropriation order had lapsed because the deadline for completion of the work had expired.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1914, 1920, 1921 and 1945 respectively. The first lives in Timişoara, the second in Delémont (Switzerland) and the others in Arad.', '5. The first two applicants and their deceased brother, Mircea Stoinescu, whose heirs are the other two applicants, were the owners of a house in Arad. In 1950 the State took possession of that house under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. The house was converted into four flats intended for rental.', '6. On 27 September 1993 the first two applicants and Mircea Stoinescu brought an action for the recovery of possession of immovable property in the Arad Court of First Instance against Arad Town Council and R., a State-owned company responsible for the management of property belonging to the State. After the death of Mircea Stoinescu, the action was pursued by his heirs, Mrs Felicia Stoinescu and Mrs Maria Tăucean. The applicants sought a declaration that they were the rightful owners of the house and appurtenant land that the State had, in their opinion, wrongfully seized in 1950. They claimed that, under Article 2 of Decree no. 92/1950, property belonging to persons in certain social categories was not subject to nationalisation, and that they fell within such a category. In their view, the nationalisation of the house in question had therefore been improper and unlawful.', ""7. In a judgment of 12 April 1994, the Arad Court of First Instance dismissed the applicants' action, refusing to rule on the merits on the ground that they could not obtain redress for the damage they had sustained until the enactment of special legislation introducing reparation measures. The judgment was upheld by the Arad County Court on 3 November 1995. The applicants appealed against that decision."", '8. In 1996 the tenants of the flats making up the house applied to purchase them, relying on Law no. 112/1995. Arad Town Council informed the R. company that a dispute was pending concerning the title to the house and instructed it not to pursue the sale of the flats in question.', '9. Consequently, the tenants of three flats had their purchase applications rejected, but not H.D. (a former football player and international celebrity) and his wife, to whom the R. company sold flat no. 3 on 18 December 1996.', '10. On 25 February 1997 the Timişoara Court of Appeal upheld an appeal by the applicants and remitted the case to the Arad Court of First Instance for a decision on the merits.', '11. On 12 May 1997 Mr and Mrs D. applied to intervene in the Court of First Instance proceedings on the ground that they had been the owners of flat no. 3 since its sale on 18 December 1996.', ""12. Further to the couple's application to intervene, the applicants requested the court to find that the sale of flat no. 3 was null and void. In their view, as the nationalisation had been improper and unlawful, the State could not have been the rightful owner of the property and thus could not lawfully have sold any part of it. The applicants relied in particular on Article 966 of the Civil Code, whereby an undertaking entered into on an erroneous or unlawful basis could not produce any useful effect."", '13. On 7 June 1997 the Arad Court of First Instance held that the nationalisation of the house had been unlawful and that the applicants were therefore the rightful owners. However, the court rejected the request for the rescission of the contract of sale between the State and Mr and Mrs D., on the ground that the couple had made the purchase in good faith.', '14. The applicants appealed against that judgment. On 28 November 1997 the Arad County Court allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the Court of First Instance for reconsideration.', '15. In a judgment of 6 July 1998, the Arad Court of First Instance held that the nationalisation of the house had been unlawful, that the applicants were the rightful owners and that the contract of sale between the State and Mr and Mrs D. was null and void.', ""16. On 2 February 1999 the Arad County Court allowed an appeal by Mr and Mrs D. and dismissed the applicants' action, finding that the nationalisation had been lawful and that, consequently, the sale by the State of flat no. 3 was also lawful."", ""17. The applicants appealed to the Timişoara Court of Appeal, which gave its judgment on 30 June 1999. It partly allowed the applicants' appeal in so far as it found the nationalisation to have been unlawful and acknowledged that they had remained the rightful owners of the property. However, it dismissed the appeal as regards the rescission of the sale of flat no. 3, considering that the State had been presumed to be the owner of the property at the time of the sale, in spite of the dispute over the property that was pending in the courts. It moreover relied on the fact that Law no. 112/1995, which had formed the statutory basis for the sale of the property, did not provide for any penalty in respect of property sold when the title to it was in dispute before the courts. The Court of Appeal did not address the applicants' argument relating to the principle of unjust enrichment (see paragraph 27 below)."", '18. On 20 August 2001 the applicants again requested the Arad Court of First Instance to order the rescission of the sale of flat no. 3, contending that the purchasers had broken the law. Their action was dismissed on 13 December 2001 on the ground that the matter had become res judicata.', '19. The relevant provisions of Decree no. 92/1950 on the nationalisation of certain immovable property are as follows:', '“... in order to ensure the proper management of dwellings which wealthy capitalists and exploiters who possess a large number of properties have allowed to fall into dilapidation as a means of sabotage; [and]', 'In order to deprive exploiters of an important means of exploitation;', 'The immovable property appearing in the schedules ... annexed to and forming part of this Decree shall be nationalised.

The decision provided that immovable property that had passed into State ownership under a legislative provision was to be regarded as immovable property legally vested in the State. It also specified that Law no. 112/1995 did not apply to immovable property held by the State where its right of property was not based on any legislative provision.', '22. On 18 February 1997 the Government adopted decision no. 11/1997, supplementing decision no. 20/1996. Paragraph 1 (3) of decision no. 11/1997 provided that, in order for property to be defined as having been acquired by the State under Decree no. 92/1950, it had to have been acquired in accordance with the decree and the person referred to as the owner in the lists enumerating nationalised property had to have been the true owner at the time of the nationalisation.', '23. The relevant provisions of Law no. 10/2001 of 14 February 2001 on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989 read as follows:', '“(1) Immovable property wrongfully seized by the State ... between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989 and property expropriated under the Requisitions Act (Law no. 139/1940) that has not been returned shall be subject to restitution, normally consisting of the return of the property in question ...', '(2) Where the property cannot be returned, alternative measures of redress shall be taken.

Article 966 of the Civil Code reads:', '“An obligation without legal basis or based on an erroneous or unlawful ground cannot produce any useful effect.”', ""26. Under Romanian law, an action for recovery of possession is one of the principal remedies for the protection of a right of property. Such action is not governed per se by statute but has emerged from case-law. An action for recovery of possession can be defined as the bringing of proceedings to enforce a right in rem in which a dispossessed owner claims back his or her property from the person currently in possession of it. The main outcome of such an action, if successful, is the acknowledgment by the court of the claimant's title to the property, with retrospective effect, thus obliging the defendant to return the property. If physical restitution is no longer possible, that obligation is replaced by an obligation to pay compensation on the basis of an equivalent sum (see, for example, Liviu Pop, Dreptul de proprietate şi dezmembrămintele sale (Ownership and its Attributes), Lumina Lex, Bucharest 1997, pp. 278-90, and Ion Dogaru and T. Sâmbrian, Elementele dreptului civil, vol. 2, Drepturile reale (Elements of Civil Law, vol. 2, Rights in rem), Oltenia, Craiova 1994, p. 160)."", ""27. In legal systems derived from Roman law there is an equitable rule that when a person has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another, the latter may claim compensation in the amount by which that person has been enriched (see François Terré, Philippe Simmler and Yves Lequette, Droit civil : les obligations (Civil Law: Obligations), Dalloz, 5th edition, 1993, pp. 742-44, and Ion Filipescu, Drept civil : Teoria generală a obligaţiilor (Civil Law: General theory of obligations), Editura Actami, Bucharest 1994, p. 98). Whilst an action for tortious liability enables the injured party to claim exact reparation for the loss sustained as a result of negligence on the part of an enriched person, in an action for unjust enrichment the claimant can only seek an amount corresponding to the other party's gain, provided that some pecuniary benefit has been obtained, without just cause, at the expense of the claimant (see Terré, Simmler and Lequette, op. cit., p. 744, and Filipescu, op. cit., p. 98).""]",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Grozny.', '8. According to the applicant, he experiences difficulties in reconstructing the events during and following his detention coherently and chronologically. On account of his ill-treatment in custody, the applicant suffers from memory lapses. He also finds it psychologically difficult to recall the details of the abusive treatment he was subjected to in detention.', '9. The applicant owned real estate consisting of a house and outhouses at 94 Flotskaya Street, the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny. At the material time he lived there alone, since his relatives had left the Chechen Republic after the renewal of hostilities in October 1999. The applicant remained in Grozny to look after the house and other possessions. The latter comprised personal belongings of the applicant and his relatives, furniture, an audio system, a satellite dish, two Subaru vehicles and an Oldsmobile car. Between late 1999 and early 2000 the applicant lived in the house only occasionally because of frequent attacks. From late January 2000 onwards he lived there permanently.', '10. At the material time the applicant, a school teacher by profession, was working in a “burial group” (группа захоронения) for the Ministry of Civil Defence and Emergency Situations of the Chechen Republic (Министерство Чеченской Республики по делам гражданской обороны и чрезвычайным ситуация). He was also helping the residents of the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny to obtain drinking water and food.', '11. On 5 March 2000, at around 10 a.m., the applicant was distributing drinking water among the residents of the Oktyabrskiy District when a group of federal servicemen in two UAZ vehicles arrived and enquired as to how they could get to a certain street. The applicant and some other residents explained to them how to find that street, but the commander of the group asked the applicant to come with them and show them the way. The applicant agreed. The applicant submitted eyewitness statements by two residents of the Oktyabrskiy District confirming the above-mentioned episode.', '12. When the servicemen arrived at the street they were looking for, the applicant asked them to let him out. Instead, the military hit the applicant in the kidneys and put a bag over his head. They ordered him to be silent and delivered him to the Temporary Office of the Interior of the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny (“the Oktyabrskiy VOVD”, временный отдел внутренних дел Октябрьского района г. Грозного). According to the applicant, the officers who apprehended him could not know his identity because they did not check his identity papers.', '13. At the Oktyabrskiy VOVD the officers intimidated and ill-treated the applicant for several hours. In particular, they severely beat him, cut his hair and forced him to chew and swallow it, pressed a red-hot nail into his hands, forehead, nostrils and tongue and carved a derogatory word “Chichik” on his forehead with a nail or knife.', '14. The officers also questioned the applicant, but made no written record of the interrogation. They asked the applicant where he had fought as a rebel fighter and why there was a list of names in his pocket. The applicant replied that he was a teacher, had never fought and that the list included the residents of the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny to whom he distributed water. It appears that the officers did not believe him. They told him that he would not leave the premises of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD alive.', '15. The officers then took the applicant down to a basement, stood him against the wall and started shooting around him. They told him that he should “wait a little longer to die” and that they had not “[had] enough of mocking him yet” and took a break.', '16. Some time later they returned to the basement with several other officers and started “playing football” with the applicant. They spent about two hours knocking him off his feet, kicking him and throwing him onto the concrete floor. From time to time the applicant lost consciousness, but the officers brought him round. According to the applicant, he lost most of his teeth and his ribs, jaw, arm and leg were broken as a result of this treatment.', ""17. At around 5 p.m. one of the officers suggested that they go to the applicant's place of residence and “seize his firearms” whereupon a group of about eleven officers in two UAZ vehicles went there. The applicant was put into the boot of one of the cars."", '18. When they arrived the police ordered the applicant to unlock all the doors in the house and started searching. The search lasted for a few hours. The officers entered all the rooms, the basement and the garage and climbed up onto the roof. The applicant maintained that he was unable to keep an eye on all the officers at the same time. At some point during the search one of the officers called the applicant into the corridor, showed him an object, which resembled a piece of soap and later turned out to be a TNT block, and asked what it was. The officer claimed that he had found the object on a shelf. The applicant replied that he was unable to identify the object, as it was the first time he had seen it.', '19. After the search the applicant was put into the boot again and escorted to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. There he was chained to a heater.', '20. The applicant spent the next two days chained to the heater pending the construction of a new cell.', '21. On one of those days the investigator, Mr P., interviewed the applicant. He enquired as to where the applicant had obtained the TNT block. The applicant denied that he had ever possessed explosives and insisted that the TNT block had been planted in his house during the search on 5 March 2000. The investigator then called two masked men, who beat the applicant until he lost consciousness. Later that day the two men returned and beat him again. The applicant said that during the next two days he coughed up blood and was unable to get up.', '22. On around 7 March 2000 the officers twice put the applicant into the boot of a police car and drove him around for some time.', ""23. On 7 March 2000 the applicant was transferred to a newly constructed cell. Some time later another detainee, Mr K., was placed in the applicant's cell and two detainees in the adjacent one."", '24. On 10 March 2000 an investigator informed the applicant that an expert study of the object found in his house had confirmed that it contained explosives. The investigator did not show the expert examination report to the applicant.', ""25. On 11 March 2000, in the evening, two servicemen approached the applicant's cell and ordered a guard to open it. The guard, who appeared to be afraid of the men, complied with the order. According to the applicant, the men were drunk and one of them was wearing a mask. They started beating the applicant. After a while one of the men put his foot on the applicant, who was lying on the floor, took a knife and cut off his left ear. He also declared that he would cut off the applicant's head and made a scratch on the applicant's throat. In the applicant's submission, the man had a horseshoe-shaped moustache. Then another man entered the cell and took pictures of the bleeding applicant and his cut ear. According to the applicant, the man who took pictures was of Uzbek origin, his first name was Andrey and he served as a guard at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD."", ""26. The applicant submitted statements by his cellmate who had witnessed the applicant's ill-treatment. The applicant further referred to a statement of the then Mayor of Grozny, Bislan Gantamirov, who claimed in an interview with a regional weekly newspaper Groznenskiy Rabochiy (1724 May 2000) that he had “a witness who had seen the deputy head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD cut off the ear of one of the Chechen detainees”."", '27. Then the officers left and entered the adjacent cell in which two other detainees were being held. According to the applicant, he heard screams and moans which became fainter and then died out. The applicant never saw those detainees again.', ""28. Early on 12 March 2000, when the applicant and his cellmate were asleep, the guards forced them to get up, put bags over their heads and escorted them to a small room. Several hours later the applicant and his cellmate were returned to their cell which had been thoroughly cleaned. The applicant saw the other cell because its doors were wide open. It was also clean and there were no detainees there. In the applicant's opinion, the Oktyabrskiy VOVD authorities were hiding him and other detainees from a commission that was visiting police stations to inspect the treatment of detainees."", ""29. On around 13 March 2000 an official from the Grozny prosecutor's office (прокуратура г. Грозного), Mr L., visited the applicant and warned him not to disclose the fact that he had lost his ear in detention. Instead, the applicant was told to state that his ear had been cut off by rebel fighters."", ""30. On around 16 March 2000 a medical officer, whose first name was Gennadiy, visited the applicant. He put some ointment on the applicant's ear wound, but did not bandage it. Nether did he examine the applicant or treat his other injuries. According to the applicant, he was attended by medical officers on several occasions while in detention, but never underwent a medical examination or received proper treatment for his ear."", '31. On around 19 March 2000 the applicant was transferred to the basement of another building of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, where he was kept until his release on 24 May 2000.', '32. The basement was divided into two rooms. One of them, measuring approximately 48 square metres (8 m x 6 m), was used as a torture chamber and contained various instruments, including an axe, a hammer, a sledgehammer, a shovel and scissors. According to the applicant, he was ordered to clean the room once and noticed bloodstains even on the ceiling which was 3m high.', ""33. The other room, measuring approximately 9 square metres (3 m x 3 m), was a cell. During the applicant's detention twelve to fifteen detainees were kept there. The applicant stated that on numerous occasions the detainees were taken to the adjacent room and tortured. He could hear them screaming. Sometimes the door between the two rooms was left open and the applicant could see his cellmates being severely ill-treated. They returned to the cell severely beaten, two of them had their fingers missing and another detainee was brought back unconscious."", '34. On several occasions the investigator interrogated the applicant about the object allegedly found in his house on 5 March 2000. The applicant was forced to sign a confession stating that the object in question belonged to him. The investigator also questioned the applicant about the activities of his neighbours. No transcript of those interrogations was ever made.', '35. From time to time the guards took the applicant out of his cell to another room for a short period of time, apparently when inspections occurred, and then brought him back.', ""36. At some point in March 2000 the applicant's sister, Ms L. S., and his cousin, Ms Kh. Z., found out that the applicant had disappeared. They returned to Grozny and started searching for him."", ""37. They applied in person and in writing to a military commander's office, the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, the local administration, the detention centre in Chernokozovo, the federal military base in Khankala and a morgue, but to no avail."", ""38. Some time later the applicant's sister received information that he had been seen in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. In the following weeks the applicant's sister and cousin unsuccessfully applied to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD with enquiries about the applicant."", ""39. At some point in April 2000 the applicant's relatives finally managed to talk to the investigator in charge, who told them that the police had found explosives in the applicant's house. Ms L. S. answered that it was untrue and that her brother had never participated in military actions. The applicant's relatives then requested permission to see the applicant, but this was refused. However, they were allowed to send him a note and fresh clothes. The applicant's old clothes were returned to the applicant's sister, who checked them and saw blood on the shoulder and back of the applicant's shirt."", ""40. In the following weeks the applicant's relatives unsuccessfully requested authorisation to see the applicant."", '41. On 12 May 2000 new police officers arrived from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region of Russia and replaced the staff of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Several days later Ms L. S. and Ms Kh. Z. were allowed to see the applicant for ten minutes in the presence of an investigating officer. They were ordered to speak Russian only. According to them, the applicant was swollen, had lots of scars and one of his ears was missing.', ""42. On 24 May 2000 an investigator of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD issued a decision to discontinue criminal proceedings in case no. 14206/03 instituted against the applicant for unlawful possession of explosives. The decision stated that the applicant had not lived in his house on a regular basis because of the hostilities and that for some time the house had been occupied by unknown armed men who might have brought the explosives which the applicant had then unintentionally kept. Besides this, the decision stated that “having been kept in detention, the applicant ceased to pose a danger to society” and could be released. It also explained the applicant's right to appeal against that decision to a prosecutor or in court."", '43. Later that day the applicant was released and returned home. According to eyewitness statements, the applicant was in a very poor condition, being swollen, emaciated and pale, and with his left ear and teeth missing and his hip broken.', '44. According to the Government, on 5 March 2000 the Criminal Investigation Division of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD instituted criminal proceedings in case no. 14206/03 against the applicant on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence punishable under Article 222 (unlawful possession of firearms and explosives) of the Russian Criminal Code.', ""45. During a search which was carried out in the applicant's house pursuant to an investigator's order of 5 March 2000 an explosive was found and seized. According to an expert report, which was communicated to the applicant, the explosive was a 200-gram TNT block."", '46. On the same date the applicant was arrested pursuant to Article 122 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '47. On 6 March 2000 the case was sent to another division of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD for further investigation.', '48. On 8 March 2000 the acting prosecutor of Grozny ordered the applicant to be remanded in custody, in accordance with Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '49. On 15 March 2000 formal charges were brought against the applicant under Article 222 of the Russian Criminal Code. When questioned, the applicant was unable to give any explanation concerning the explosive found in his house.', '50. On 24 May 2000 the Oktyabrskiy VOVD discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant with reference to Article 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, notably because he had ceased to pose a danger to society, and released him.', ""51. On 2 August 2002 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic (прокуратура Чеченской Республики) set aside the decision of 24 May 2000 and ordered that the criminal proceedings against the applicant be resumed."", ""52. By a decision of 20 February 2006 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant on the ground that the constituent elements of a crime had not been made out. The decision stated, in particular, that the search carried out in the applicant's house on 5 March 2000 had not been duly authorised and had been conducted in breach of procedural law with the result that the TNT block allegedly found during that search could not be regarded as reliable evidence of the applicant's involvement in the imputed offence, and that therefore there had been no grounds on which to bring criminal proceedings against him."", ""53. Shortly after his release, the applicant started complaining personally and in writing to various official bodies about his unlawful arrest and detention, ill-treatment in custody and the search of his house. Subsequently he complained to prosecutors offices at various levels of the ineffectiveness of the investigation, indicated the names of the perpetrators established during the investigation and requested that they be brought to justice. The applicant's efforts were supported by the SRJI and his lawyer. According to the applicant, his complaints mostly remained unanswered, or only formal responses were given by which the respective requests were forwarded to various prosecutor's offices “for examination”."", ""54. In particular, on an unspecified date he applied in writing to the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia, the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic, the Minister of the Interior of the Chechen Republic and two other high-ranking officials. In his complaint the applicant described in detail the events of 5 March to 24 May 2000 and requested that those responsible be punished."", ""55. On 23 October 2000 the Representative for Rights and Freedoms in Russia (Уполномоченный по правам человека в Российской Федерации) declined to examine the applicant's complaint on the ground that it was unclear and not supported by relevant documents."", ""56. On 1 March 2001 the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia referred the applicant's complaint to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic."", ""57. In a letter of 22 March 2001 the military prosecutor of military unit no. 20102 (военная прокуратура – войсковая часть 20102) forwarded the applicant's complaint, along with several other applications, to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic."", ""58. On 22 March and 16 April 2001 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic transmitted the applicant's complaints concerning his unlawful detention “by unidentified servicemen” to the Grozny prosecutor's office."", ""59. On 4 and 25 July 2001 respectively the applicant complained in writing to the Administration of the Oktyabrskiy District of Grozny and to the Grozny prosecutor's office of the theft of his Oldsmobile car by police officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD."", '60. On 13 July 2001 Médecins Sans Frontières issued the applicant with a medical certificate which listed the after-effects of the injuries inflicted on him during his detention. It stated that a medical examination of the applicant on 13 July 2001 had revealed the following:', '“– [The applicant] wears dentures which replace teeth 12 to 17, 22 to 27, 33 to 35, 42 to 45. The original teeth were broken during his detention.', '– The bridge of the nose is crooked, suggesting a possible set fracture.', '– The left ear lobe is missing, and, while the auditory canal is not obstructed, the hearing capacity of the left ear is diminished. A shiny scar is visible, which extends 6 cm from the external auditory canal towards the bottom part of the lower jaw and 5 cm towards the mastoid bone and slightly beyond.', '– A star-shaped scar is present on the palm of the right hand, suggesting a non-transfixiant burn or wound. It is located opposite the 4th metacarpal.', '– At the palpation of ribs 8, 9 and 10 facing the interior arc, are located still sensitive bone calluses, likely resulting from clean rib fractures.', '– At the palpation of the top of the lower 1/3 tibia of the right leg is a discrete bone callus which could be connected to a non-displaced fracture or an incomplete fracture of the tibia.”', ""61.

In a letter of 3 January 2002, in reply to the SRJI's query, the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic stated that criminal proceedings had been instituted in connection with the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. The letter did not indicate the date on which the criminal proceedings had been instituted or the number assigned to the criminal case file."", ""66. On 13 April 2002 the applicant made a written request to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic for copies of a number of documents from his case file. It does not appear that this request was granted."", '67. In letters of 23 August and 26 October 2005, 25 September 2006 and 22 January 2009 the applicant was informed that criminal proceedings had been instituted in cases opened in connection with his complaints (see paragraphs 137, 139, 145 and 153 below).', ""68.

The Government submitted that a number of investigative measures had been taken during the investigation. In particular, the authorities had interviewed a number of police officers serving in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the relevant time. The Government maintained that Mr P., who had been seconded to Grozny as a senior inquiry officer, had stated that when being questioned during his detention the applicant had submitted that four or five unknown persons had cut off his ear the day before he had been apprehended. Mr P. also stated that the applicant had received the necessary medical aid during his detention (see paragraphs 184-186 below). According to the Government, Mr Dub., who had been the acting head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at the relevant time, gave similar oral testimony about the existence of bodily injuries on the applicant at the time when he had been apprehended (see paragraph 199 below).

This judgment was upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of the Chechen Republic on 27 January 2009."", ""117. In June 2005, at the communication stage, the Government were invited to indicate whether criminal proceedings had been instituted in respect of the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment and looting of his property, and, if so, which numbers had been given to the respective criminal cases. They were also invited to produce documents pertaining to those criminal cases. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General's Office, the Government informed the Court that the investigation in connection with the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant and damage to his property was under way and that the case file had been assigned the number 12088. The Government refused, however, to submit any documents from the file, stating that their disclosure would be in violation of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure because the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the participants in the criminal proceedings. At the same time, the Government suggested that a Court delegation be given access to the file at the place where the preliminary investigation was being conducted, with the exception of “the documents [disclosing military information and personal data concerning the witnesses], and without the right to make copies of the case file and to transmit it to others”."", ""118. In November 2005 the Court reiterated its request and suggested that Rule 33 § 3 of the Rules of Court be applied. In reply, the Government submitted documents running to 76 pages but refused to produce the entire investigation file for the aforementioned reasons. The documents submitted by the Government included a list of documents in the case file, decisions to initiate criminal proceedings, a decision granting the applicant victim status, decisions to suspend and resume the investigation, various investigators' decisions to take up the case, a decision to join cases, a decision ordering that the investigation be carried out by an investigative group and a decision extending the period of preliminary investigation."", ""119. The applicant, for his part, managed, with the assistance of the Committee against Torture – a Russian NGO based in Nizhniy Novgorod – to obtain a substantial portion of the file in criminal case no. 12088 for the period 2000-2005. He enclosed around 1,000 pages from the file, running, as can be seen, to twelve volumes with his comments on the Government's observations on the admissibility of the present application."", ""120. On 22 January 2009 the application was declared partly admissible. At that stage the Court invited the Government to provide information on the progress after November 2005 made in investigating case no. 12088 concerning the alleged ill-treatment of the applicant and the theft of his Oldsmobile and Subaru vehicles, and to produce copies of all the documents from the investigation file pertaining to the period stated. The Government were also invited to provide information on the progress made, and to produce the entire copy of the file, in investigating case no. 61857 concerning the theft and destruction of the applicant's possessions, including his Subaru minivan."", ""121. In March 2009 the Government produced several documents running to 95 pages from the files in criminal cases nos. 12088 and 61857, including decisions to suspend and resume criminal proceedings, decisions to disjoin a criminal case concerning the theft of the applicant's property, a decision granting the applicant victim status in case no. 61857, a transcript of the applicant's witness interview, investigators' decisions to take up the case, a decision ordering that the investigation be carried out by an investigative group, a decision extending the period of the preliminary investigation, and decisions to transfer the case from one investigator to another. The Government refused to produce any other materials, referring to Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure."", '122. The documents submitted by the parties, in so far as relevant, may be summarised as follows.', ""123. By a decision of 13 July 2000 the Grozny prosecutor's office instituted criminal proceedings under Article 286 § 3 (a) (aggravated abuse of power) of the Russian Criminal Code in connection with the applicant's allegations of his unlawful detention and ill-treatment by officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in his complaint of 30 June 2000. The case file was given the number 12088."", '124. By similar decisions of 13 August 2000, 24 September, 6 November and 19 December 2001 and 30 January 2002 the investigation in case no. 12088 was suspended. The very succinct decisions stated that it had been impossible to identify those responsible and instructed the Criminal Investigation Division of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD (eventually the Oktyabrskiy District Office of the Interior – “the Oktyabrskiy ROVD”) to “take measures” to identify the alleged perpetrators.', ""125. In similar decisions of 24 August, 6 October, 19 November and 30 December 2001 and 18 July 2002 supervising prosecutors set aside the decisions of 13 August 2000, 24 September, 6 November and 19 December 2001 and 30 January 2002 respectively, stating that the investigation had been incomplete, that the circumstances of the incident had not been established fully and objectively and that a number of necessary investigative measures had not been taken. The decisions ordered that the proceedings be resumed and listed the requisite investigative measures. The decisions of 19 November and 30 December 2001 and 18 July 2002 also stated that the investigating authorities had failed to comply with the prosecutors' earlier instructions and had not performed a number of investigative measures listed in the previous decisions."", ""126. A decision of 20 August 2003 ordered that the investigation be suspended. It listed in detail the investigative measures that had been performed, including questioning the applicant and granting him victim status, questioning a number of officials who at the relevant time had been serving at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, Messrs P., Dub., S., B., Ya., A., Sh., V. and Z. being among their number, questioning Mr K. – the applicant's cellmate, seizing photographs of officers of the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior seconded for the relevant period to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and identification – from their photographs – by the applicant and Mr K. of the officers involved."", ""127. The decision further stated that queries had been sent to competent bodies with a view to finding the cars stolen from the applicant and locating Mr Dzh., who had possibly been involved in stealing them. The decision went on to say that Mr Z., whom the applicant had identified from a photograph, had confirmed that he had let into the applicant's cell officers from the special fire group of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, who had cut off the applicant's ear. It further stated that charges of aggravated negligence of official duties had been brought against Mr Z., who had been put on the federal wanted list as he had absconded from the investigating authorities with the result that it had so far not been possible to show him photographs for identification of the officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD allegedly involved."", '128. The decision went on to state that the applicant and Mr K. had also identified Mr Ab. as the person who had inflicted physical violence on detainees and photographed the applicant after his ear had been cut off. According to the decision, the investigator seconded to the Khanty-Maniysk Region had been unable to interview Mr Ab., as the latter had been on annual leave in the Republic of Uzbekistan.', ""129. The decision also mentioned that the applicant had identified, from a photograph, Mr N. as one of the people who had inflicted bodily injuries on him and Mr D. as one of the people who had also participated in inflicting bodily injuries on him, and that Mr K. had identified, from a photograph, Mr N. as a person resembling the one who had cut off the applicant's ear."", ""130. The decision went on to note that, when carrying out investigative measures within the territory of the Khanty-Mansiysk Region, the investigator had encountered reluctance on the part of a number of high-ranking officials of Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior to allow him to have contact with their subordinates, with the result that he had been unable to interview a number of officers from the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior who, under various pretexts, had ignored his summons to appear for questioning. , who had been summoned to appear at the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic by 10 November 2003. The decision concluded that all investigative measures which could have been carried out in the absence of the aforementioned officers had been performed and that therefore the proceedings should be suspended pending their arrival in Grozny and until Mr Z.'s whereabouts were established."", ""131. A decision of 13 April 2004 ordered that the investigation in case no. 12088, which had most recently been suspended on 3 December 2003, be resumed. It stated that the decision to suspend the proceedings had been unlawful as the investigating authorities had not performed all investigative measures that could have been carried out in the absence of those responsible and, in particular, had failed to comply with the investigator's instructions and with supervising prosecutors' orders."", ""132. Decisions of 13 May and 26 November 2004 ordered that the proceedings in case no. 12088 be stayed. The decisions were similar to that of 20 August 2003. In particular, they referred to the same measures carried out during the investigation as those listed in the decision of 20 August 2003. They also stated that, in reply to their relevant queries, the investigating authorities had received information to the effect that Mr Dhz. had died on 6 January 2002; they contained no indication, however, as to whether the actions prescribed by the decision of 20 August 2003, such as confrontations between the applicant, Mr K. and officers N., Deg. and Ab. (see paragraph 130 above) had been performed, nor did they indicate whether, and if so which, measures had been taken with a view to establishing Mr Z.'s whereabouts. The decisions concluded that all possible investigative measures had been performed and that it was impossible, in the absence of Mr Z., whose whereabouts remained unknown, to take measures to identify the persons who had inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant."", ""133. A decision of 20 October 2004 set aside the decision of 13 May 2004 and ordered that the investigation be resumed. According to that decision, the investigating authorities had not performed all investigative measures that could have been carried out in the absence of those responsible. It pointed out, in particular, that a number of the investigator's instructions had not been complied with, the identities of witnesses of the theft of the applicant's property had not been established and the relevant individuals interviewed. The decision stated that all other necessary investigative measures should be taken. It was signed by the investigator to the effect that “the interested persons” had been apprised of it on 26 October 2004."", ""134. A decision of 26 May 2005 quashed the decision of 26 November 2004 and ordered that the investigation be resumed. It then ordered that a number of investigative measures be carried out, and in particular, that the measures indicated in the decisions of 13 April and 20 October 2004 be complied with in full, that the search for Mr Z. be conducted more actively, that additional evidence be searched for to confirm the involvement of Mr N., Mr D. and Mr Ab. in the incident of 11 March 2000 and, if such evidence was obtained, that relevant charges be brought against those responsible, that the applicant's arguments advanced in his complaints of 17 August and 22 September 2004 be investigated, and that other necessary steps be taken."", ""135. A decision of 4 July 2005 ordered the suspension of the criminal proceedings. It was similar to the decisions of 13 May and 26 November 2004 and listed the same investigative measures that had been carried out. The decision added that during an additional investigation Mr Z.'s whereabouts had been established at the address of his permanent place of residence; however, given that “a preventive measure in the form of an undertaking not to leave his place of residence had been applied to him, it had been impossible to deliver him to Grozny”. The decision concluded that all investigative measures that could have been conducted in the absence of Mr Z. had been performed and that the preliminary investigation should be stayed “until there was a real possibility of participation in the criminal proceedings of the accused Z.” The decision was signed by the investigator to the effect that the accused Z. and the applicant had been apprised of it."", ""136. A decision of 17 August 2005 set aside the decision of 4 July 2005 as unlawful and unfounded stating that a number of essential steps had not been taken, and, in particular, that no legal classification had been given to the actions of Mr D., Mr N. and Mr Ab., identified by the applicant as those involved in the incident of 11 March 2000, that the theft of the applicant's property and Mr Ya.'s possible involvement in that offence had not been duly investigated, that an additional forensic medical examination of the applicant – necessary in view of the presence in the case file of two conflicting reports on medical examinations conducted earlier – had not been performed, and that other necessary measures had not been taken. The decision thus ordered that the proceedings be resumed."", ""137. In a letter of 30 August 2005 the investigator informed the applicant and his lawyer that on 13 July 2000 criminal proceedings in case no. 12088 had been instituted in connection with the infliction of bodily injuries on the applicant by unidentified police officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, that on 30 August 2001 criminal proceedings in case no. 15082 had been instituted in connection with the theft of the applicant's Oldsmobile vehicle presumably by officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, that on 5 September 2001 those two cases had been joined under number 12088, and that on 23 August 2005 criminal proceedings had been instituted in case no. 61856 in connection with the theft of the applicant's Subaru vehicle by unidentified police officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD seconded to the Chechen Republic from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region. The letter went on to say that during the period of the applicant's detention between 5 March and 24 May 2000 a group of unidentified persons had broken into his house and stolen his property including a Subaru minivan, causing him pecuniary damage amounting to USD 148,620 and that during the same period unidentified persons had deliberately destroyed the applicant's property – his house and outhouses – causing him considerable pecuniary damage. The letter stated that criminal proceedings had been brought in that connection and that the new case had been disjoined from case no. 12088 and given the number 61857. Lastly, the letter stated that the investigation in case no. 12088 had been resumed and was in progress."", ""138. A decision of 30 September 2005 ordered that the proceedings in case no. 12088 be suspended as all investigative measures that it had been possible to perform in the absence of the accused had been carried out. It stated, briefly, that during an additional investigation Mr Z.'s whereabouts had been established at his home address; however, Mr Z. had then fled from the investigating authorities and, at present, his whereabouts remained unknown."", ""139. In a letter of 26 October 2005 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic informed the applicant's lawyer of the criminal cases opened into the applicant's allegations of ill-treatment and theft of his property and stated that at present the proceedings in case no. 12088 had been stayed pending the search for the accused."", '140. A decision of 21 November 2005 set aside the decision of 30 September 2005 as premature and ordered the resumption of the investigation. It stated, in particular, that although the case file contained evidence implicating officers N. and Ya. in the offences against the applicant, no procedural decision had yet been taken in their regard. It also noted that the investigating authorities had not yet decided on the question of whether to bring proceedings against Mr Z. separately.', ""141. By a decision of 24 December 2005 the investigation was suspended owing to the failure to establish Mr Z.'s whereabouts. The decision restated the circumstances of the offence imputed to Mr Z. and indicated that charges of aggravated negligence of official duties had been brought against him, that he had been banned from leaving his place of residence and eventually put on the wanted list in view of the fact that he had repeatedly failed to appear at the prosecutor's office and had been absent from his place of residence for a long period. The decision concluded that it was impossible to continue the investigation in the absence of the accused and ordered the Criminal Investigation Division of the Oktyabrskiy ROVD to organise a search for him."", '142. In a decision of 7 February 2006 a supervising prosecutor quashed the decision of 24 December 2005 and ordered that the investigation be resumed. The decision of 7 February 2006 was similar to that of 21 November 2005 and stated, in particular, that until that time no procedural decisions had been taken against police officers N. and Ya. despite the evidence of their involvement in the offences against the applicant.', '143. By a decision of 7 March 2006 the investigator in charge stayed the proceedings. The decision was similar to that of 24 December 2005 and stated, in addition, that charges had been brought against Mr D. and that he and Mr B. and Mr Ya. had been banned from leaving their place of residence and put on the wanted list (see paragraphs 80 and 82 above). It went on to say that it was impossible to continue the investigation in the absence of Mr Z., Mr D., Mr Ya. And Mr B., whose whereabouts were unknown, and instructed the Criminal Investigation Division of the Oktyabrskiy ROVD to organise a search for them.', '144. A decision of 21 August 2006 set aside the decision of 7 March 2006 as unlawful and unfounded and ordered that the proceedings be reopened. It stated, in particular, that the investigating authorities had not performed all investigative measures which could be carried out in the absence of Mr Z., Mr D., Mr Ya. And Mr B., and that no steps had been taken with a view to establishing their whereabouts. The decision noted that, although the case file contained information regarding the identity and the duty station of the aforementioned four officers, the investigation had failed to interview their relatives, neighbours and colleagues, or to conduct searches at the places of their service or residence with a view to finding relevant evidence and locating them.', '145. By a decision of 25 September 2006, similar to that of 7 March 2006, the investigation was again suspended. The applicant was informed of that decision by a letter of the same date.', ""146. In a letter of 5 October 2006 the applicant complained to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic about the decision of 25 September 2006 and requested the prosecutor's office to resume the investigation. He indicated the addresses of the individuals whose whereabouts, according to the decision of 25 September 2006, could not be established."", ""147. In a letter of 12 October 2006 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic informed the applicant that his complaint of 5 October 2006 had been examined and disallowed. The letter did not elaborate on the reasons."", '148. A decision of 9 January 2007 quashed the decision of 25 September 2006 as unlawful and unfounded. It was noted that the investigating authorities had not performed all investigative measures which could be carried out in the absence of the suspects and accused, and that no measures had been taken with a view to establishing the whereabouts of Mr Z., Mr D., Mr Ya. and Mr B. and delivering them to the Chechen Republic for investigative action although in the case file there was information concerning the place of their service and residence.', '149. A decision of 28 May 2007 ordered that the criminal proceedings be stayed. It listed investigative measures similar to those mentioned in the decisions of 7 March and 25 September 2006 taken in respect of Mr D., Mr Z. and Mr B. and concluded that it was impossible to continue the investigation in the absence of those three officers.', '150. A decision of 29 May 2007 ordered that the criminal proceedings be resumed, with reference to the necessity to complete a forensic examination ordered on 29 April 2007.', '151. Decisions of 29 June 2007, 25 December 2008 and 21 February 2009, similar to that of 28 May 2007, ordered that the investigation be suspended pending the search for Mr D., Mr Z. and Mr B., whose whereabouts remained unknown.', '152. A decision of 24 November 2008 ordered that the criminal proceedings be resumed. It stated that the decision of 29 June 2007 was unlawful and unfounded, as all versions of the incidents under investigation had not been checked and it was necessary to intensify the search for Mr Z. and Mr D.', ""153. A decision of 19 January 2009 set aside the decision of 25 December 2008 as unlawful and unfounded, stating that the investigating authorities had not taken all possible measures. It ordered, inter alia, identification by the applicant of Mr M. (see paragraph 161 below), an interview of Mr M. as a witness in connection with thedetermination as to whether he had participated in inflicting bodily injuries on the applicant, an examination of the question whether the materials concerning the theft of the applicant's property should be examined separately, as it had not been proven during the preliminary investigation that the offence in question had been committed by the same individuals who had inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant, an examination of the question whether to discontinue the prosecution of Mr B., who had expressed his intention to avail himself of an Amnesty Act of 22 September 2006 that had been passed in respect of perpetrators of criminal offences during counter-terrorist operations within the territory of the Southern Federal Circuit, and the performance of other investigative measures. The applicant was informed of the decision of 19 January 2009 by a letter of 22 January 2009."", ""154. The materials in the Court's possession reveal that during the investigation the applicant underwent forensic medical examinations on at least three occasions. It appears that the applicant was first examined by experts on 7 September 2001. The results of the examination are unclear because the relevant report is missing."", ""155. The case file contains a report on the applicant's forensic medical examination dated 4 April 2003. The results of that examination are unclear because the relevant part of the document is illegible. The report referred, however, to the forensic medical examination which the applicant had undergone earlier. It stated, in particular:"", ""“A forensic medical examination was ordered on 7 September 2001 in order to establish the degree of damage inflicted on the applicant's health by unlawful actions of the VOVD officers. According to expert report no. 192 of 7 September 2001, it was established that [the applicant] had lost his hearing capacity, had a scar on his left ear, and had eleven teeth missing from his upper jaw. The report does not indicate [the applicant's] other injuries, nor does it evaluate the degree of damage caused to his health. It is therefore necessary at present to conduct an additional forensic medical examination in order to establish and evaluate all injuries inflicted on [the applicant] by unlawful actions of police officers.”"", ""156. A report of 30 June 2005 attested to the closed fracture of the applicant's four ribs on the right side, the amputation of his left ear and the complete loss of hearing in the left ear, scars on the left side of the lower jaw and traumatic extraction of eleven teeth from the upper jaw. The report indicated that the applicant's ear could have been amputated by a sharp tool such as a knife or similar object and that the other injuries could have been sustained as a result of the repeated application of hard blunt object(s), possibly during the period and in the circumstances described by the applicant. It then stated that the total deafness in the left ear had entailed a considerable and lasting disability and that the ablation of the left ear had led to a facial defect necessitating plastic surgery. The report also mentioned that at present the applicant complained of deafness in his left ear and of discomfort caused by the absence of his left ear and that he was wearing his hair long in an attempt to hide his defect and avoided other people, including his friends and relatives, as he felt embarrassed about his appearance."", ""157. By an investigator's decision of 18 July 2000 the applicant was granted victim status. The decision did not refer to any case number and was signed by the applicant to the effect that he had been informed of that decision on the same date and his procedural rights had been explained to him."", ""158. The materials in the Court's possession reveal that in the period between November 2001 and August 2003 the investigating authorities sent a number of queries and requests to law-enforcements bodies in the Chechen Republic and in the Khanty-Mansiysk Region. In particular, they sought and obtained a list of police officers of the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior seconded to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in 2000-2001, photographs and transcripts of witness interviews of a number of those officers."", ""159. On an unspecified date the applicant identified Mr Z. from a photograph as the guard of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD who had let into the applicant's cell two individuals who had cut off his ear. On 10 February and 13 May 2003 Mr K. also identified Mr Z., stating that the latter had guarded the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in March 2000 and that it was he who had let in two individuals, one of whom had then cut off the applicant's ear."", ""160. On 26 November 2002 the applicant identified Mr B. from a photograph as the officer who, upon the applicant's delivery to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD on 5 March 2000, had beaten him, along with other officers, with an automatic rifle butt and then pressed a red-hot metal bar into the palm of his right hand, his face, forehead and tongue, and had cut the applicant's hair and forced him to chew it. On 28 November 2002 Mr K. also identified Mr B. from a photograph, stating that he had heard the latter, in the office of the head of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, order one of his subordinates to smash detainees' fingers with a sledgehammer. Mr K. also stated that Mr B. had been aware of all unlawful actions that had taken place in the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD."", '161. On 4 April 2003 the applicant identified Mr M. from a photograph as the officer who, at the relevant period, had been seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region as head of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and who, according to a relevant decision, had committed suicide on 12 October 2001. The applicant stated that Mr M. had never committed any form of physical violence against him. On 13 May 2003 Mr K. identified Mr M. from a photograph as an officer of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and stated that the latter had not been involved in any incidents with him.', '162. On 8 May 2003 the applicant and Mr K. identified Mr Ab. from a photograph as the guard at the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD who had photographed the applicant immediately after his ear had been cut off (see paragraph 25 above).', ""163. The decision of 19 May 2003 by which Mr Z. was charged under Article 293 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code (see paragraph 77 above) stated that, on 11 March 2000, the latter had neglected his duties as a guard of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD because, in breach of the relevant regulations, he had opened the applicant's cell and let in unidentified officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, one of whom had then cut off the applicant's ear thus causing severe damage to the applicant's health. The report went on to say that Mr Z. had further neglected his official duties by failing to report the incident to his superiors."", '164. Two decisions of 19 May 2003 stated that Mr Z. had failed to appear at the requests of the investigating authorities and that his whereabouts were unknown. One of the decisions accordingly banned Mr Z. from leaving his place of residence and another one ordered that a search for him be organised.', ""165. On 20 May 2003 the applicant identified Mr D. from a photograph as the person who had cut off his ear at the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD on the night of 11 March 2000. The applicant stated that he had never seen that individual before the incident of 11 March 2000 and that he was certain that it was the man who had inflicted the said injury on him. The applicant added that at the time of the incident the identified person's face had been thinner."", ""166. In a decision of 23 May 2003 the investigator requested a prosecutor to authorise an extension of the period of the preliminary investigation. The decision listed the investigative measures that had been taken, including questioning the applicant and granting him victim status, questioning a number of officials of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, including Mr P., Mr Dub., Mr S., Mr B., Mr Ya., Mr A., Mr Sh., Mr V. and Mr Z., questioning Mr K., seizing photographs of officers of the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior seconded for the relevant period to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and identification by the applicant and Mr K. from photographs of officers allegedly implicated in the offence. The decision stated that given that the officers who had been serving at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD during the relevant period lived in the Khanty-Mansiysk Region, in April 2003 the investigator had been seconded there and had obtained evidence of the involvement of a number of those officers in the alleged offence. In particular, Mr Z., who had been identified by the applicant from a photograph, and Mr K. had confirmed that Mr Z. had let officers from the special fire group of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD into the applicant's cell and that the officers had then cut off the applicant's ear. The decision went on to say that charges of aggravated negligence of official duties had been brought against Mr Z., who was at present on the federal wanted list as he was absconding from the investigating authorities. According to the decision, it had so far been impossible to interview Mr Ab., identified by the applicant from a photograph, and Mr K., as he had been on annual leave in the Republic of Uzbekistan. The decision also mentioned that the applicant had identified Mr D. from a photograph as the person who had cut off his ear and stated that measures were being taken with a view to establishing Mr D.'s whereabouts and bringing charges against him. The decision then listed the investigative measures which should be taken, including, in particular, questioning Mr D., Mr Ab., Mr B. and carrying out an additional forensic medical examination of the applicant as the results of the previous two examinations had been conflicting."", ""167.

In a letter of 3 June 2004 the Ministry of the Interior of the Chechen Republic replied to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic saying that an internal check carried out upon the latter's request had established that the aforementioned officers had never lived at the address indicated. According to the letter, the implication of those officers in the theft of the applicant's cars had therefore not been established."", ""168. On 15 August 2003 the applicant identified Mr N. from a photograph as the person who had cut off his ear at the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD on 11 March 2000.

By two similar decisions of 26 November 2003 the investigator ordered officers N. and Ya. to be compulsorily brought in for questioning on the same date. The decisions stated that on 26 November 2003 Mr N. and Mr Ya. had been summoned as suspects in the applicant's case; however, during the investigative measures in their regard both suspects had left the investigator's officer under a far-fetched pretext, with the result that it had been impossible to complete the investigative measures."", '171. In a letter of 18 August 2004 the Criminal Investigation Division of the Khanty-Mansiysk Regional Department of the Interior informed the Oktyabrskiy ROVD that Mr Z. was registered and lived at his home address in Khanty-Mansiysk, that at present he was on leave outside the territory of Khanty-Mansiysk and that his wife had refused to disclose his current whereabouts with reference to her constitutional right not to testify against her relatives.', ""172. In a letter of 18 November 2004 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic inquired of the Oktyabrskiy ROVD whether their instruction of 29 October 2004 to activate the search for Mr Z. had been complied with. In a letter of 3 December 2004 the Oktyabrskiy ROVD replied that, in an attempt to locate Mr Z., the Oktyabrskiy ROVD had made enquiries at his place of residence and duty station, sent a description of his appearance to places where he might be and had verified the relevant records to check whether he had ever bought railway tickets. The letter stated that, to date, Mr Z.'s whereabouts had not been established."", ""173. In a letter of 14 January 2005 the Oktyabrskiy ROVD informed the investigator that they had established the whereabouts of Mr Z. who was residing at his home address in Khanty-Mansiysk; however, it was impossible to deliver Mr Z. to the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic because he was under an undertaking not to leave his place of residence pending the criminal proceedings against him in the present case. In a letter of 18 June 2005 the Oktyabrskiy ROVD further informed the investigating authorities that Mr Z. had been removed from the federal wanted list because his permanent place of residence had been established."", ""174. By a decision of 29 June 2005 the investigator, upon a request by the applicant's lawyer, ordered an additional forensic medical examination of the applicant, stating that the report of 7 September 2001 (see paragraphs 154 and 155 above) had been incomplete and had not addressed one of the questions by the investigating authorities."", ""175. By a decision of 17 September 2006 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic rejected a complaint by the applicant's lawyer about the investigator's refusal to grant the applicant and his counsel full access to the criminal investigation file. The decision stated that the investigator had allowed the applicant and his lawyer to study, without making copies, reports on investigative measures in which the applicant had taken part and decisions ordering expert examinations and reports on the results thereof, and to receive copies of decisions to institute and suspend criminal proceedings and a decision to declare the applicant a victim in the case. The decision went on to say that, under the relevant legal provision, a victim could have full access to the file and make copies of the materials only upon the completion of the investigation and that, given that the investigation in case no. 12088 was still in progress, the investigator had rightly refused the applicant and his lawyer access to any other materials in the file."", '176. In a decision of 9 January 2007 the investigator requested a prosecutor to authorise the extension of the period of the preliminary investigation. The decision stated, in particular:', '“The preliminary investigation in the present case has established the following:-', ""“Mr B., performing the duties of head of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD ..., on 5 March 2000 ... clearly in excess of his authority, along with other unidentified persons, beat and kicked [the applicant] on various parts of his body, burnt the palm [of the applicant's hand] with a metal bar, cut [the applicant's] hair and forced the latter to eat it."", ""Mr Z., performing the duties of head of the convoy group..., when on duty in the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD ..., on 11 March 2000 at around midnight let into a cell of the IVS Mr D. – the deputy head of the special fire group – and other unidentified persons. Mr D., being in the state of alcohol intoxication and having a knife, along with other unidentified persons, entered the cell where [the applicant] and Mr K. were held, and, acting deliberately ... in clear excess of his authority, knocked [the applicant] down and started kicking him in various parts of his body. Thereafter an unidentified person held the applicant down whilst Mr D., using his knife, cut off [the applicant's] left ear."", ""Mr Ya., performing the duties of deputy head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD ..., in the period from 5 March until 24 May 2000, ... along with other unidentified persons stole from the applicant's house ... an Oldsmobile car belonging to [the applicant] and sold it for USD 500 to Mr Dzh.”"", 'The decision thus stated that the preliminary investigation should be extended because it was necessary to carry out numerous investigative measures and, in particular, to arrest Mr Z., Mr D., Mr B. and Mr Ya. and to seek authorisation from court to place them in detention, bring charges against them and question them, conduct searches at their places of residence, organise, if necessary, confrontations between the four individuals in question and the applicant and Mr K., prepare a bill of indictment, and so forth.', '177. In an application of 16 February 2007 the applicant requested the investigator to interview Mr Kh. Dzh., Mr R. Dhz. and Mr I. Dzh. – brothers of the deceased Mr Dzh. – in connection with the circumstances of the theft of his property, including his cars, stating that they, together with officers from the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, had been implicated in that offence, which could be confirmed by numerous eyewitness statements.', ""178. In a letter of 20 February 2007 the investigator informed the applicant that his application of 16 February 2007 had been granted and invited him to appear at the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic for questioning. The applicant states that he is unaware whether the aforementioned three persons were questioned."", ""179. The case file contains transcripts of the applicant's interviews of 1 and 5 September 2005 in which he described the circumstances of his arrest by the police and submitted that during his detention his property had been stolen from him, including his cars in respect of which he had kept the papers."", ""180. It can be ascertained from the case-file materials that Mr K., the applicant's cellmate (see paragraph 23 above), was questioned on several occasions."", ""181. When questioned on an unspecified date in 2000, Mr K. stated that he had seen unknown military officers enter the cell in which he and the applicant had been kept and cut off the applicant's ear. Mr K. also described the officer who had done it and stated that he would be able to recognise him."", ""182. During a witness interview of 4 September 2001, Mr K. made similar statements. In particular, he submitted that he had been apprehended on 10 March 2000 and placed in the applicant's cell. Mr K.'s stated that he had not noticed any visible injuries on the applicant. He further stated that one or two days later two unknown individuals of Russian ethnic origin had entered the cell; they had been inebriated and one of them had had a moustache. He confirmed that he would be able to recognize the person in question. According to Mr K., the IVS guard had told the intruders that they should not touch Mr K., but that they could do what they wanted with the applicant. The man with the moustache had ordered Mr K. to step aside and turn his back; the latter had slightly turned his head, however, and had been able to see one of the intruders knock the applicant down and hold him down whilst the man with the moustache took a knife and cut off the applicant's ear. The latter had been shouting very loudly and both intruders had been cursing. They had then left. Mr K. added that over the following days various officers had entered the cell and had severely beaten him and the applicant. Among those who had beaten them, Mr K. remembered two officers seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region."", ""183. In an interview of 15 November 2004 Mr K. gave oral evidence similar to that of 4 September 2001. In reply to the investigator's question he also stated that Mr N., whom he had previously identified from a photograph (see paragraph 168 above), resembled the person who had cut off the applicant's ear; however, he could not affirm that it had definitely been the same person as the incident had taken place long before."", ""184. Mr P., who from February until May 2000 was seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region as a senior inquiry officer at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, stated during an interview of 14 August 2000 that he had been investigating a criminal case against the applicant, that the latter's head had been bandaged and that, when being questioned in the latter respect, the applicant had submitted that four or five unknown persons had cut off his ear the day before he had been apprehended by officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Mr P. also stated that neither the applicant nor he had known who had cut off the applicant's ear and that the applicant had received the necessary medical aid during his detention."", ""185. During an interview of 21 March 2002 Mr P. stated that he did not remember what the applicant had looked like, whether the applicant had had any bodily injuries, whether his head had been bandaged, whether he had made any complaints about beatings in the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and whether he had been provided with any medical assistance. According to Mr P., he had heard that somebody had cut off the applicant's ear; however, he did not remember who had told him about that incident and he did not know who could have done it."", ""186. In an interview of 9 September 2002 Mr P. stated that he did not know which of the police officers could have inflicted bodily injuries on the applicant and denied stealing any items of the applicant's property."", ""187. Mr B., who between February and May 2000 was seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region to the Chechen Republic as the head of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, stated during questioning on 6 September 2002 that, in practice, he had performed his duties as head of the IVS starting from late March – early April 2000, as prior to that date the IVS had not existed, in the absence of necessary documentation. According to Mr B., when the applicant had been placed in the newly created IVS, he had had a fresh wound sustained as a result of amputation of his ear, which, as the applicant had said to Mr B., had been performed by an unknown man dressed in camouflage uniform. Mr B. denied having known or seen the applicant before, or having known those who had cut off his ear or having let anyone into the applicant's cell. He stated that he had reported the incident to the Grozny prosecutor's office, which had conducted an inquiry in that connection and had refused to institute criminal proceedings. He also stated that he had been told by someone that the applicant had explained that his ear had been cut off a day or two prior to his detention, by unknown members of illegal armed groups, for the applicant's refusal to cooperate with them."", ""188. In an interview of 26 November 2003 Mr B. stated that he had found out about the incident of 11 March 2000 the next day. In particular, he had been told that during that night several men, who had been drunk, had entered the applicant's cell and that one of them had cut off his ear. According to Mr B., they had probably been officers of the special fire group of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Mr B. stated that he did not know why there had been no internal inquiry in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD in connection with the infliction of injuries on the applicant. He insisted that he had performed his duties in strict compliance with the relevant regulations and had never used any form of physical violence against detainees or received any information that any violence had been used by his subordinates."", ""189. In a witness interview of 28 March 2003 Mr Z. confirmed that on several occasions he had been on duty as a guard of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. However, he denied knowing the applicant's surname or the circumstances of the latter's arrest. Mr Z. also stated that he did not remember whether he had been on duty on any date between 9 and 11 March 2000, whether he had let anyone into the cells, and whether “anyone's ear [had been] cut off in the cell”. Mr Z. also stated that initially visits to the IVS had not been registered at all, and that subsequently they had been noted down in a notebook."", ""190. During questioning on 28 April 2003 Mr Z. stated that he had a clear memory of the applicant who had been detained for having kept a TNT block and had been held in same cell as Mr K. Mr Z. then stated that on the date – which he no longer remembered – when he had been on duty, a group of officers from the special fire group of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD had entered the IVS. According to Mr Z., the officers had been drunk and told him to let them into the applicant's cell as they intended to talk with the detainees. Mr Z. had obeyed. He maintained that he had not watched what had been going on in the cell; however, some time later he had heard a moan and looked into the cell. Mr Z. had seen the applicant on his haunches with one of his ears missing. There had been a lot of blood on the floor. The officers of the special fire group had also been there; however, Mr Z. could not remember which of them had been holding a knife or who had cut off the applicant's ear. According to Mr Z., he had “expressed his discontent”, following which the officers had left. Thereafter Mr Z. and another guard had provided the applicant with medical assistance. Mr Z. also confirmed that an officer of Uzbek origin whose surname was Ab. had served in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD at that time, but he did not remember whether Mr Ab. had been in the cell when the applicant's ear had been cut off or whether Mr Ab. had had a photographic camera."", '191. In a witness interview of 4 May 2003 Mr Z. made statements similar to those of 28 April 2003.', ""192. In a witness interview of 12 October 2001 Mr Dzh., who between February and May 2000 had been an officer of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, submitted that in late March or early April 2000 Mr A., a driver at the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, had told him that he had bought for USD 200 two cars from police officers seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region. According to Mr Dzh., one of the cars had been left in Grozny and the other one had been conveyed to Urus-Martan and left in the courtyard of Mr Dzh.'s house where it had remained for about a year. Mr Dhz. further stated that at some point the applicant, who had come to Urus-Martan, had requested him to return the car, claiming to be its owner; the applicant had allegedly also accused Mr Dhz. of stealing his other property. Mr Dhz. stated that on two occasions he had proposed that the applicant take the car but that the latter had refused stating that Mr Dhz. should also pay for the other stolen property. According to Mr Dhz., the car had then been taken away by federal servicemen."", ""193. Mr A. stated during a witness interview of 13 October 2001 that in late February or early March 2000 he, along with two other police officers – Mr Sh. and Mr Sul. – had met a group of servicemen in camouflage uniform in an Ural truck and an armoured personnel carrier who had been towing two foreign-made cars. According to Mr A., the officer in command of the convoy had said that they were officers of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and then offered to purchase the two cars from them for RUB 2,000. The three men had agreed to buy the cars, although, in Mr A.'s submission, they had not known where the cars had been taken from, and who had been their owner. Mr A. further stated that he and Mr Sh. and Mr Sul. had hidden one of the cars in a nearby courtyard and taken the other one to their place of residence and then, three months later, to Mr Dhz.'s courtyard in Urus-Martan. According to Mr A., approximately four months later the applicant had expressed his intention to retrieve his cars and Mr A. had told him that one of the vehicles was in Urus-Martan, but the applicant had not taken it; however, he had taken the one that had remained in Grozny. Mr A. added that the applicant had not refunded them the money which they had paid for the cars. He also stated that he would be able to recognise the police officers who had sold them the vehicles."", '194. In a witness interview of 13 October 2001 Mr Sh. made statements similar to those of Mr A.', ""195. Mr V. stated during questioning on 13 October 2001 that at some point he had noticed a car in the courtyard of the house in which he had lived with Mr A., Sh. and Mr Sul. and that they had explained to him that they had purchased the vehicle from federal servicemen. According to Mr V., a month later the car had been taken to the courtyard of Mr Dhz.'s house in Urus-Martan, and some time later, upon Mr Dhz.'s request, Mr V. had told the applicant that he could retrieve the car. Mr V. claimed that the applicant had not taken the car but had retrieved another one that had remained in Grozny."", '196. The transcript of a witness interview on 13 October 2001 with Mr Sul. is illegible.', '197. During questioning of 15 January 2003 Mr A. retracted his statements of 13 October 2001 and stated that he had never participated in the purchase of the cars. He also submitted that he had heard from Mr Dzh. that the latter had purchased the cars from Mr Ya., the deputy head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD.', '198. In witness interviews of 14 May 2003 Mr A., Mr Sh. And Mr V. made statements somewhat similar to those of 13 October 2001. In particular, they stated that around late winter 2000 they and Mr Dhz. had met a convoy of an Ural vehicle and an armoured personnel carrier escorting two foreign-made cars and that Mr Dzh. had purchased the cars and taken one of them to Urus-Martan and left the other one in the courtyard of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. According to the three men, the applicant had visited Mr Dhz. in Urus-Martan several months later and attempted to retrieve the car but Mr Dzh. had stated that he would return the car in exchange for money equal to the amount he had paid for it.', ""199. Mr Dub., who between February and May 2000 was seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region to the Chechen Republic as head of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, stated during questioning on 15 March 2002 that he remembered a detainee with an amputated ear who had been delivered to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Mr Dub. insisted that none of the police officers had cut off the detainee's ear and that the Grozny prosecutor's office had carried out an inquiry into the incident and had decided to dispense with criminal proceedings. Mr Dub. stated that the applicant had told him in conversation that his ear had been cut off before the detention and that it had been done by one of several persons in camouflage uniform who had broken into the applicant's house. In a witness interview of 12 May 2003 Mr Dub. made similar statements. He also added that during the entire period of his secondment there had been no foreign-made cars or satellite dishes on the territory of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD."", ""200. During questioning on 3 September 2002 Mr S., an officer who had carried out a search in the applicant's house on 5 March 2000, denied seizing or stealing any items of the applicant's property."", '201. In a witness interview of 6 September 2002, Mr Kir., seconded between February and May 2000 from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region to the Chechen Republic as an officer of the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD, submitted that he had heard from his colleagues that the applicant had been delivered to the IVS with his ear cut off. According to Mr Kir., none of the police officers had inflicted any injuries on the applicant in his presence and the latter had received regular medical assistance in respect of his ablated ear. Mr Kir. also stated that had learnt from the applicant that his ear had been cut off two or three days prior to his detention.', ""202. Mr Ya., who between February and May 2000 had been seconded from the Khanty-Mansiysk Region to the Chechen Republic as the deputy head of Oktyarbskiy VOVD, stated during a witness interview of 29 April 2003 that he did not know how the applicant had received severe bodily injuries and that he had not conducted an inquiry in that respect as it had not fallen within his competence. Mr Ya. added that he had heard from other officers that the applicant's ear had been cut off by unknown members of illegal armed groups in revenge for the applicant's cooperation with federal forces. Mr Ya. denied stealing any property from the applicant or selling to anyone any cars belonging to the applicant. He said that he did not know Mr A. or Mr Dzh. and could not explain why they had indicated that they had purchased the applicant's cars from him. Mr Ya. also added that Mr S. (see paragraph 200 above) had informed him of the seizure during the search of 5 March 2000 of the applicant's satellite dish."", ""203. Mr S., when questioned on 4 May 2003, again denied having seized any of the applicant's property during the search and stated that it was unclear to him why Mr Ya. had made a statement to that effect. Mr S. added that there had been a garage in the courtyard of the applicant's house but it had been empty and that he had not seen any cars in the courtyard either. Mr S. also explained that the search of the applicant's house had been carried out on the basis of operational information received from the Federal Security Service to the effect that the applicant had provided food and water to illegal armed groups."", ""204. Mr D., identified by the applicant as the officer of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD who had cut off his ear (see paragraph 165 above), submitted during a witness interview of 26 May 2003 that the applicant's surname was unfamiliar to him. He stated, however, that the applicant might have been the person whom he had arrested in March 2000 following operational information received by the law-enforcement authorities to the effect that the applicant, who had been assisting the Ministry for Civil Defence and Emergency Situations of the Chechen Republic in distributing food and water to local residents, had given some of the provisions to illegal fighters. According to Mr D., a group of police officers, in two vehicles, had arrived at the place where the applicant had been working that day, and the decision had been taken to arrest the applicant without attracting the attention of local residents. Mr D. had approached the applicant and asked him to show the officers a certain street. After the applicant had got into one of the vehicles, he had been delivered to the Oktyabrskiy VOVD and left there. Mr D. stated that at the time of his arrest the applicant had had no visible injuries. He added that he had never met the applicant again and strongly denied inflicting any injuries on him. Mr D. stated that could not explain why the applicant had identified him as the person who had cut off his ear."", ""205. The case file also contains transcripts of witness interviews of a number of police officers who had participated in the search of the applicant's house on 5 March 2000 and officers who had served in the Oktyabrskiy VOVD during the relevant period. They all denied taking any property from the applicant's house, including any vehicles, or knowledge of the origin of the applicant's bodily injuries."", ""206. By a decision of 23 August 2005 the prosecutor's office of the Chechen Republic instituted criminal proceedings under Articles 158 § 3 (aggravated theft) and 167 § 1 (deliberate destruction of another's property) of the Russian Criminal Code in connection with the theft of the applicant's Subaru minivan and property from his house and the destruction of his house and outhouses, which had been established during the investigation in case no. 12088. The decision stated that the applicant's aforementioned property had been stolen and destroyed during his detention in the IVS of the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. It went on to say in that, so far as these offences were concerned, there was no objective evidence that they had been committed by officers from the Oktyabrskiy VOVD. Accordingly, the decision ordered that the relevant materials be disjoined from case no. 12088."", ""207.

The decisions did not indicate which measures had been taken during the investigation.', '212. A decision of 23 November 2005 set aside the decision of 23 October 2005 as unlawful and unfounded and ordered that the investigation be recommenced.

On 30 November 1998 the public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute.', '7. On 29 April 1998 the Ankara Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request for suspension of his transfer. On 22 May 1998 the applicant objected to that decision. On 3 June 1998 the Ankara District Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s objection.', '8. On 15 July 1998 the applicant requested the Ankara Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing.', '9. On 11 November 1998 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case, without holding a hearing. It ruled that the applicant’s appointment to the Şanlıurfa Airport had been effected in view of the needs of the General Directorate and that the administration had thus acted within its legal discretion and in accordance with the relevant laws.', '10. On 22 December 1998 the applicant appealed against the judgment of the administrative court and requested the suspension of the transfer. He also requested the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing.', '11. On 7 April 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the request for suspension.', '12. On 21 May 1999 the applicant once again requested the suspension of the administrative act. His request was dismissed by the Supreme Administrative Court on 9 July 1999.', '13. On 30 October 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court issued an interim decision requesting certain information and documents from the respondent administration, including the applicant’s classified appraisal records (gizli sicil raporları) and a description of his duties at the new place of assignment. It appears that the administration submitted the requested information and documents to the Supreme Administrative Court on 13 December 2002. However, neither the interim decision nor the responses of the administration were communicated to the applicant.', '14. On 30 January 2003 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the Ankara Administrative Court’s judgment of 11 November 1998 by a majority decision, without holding a hearing. The dissenting judge opined that the replies provided by the General Directorate to the questions put to it in the interim decision indicated that the applicant’s transfer had been based on subjective grounds and not on any public need as alleged. Upon service of the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision, the applicant found out about the interim decision of 30 October 2002 and the administration’s submissions in reply, including his appraisal grades which had apparently fallen following the various actions he had brought against the administration.', '15. On 30 April 2003 the applicant requested the rectification of the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision, complaining, inter alia, of the noncommunication of the interim decision of 30 October 2002 and the General Directorate’s replies thereto, which had prevented him from responding to its arguments. In the same letter, the applicant also attempted to challenge the accuracy of the information provided by the General Directorate.', '16. On 15 September 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s rectification request, holding that none of the reasons put forth by the applicant for rectification fell within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for rectification indicated in Section 54 (1) of Administrative Procedure Act (Law no. 2577).', '17. According to Section 16 (1) and (2) of the Administrative Procedure Act, after a claimant lodges a case with the administrative court, his or her submissions are transmitted to the defendant party. The initial written pleadings of the defendant in response are communicated to the claimant, who submits his or her replies thereto. The claimant’s replies are then sent to the defendant, who is invited to submit his or her final pleadings, to which the claimant cannot reply.', '18. According to Section 17 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act, an oral hearing will be held in administrative proceedings involving, inter alia, an action for annulment of an administrative act (iptal davası), upon request of either one of the parties.', '19. According to Section 17 (3) of the Administrative Procedure Act, a request for an oral hearing can be made by the parties only at certain stages of the administrative proceedings, that is at the time of bringing the case by the claimant, or as part of the subsequent written pleadings and replies submitted to the court by the parties (see paragraph 17 above).']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and, at the time of lodging her application, lived in Nizip, Gaziantep, Turkey. She now lives in Paris, having apparently been granted asylum in France. The applicant stated that she made the application not only on her own behalf but also on behalf of her daughter and deceased husband. The case concerns the applicant’s allegations that her husband, Mehmet Şen, was abducted, tortured and killed by members of the security forces.', '9. The facts surrounding the death of Mehmet Şen, are in dispute between the parties.', '10. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Part A below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Part B. The witness evidence taken by Delegates of the Commission at a hearing in Ankara is summarised in Part C. The summary of the other evidence submitted by the parties, in documentary form, which the Court considers relevant is to be found in Part D.', '11. The applicant’s husband, Mehmet Şen, was a Turkish national of Kurdish origin. He was an active member of the Democracy Party (the “DEP” Party) in Turkey until it withdrew from local elections. He had been the Party’s candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran (Birecik, Şanlı Urfa) in the 1994 local elections.', '12. Throughout his involvement with the DEP, Mehmet Şen was followed and threatened by plain-clothed police and this continued after the withdrawal of his candidacy. On 25 March 1994 Mehmet Şen informed the applicant that he was not being followed by the usual plain-clothed policemen but by other people whom he said might be “hit-men”.', '13. On 26 March 1994 at approximately 5 p.m., two plain-clothed policemen had a drink at the Çağdaş café in Birecik, which was owned by Mehmet Şen and Rasim Ağpak. At approximately 7 p.m., a Doğan SLX car (registration number 34 PLT 30) blocked the door of the café. Three plain-clothed persons entered, leaving the car engine running with a fourth person remaining in the vehicle. One of the three persons asked Rasim Ağpak whether he was Mehmet Şen. When he answered negatively, the person approached Mehmet Şen, who confirmed his identity and showed his identity card. Before the nine people in the café, the abductors stated that they were plain-clothed police who were there to take Mehmet Şen to the Security Directorate. Mehmet Şen was grabbed by the arms and taken away in the waiting car. It was later ascertained that a second car with four persons inside had left with the Doğan SLX vehicle.', '14. Upon hearing the news of the abduction, the applicant contacted, inter alia:', '(a) the Nizip Anti-Terrorism Department, who denied holding Mehmet Şen or any knowledge of the abduction;', '(b) the Gaziantep Security Directorate who also denied all knowledge; and', '(c) the Gaziantep Branch of the Human Rights Association, with a request that they look into the matter.', '15. Other persons also contacted the Gaziantep Security Directorate on the applicant’s behalf, but were told that Mehmet Şen was not in custody.', '16. On 28 March 1994 the applicant applied to the Nizip Prosecution by way of petition, reporting that Mehmet Şen had been abducted.', '17. On 30 March 1994 an unknown person telephoned the “Özgür Gündem” newspaper and the Gaziantep Branch of the DEP, saying that Mehmet Şen’s body was at the Gaziantep State Hospital. The applicant went to the hospital and, on examining the corpse, concluded that her husband had been killed under torture. She saw the body with the right eye gouged out, the right side of the head crushed to pieces, a broken right arm, broken fingers, marks of blows to the body, and a bullet wound to the head and one to the neck, with no traces of blood, implying that the shots had been fired after death.', '18. An autopsy report concluded that there was a bullet wound to the left side of the chest, a bullet wound above the right eyebrow, fired at almost point blank range, exiting the body from the back of the head, a bullet wound to the left cheek, fired at a distance of 95 cm, which had travelled through the body and lodged in the rib cage, that there were no other wounds, blows to the body or head, and that death had been caused by the bullet to the head.', '19. On 31 March 1994 the applicant and the DEP Member of Parliament for Siirt, Naif Güneş, met the representative of the Governor of Gaziantep. The Gaziantep Security Director and the Provincial Gendarmes Commander were also present. The Gendarmes Commander said that the body of Mehmet Şen had been found by a shepherd near the village of Karpuzkaya in the Şehit Kamil District of Gaziantep, and that the gendarmes had collected the body. The State Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, gave the applicant the same information. He also stated that the body had had no identity card on it, and therefore the autopsy report was headed “unidentified body”.', '20. However, the applicant was informed that a person at the hospital had witnessed four plain-clothed policemen take Mehmet Şen’s body to the hospital morgue on the night of 29 March 1994.', '21. On 13 April 1994 the Gaziantep Branch of the Human Rights Association, on behalf of the applicant, made an application to the Governor of Gaziantep and the State Prosecution. On 22 April 1994, the Governor replied that it had not been possible to determine any suspect or suspects but that the inquiries were continuing. The State Prosecution also indicated that the inquiry into the death was continuing.', '22. The applicant was not satisfied with the inquiries and the answers she had been given. The official information she had received was allegedly inconsistent with her own. She therefore continued contacting the State for answers. She was informed on 26 May 1994 by the State Prosecutor that there had been no developments.', '23. According to the statements of Osman Özer, Durmuş Kaplan, Maksut Yıldırım, Rasim Ağpak and Abit Şahin, who had been present when Mr Şen was abducted on 26 March 1994, three people entered the café where Mehmet Şen was playing cards. One of them asked where he could find Mr Şen. When Mehmet Şen presented himself, he was asked to show his identity card. Then the person in question came closer to Mr Şen and showed him a card, the details of which the witnesses could not see. Osman Özer and Maksut Yıldırım also stated that the persons who came into the café had not openly presented themselves as plain-clothed policemen, so they could not say for certain that they were. Rasim Ağpak stated that Mehmet Şen had not asked any questions or resisted the abductors. It was as if he had known them.', '24. On 29 March 1994 Mehmet Şen’s body was found near the quarry of Karpuzkaya on the Kahramanmaraş-Gaziantep highway construction site. On the same day an autopsy was carried out. The autopsy report concluded that death had resulted from a fractured skull, the destruction of the cellular tissues of the brain and an internal haemorrhage due to a bullet wound. There were no signs of assault or torture.', '25. The Nizip Public Prosecutor started an investigation into the killing of Mehmet Şen. On 18 May 1994 a decision of non-jurisdiction was issued and the file was sent to the Gaziantep Public Prosecutor. According to the preliminary findings, Mehmet Şen had not been taken into custody by the security forces. The car in which he was driven away carried a false registration number. The investigation was still pending in June 1996.', '26. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, three Delegates of the Commission took evidence in Ankara between 16 and 18 June 1998. The applicant appeared before the Delegates, as did ten other witnesses for one or other party. Certain other witnesses had been summoned but failed to appear. The evidence of those who attended the hearing may be summarised as follows:', '27. Mrs Şen was born in 1951 and had been married to Mehmet Şen since 1971. She had been a teacher and he ran the Çağdaş coffee house in Nizip, owned by his brother. He had had no personal enemies or debts. Nor had he been involved in any vendetta.', '28. Mr Şen became politically active around 1991, helping to create the HEP Party and the DEP Party in 1992. The DEP withdrew from the 1994 local elections due to the intimidation of its members (threats, detention and murders).', '29. Her husband had been a leading member of DEP and, when he stood as a candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran in early 1994, he was threatened by the Gendarmes Station Commander of that constituency (who may have been called Sergeant-Major Orhan), and regularly picked up by the police for questioning. He was so intimidated that he resorted to carrying a licensed gun and rarely went out alone. He was taken to the police station many times and harassed. He sold the gun eventually as he was detained several times at night with a view to ascertaining whether the gun had been involved in incidents. However, this was just part of the harassment to which he was subjected.', '30. Two days before he was abducted, Mr Şen told his wife that he was being followed by hit-men, men who were not his previous surveillance officers. He had been alerted to this possibility by an acquaintance who had been detained and interrogated about Mr Şen, and about whom the interrogators had said that Mr Şen would be “done away with”. Some seven people had been killed in the recent past by unknown perpetrators because of their DEP affiliation and/or membership of the Kurdistan National Assembly. These hit men were not recognised by Mr Şen, who had known most of the local policemen. They were of medium height and able-bodied, carrying radios and guns. Mrs Şen had understood her husband to mean that they were contra-guerrillas operating under State authority, as confirmed in the later Susurluk report.', '31. On 16 March 1994 Mrs Şen was informed of her husband’s abduction 5 minutes after its occurrence by Osman Özer, one of the café’s employees. Mr Özer told her that two strangers had been in the café for tea. They seemed tense, made a telephone call and left. Then a Doğan SLX car (registration number 34 PLT 30) stopped in front of the café, blocking the door. Of the four unknown people in the vehicle, one stayed in the driver’s seat with the engine running, another, carrying a gun and a radio, waited at the door. That man was well dressed and middle-aged. Two others, casually dressed, strong looking and with apparent special training, walked towards Rasim Ağpak, who looked rather like Mr Şen, and then moved on to Mr Şen, who identified himself. The two flashed identity cards at the people in the café. The armed man at the door spoke into his radio, “OK, Sir, we’ve got him”, and then said to Mr Şen, “You’re coming with us to police headquarters. We have business with you.” Mr Şen tried to ask questions but was dragged towards the door by the two men, holding him under his armpits. He was put in the back of the car, which drove off immediately. Despite the shock and panic of the people in the café, they managed to note down the registration number of the car.', '32. These matters were discussed over and over again in the following days with Osman Özer, Rasim Ağpak, Maksut Yıldırım and Durmuş Kaplan because Mrs Şen wanted to learn as much as possible about the details of the incident. It was during such discussions with others that she learnt that another car, with four other plain-clothed people in it, drove off behind the first. She had not talked to Abit Şahin, who had also witnessed the events, as she did not know him.', '33. The people in the café had said that the abductors had been policemen because of the gun, the radio, the identity cards they had shown everyone and what they had said. However, the café witnesses were taken from their homes in the ensuing days, at 2 o’clock in the morning, for interrogation, and statements were demanded of them. This had intimidated them.', '34. Immediately after Mr Özer’s call, Mrs Şen called the Nizip Police Headquarters and the Anti-Terrorism Department. They said that they had not taken him into custody and had no information about him. They confirmed that they would investigate. She tried contacting the Mayor, a Member of Parliament, a delegation from Switzerland and DEP members, for them to make inquiries about her husband’s fate.', '35. Mrs Şen’s inquiries with the Urfa, Gaziantep and Birecik Police proved fruitless. Travelling had been difficult at the time because of roadblocks and identity checks, through which only the security forces could pass easily. She nevertheless went to Adana after she had been told by a lawyer called Çağatay Özaslan that the car number plate was a forged one used by the Adana Police. The Public Prosecutor there was not helpful. He referred to a DEP Member of Parliament who had been killed and added, “What can I tell you? What can I do?” She was advised to go home and wait.', '36. She then met a DEP member called Müskün Kurucu who told her that the Gaziantep branch of the DEP had telephoned to say that she should return home immediately. On her arrival, she was told that the body of her husband was in the morgue at the State hospital. The Gaziantep DEP and the newspaper “Özgür Gündem” had been telephoned by a well-spoken Turkish lady who had provided this information. Mr Şen’s relatives were called and Mrs Şen met her sister-in-law and father-in-law at the hospital, where a crowd had gathered, cordoned off by the police.', '37. Mrs Şen was not informed of the circumstances surrounding the recovery of the body. Subsequently, the Public Prosecutor of Gaziantep, Mr Naci Ayaz, informed her that the body had been found by the gendarmerie in the rural area of Karpuzkaya, in the Şehit Kamil District of Gaziantep. The body was unidentifiable, as it had no personal belongings or identity card on it, until the inner pocket of the suit, which the corpse was wearing, was ripped open to disclose Mr Şen’s name, written by his tailor on the lining. However, Mrs Şen said that the suit had not been tailor-made, but had been a ready-to-wear purchase from a shop. She did not recall the gendarmes mentioning this matter to her. She therefore insisted on further information as to how her husband’s body had been identified. She was told that her husband’s belongings were to be kept for the investigation. A ring and watch were returned to her father-in-law in the autumn of that year.', '38. The sight of her husband’s body was horrible: the right side of his head had been smashed; his right eye was not in place; his right hand fingers and arm appeared broken, and there was a hole through his throat with no blood around it. She saw only one bullet wound. She insisted on having a copy of the autopsy report, which she was not given until long after the burial, and which did not correspond to her observations (such as its description of two other bullet wounds to the face).', '39. Mrs Şen told the Public Prosecutor that her husband had been tortured, and insisted that a murder investigation be conducted. However, the Public Prosecutor would not listen to her and no statement or information was sought from her. As she persisted in visiting the Prosecutor regularly, a statement was taken from her a month later on 26 April 1994. However, no progress whatsoever was made in the investigation, even years later.', '40. After her husband had been killed, her house was put under constant surveillance, all visitors being recorded, and many asked by the policemen on duty why they were visiting such terrorists. Her 12-year-old daughter had been stopped as she was leaving school and asked by plain-clothed policemen whether her mother used her as a courier and what kind of papers she was carrying. She was so scared by this and the idea that she might be killed like her father, that she stopped attending school.', '41. Mrs Şen received threatening telephone calls at that time. The caller said that he was a contra-guerrilla and that she would be killed too. She changed the locks on the doors to her home as her husband had had his house keys on him when he had been abducted. She and her daughter were away on 28 May 1994 when special policemen unsuccessfully tried to enter the house, according to the employees of the bakery situated on the ground floor of her building. The police then went to the house of Mrs Şen’s friends where her daughter was staying and asked why they had taken in a terrorist’s daughter. The father of that family was placed in custody for four or five days and interrogated about his relationship with the Şen family.', '42. Mrs Şen was warned not to go home as there was a purple civilian car waiting at the corner of the street and that she would be taken away. Since then she has not returned home even to recuperate her belongings or souvenirs of her husband. Out of the same concerns, she was living separately from her daughter.', '43. She was taken into custody on 10 November 1995 in Diyarbakır and interrogated for 11 days about her alleged membership of the PKK (the Kurdistan Workers’ Party) (see her other application to the Convention organs – Nuray Şen v. Turkey, no. 41478/98, judgment of 17 June 2003).', '44. Mr Şen was an elderly gentleman, born in 1916. He was the father of the deceased Mehmet Şen. His son had not told him of his fears for his life prior to his abduction, nor of the difficulties he had faced as a politician. He had had no enemies whatsoever. Everyone liked him.', '45. Mr Şen was informed the morning after the event that his son had been seized by policemen the evening before. He intuitively knew that he was dead. He went to Nizip. His daughter-in-law had gone to Adana in search of her husband. In Nizip he heard from Gaziantep that his son had been killed.', '46. Mr Şen went to the Gaziantep Hospital to identify the body. He did not meet Nuray Şen there. He could not bear to look at his son’s tortured corpse, but noticed that an eye was missing, apparently caused by a bullet wound, and that he had a fractured finger. His son’s clothing was bloodstained. Apparently he had been killed by the police, perhaps because of his candidacy for Mayor.', '47. The police ordered him to remove the body, but he did not do so until the following day. A great crowd gathered. They took the body back to the village and buried it. There were police and gendarmes everywhere on alert, who behaved disrespectfully. Nuray Şen was at the funeral.', '48. One or two months later he was called to appear before the Prosecutor and Judge to receive his son’s personal possessions. He took the watch and ring but not the clothes which were soaked in blood. The only inquiry made later was by the Gendarmes Station Commander, Sergeant-Major Orhan, about Nuray Şen’s stay with him for 9 or 10 days, which dates the gendarmes deliberately recorded wrongly.', '49. Mr Şen was born in 1970. He was no relation to the deceased Mehmet Şen and did not know him.', '50. In May 1994 the witness was stopped at a police roadblock at the exit from Nizip, where everyone’s identity was checked. One could not leave Nizip without going through this checkpoint. He was also given a body search and asked why he was carrying a copy of the newspaper “Özgür Ülke”. He alleged that, because of his surname and the possession of the newspaper, he was taken into a field by three officers and tortured with beatings for two or three hours. In view of this experience, he could understand how Mehmet Şen had died.', '51. Mr Aktaran was born in 1958 and was a Public Prosecutor at Gaziantep a year after the events, from February to August 1995.', '52. The investigation into the death of Mehmet Şen was opened by the Gaziantep Chief Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz. The file was subsequently transferred to him. It contained witness statements taken by the police, Mrs Şen’s statement to the Prosecutor and the autopsy report, but provided no serious leads as to the perpetrator of the crime. There was no ballistic expertise of the bullet found in Mr Şen’s body or of the empty cartridge found near his corpse. No evidence had been taken from police witnesses because none had been identified as being implicated in the death. The suggestion that Mr Şen had been involved in vendettas was not taken up as it had no serious basis.', '53. On receiving the file, the witness found lacking an inquiry into the registration number of the car in which Mr Şen had been abducted – a honey-coloured vehicle with a registration containing the letters PLT, PUC or PUD. This inquiry revealed that either the car had had false number plates or that the witnesses had been mistaken about the registration number. He did not seek other information following the evidence of the eyewitness Osman Özer as to a green car with the number 34 PVC 30 or 34 PVD 30. He was unaware of any significant discrepancies in the overall evidence on this or other points.', '54. Mr Aktaran considered that he and his colleague had conducted a satisfactory investigation in the circumstances. Prosecutors do not need to take further evidence from people whose statements have already been taken by the police. At the outset he had been open-minded about the applicant’s allegation that the security forces might have been involved in the incident. However, there had been nothing in the various statements taken to suggest that an inquiry into any particular officers was required. He placed a permanent search warrant on the file, so that the investigation would remain open for another 20-25 years should new evidence appear.', '55. Mr Kelleci was born in 1973 and at the material time was working as a reporter for the Gaziantep office of the “Özgür Gündem” newspaper. He had been acquainted with Mr Şen.', '56. In a general operation against the “Özgür Gündem” newspaper on 11 December 1993, the witness was taken into custody and held for some six days. On the fourth day of his interrogation, the name of Mehmet Şen was mentioned with a threat “to finish him off” or “do him in” along with two other named persons. Mr Şen’s name was cursed. The witness thought that the remarks were intended to be passed on to Mr Şen. He later informed Mr Şen of this threat and advised him to take care.', '57. The next time he saw Mr Şen was at the morgue. His newspaper had been telephoned with the news by a well-spoken Turkish lady. He had taken the call himself. When he saw the corpse, of which he took photographs, he remarked the strange position of the wrists, which looked fractured. He did not see the injured side of the face which was turned parallel to the table. No autopsy had been performed on the body at that stage.', '58. On returning home from the morgue, he received an anonymous telephone call also threatening him with death.', '59. Mr Kelleci accompanied Mrs Şen and a delegation to the Governor’s office on 31 March 1994. Afterwards, the witness saw the Gaziantep Gendarmes Commander, Chief of Police Hüseyin Çapkın and the Deputy Governor. They stated that Mr Şen’s death was possibly linked to gambling debts and had not been perpetrated by the State. He told them of the death threat he had personally received but it was not taken seriously. They persisted with the gambling debt theory and assured him that Mr Şen’s murderer would be found.', '60. Mr Alan was born in 1958 and was a tailor by profession in Gaziantep, as well as the Chairman and District Leader of the DEP Party at the material time. He knew Mehmet Şen from their common political activities. In those days there had been many killings by unknown perpetrators which, together with the bombing of the Party’s headquarters in Ankara, led to their withdrawal from the imminent elections.', '61. Mr Şen came to his shop four days before his abduction and offered to repair his car. When driving it away, the witness noticed that Mr Şen was being followed by a white police car, a Renault Toros. This had happened to him too. The occupants were obviously plain-clothed policemen, whom he could identify if he saw them again. All Party members were under great pressure at that time. Even after the Party’s withdrawal from the elections, it continued: he was taken into custody at midnight on 29 March 1994, four days after Mr Şen’s abduction, and challenged about disseminating propaganda for the Welfare Party instead.', '62. On the drive into custody, he was told that Mr Şen had “changed worlds”, and that he would be “sent to the place where he is”. He had understood the remarks to mean that Mr Şen was dead and that he would be killed too. (He had not heard of the recovery of Mr Şen’s corpse at that stage, so he was not too sure.) Panicking, the witness claimed to have made certain telephone calls before he had been taken from his house, including a call to the normal police. He was then punched and, before the car left town, it turned round and deposited him at the police anti-terrorism department, some 220 meters from his house.', '63. Mr Alan was held in police custody for 16 days. The custody records indicating a shorter period were incorrect. He was interrogated under torture. Mr Şen was not mentioned but Mr Alan was told that his Party was “finished in Nizip”. He was subsequently remanded in custody for three months, accused of being, inter alia, a member of, and aiding and abetting, the PKK. On release, these charges were dropped and a remaining charge of possessing a gun without a licence was still pending.', '64. Dr Erkol was born in 1962. She had worked as an expert in forensic medicine and as a lecturer at the Medical Faculty of Gaziantep University since 1990.', '65. Dr Erkol performed the autopsy on Mehmet Şen, whose identity was unknown at that time, as was that of his killer. Given the frequent blood feuds in the area, she suspected that the murder was another of that kind. She was struck by the fact that the victim had been blindfolded. Dr Ahmet Aslan, an unspecialised physician, assisted her at the autopsy. The Public Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, whom the witness described as a meticulous and responsible professional, attended the procedure.', '66. The body, fully clothed, was inspected on site and photographed by Dr Aslan and the Prosecutor. It was then taken to the hospital for examination. The bloodstains on the victim’s jacket indicated that he had been shot whilst clothed and still alive. The clothes were removed at the morgue. Dr Erkol had been told prior to the autopsy, and then saw herself, that the name of Mehmet Şen had been written in biro on the inside pocket of the jacket, but that was insufficient evidence of identity. She did not follow the local news, so had not heard about Mr Şen’s abduction. It was not her responsibility to identify the corpse.', '67. The body was X-rayed to verify the placement of any bullets still lodged in it. The X-rays were not kept. There were two bullet wounds to the head, one bullet having remained lodged in the chest. They had caused extensive fracturing, brain damage and haemorrhaging, resulting in death, some 36 hours to four days before the autopsy. It would appear that Mr Şen had been killed two or three hours after his last meal. It was not possible to be more precise about the time of death given the limited facilities available in Gaziantep. The bullet which had entered and exited the skull had torn the victim’s eye out. Neither the arms nor fingers had been fractured, but their distorted position would have been due to the onset of rigor mortis.', '68. The remaining bullet would have been kept. It was probably of a wide calibre – 9 mm – fired from a short-barrelled gun, within a 95 cm range of the body. A ballistic analysis could prove valuable only if linked to a suspect weapon and a comparative study.', '69. The body showed no trace of ill-treatment. In the absence of any obvious external signs or allegations of torture, no examination of the internal organs was conducted. However, the body had begun to decompose, presenting signs of post-mortem discolouring, distortion through rigor mortis, and, with the bullet injuries and autopsy incisions, was a very ugly sight. An untrained person might understandably misconstrue these elements as evidence of ill-treatment. Moreover, the body was not washed down after the autopsy, so it may have looked even bloodier. Washing was for the hoca, a religious leader on duty at the morgue, or the family to perform. The hole in the throat seen by Mrs Şen would have been an autopsy incision.', '70. People cannot enter the morgue without the Prosecutor’s authorisation, other than perhaps a very close relative who might be allowed to view the body by the hoca. She could not tell from the poor photocopy of the photograph taken by the journalist, Mr Kelleci, purportedly of Mr Şen’s corpse in the morgue, whether that photograph had been taken before or after the autopsy. However, judging by the position of one of the hands in the photograph, it was probable it had been taken before the autopsy had been conducted.', '71. It transpired that the photographs provided by the Government at this point in the hearing, and in respect of which the witness noted several contradictions with the autopsy findings, were not of Mr Şen’s corpse.', '72. Mr Güdül was born in 1947 and was the official chauffeur for the law courts. He also accompanied the Prosecutor at autopsies.', '73. In the present case he had driven the Prosecutor to where the body had been found. It was on the road construction site but accessible by car, albeit very dusty because of the nearby sand quarries and frequent heavy lorry traffic. There were gendarmes at the scene, as well as a finger print expert, a clerk and a doctor. The Prosecutor made a record which included the position of the body. This procedure took about an hour. The body was lying on its back, clothed. There was a yellow, car-polishing cloth over its eyes. There was blood on the ground which had come from the back of the head. The body was transported by ambulance to the Gaziantep State Hospital morgue as an on-site autopsy was not possible. There had been no discussion as to its identity.', '74. He was sure that no one saw the corpse at the morgue other than the officials concerned. He described the same X-ray, medical procedures and findings as Dr Erkol, having been present throughout. He did not recall the name of Mr Şen being inscribed inside his jacket. He had had no idea who the individual was. That was a police matter. For him it was just an ordinary incident. He did not recall being present when Mr Şen’s father arrived at the morgue to identify the corpse, although his signature had been on the relevant document. The circumstances had been very distressing at the time.', '75. Mr Pekbalcı was born in 1956 and was a farmer by profession. He had been working on the road construction site, obtaining materials from the quarry using explosives. He had had a fright after one particular detonation when he spotted a corpse about 10 m away from him, which, without approaching it, he reported to the Gendarmes Station of Aktoprak. He signed a statement to that effect at the station. The place where the body was found was accessible by car but was frequented mostly by lorries. He had been working with İbrahim Kilit at the time.', '76. Mr Sünbül was born in 1970 and was a Gendarmes Non-commissioned Officer. At the material time he was Station Commander at the Şehitarif Sub-station which was attached to the Central District Station in Gaziantep. His superior was Hüseyin Kanat, the District Gendarmes Commander.', '77. Mr Sünbül had been at his station when MM Pekbalcı and Kilit reported the presence of a corpse on the Tekfen highway construction site. He took statements from them and then went with a unit of his men to the location. There they found the clothed body of a man, some 45-50 years old, lying on his back, with firearm wounds to his head and face. He checked the throat artery, confirming death, cordoned off the area and notified his superiors. Although there appeared to be two bullet wounds, only one cartridge was found, despite a thorough search of the immediate vicinity. He had no idea of the time of death or how long the body had been there. The person in charge of the criminal laboratory at the Provincial Gendarmes Headquarters took photographs. These would still be in the gendarmes’ files if they had not been sent to the Public Prosecutor.', '78. The next day he typed up a report from his notes about the corpse, which had not been identified as no identity papers had been found, although Mr Şen’s name had been written on the jacket. The Prosecutor must have been shown that. He had not been aware of Mrs Şen’s missing person report the day before. His station had not been informed of that. The abduction had taken place in Nizip and his station would not have been informed unless directly asked to make inquiries. He presumed that his superiors had conducted the necessary inquiries after he had told them about the name in the jacket.', '79. Mr Sünbül sent the empty cartridge case, together with the person’s ring and watch and the documents he had prepared, to the Public Prosecutor that day. The blindfold was also transmitted. It had the name and number of a petrol station on it, about which inquiries were made by his superior officer. No analysis was carried out of the soil near the corpse for the fibres of other clothes or the like. He could not recall whether casts were made of the footprints near the body.', '80. The body’s location had been accessible by car. The area consisted of compacted earth on which there were footprints. Only the site workers frequented the area and the body had been well hidden from view. There were no vehicle tracks within an 8 to 10 m perimeter of the corpse.', '81. He did not recall whether there had been checkpoints in place on the day the body was found. Subsequently, he interviewed local villagers and site workers in an unsuccessful effort to gather information about the incident. It would have been possible to have transported Mr Şen to the site using secondary roads and thus avoiding the road-blocks on the main route. If he had been informed of Mr Şen’s abduction, he would have instructed the checkpoints under his control to look out for him. At the checkpoint, people’s identity cards would be checked manually against a list of wanted persons. The officers could also search vehicles and persons who were suspect.', '82. Mr Kanat was born in 1969 and he was the Şehit Kamil District Gendarmes Commander at the material time, with six stations under his command, including a large central station. The workload was very heavy.', '83. After being notified of the incident by the Station Commander, he in turn notified the Provincial Gendarmes Commander and the regiment’s operations centre. He accompanied the Public Prosecutor to the scene, which had already been secured on his instructions by the Station Commander. The regiment’s team of crime specialists arrived in separate vehicles and carried out a systematic and detailed investigation. The photographs which they had taken should have been retained at the Gaziantep Central Gendarmerie. They would have been sent to the Public Prosecutor if requested. They were kept principally to assist in identifying the body and showing them to people assisting with the inquiries.', '84. Mr Kanat confirmed Mr Sünbül’s description of the corpse, the bullet wounds, the empty cartridge and the name written inside the jacket. The body seemed to have been in place for some time – perhaps 15 or 16 hours. He thought that a ballistic test had been made at a later date. The results would be in the Prosecutor’s file. The blindfold was marked with the name of a service station called Petrol Ofisi, from which it was thought that the victim could have been from Nizip. However, he had not heard of the abduction of Mr Şen beforehand. The area was searched for footprints or other leads. Footprints were found near the body which could have been those of the people who had discovered it. However, they were not recent enough for casts to be made.', '85. On the instructions of the Prosecutor, they searched the body and found a small piece of paper in the inner pocket of the jacket with the name Mehmet Şen written on it. It could also have been the case that the name had been written in very small letters on the pocket lining. Perhaps a dry cleaner had done this. They took the blindfold and notified the regiment’s operations’ centre to confirm the person’s identity. This was not confirmed until the witness returned to the main station in Gaziantep. He was not present at the autopsy but did attend the funeral.', '86. After establishing that the deceased person was Mehmet Şen, Mr Kanat went to Nizip where he started his inquiries. According to the statements of witnesses, the victim was last seen playing cards at the coffee shop. Three people entered the café and then left with him by car. The vehicle bore the registration number 35 PLT (or PLV) 30 which, following inquiries by the provincial police headquarters, proved to be false. Other similar numbers were searched unsuccessfully. He rejected any suggestion that the security forces in the area had been operating in vehicles with false number plates. All their vehicles had official plates. Inquiries were also made as to the identity of a woman who worked in a nightclub, and who was mentioned in the statements taken, but a check on all the nightclubs proved fruitless. Nothing suspicious was reported by the local stations or the check-points on the main road. In any event, it would not have been possible for them to check every passing vehicle as traffic was heavy. Besides, the killer could have taken the secondary roads with no roadblocks.', '87. At first he did not consider the possibility that the death had been perpetrated by officials. He thought that this was a settling of scores within the “organisation”, particularly as the victim had been a candidate in local elections, and such unpleasant incidents frequently occurred at the time. Later however he did make unofficial background inquiries into Mrs Şen’s allegation of official involvement, particularly concerning police employees, but he found no evidence to support her claims. He thus rejected this theory. He made no contact himself with Mrs Şen, the café employees or any DEP Party members. Statements were taken by his subordinates about the murder. The police also took statements, possibly because of the abduction offence which had occurred within their jurisdiction. No records were drawn up of inquiries which proved fruitless. So, for example, if someone had gone to the aforementioned petrol station but inquiries there had revealed nothing pertinent, no record of that visit would have been made.', '88. More than ten people had been murdered by firearms during the three years he was stationed in the area. Most of the perpetrators of those crimes had been found. The killer of an unknown person, whose head had been crushed beyond recognition, was not found, like the murderer of Mr Şen. These two incidents were unusual. He had heard that seven members of the DEP Party had been murdered, but did not know if it had occurred at the material time. He had not heard of groups of contra-guerrillas employed unofficially to eliminate political opponents or activists, other than what he had read in newspapers.', '89. Certain key witnesses failed to appear before the Delegates of the Commission: the eyewitnesses to the abduction of Mr Şen from the coffee shop, namely Osman Özer, Rasim Ağpak, Maksut Yıldırım, Durmuş Kaplan and Abit Şahin, who were to have been summonsed through the applicant’s representatives, and the principal Public Prosecutor in the case, Naci Ayaz, summonsed through the Government Agent. Mr Ayaz refused to attend the hearing because of a heavy workload.', '90. The applicant declared that her husband had been abducted from his place of work by plain-clothed policemen on 26 March 1993 around 7 p.m. and that she had had no news of him since. There had been seven eyewitnesses to the event. The applicant also lodged a formal criminal complaint. The Prosecutor immediately ordered the Nizip Security Directorate, urgently, to make the necessary inquiries and take the pertinent statements. On 30 March 1994 the Prosecutor issued a similar instruction to the Gaziantep Population Service. That day, he also issued the burial certificate and authorisation. On 18 April 1994, the Prosecutor requested an urgent reply to his instructions from the Nizip Security Directorate.', '91. The Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, instructed the Gaziantep Gendarmerie to make an in-depth, discreet investigation into the murder, to identify the assassins, and to respect their defence rights on arrest, to take the evidence of eyewitnesses and to transmit the results to him.', '92. Mr Kilit described how his colleague, Selahattin Pekbalcı, had found the corpse of Mehmet Şen while working nearby on 29 March 1994, and he had driven over with his lorry to see it and immediately notified the gendarmes. He did not get out of the lorry to examine the corpse more closely. Mr Pekbalcı stated that he had been recuperating cables for explosives work and, while walking down the highway, he had spotted the corpse. He then informed Mr Kilit and accompanied him to the gendarmerie.', '93. Mr Mehmet Sünbül, a Gendarmes Sergeant, recorded that Mr Pekbalcı had said to him that he had spotted the corpse on the highway construction site but had been too scared to go over to it. Mr Sünbül had made a sketch of the site and the placement of the corpse. That record also contained details of the few personal effects found on the deceased, which effects included a ring and watch.', '94. Mr Sünbül had made a sketch of the site and the placement of the corpse. He recorded that the body of an unidentified person had been found. The deceased was Mehmet Şen, killed by a bullet to the head. The crime had probably been committed some 24 to 36 hours before the body was discovered. The identity and number of the assassins were unknown. The minutes described, inter alia, how the gendarmes had been informed of the incident and the state of the corpse (see also paragraph 95 below).', '95. The Gendarmes Command had informed the Prosecutor’s Office by telephone that the body of an unidentified man had been found, shot, 2 km from the village of Karpuzkaya. Prosecutor Naci Ayaz and other officials went to the scene of the incident at the highway construction site. The area had been cordoned off. The state of the body was described and the evidence of Mehmet Sünbül was taken. He said that around 2 p.m. that day two construction workers had come to the Gendarmes Station and reported the body. He went with his team and the two workers to the scene. He found the body of a man of around 40 years of age, and gave other details about the corpse. An empty cartridge had been found a metre away. He noted that the name Mehmet Şen had been written in biro on the lining of the inside pocket of the deceased’s jacket. Photographs were taken of the body and the scene. The doctor present said that an autopsy could not be conducted there and then as night was falling, so the body was taken to the State Hospital.', '96. The state of the corpse and its clothing were described. The cause of death was found to have been a bullet wound to the skull, causing major brain damage and haemorrhaging, some 36 hours to 4 days before the examination.', '97. The report, written by Mr Hüseyin Kanat, described the finding of the body of an unknown person who had been murdered with a 9 mm calibre pistol. The deceased’s clothes and personal effects were depicted. On 29 March 1994 around 2 p.m. a telephone call was received at the gendarmerie from someone calling himself Mehmet Şen (sic), reporting the finding of a male corpse. The Chief Prosecutor was immediately informed. After an investigation, it was established that the person had been killed on 28 March 1994.', '98. The report, also written by Mr Hüseyin Kanat, gave the identity of the victim, his wife and their address. It mentioned the abduction on 26 March 1994 and that inquiries were continuing.', '99. The Prosecutor, Naci Ayaz, described the finding of an unidentified corpse near the Karpuzkaya village on 29 March 1994 and the subsequent identification of the body by Necip Şen, the father of the victim, the next day.', '100. The property found on or near the deceased was listed. It included a 9 mm empty cartridge, cigarettes and a lighter, and a windscreen cloth from the Bucak petrol station.', '101. Mr Kaplan stated that he had known Mehmet Şen for some 5 to 10 years. Mr Şen had been his associate in running the Çağdaş Café. On 26 March 1994 around 4 or 5 p.m., Mr Şen had been playing cards in the café with others. Mr Kaplan had been at another table. Three unknown men came into the café. Two stayed at the door and the third approached Mr Şen. While asking to see his identity, the man showed him his. The latter had had his back to Mr Kaplan and was carrying a walkie-talkie. One of the men at the door told him to hurry up, whereupon Mr Kaplan looked at him. He described that individual. Mr Şen left the café with them, quite normally, in a car with a registration number beginning with the numbers “34”. Before meeting Mr Şen, Mr Kaplan had known that he had been a heavily indebted gambler. Mr Şen’s brother in Germany paid his debts. Mr Şen knew a certain İnci Doğan, a hostess at the night club in Gaziantep. Mr Kaplan had previously discussed with Mr Şen the latter’s DEP Party candidature for the post of the Mayor of Ayran.', '102. Mr Kaplan confirmed his statement above (paragraph 101) and added that he had not seen whether an actual identity card had been shown to Mr Şen by the stranger who had approached him; nor did he hear the reason why Mr Şen was being taken away. Mr Şen had not seemed perturbed, however. Because of gambling debts amounting to 50-100 million Turkish lira, Mr Şen had sold two bakeries which he had owned, and his home and café were mortgaged.', '103. Mr Özer declared that he had known Mehmet Şen for 2 or 3 years. He was one of his associates in the running of the Çağdaş Café. On 26 March 1994 around 4 or 5 p.m., they had been playing cards with two others when three unknown men came into the café. Mr Özer described two of them. One man came over to the card table and asked for Mehmet Şen, who identified himself. On request, Mr Şen showed his identity card, which the man kept, and then showed his, asking Mr Şen to follow him, which he did without protest. The man said to them, “It’s not serious.” The four left in a metal green coloured Doğan SLX, registration number 34 PVC (or PVD) 30. He immediately notified Mrs Şen, but was unable to tell her who the men were. He added that he had read in the newspapers that Mr Şen had been a DEP Party candidate for the post of the Mayor of Ayran.', '104. Mr Özer essentially confirmed his statement of 1 April 1994 (paragraph 103 above), whilst amending the car registration number to 34 PLT (or PVT) 30, and adding that Mr Şen had had gambling debts and had been involved in a long-standing vendetta.', '105. Mr Şahin said that he had been a waiter at the Çağdaş Café. On 26 March 1994 Mehmet Şen had been playing cards with others there. All Mr Şahin had seen, around 7 p.m., was Mr Şen leaving with two other people, whose backs were turned to him and whom he was incapable of recognising or identifying. He had heard it said that these people had presented themselves as policemen.', '106. Mr Yıldırım had been playing cards with Mehmet Şen at the Çağdaş Café on 26 March 1994 when, around 5.15 p.m., a man had entered the café and asked Rasim Ağpak if he were Mr Şen, whereupon the latter identified himself. The individual showed Mr Şen a document enclosed in an identity wallet, and told him that he had to accompany him, which he did. Mr Yıldırım had not taken note of the individual or his appearance as he had had his back half-turned away from the man. Before leaving, Mr Şen asked Mr Özer for some money, but Mr Yıldırım had not looked at him at that point in order to avoid any embarassment. He had not been worried by any of this as he had been absorbed by the excitement of the card game. After drinking some tea, Mr Yıldırım went home. He knew that Mr Şen had been involved in a vendetta for years and that he liked going to nightclubs and gambling, thereby spending the money he made from the bakery which his brother had given him.', '107. Mr Ağpak said that on 26 March 1994, around 5.15 p.m., someone came up behind him while he was playing cards at the Çağdaş Café, asking whether he was Mehmet Şen. Before Mr Ağpak could turn round to see who was speaking to him, Mr Şen identified himself. Within a few seconds, Mr Şen had left the café. Mr Ağpak could not remember what the stranger had looked like or whether he had shown an identity card. He had continued playing cards as the matter did not concern him.', '108. On the basis of the statements made by the eyewitnesses, MM Kaplan, Özer, Yıldırım and Ağpak, a sketch was made of the inside of the Çağdaş Café where they had all been sitting when Mr Şen was taken away, the streets outside and the placement of the abduction vehicle, registration number 34 PLT 320 or 34 PVT 30.', '109. It was recorded that the investigations, including a car registration check, had so far not disclosed the identity of the killers of Mehmet Şen, but that inquiries were continuing.', '110. The report recounted that on 29 March 1994 the body of an unknown man was found 2 km from the village of Karpuzkaya. The autopsy revealed that he had been killed on 28 March 1994 by a gunshot wound to the head. Investigations discovered that the victim had been Mehmet Şen who, on 26 March 1994, had been abducted from a night club by three people in a car bearing the false registation number 34 PLT 30. Since then there had been no news of him.', '111. It was noted that the gold wedding ring and wristwatch belonging to Mehmet Şen were to be handed to his heirs.', 'a) on 4 April 1994 to the Gaziantep Human Rights Association', '112. The applicant stated that her husband had been abducted from his café on 26 March 1994 around 7 p.m. by three people claiming to be plain- clothed policemen, in a honey-coloured Doğan SL car, registration number 34 PTL 30. Her enquiries of the local authorities revealed nothing. She later learnt of and saw his tortured body at the morgue of the Gaziantep State Hospital. The applicant recounted her husband’s fears on 25 March 1994 about two men who had been following him, and the eyewitness accounts of two strangers being in the café drinking coffee on the afternoon of the abduction. She suspected that her husband had been abducted, tortured and killed by contra-guerillas.', '113. This statement essentially contained the applicant’s original allegations described above (see paragraphs 11-22 and 27-39). She added that she was now convinced that her husband had been abducted, tortured and killed by contra-guerillas because of his political beliefs and activities for the DEP Party.', '114. This statement essentially contained the applicant’s original allegations described above (see paragraphs 11-22 and 27-39). She claimed that four people had abducted her husband (rather than the three previously mentioned, paragraph 112 above). She could conceive that her husband had been murdered because of his political affiliations and ambitions, but was now of the view that it had been the work of contra-guerrillas. Seven DEP Party members had been abducted and murdered to date. She confirmed her criminal complaint and asked that her husband’s killers be brought to justice.', '115. The applicant recounted how her father-in-law, Necip Şen, had been called to the office of the Birecik State Prosecutor and handed his son’s ring and watch. He was informed that no progress had been made in the identification of his son’s murderers. However, on the many occasions on which the applicant had gone to the Gaziantep Prosecutor’s Office for a progress report, she had been told that no personal possessions had been found on her husband’s corpse. She therefore deduced that the Turkish State knew of her husband’s murder / murderers, and demanded to be told, inter alia, how the State had obtained the ring and watch, from whom, and for how long they had kept them, as well as the identity of the murderers and her husband’s last words.', '116. Mrs Şen alleged that her father-in-law had been mentally tortured by the Urfa Anti-terrorist Department in January 1995 to give information about her current whereabouts and activities. Her relatives in Nizip and Gaziantep were being put under similar pressure. So she could no longer go home or work. Since giving an interview to Amnesty International, she had been denounced as a PKK member at a press conference given by a Turkish Government spokesman, relayed in the press and on television. Her death warrant had thereby been signed by the State and she requested international support. (The applicant later made other statements to the Convention organs, alleging her ill-treatment, which statements were dealt with separately in application no. 41478/98, decision of 30 April 2002.)', '117. Mr Dirik was recorded as saying that people had knocked on his door at 3.30 a.m. on the same day as Mehmet Şen’s abduction, 26 March 1994. İsmail Kelleci, a journalist at the “Özgür Gündem” newspaper, had been told by the Gaziantep Security Directorate in December 1993 that they knew what Arif Dirik and Mr Şen had been doing, that their patience had run out and that they were going to kill the two of them. Mr Dirik declared that he could no longer go home and that, if any action was taken against him, it would be the responsibilty of Hüseyin Çapkın and the Gaziantep Security Directorate.', '118. In response to their inquiries, the Association was informed that it had not been possible to determine the identity of the offenders, but that the investigation was being pursued in many directions in order to cast light on the incident.', '119. The letter enclosed the latest statements (three), records (four) and a rough sketch that had been drawn up for the investigation file.', '120. The Nizip Prosecutor stated that he had no geographical jurisdiction in the matter of the murder of Mehmet Şen. Accordingly, he referred the file to the Gaziantep Prosecution.', '121. In response to a request for information, the Governor explained that Mrs Şen had filed a petition with the Nizip Prosecutor on 28 March 1994 concerning the abduction of her husband. A body was found on 29 March 1994. The autopsy established that the victim had been shot, and inquiries revealed that the deceased was Mehmet Şen. The security forces denied any involvement in the matter. Any allegation to the contrary was an absolute, slanderous lie. Allegations by Mrs Şen that she had been ill-treated were also untrue. An investigation into the registration number, 34 PLT 30, of the car in which Mr Şen had been taken away, revealed false plates.', '122. The Prosecutor, Zekâi Aktaran, instructed the gendarmerie to make an in-depth, discreet investigation into the murder, to identify the assassins, and to respect their defence rights on arrest, to take the evidence of eyewitnesses and to transmit the results to him.', '123. The gendarmes recorded that little progress had been made in the investigation concerning the murder of Mehmet Şen. No new clues had been revealed by their inquiries, which were continuing.', '124. Lieutenant Hüseyin Kanat reported to the Gaziantep Prosecutor that no progress had been made in the identification of the corpse found shot on 29 March 1994. Moreover, no information had been gleaned concerning the murderer(s). The gendarmes had no clues or evidence which could throw any light on the case. The investigation would continue.', '125. Prosecutor Zekâi Aktaran requested the directorate to run a search on a metallic green Doğan SLX car, registration number 34 PUC (PUD) 30, or a honey-coloured Doğan SLX car, registration number 34 PTL 30. The directorate replied on 18 April 1995 that these registration numbers belonged to other vehicles of different makes and colours.', '126. The warrant stated that the search for the guilty person(s) had continued but their identity had not been established. The search would be kept open until time-barred on 30 March 2014, in accordance with Article 102 (1) of the Criminal Code. A letter of inquiry would be addressed to the gendarmerie every three months in the meantime.', '127. The reports recorded that on-site inspections of the scene of the crime had been made but no new elements had been discovered. The local villagers had been unable to shed light on the facts of the case and inquiries would continue.', '128. The destruction of the respective 1995 and 1997 monthly progress reports concerning attempts to identify the perpetrators of the murder on 28 March 1994, in the region of the Karpuzkaya village, was noted.', '129. The reports recorded that the investigation into the murder of Mehmet Şen had been concluded without the perpetrators being found, but that efforts to do so would continue. Some of these reports mentioned the patrol visits to the village of Karpuzkaya, 2.5 km from where the body of Mr Şen had been found. The villagers recalled the incident, but had not known the deceased and could not provide any further information, other than the idea that the incident could have been caused by passers-by on the inter-city road.', '130. The reports repeated the preceding gendarmes progress reports.', '131. Mr Oruç submitted a similar statement to that of Mr Yusuf Şen (paragraph 50 above) and Halil Alan (paragraphs 60-63 above): He had been taken into custody (authority unspecified) on 30 March 1995, on suspicion of being active for the PKK. He alleged that he was asked whether he knew Mehmet Şen who, because of his illegal activities, they had killed. He was then warned that, if he failed to confess, he would suffer the same fate. (He had not appeared before the Delegates to testify to this, as had been proposed at one stage by the applicant’s representatives.)', '132. Mrs Dirik said that Mehmet Şen had been a family friend. He had telephoned her one or two days before his kidnapping in an anxious state. He had wished to speak to her husband who was not in. After his abduction, her husband went with Nuray Şen to Adana to inquire whether Mehmet Şen was in police custody there. While he was away, around 2 to 3 a.m. at night, her doorbell rang and there was a loud banging on her door. Peering through the curtains, she saw two men and a taxi. She made a couple of telephone calls and was advised not to open the door. She thought it could have been the police, as her husband would have used his key and he had previously been threatened and taken into custody because of his political and trade union activities. Eventually the strangers left. The next morning she saw that the doorbell had been broken. At the Human Rights Association the following day, she heard that the tortured corpse of Mehmet Şen had been found. On being informed of this, her husband never returned to Gaziantep.', '133. Mr Dirik confirmed his wife’s statement above (paragraph 132 above). Prior to the events in question, on 10 December 1993 İsmail Kelleci had been detained in an operation against the “Özgür Gündem” newspaper. Mr Kelleci had told Mr Dirik that the police had asked whether he knew him and Mehmet Şen, to which Mr Kelleci replied that he knew the latter. The police allegedly stated that Mr Dirik would soon be killed. Mr Dirik had been taken into custody several times, fortunately with others; otherwise he feared he might have disappeared too. He had been a refugee in Germany since Mr Şen’s death.', '134. The Amnesty Report alleged gross violations of human rights being inflicted on civilians in south-east Turkey in the context of the 10 year old conflict between Turkish Government forces and the PKK. It reported disappearances, extrajudicial executions and torture in police and gendarmes stations.', '135. The Government informed the Commission that, on 10 November 1995, the applicant had been taken into custody on suspicion of being a member of the PKK, and was the subject of a criminal investigation by the Prosecution Service of the Diyarbakır State Security Court.', '136. The Government informed the Commission, inter alia, that the investigation into the death of Mehmet Şen, under file no. 1994/3941, by the Gaziantep Prosecution Service was still pending, the perpetrators of the crime not yet having been identified.', '137. The Government informed the Commission that an investigation had been carried out by the Public Prosecutor, under file no. 1996/4823, into the applicant’s allegations to the Commission on 25 April 1995 that she had been tortured during her detention between 10 and 21 November 1995. The medical examinations which had been conducted at the time, on her arrest and release, showed no evidence of any violence to her person and, therefore, the Prosecutor had closed the investigation.', '138. The reports stated that the bullet examined was of the SPB make, 9x19 mm calibre, which could not be traced to any other previous incident involving unknown perpetrators. The report was accompanied by a covering letter dated November 1997 (actual day illegible), from the Gaziantep Central Gendarmes Command, explaining that an empty cartridge marked “Parabellum SPB”, found at the scene where the body of Mehmet Şen had been discovered, had been sent for an expert examination.', '139.

Pekkanen,"['6. The applicant is a Netherlands national born in 1945. He lives at Geffen in the province of Noord-Brabant, where he is a dairy farmer.', '7. The applicant owned a cowshed in which there were originally 90 stands for milch cows and cows in calf as well as 63 stands for calves and heifers. In the years 1981, 1982 and 1983 the numbers of milch cows and cows in calf were 90, 96 and 102, respectively; the quantities of milk produced by the applicant in those years were 475,952, 445,571 and 488,026 kilograms.', '8. After the Ordinance no. J 1731 on the Additional Levy (Beschikking Superheffing) of 18 April 1984, Staatscourant (Government Gazette) 79 -""the 1984 Ordinance""- was published on 19 April 1984, the applicant was allocated a reference quantity (that is a quantity of milk in excess of which an additional levy is payable - see paragraph 23 below) of 445,813 kilograms.', '9. On 29 June 1984 the applicant filed a claim for a larger levy-free quantity of milk under Article 11 of the 1984 Ordinance (see paragraph 27 below) with the Head of the District Office of the Board for the Implementation of Agricultural Measures (districtsbureauhouder van de Stichting tot Uitvoering van Landbouwmaatregelen) of the province of Noord-Brabant. He stated that he had entered into obligations to invest in increasing the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf as early as January 1984. These investments related to a new shed for heifers and bulls, the construction of which would release 40 stands in the existing shed for milch cows and cows in calf. The number of such stands would thus be raised from 90 to 130, an increase of more than 25%.', 'The total cost of building the new shed and adapting the existing one came to more than NLG 100,000.', '10. The Head of the District Office of the Board for the Implementation of Agricultural Measures forwarded the applicant’s claim to the Director of Agriculture and Food Supply (directeur voor de landbouw en voedselvoorziening) of the province of Noord-Brabant (see paragraph 28 below). The latter rejected it on 1 November 1984, on the ground that the applicant had failed to show ""that it had always been his intention to increase the number of stands for milch cows as stated in his claim"".', '11. On 27 November 1984 the applicant filed an objection to this decision with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries (see paragraph 30 below), arguing at length that he had in fact been planning such an increase for a long time.', '12. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries dismissed the applicant’s objection on 11 November 1985, on the ground that ""it appeared from the facts and circumstances stated in the objection and from information obtained officially from other sources (ambtelijk overig ingewonnen informatie)"" that the number of stands for milch cows and cows in calf had been increased from 118 to 130 (i.e. by 12 or approximately 10%). The increase thus fell well short of the minimum of 25% required by the 1984 Ordinance (see paragraph 27 below).', '13. The applicant appealed to the Industrial Appeals Tribunal (College van Beroep voor het Bedrijfsleven) (""the Tribunal"" - see paragraph 31 below) on 3 December 1985. He maintained that the number of stands had been increased by 40 and argued that the Minister had erred in considering that the cowshed had originally contained 118 stands.', '14. In addition, by a letter which reached the registry of the Tribunal on 30 December 1986, Mr van de Hurk applied to the President of the Tribunal (see paragraph 35 below) for an interim measure to the effect that, pending the Tribunal’s judgment, he should not be required to pay the additional levy for 1984-85 and the following milk years and that he should be paid back the additional levy he had already paid in respect of milk production which had not exceeded the reference quantity claimed on the basis of 28 new stands.', '15. After a public hearing, the President of the Tribunal, in a letter dated 10 February 1987, asked the Minister to indicate whether he was prepared to reconsider his decision. By a letter dated 3 April 1987 the Minister replied that he saw no reason to do so and that the interim measure requested by the applicant should be refused. The Minister discussed the question of the increase in the number of stands and maintained his previous position. He submitted in the alternative that the applicant’s investments referable to that increase fell short of the required minimum of NLG 100,000. The Minister estimated that the total investment had been worth NLG 176,608.27 and the price per square metre of the new shed had been NLG 197.23; calculating on the basis of the surface taken up in the old shed by the new stands for milch cows and cows in calf, he concluded that the amount involved in the increase had been NLG 48,406.65 at the most.', '16. The applicant set out his objections in a letter dated 18 May 1987. He argued firstly that the Minister was estopped from using this argument, which had never been invoked as a reason for rejecting the applicant’s original claim; in the alternative, the Minister’s calculations were wrong. He claimed, with reference to a list of the costs concerned drawn up by his accountant, that his total investment had in fact been NLG 215,183.22, and criticised the method of calculation used by the Minister. In his view, 65% of the total investment was referable to cow stands in the new shed for heifers, of which 90% replaced similar stands in the old shed that were now to be used for milch cows and cows in calf; the sum relating to the relevant increase was therefore NLG 125,882.', '17. On 7 July 1987 the President of the Tribunal gave a decision refusing the interim measure requested, holding that it was not prima facie likely that the Tribunal itself would overturn the Minister’s decision. In his view, the Minister had not erred in rejecting the applicant’s claim. The President did not find it necessary to address the question of the increase in the number of stands for milch cows and cows in calf, since he accepted the Minister’s alternative argument concerning the applicant’s investment. He rejected the applicant’s submission that the Minister was estopped from relying on that ground, holding that section 51 of the 1954 Industrial Appeals Act (Wet administratieve rechtspraak bedrijfsorganisatie, Staatsblad (Official Bulletin) 1954, 416, as amended - ""the 1954 Act"") entitled him to supplement his arguments while the applicant had not only had sufficient possibility of replying to the Minister’s alternative submission but had in fact done so. Accepting the method of calculation used by the Minister and the total investment submitted by the applicant, the President arrived at a figure of NLG 55,440 referable to the increase in the number of stands in the old cowshed, and that figure was insufficient.', '18. By a letter of 25 September 1987 to the registrar of the Tribunal the applicant stated that he wished to continue the proceedings. Commenting on the President’s decision, he discussed extensively his own method of calculation. Like the Minister, he took as his starting-point the investment involved in building the new shed for heifers. Starting from the figure which he gave before the President - NLG 215,183.22 (see paragraph 16 above) - he calculated a price per square metre of NLG 240. On that basis he arrived at a figure of NLG 125,882 for the investment referable to the increase in the number of cow stands for milch cows and cows in calf in the existing cowshed. In the alternative, if the Minister’s calculations were to be followed, he submitted that the Minister had based them on incorrect premises; if applied correctly, the Minister’s method resulted in a figure referable to the extension of stands for milch cows and cows in calf of NLG 91,200, which was sufficient since the applicant had carried out the physical work involved in building the new cowshed himself (see paragraph 27 below).', '19. The Minister filed a written statement in reply on 21 November 1988. A public hearing was held on 19 April 1989, during which the applicant again contested the Minister’s method of calculation and argued that, should the Tribunal accept it nevertheless, the price per square metre calculated by the Minister was in any case too low; it was not NLG 240 - the Minister’s figure - but NLG 342.85.', '20. The Tribunal delivered its judgment on the merits on 16 June 1989. Adopting the same approach as the President, it did not decide whether the increase in the number of cow stands had been sufficient; indeed, it explicitly declined to address this point. It likewise accepted the Minister’s method of calculation; applying it to the figures submitted by the applicant in response to the decision of its President (a price per square metre of NLG 240, the new stands covering a surface of 330 square metres), the Tribunal arrived at an investment of NLG 79,200 referable to the increase in the number of stands. The Tribunal refused to consider the price per square metre put forward by the applicant at the hearing, on grounds of belatedness, holding:', '""The applicant’s statement first made at the hearing to the effect that the price per square metre is in reality NLG 342.85 will not be taken into account in reviewing the decision appealed against, in view of the rule laid down in Article 6 para. 2 of the Ordinance, amongst other things.""', 'Accordingly, concluding that the applicant’s investments fell short of the minimum required, the Tribunal rejected the applicant’s appeal.', '21. There had been surpluses of milk and milk products for some considerable time. By 1984, according to the preamble of Council Regulation (EEC) no. 856/84, ""quantities of milk delivered [were] increasing at a rate such that disposal of surpluses [was] imposing financial burdens and market difficulties which [jeopardised] the very future of the common agricultural policy"".', '22. Amending an earlier regulation which had not proved sufficiently effective, Council Regulation (EEC) no. 856/84 (OJ (Official Journal) no. L 90 of 1 April 1984, p. 10) was adopted by the Council of the European Communities in response to these structural surpluses.', '23. The Council of the European Communities decided that for an initial period of five years the quantity of milk every dairy farmer would be allowed to produce should be limited to a fixed amount (the ""reference quantity""). To this end they introduced a system under which dairy farmers had to pay a penalty or ""additional levy"" on milk delivered in excess of their allotted quantities. It was left to the States themselves to share out their guaranteed quantities within their jurisdictions according to a formula prescribed by Council Regulation (EEC) no. 857/84 (OJ no. L 90 of 1 April 1984, p. 13).', '24. Under Article 189 of the EEC Treaty, Council Regulations (EEC) no. 856/84 and (EEC) no. 857/84 were binding in their entirety and directly applicable in all member States of the European Communities. They entered into force on 1 April 1984.', '25. Under section 13 paras. 1-2 of the Agriculture Act (Landbouwwet), the Minister of Agriculture, Nature Conservancy and Fisheries (minister voor landbouw, natuurbeheer en visserij) is empowered to issue an ordinance (beschikking) imposing a levy on the production, supply and processing of agricultural produce. Such an ordinance may be adopted, inter alia, to give effect to regulations, guidelines, decisions and recommendations of the EEC in so far as they relate to its common agricultural policy.', '26. Council Regulations (EEC) no. 856/84 and (EEC) no. 857/84 were implemented by the 1984 Ordinance. This Ordinance was given retroactive effect to 1 April 1984, that being the date of entry into force of the EEC regulations.', '27. Dairy farmers who had assumed obligations in connection with investments (investeringsverplichtingen) after 1 September 1981 but before 1 March 1984 could claim a larger reference quantity, calculated according to a formula given in the 1984 Ordinance, if certain conditions were fulfilled. Such an increased reference quantity was available, inter alia, to dairy farmers who could prove that they had entered into financial obligations to increase the number of their cow stands (for milch cows or cows in calf) by at least 25% to more than 60 (Article 11 of the 1984 Ordinance). The amount required to be invested was at least NLG 100,000, or 90% of that figure if the farmer could prove that he himself had contributed sufficiently to the physical work involved to make up the difference.', '28. A person claiming an increased reference quantity on the basis of Article 11 of the 1984 Ordinance had until 1 August 1984 to file his claim with the Head of the District Office of the Board for the Implementation of Agricultural Measures, who would forward it to the provincial Director of Agriculture and Food Supply (Articles 6 para. 1, 7 para. 1 of the 1984 Ordinance). The Director gave a decision after consulting an advisory panel.', '29. Such a claim had to be accompanied by a statement setting out the arguments and documentary evidence. According to Article 6 para. 2 of the 1984 Ordinance:', '""A claim as referred to in the first paragraph shall be reasoned. It shall include a statement supported by evidence as to the various grounds of the claim referred to in Articles 11, 11b, 11c, 12 and 13.', 'The claim shall not be admissible if ... the rules laid down in this paragraph have not been complied with.""', '30. In the event of his claim being rejected, the claimant had thirty days within which to file an objection (bezwaarschrift) to the Director’s decision with the Minister (Article 7 paras. 2-3 of the 1984 Ordinance).', '31. An appeal against the decision of the Minister lay within thirty days to the Tribunal (section 46 of the Agriculture Act).', '32. The Tribunal is a judicial body set up under the 1954 Act. It was instituted initially to hear appeals against decisions and acts by various economic regulatory bodies, but gradually its jurisdiction has been extended to include certain decisions of central government and other independent government bodies under specialist legislation. According to the ""Guidelines for making provision for appeals to the Industrial Appeals Tribunal"" (Richtlijnen voor het openstellen van beroep op het College van Beroep voor het Bedrijfsleven) of 24 June 1986, Government Gazette 1986, 124, the Tribunal should in principle be the competent court with regard to ""legislation of a socio-economic nature"".', 'Section 5 of the 1954 Act gave the Tribunal competence to review such acts and decisions for compliance with legislation of a general nature and general principles of good governance (algemene beginselen van behoorlijk bestuur), to check whether there had been any abuse of authority and to determine whether in weighing up the interests at stake, the government body concerned had acted reasonably in deciding as it had.', '33. The judges of the Tribunal are appointed for life by the Crown. They must have the same qualifications as Court of Appeal judges (section 9 of the 1954 Act). They take the same oath and receive the same salary as Court of Appeal judges and are subject to the same rules and procedure as regards supervision and dismissal (sections 11 and 12 of the 1954 Act).', 'Tribunal judges may not have any other official position, nor may they hold any position in private enterprise or in any association of employers or employees (section 10 of the 1954 Act).', '34. The proceedings before the Tribunal are public. At the material time, they normally comprised written proceedings (an application filed by an appellant, a memorial in reply submitted by the government body concerned, and possibly - if the President consented - additional memorials) followed by an oral hearing (sections 29 et seq. of the 1954 Act).', 'Section 51 allowed both the government body and the applicant to ""alter their claim or their defence and the grounds advanced in support, until the close of the hearing, unless the Tribunal [was] of the opinion that such a change place[d] the opponent at an unreasonable disadvantage"".', '35. Under section 65 of the 1954 Act the applicant could apply for interim measures to the President of the Tribunal. He could do so both before and after filing an appeal on the merits. The President would give a decision as soon as possible, having heard the government body concerned or at least offered it the opportunity to be heard.', '36. The Tribunal, against whose judgment there was no further appeal, was empowered to overrule the decision appealed against and to provide for the consequences of such reversal; in particular, it could order the government body concerned to make, retract or alter a decision or to act or refrain from acting in a certain way. The judgment might include an order to pay a penalty in the event of non-compliance (section 58 of the 1954 Act). The Tribunal could also order the body to pay compensation for any damage suffered by the appellant as a result of the decision or act appealed against (section 60). To the extent that the judgment ordered payment of a sum of money, it could be executed in accordance with the rules pertaining to the execution of judgments of the courts in civil cases (section 62).', '37. Sections 74 and 75 of the 1954 Act provided as follows:', '""1. If in Our opinion the consequences of a judgment [i.e. of the Industrial Appeals Tribunal] are contrary to the general interest, We may, on the recommendation of those of Our ministers whom it concerns, decide that it shall not be followed or shall not be followed in its entirety.', '2. Pending the taking of a decision under the preceding paragraph, We may, on the recommendation of those of Our ministers whom it concerns, suspend the judgment in whole or in part for a length of time to be determined by Us. Even after prolongation, suspension may not be for longer than one year.', '3. A decision as referred to in the first paragraph may only be taken within two months of the judgment or, if the judgment is suspended within that period, within the length of time determined for the suspension. A decision as referred to in the second paragraph may only be taken within two months of the judgment.', '4. Our decisions shall be published in the Official Bulletin.', '5. The first two paragraphs shall not apply in so far as the decision awards compensation or partial compensation or orders the payment of costs.', '6. ...""', '""1. If We decide that the judgment shall not be followed or shall not be followed in its entirety, the Industrial Appeals Tribunal may, at the request of the person concerned, retry the case taking due notice of Our Decision or order the government body concerned to pay compensation for all or part of the damage suffered by the appellant as a consequence of the fact that the judgment is not followed or not followed in its entirety.', '2-4. ...""', 'The expressions ""We"", ""Our"" and ""Us"" in the above sections referred to the fact that the decisions under section 74 took the form of a royal decree (Koninklijk besluit), that is a decree signed by the Monarch and the Minister responsible. Since such a decree can only be adopted on the initiative and the (political) responsibility of a Minister, it was effectively the Minister who had the power to issue a decision under section 74 paras. 1-2. Following customary Netherlands terminology, the present judgment will refer to the Monarch and the Minister together as ""the Crown"".', '38. No use was ever made of the powers under sections 74 and 75 of the 1954 Act. The above-mentioned Guidelines (see paragraph 32 above) stated explicitly that new laws conferring jurisdiction on the Tribunal should declare the 1954 Act applicable except for sections 74 and 75. Before the Guidelines were drawn up, the Minister of Justice replied as follows to a question from the Council of State (Raad van State):', '""In my opinion, it is in principle never necessary to declare sections 74 and 75 applicable by analogy. At the time, these two provisions were included in the Act as a matter of prudence, which may be explained by the circumstance that more than thirty years ago the legislature had little idea of the way in which administrative judicial procedure would develop. No use has ever been made of the Crown’s powers under section 74. One might even venture to suggest that the scheme of sections 74 and 75 has become a dead letter."" (Kamerstukken (Parliamentary Documents) II 1984-1985, 18798, A-C, p. 10)', '39. The 1954 Act remained in force until 1 January 1994. On that date a General Administrative Code (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht) came into force, laying down new uniform rules of administrative-law procedure.', 'At the same time the 1954 Act was replaced by the Industrial Organisation (Administrative Jurisdiction) Act (Wet bestuursrechtspraak bedrijfsorganisatie). Under section 19 of that Act, the new uniform rules laid down in the General Administrative Code also govern the procedure of the Tribunal.', 'There is no provision in either the Code or the Act empowering any executive authority to interfere with the binding force of a judgment.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 6-3-c;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza;Simon Brown,"[""8. On 3 January 1997 the applicant appeared before the magistrates' court, charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and failing to answer bail. He was legally represented. The applicant elected to be tried in the Crown Court. The stipendiary magistrate therefore adjourned the proceedings to enable a committal hearing to take place at a later date and proceeded to consider whether the applicant should be granted bail. During the course of that consideration, the applicant “reacted adversely” in court, causing a disturbance which led the magistrate to conclude that there existed a future risk of a breach of the peace by him. The magistrate therefore made an order binding the applicant over to keep the peace and to be of good behaviour under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361."", ""9. The applicant was “bound over” in his own recognisance of 50 pounds sterling (GBP) together with a surety of GBP 250. The precise terms of the order were found by the Divisional Court (in the later judicial review proceedings) to be unclear. However, the Divisional Court proceeded on the assumption that the order of the magistrates' court had fixed a period of 28 days' imprisonment in default of the applicant's own recognisance and/or a suitable surety. The magistrate did not give any opportunity for the applicant or his representative to make submissions about the terms of the order before it was imposed."", '10. It appears that later on the day on which the binding over order was imposed, in the absence of both the applicant and his representative, the surety presented himself to the magistrate, who himself took the recognisance. The magistrate appears to have deemed the proposed surety unsuitable and to have done so on the ground that he did not have any readily available money. The applicant was committed to custody on the same day for 28 days. The Divisional Court later noted that he had remained in custody until 16 January 1997 or a little later.', '11. On 2 June 1997 the applicant was granted leave to apply for judicial review of the decision to impose the binding over order.', ""12. On 20 January 1998 the Divisional Court granted the application for judicial review. The nature of the applicant's case was stated by the Divisional Court to be as follows:"", '“It is not suggested by Mr. Daniel, for the applicant, that the magistrate had no power under [the Justices of the Peace Act 1361] or common law to impose a binding over order without consent, to require a surety or to impose a sentence of imprisonment in lieu. What is suggested is that there was a breach of natural justice or procedural irregularity in the way in which the magistrate dealt with the matter, without investigating further, or giving specific opportunity to the applicant or his legal representative to make representations about the terms of any binding over order.”', '13. The Divisional Court (Lord Justice Simon Brown and Mr Justice Mance) agreed that the binding over order had been procedurally irregular and granted a declaration to that effect. During the course of their judgments, the judges of the Divisional Court held that:', '(a) previous domestic case-law had established that there were circumstances where failing to hear a defendant or his representative prior to imposing a binding over order containing a requirement of a recognisance could amount to a breach of the rules of natural justice. Mr Justice Mance quoted, inter alia, the headnote of the case of R. v. Central Criminal Court ex parte Boulding [1984] 1 QB 813 that:', '“... although there was no general obligation upon a court to afford a defendant an opportunity to be heard prior to binding him over, it was a breach of the rules of natural justice, unless the recognisance was of a trivial sum, for a court to bind a person over without inquiring into his means and giving him an opportunity to make representations as to the size of the recognisance.”', '(b) the position where there was a requirement for a surety was even clearer. A surety required the separate approval of the court as to his suitability. This was outside the control of the person to be bound over and yet could have drastic consequences for him where, as in the present case, it resulted in his serving a period of imprisonment imposed as an alternative;', '(c) in such circumstances, magistrates needed to take particular care lest, in effect, they imposed a binding order which amounted to an automatic sentence of imprisonment without appreciating what they were doing;', ""(d) a defendant ought not to be put at peril of a prison sentence in default of finding a surety unless he had first been specifically invited to address the magistrates' court upon that point;"", ""(e) the magistrate did not expressly invite or give opportunity for any submissions, or indeed any discussion between the applicant and his representative, about the proposed terms of the binding over order before he imposed it. While the magistrate stated during the course of the judicial review proceedings that he would have been prepared to listen to anything that the applicant's representative would have wished to say, the High Court accepted that the applicant's representative was effectively presented with a “fait accompli” of a nature which she had not come across before. In responding to an argument put forward on behalf of the magistrate that an advocate was under a duty to bring any procedural irregularity to the attention of the court during the hearing and not reserve such matter to be raised on appeal, Mr Justice Mance said:"", ""“That is of course right, but it assumes that the advocate appreciates that what happens does amount to a procedural irregularity and understands at the time the nature of the point. Here [the applicant's representative] does not appear to have had the confidence of whatever belief she had that something was not quite right, she did not raise the matter, and I do not think that the applicant should suffer from any failure, if there was any on her part, to react as another advocate, perhaps more familiar with this area of the law and practice, might have done.”"", '(f) had the applicant or his representative been able to make submissions about the proposed order the magistrate might have been persuaded to impose different terms. Mr Justice Mance stated:', ""“What Mr Burnett [counsel for the respondent] has submitted is that it cannot be shown that it would have made any difference if the magistrate had given to the applicant [and his counsel] an opportunity to make representations. However, it seems to me certainly not beyond the bounds of possibility, that if a proper opportunity had been given to [the applicant's counsel] to consider and address the matter after brief discussion between herself, the applicant and the friend [the proposed surety] the stringency of the proposed order - particularly in the alternative ... it had of 28 days' imprisonment - would have been one of the points on which she would have focused; the risk and consequences of a suitable surety being found, and in particular, of the friend at court ... not being regarded as suitable might well also have been highlighted."", ""Mr Burnett did not seek to controvert that. The magistrate might, in such circumstances, have been persuaded to a different result. This is all, of course, speculative, but speculation though it may be, the reason why it is speculation is that the magistrate failed, in my judgment, to give the applicant or, on his behalf, [the applicant's representative] proper time or a proper opportunity to address the terms of the proposed bind over order, particularly so far as they involved a requirement that the applicant produce a surety in the sum of £250.”"", '14. Magistrates have powers to bind over at common law and under the Justices of the Peace Act 1361. These powers allow magistrates, at any stage in proceedings before them, to bind over any participant in the proceedings if they consider that the conduct of the person concerned is such that there might be a breach of the peace or that his or her behaviour has been contra bonos mores.', '15. The Justices of the Peace Act 1997 provides, in so far as relevant, as follows:', '“51. No action shall lie against any justice of the peace ... in respect of any act or omission of his -', '(a) in the execution of his duty -', '(i) as such a justice;', '...', '(b) with respect to any matter within his jurisdiction.', '52. An action shall lie against any justice of the peace ... in respect of any act or omission of his -', '(a) in the purported execution of his duty -', '(i) as such a justice;', '...', '(b) with respect to a matter which is not within his jurisdiction,', 'if, but only if, it is proved that he acted in bad faith.”']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in the town of Debaltseve, in the Donetsk region, Ukraine.', '5. On 15 July 1998 the Dokuchayevsk Court ordered the State-owned mining company “Yuzhnodonbassakya-3” (“the company”) to pay the applicant 2,147.72 Ukrainian hryvnyas (UAH) in salary arrears and other payments. By another decision adopted on the same day the court ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 312.11 for loss of salary and to rectify the records in his work book (трудова книжка) about the date and the reason of his dismissal.', '6. On 1 September 1998 the same court ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 949.90 for loss of salary and other payments. By the same judgment the court ruled again to rectify the records in his work book about the date of his dismissal.', '7. On 6 January 1999 the same court ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 1,438.42 for loss of salary and other payments. By the same judgment the court ruled to rectify the records in his work book about the date of his dismissal.', '8. On 26 February 1999 the same court ordered the company to enforce the judgments of 15 July 1998.', '9. On 1 October 1999 the same court ordered the company to provide the applicant with an apartment, as stipulated in his employment contract. On 4 March 2002 the same court, upon the applicant’s request, modified the manner of enforcement of the judgment of 1 October 1999 and ordered the company to pay the applicant UAH 13,137 instead of providing him with an apartment.', '10. All the above judgments became final and the enforcement proceedings were instituted by the Vugledar Bailiffs Service (“the Bailiffs Service”).', '11. On 22 February 2000 the Bailiffs Service informed the applicant that the enforcement proceedings had been suspended due to bankruptcy proceedings pending against the company.', '12. In September 2003 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Vugledar Court against the Bailiffs Service seeking compensation for damage caused to him due to the non-enforcement of the above judgments. On 10 June 2004 the Vugledar Court rejected the applicant’s complaints against the alleged inactivity of the Bailiffs Service. On 26 August 2004 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision and remitted the case to the first-instance court for a new consideration. According to the applicant’s submissions, the proceedings are still pending.', '13. The applicant rented a house owned by Mr. Ch. In December 2001 the applicant instituted proceedings against the municipal company Donetskoblvodokanal (ДОКП Донецькоблводоканал), and the Dokuchaevsk Water and Sewerage Company (Докучаєвське управління водопровідно каналізаційного господарства) claiming UAH 2,000 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, alleging that the water supply to the house rented by him was unsatisfactory. The applicant also sought a recalculation of his water rates.', '14. On 13 September 2002 the Dokuchayevsk Court allowed the applicant’s claims in part.

On 22 February 2006 he requested that the Volnovakha Court suspend the proceedings in the applicant’s case since he had instituted other proceedings against the municipal company “Donetskvodokanal” in the Dokuchaevsk Court, and their outcome would have a bearing on the consideration of the case. On the same date the court granted the request. On 31 May 2006 the Dokuchaevsk Court left Mr Ch.’s claim unexamined because it lacked jurisdiction over the case. On 23 July 2006 the Volnovakha Court renewed proceedings in the applicant’s case.', '19. On 7 November 2006 the Volnovakha Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part and awarded him UAH 200 in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.

Four were adjourned because of the absence of both parties; four were adjourned because of the absence of the applicant or at his request; and one was adjourned due to the judge’s illness.', '22. On 29 March 2002 the Volnovakha Tax Inspection Office fined the applicant with UAH 170 because he had submitted his VAT declaration out of time.', '23. In May 2002 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Dokuchayevsk Court.', '24. On 22 July 2002 the applicant’s complaint was transferred to the Volnovakha Court, which left it unexamined on the ground that the dispute fell within the jurisdiction of the commercial courts. On 4 November 2002 and 29 August 2003 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld that ruling.', '25. On 2 March 2004 the investigator of the Debaltseve Department of the Interior appointed the applicant, acting as a legal advisor, as legal assistant to a minor, B., who was charged with robbery.

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Łódź. He is currently detained in the Katowice Remand Centre.', '6. On 15 February 2002 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having been involved in drug trafficking as a member of an organised criminal group.', '7. On 17 February 2002 the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) ordered that the applicant be detained on remand until 15 May 2002 in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. The court considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings given the risk that he might obstruct them. This suspicion was, in the court’s view, justified by the fact that the applicant had been acting in an organised criminal group, “the members of which had not been identified”. The court also stressed the severity of the likely sentence.', '8. The applicant’s detention was repeatedly extended by several decisions of the Szczecin Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) and the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny). In their decisions, the courts repeatedly relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged, the serious nature of the offences and the risk that the applicant, as a member of an organised criminal group, would obstruct the investigation.', '9. On 14 December 2004 the prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court against the applicant and 32 other co-accused. The prosecutor requested 22 witnesses to be heard.', '10. On 7 December 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal, extending the applicant’s detention for a further three months, noted that the length of the investigation had already been excessive and ordered that, by the end of the extended detention (that is, by 15 March 2006), the Regional Court commence the trial and hear all the defendants in the proceedings.', '11. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed.', '12. On 28 December 2005 the Katowice Court of Appeal confirmed its decision.', '13. It appears that the Katowice Court of Appeal’s instructions were not followed by the Regional Court. After 15 March 2006 the applicant’s detention was extended three more times and the measure has still not been lifted.', '14. On an unspecified date in January 2007 the applicant’s lawyer, relying on the applicant’s state of health and his family situation, requested the court to vary the preventive measure.', '15. On 15 January 2007 the Katowice Regional Court refused the request, again invoking the serious nature of the offences with which the applicant had been charged and the risk that he would obstruct the proceedings. As regards the applicant’s health and his family situation the court found that:', '“It emerges from the information received from the Katowice Remand Centre’s doctor that the applicant can be treated in detention.... The applicant’s family situation is not so different from the situation of most families where a husband and father is imprisoned. However, the applicant’s wife runs her own business, which secures her and her children a basic income. It is true that the applicant’s apartment has been sold at auction but, in the court’s view, any possible eviction is still a long way off and even then the applicant and his family can obtain alternative accommodation. Lifting the applicant’s detention order would not change the living conditions of his family much.”', '16. The applicant’s detention was further extended by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 4 April, 27 June, 24 October and 28 December 2007 and on 6 February 2008. The applicant appealed against all those decisions, apart from the one given on 24 October 2007, but they were confirmed by the Court of Appeal. In all those decisions the Katowice Court of Appeal relied basically on the same grounds, repeating the arguments relating to the suspicion against the applicant, the serious nature of the offences with which he had been charged, the severity of the penalty to which he was liable and the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings. The suspicion was justified, in the court’s view, by the charge of acting in an organised criminal group.', '17.

THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE', '5. The applicants were born in 1990 and 1989 respectively and live in Chişinău.', '6. The present case concerns the circumstances surrounding the killing of the applicants’ 29-year-old brother Alexei Vlasi during a police operation on 14 March 2009.', '7. On that date at approximately 10.20 p.m. three plain-clothed police officers (N., B. and C.) entered a five-storey apartment block to arrest a person suspected of armed robbery. According to their information, the suspect in question was supposed to be visiting his ex-girlfriend M. that evening, who lived on the fourth floor of the building.', '8. At the same time, M. was coming down the stairs from the fourth floor with a group of four friends. None of them was the suspect wanted by the police. Two young women (S. and Z.) and a young man (G.) were at the front of the group and they passed the police officers between the third and second floor.', '9. Upon passing the first part of the group one of the police officers immediately apprehended G. Alexei Vlasi and M. were several storeys up and saw the police officers as they approached the rest of the group. Two police officers rushed after Alexei Vlasi, who started to run back up the stairs. They apprehended him on the fifth floor. Shortly afterwards, one of the police officers shot him in the back of the head at very close range. He died instantly.', '10. An investigation followed, during which all the witnesses and police officers were questioned. There were two versions of events: that of the group of friends coming down the stairs with the victim (the witnesses), and that of the police officers.', '11. The witnesses’ version was that two police officers, N. and C., were armed with pistols which they were holding upwards. Upon passing the first part of the group, the officers saw that there was someone else upstairs and ran in that direction, leaving the first part of the group with police officer N. They then told police officer N. to come upstairs with the rest of the group. After apprehending Alexei Vlasi somewhere on the fifth floor, police officers B. and C. started to beat him up. All the members of the group recounted an almost identical description of what they had heard and the conversation that had taken place between the two police officers and Alexei Vlasi. According to them, one of the police officers (B.) called Alexei Vlasi by his first name and told him to follow them. In response, he addressed B. by his first name and told him to stop beating him up. Sounds of someone being beaten up were heard and Alexei Vlasi threatened to report his injuries to a forensic doctor. The manner in which he said this last sentence was very specific, as he used a mixture of both Romanian and Russian words and the witnesses recounted it in the same manner. It later transpired that police officer B. and Alexei Vlasi already knew each other, as in 1999 the latter had been arrested by the former for bicycle theft.', '12. The encounter between police officers B. and C. and Alexei Vlasi took place on the fifth and top floor. Two of the witnesses M. and G. were the closest to the scene at the time, being held by police officer N. on the fourth floor. The fourth floor was separated from the fifth floor by two flights of stairs going in opposite directions joined by an intermediate landing. M. (who also already knew police officer B.) started to shout at him, telling him to leave Alexei Vlasi alone. She called him by his first name and tried to get past police officer N. in order to help Alexei Vlasi. In her struggle with police officer N. she could partly see what was happening on the fifth floor. G. was also there. According to them, police officer B. grabbed Alexei Vlasi by his right hand while officer C. grabbed him by his left hand and started to make his way down the stairs from the fifth floor to the landing between the fifth and fourth floors. At about the third from last step, Alexei Vlasi was facing the handrail and grabbed it. The police officers who were behind him bent him over and, according to one of the witnesses, held both his hands behind his back. According to another witness, one of his hands was on the handrail while the other was held by a police officer behind his back. Police officer C. was holding his pistol at the back of Alexei Vlasi’s head while he was bent over. Police officer B. punched him in the ribs and he repeated again that he would be reporting his injuries to a forensic doctor. Immediately afterwards, he was shot in the back of the head by police officer C. at very close range. He collapsed on the landing between the two flights of stairs, with his feet on the stairs and his body on the landing. Blood started to spurt out of his head wound. M. shouted: “He shot him straight in the head!” and her first reaction was to try to stop him losing any more blood with her hands. In what appeared to be an attack of hysteria she started to scream and to attack police officer B. and shouted “Why did you do that?” Another female friend in the group approached her from behind, hugged her and tried to pull her away from the body.', '13. According to the witnesses, Alexei Vlasi did not have anything in his hands after collapsing to the ground. Police officer B. asked officer C.: “What the hell did you do?!” C. did not respond with anything intelligible but remained still, holding his head in his hands. One of the witnesses said they heard him respond in a low voice: “I didn’t want to do that”. He was very pale. According to the witnesses he did not have any visible injuries and could walk perfectly well. Immediately afterwards, officer B. ordered all the witnesses to go into M.’s apartment on the fourth floor. He and police officer N. pushed everybody into her apartment and closed the door. Police officer N. was holding the doorknob so that nobody could leave. Many of the neighbours started to look out of their apartments but the police officers ordered them all to close their doors and stay inside.', '14. According to the police officers, when Alexei Vlasi ran up the stairs, they thought he was the suspect they had been after. They claimed to have been convinced that the victim was the suspect they were looking for and that they only realised their mistake after he had been shot. However, during a confrontation which took place later, police officer B. admitted he had known Alexei Vlasi for a long time. The following description of the police officers’ version of events was made after a video reconstruction of the scene, which was filmed during the investigation with the participation of police officer C. on 7 August 2009. Police officer B. recounted an identical version of events.', '15. Police officer B. chased Alexei Vlasi and approached him from behind on the landing of the top, fifth floor. He put his hand on his shoulder, called him by the name of the wanted suspect, announced that he was a police officer and asked him to come with him. At that moment Alexei turned around and punched police officer B. in the face with his right fist and attempted to run down the stairs. When he punched police officer B. he did not have anything in his hand. Police officer B. was pushed into a wall on his right and lost his balance. However, police officer C., who had already approached them from behind, managed to apprehend Alexei Vlasi by pulling his left arm near his shoulder (in his initial statement police officer C. stated that he had apprehended him by the collar of his jacket). The apprehension took place on the top three steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor. Police officer C. was behind Alexei Vlasi on a higher step, holding his hand with his left hand and holding his pistol pointed upwards in his right hand. At that moment, without changing his position, Alexei Vlasi stabbed police officer C. in the right thigh with a knife, which he had been holding in his right hand in reverse grip. Then, without changing the position of the knife, Alexei Vlasi attempted to turn to his left and to stab police officer C. in the face. According to police officer C., Alexei Vlasi had been standing upright. Fearing for his life, police officer C. pulled the trigger of the pistol he was still holding upwards and shot him in the upper neck. The police officers did not say how the victim’s body ended up on the landing between the fifth and fourth floor some six or seven steps lower, but it is reasonable to infer that it rolled down by itself before slumping at the bottom of the stairs.', '16. A criminal investigation was formally initiated on 15 March 2009. According to a report describing the scene, Alexei Vlasi’s body was lying in a pool of blood on the intermediate landing between the fourth and fifth floors. There was an open small pocket knife with a lock mechanism with a blade 6.5 cm long in the palm of his right hand. His feet were on the first two steps of the flight of stairs leading to the fifth floor. There were traces of blood on those steps. The report contains pictures of areas stained with blood, such as the landing where the body was lying, the walls around it, and the landing between the third and the fourth floor, where blood had run down from above. No traces of blood appear to have been found above the steps on which the victim’s feet were located. On the wall above the sixth step of the flight of stairs going down to the fourth floor from the landing where the body was lying, there was a bullet hole 2.3 metres above the step, exactly opposite where the witnesses alleged the victim had been shot when facing the handrail.', '17. During the investigation, the Chişinău prosecutor’s office obtained several forensic reports which found, inter alia, that the entry wound was on Alexei Vlasi’s upper left neck and the exit wound was on the right side of his forehead above his eyebrow. According to the forensic report, the shot was fired at such close range that gunshot residue was present on the victim’s skin around the entry wound. Another forensic report found that the police officer who had shot him had had an injury to his right thigh made by a knife wound and the other police officer who had allegedly been punched in the face by Alexei had had a bruise on his face. Another expert report did not find any fingerprints on the knife found in Alexei Vlasi’s palm after his death.', '18. On 21 September 2009 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office decided to discontinue the criminal investigation on the grounds that the police officer who shot Alexei Vlasi had acted in self-defence. The prosecutor’s office was based on the police officers’ version of events. The applicants challenged the above decision before the Prosecutor General’s Office.', '19. On 9 October 2009 a deputy Prosecutor General quashed the above decision on the grounds that it was based exclusively on the police officers’ version of events and that no consideration was given to the witnesses’ statements. The investigator had failed to determine the exact place of the shooting and the victim’s position in relation to the shooter. Moreover, no ballistics test had been conducted in order to determine the trajectory of the bullet.', '20. In the reopened investigation some of the witnesses were re-questioned. One of them, G., changed his statements and submitted that he had not seen or heard anything, but later claimed that he had only done so because he had been pressured and threatened to do so by the accused police officers.', '21. A ballistics test was carried out with the help of an assistant standing where the police officers alleged the victim had been standing at the time of shooting. The assistant had a cabbage placed on his shoulder, near his head. Through a hole pierced in the cabbage, a thread was led to the bullet hole in the wall, which was considerably lower than the cabbage. Taking into consideration the positions of the entry and exit wounds on the victim’s head, it was concluded that, at the moment of the shooting, the victim had been bent over and not standing upright as suggested by the police officers in their version of events.', '22. On 30 June 2010 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal proceedings on similar grounds as the first time, namely on the basis of the police officers’ version of events. It does not appear that the prosecutor attempted to reconcile the findings of the ballistics test with the police officers’ version of events concerning the circumstances of Alexei Vlasi’s shooting. The applicants appealed.', '23. On 22 July 2010 a hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge.', '24. On 20 October 2010 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decisions of 30 June and 22 July 2010 and ordered a re-investigation of the case. He concluded that the investigation had been incomplete and that the conclusions reached by the investigators were inconsistent with the evidence in the case file. The investigating judge also noted that no confrontations had been carried out between all the witnesses and the accused officers, no importance had been attached to the fact that no fingerprints had been found on the knife the victim had allegedly stabbed police officer C. with, and that the investigation had not been conducted within a reasonable time.', '25. Following the investigating judge’s decision, the applicants applied to the Prosecutor General’s Office with a request to have the case removed from the Chişinău prosecutor’s office on account of its bias and to have it transferred to another prosecutor’s office. On 8 November 2010 a deputy Prosecutor General rejected the applicants’ request as ill-founded.', '26. On 27 April 2011 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office questioned witness M. again. On 17 May 2011 witness G. was questioned again. He submitted having seen police officer B. stabbing police officer C. in his thigh with a knife before being forced into M.’s apartment after the shooting. According to him, this took place between the third and the fourth floor and he had mentioned it during his initial questioning, but no record had been made. Confrontations were organised between M. and police officer B. and between G. and police officer B. on 20 and 24 May 2011, during which each party maintained their statements.', '27. On 21 July 2011 witness G. took a lie-detector test to determine whether his statement about police officer B. stabbing police office C. with a knife was truthful. The test result was negative, i.e. G.’s statement was not truthful.', '28. On 15 September 2011 the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal investigation on similar grounds as the previous occasions. The results of the lie-detector test were added to the decision. The applicants appealed against it and argued that the results of the liedetector test were inadmissible because the test had been carried out by colleagues of the accused police officers rather than by independent experts.', '29. On 20 October 2011 the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge.', '30. On 12 December 2011 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court upheld the applicants’ appeal, again finding that the investigation had been incomplete. The judge also declared the results of the lie-detector test inadmissible.', '31. On 13 April 2012, without conducting any further investigative measures, a prosecutor from the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal investigation. The content of the decision was identical to that of the decision of 15 September 2011, including reference to the lie-detector test.', '32. On 9 July 2012 the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge.', '33. On 16 October 2012 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court again upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decisions of 13 April and 9 July 2012 and ordered a reopening of the investigation.', '34. On 11 March 2013 a prosecutor from the Chişinău prosecutor’s office again discontinued the criminal investigation.', '35. On 22 April 2013 the hierarchically superior prosecutor dismissed the applicants’ appeal. They appealed to an investigating judge.', '36. On 19 July 2013 an investigating judge from the Rascani District Court again upheld the applicants’ appeal, quashed the decisions of 11 March and 22 April 2012 and ordered a reopening of the investigation.

Accordingly, the case was remitted for fresh examination.', '8. On 18 April 2003 the Mykytivsky Court replaced the respondent in the case upon the applicant’s request. In particular, the court ordered another company, the mine’s successor, to stand as a respondent. The court also ordered the local social security fund to take part in the proceedings as a co-respondent.', '9. On the same day the Mykytivsky Court delivered a judgment, ordering the fund to make monthly payments in respect of the applicant’s occupational disability. By a separate procedural decision, the applicant’s claims against the other co-respondent were left without consideration as the applicant withdrew them in the course of the court hearing.', '10. On 18 December 2003 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of 18 April 2003 and ordered reconsideration of the case.', '11. On 20 April 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Court of Appeal, finding that the latter had not complied with the rules of procedure.', '12. On 27 July 2006 the Court of Appeal reconsidered the case and adopted a new judgment reducing the payments awarded to the applicant by the first-instance court.', '13. On 22 January 2008 the Kyiv Court of Appeal, acting as a court of cassation, rejected the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the judgment of 27 July 2006.', '14. The applicant unsuccessfully tried to challenge the courts’ decisions in an extraordinary appeal, which was rejected by the Supreme Court on 18 May 2009.', '15. According to the Government, out of fifty-two scheduled hearings, twenty-four were adjourned for various reasons. In particular, the hearings were adjourned twice because of the failure of the applicant to appear, twenty times due to the failure of the respondents or their representatives to appear, and twice because of both parties’ failure to appear. Additionally, two hearings were adjourned as the judge was absent for health and business reasons. On several occasions the courts had to renew, at the applicant’s and the respondent’s request, the term for lodging an appeal which resulted in a delay of about three months. Lastly, due to the expert examination ordered at the applicant’s request, the consideration of the case was delayed for about six months.', '16. According the applicant, the hearings were adjourned twenty-three times due to the failure of the respondents or their representative to appear. The applicant also indicated that the case had not been heard between 10 May 2002 and 7 February 2003 as the presiding judge’s mandate had expired.', '17. On 23 June 1998 the second applicant, then a miner, instituted civil proceedings in the Rovenky Town Court of Lugansk Region (“the Rovenky Court“) against her employer, a State-owned mine, asking the court to order the mine to issue her a certificate confirming that she had received an occupational injury.', '18. In the course of the proceedings the applicant amended her claims on several occasions. In particular, she sought compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, resulting from her injury, to be paid by the mine and the local social security fund.', '19. Between June 1998 and May 2003 the Rovenky Court reconsidered the case on two occasions. Its judgments of 24 November 1998 and 6 May 2003 were quashed by the Lugansk Regional Court on 14 January 1999 and 29 January 2004, respectively, for procedural irregularities and failure to accurately establish the circumstances. Accordingly, the case was remitted for fresh examination.', '20. By the judgment of 24 February 2006, the Rovenky Court rejected the applicant’s claims as unsubstantiated. Following two reconsiderations of the case on appeal, the judgment was eventually confirmed by the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal on 28 November 2007.', '21. On 5 March 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal in cassation, finding no fault on the part of the lower courts.', '22. According to the Government, out of sixty-eight hearings scheduled in the course of the proceeding, eleven were adjourned because of the failure of the applicant or her representative to appear, eight due to the respondents’ or their representatives’ failure to appear or requests to adjourn hearings, and three because all the parties failed to appear.', '23. According to the applicant, she attended all the hearings; her representative failed to appear at only two hearings and was later dismissed by the applicant.', '24. On three occasions the courts had to renew, at the applicant’s and respondents’ requests, the term for lodging an appeal which resulted in a delay of about four months.', '25. On 26 July 2002 the applicant, then a miner, instituted civil proceedings in the Ternivsky District Court of Kryvyy Rih (“the Ternivsky Court”) against two State-owned companies who were the successors of his former employer, a State-owned mine, and the local social security fund, seeking recalculation of his occupational disability payments and compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.', '26. In the course of the proceedings the applicant amended his claims on several occasions. The amendments mainly concerned the amounts he claimed.', '27. Between July 2002 and November 2007 the Ternivsky Court reconsidered the case on three occasions. Its judgments of 5 July 2004, 6 March 2006 and 23 August 2007 were quashed by the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal on 4 November 2004, 5 October 2006 and 29 November 2007, respectively, for procedural irregularities and legal and factual errors. Accordingly, the case was remitted for fresh examination.', '28. The applicant’s appeal in cassation against the decision of 29 November 2007 was rejected by the Supreme Court on 11 March 2008.', '29. The case is currently pending before the Ternivsky Court.', '30. Out of sixty-three hearings scheduled between 26 July 2002 and 6 December 2010, five were adjourned because of the failure of the applicant or her representative to appear, eighteen were adjourned due to the respondents’ or their representatives’ failure to appear, six times both parties failed to appear. On four occasions the hearings were adjourned for the presiding judge was busy with another case.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1964 and 1963 respectively and live in Vladivostok, Russia. At the material time the first applicant, a police officer, and the second applicant, a former police officer, were the chairman and the deputy chairman of a local police trade union.', '7. On 28 October 1999, in connection with the discovery of two explosive devices and cartridges at the home of a third person, K., the department of the interior of the Primorskiy region and the Federal Security Service of Russia (“the FSB”) initiated criminal proceedings under Article 222 § 1 of the Criminal Code of Russia (“unlawful acquisition, transfer, sale, storage, transportation and carrying of firearms, basic parts of firearms, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices”).', '8. On 14 January 2000 the applicants were arrested. On 17 January 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the Primorskiy region extended the applicants’ detention, referring to the gravity of the charges against them and the risk of their absconding from the authorities or obstructing the course of justice.', '9. On 24 January 2000 the applicants were transferred to detention centre IZ-25/1 (“the detention centre” – in some of the documents submitted also referred to as IZ-20/1) in Vladivostok.', '10. On 13 March 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the Primorskiy region extended the applicants’ detention until 10 April 2000, referring to the same reasons, namely the risk of their absconding from the authorities or obstructing the course of justice.', '11. On 3 April 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the Primorskiy region extended the applicants’ detention until 10 May 2000. The first applicant’s lawyer appealed against the extension order. On 28 April 2000 the Leninskiy District Court of Vladivostok dismissed the appeal and stated that the applicant had the right to appeal against that decision to the Primorskiy Regional Court. The first applicant did not appeal to the second-instance court.', '12. On 27 April 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the Primorskiy region extended the applicants’ detention until 10 July 2000, referring to the gravity of the charges against them and the risk of their absconding from the authorities or obstructing the course of justice.', '13. On 10 July 2000 the investigation forwarded the criminal case against the applicants to the Primorskiy Regional Court for the determination of the jurisdiction for the trial. On 13 July 2000 the Regional Court decided that the case should be examined by the Frunzenskiy District Court of Vladivostok (“the District Court”) and forwarded the case file to the District Court.', '14. On 8 August 2000 the District Court held a directions hearing and decided to examine the criminal case on 11 October 2000. The court also decided to extend the applicants’ detention on remand, using a summary formula in respect of both applicants and stating that “the preventive measure in respect of [the applicants] should remain the same – detention on remand”. No reasons for the extension of the applicants’ detention on remand were provided.', '15. On 11 October 2000, during the examination of the applicants’ case, the court allowed an application by them for an additional expert assessment of fingerprints. The court forwarded the case file to Moscow for the expert assessment and adjourned the hearing of the criminal case. During the hearing the applicants complained under Article 276 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (lodging applications before the court) to the District Court about the length of their detention on remand and requested to be released pending trial. The applicants stated that they had permanent places of residence; that they had the necessary communication equipment to ensure constant contact with the authorities; that they had always been given positive assessments; that they had received State military awards; that they had minor children; and that they both had kidney diseases, treatment for which was not available at the detention centre. Their complaint was included in the case file (pages 497-499), but was not examined by the court.', '16. On 29 October 2000 the first applicant complained to the District Court, stating, among other things, that he had spent more than ten months in detention and requesting release pending trial. This complaint was not examined by the court.', '17. On 30 October 2000 the second applicant complained to the District Court and requested to be released pending trial. He stated that he had two minor children, that he had never been prosecuted, that he had a permanent place of residence and that he had no intention of absconding from the authorities. This complaint was not examined by the court.', '18. On 10 November 2000 the first applicant complained to the Prosecutor General. In his letter he stated, among other things, that he had been detained for more than ten months and that his requests for release pending trial had not been examined. This complaint was not examined by the authorities.', '19. On 16 November 2000 and 12 December 2000 the second applicant complained to the District Court that his detention was unlawful and requested to be released pending trial. In his letter he pointed out that he had problems with his teeth and that adequate dental treatment was not available in the detention centre; that he had a permanent place of residence; that he had two children and an elderly mother to take care of; and that he had no intention of absconding from the authorities. These complaints were not examined by the court.', '20. On 3 January 2001 the first applicant complained to the District Court, requesting it to examine the lawfulness of his detention on remand. Referring to the poor conditions of his detention, the general deterioration of his health and the lack of medical assistance in the centre, the applicant requested to be released pending trial. In his complaint the applicant stated that he had family and a child to take care of; that he had a permanent place of residence; that he had been working as a police officer for 15 years; that he had been given positive assessments; and that he had no intention of absconding from the authorities. This complaint was not examined by the court.', '21. On 3 January 2001 the second applicant complained to the District Court that his detention on remand was unlawful and requested to be released pending trial. In his letter he pointed out that he had lost several teeth and had other problems with his health, and that no medical assistance had been provided to him in the detention centre.', '22. On 12 January 2001 the District Court responded to the second applicant. The letter was very brief and did not contain any judicial decisions. It stated: “Today the court sees no reasons for changing the preventive measure”.', '23. On 23 January 2001 and 20 February 2001 the second applicant complained to the District Court that his detention on remand was unlawful and requested to be released pending trial. In his letters he stated, among other things, that he had lost eight teeth; that he had problems with his kidneys; that no treatment was available in the detention centre; that he had a permanent place of residence; that he had two children and an elderly mother to take care of; and that he had no intention of absconding from the authorities. These complaints were not examined by the court.', '24. On 31 January 2001, upon completion of the expert assessment, the case file was returned to the District Court and the hearing of the case was scheduled for 20 February 2001.', '25. On 20 February 2001 the District Court resumed the hearing of the criminal case. It completed its examination on 2 March 2001, imposing suspended sentences on the applicants and ordering their immediate release.', '26. From 24 January 2000 until their release on 2 March 2001 the applicants were detained in cells no. 41, 58, 79, 82 and 105 in the detention centre.', '27. All the cells in which the applicants were detained were of identical size, measuring 7.5 sq. m by 2.6 sq. m with four bunks. Both applicants shared their cells with four to six other detainees; therefore, they had to take turns to sleep and were allowed to sleep only between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. The applicants and their cellmates were not provided with bedding or linen; they had to acquire these items from their relatives and wash and dry them in the cells.', '28. The cells were damp; there was mould on the walls and the ceiling. The air was stale and musty. As there was no air ventilation, the cells were hot in summer and cold in winter; the temperature in the cells depended on the season and varied from +10ºC to +35ºC. The windows of the cells were covered with metal grilles supplemented with “eyelashes”, that is, metal strips covering the grille, which let no daylight in. The size of the air vents above the doors was 0.06 sq. m; therefore they could not provide fresh air. The cells were constantly lit with a single 60-watt bulb. Unprotected electric wiring hung from the ceiling and along the walls. The cells were overrun with cockroaches, blood-sucking insects and mice, but the authorities made no attempt to exterminate them, refusing even to give the inmates chloride for disinfection. The cells were not equipped with a source of drinking water. The inmates had to drink water from the tap above the toilet, which was supposed to be used only for flushing.', '29. The cells were equipped with toilets which were located 0.5 m away from the dining table and were not isolated from the living area as the centre’s administration forbade putting up curtains.', '30. Despite numerous requests by the applicants, they were never provided with bedding, crockery or kitchenware. They were also denied any toiletries, such as soap, toothbrushes, a shaving set or toilet paper, to maintain personal hygiene. In the applicants’ submission, they were able to have a shower only once every 10 to 40 days for up to 12 minutes, and to take a walk of about 50 minutes per day. The duration of walks was sometimes reduced to 20 to 30 minutes. On several occasions, the warders made the applicants choose between having a bath and taking a walk. If the applicants were in a meeting with their lawyers or in court, then they did not get to take the walk. The scarce meals were of very poor quality.', '31. The applicants, who suffered from toothache and urolithiasis, were denied proper medical treatment, reference being made to “the absence of specialists and necessary medicine”. In response to the first applicant’s complaints of renal colic, a medical officer supplied him with medicine which was unfit for use, as its shelf life had expired three years earlier. With regard to the second applicant’s complaint of acute colic, the medical officer refused to give him an injection with the medicine and syringes that had been delivered earlier by the applicant’s family. The officer stated that he only used syringes for treatment of seriously ill patients, but he could see no such patients at the moment. The available dental care was provided by a doctor who saw patients only once a week. In response to the applicants’ complaints of acute toothache he suggested that the teeth be extracted without an anaesthetic owing to the lack of medication and necessary equipment for the treatment of cavities.', '32. The applicants supported their submission with a number of documents, including eight responses by the administration of detention centre IZ-25/1 to their requests for information lodged in 2006: five responses dated 19 April 2006 (two responses concerning the ventilation of the cells, one response concerning the metal bars on the cells’ windows, one response concerning the control over the sanitary conditions in the cells and one response concerning the absence of the licence to practice medicine by the medical unit of the detention centre at the material time), one response dated 26 July 2006 (the refusal to provide the information concerning the provision of the applicants with individual toiletry kits owing to the absence of the archives), one response dated 18 August 2006 (the refusal to provide information concerning the daily number of inmates in cell no. 79 and their transfers to other cells) and one response dated 22 August 2006 (the refusal to provide information concerning the daily number of inmates in cell no. 41 and their transfers to other cells); the Recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) concerning its visit to the detention facility from 2 to 17 December 2001; three witness statements concerning the conditions of the applicants’ detention in the detention centre provided by Mr A.V. on 7 August 2006, Mr O.L. on 2 August 2006 and Mr E.K. on 3 August 2006; and six statements describing the conditions of detention and the lack of medical assistance in IZ-25/1, drawn up by the applicants and their cellmates, dated 6 and 7 November 2000, 4, 5 and 23 December 2000 and 2 February 2001. The applicants did not submit any medical documents concerning their respective conditions, whether produced during their detention in IZ-25/1 or after their release.', '33. Referring to the information provided by the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government submitted that the applicants had been detained in cells used for the detention of former employees of law-enforcement agencies.', '34. Referring to the information provided by the Russian Federal Service for Execution of Sentences, the Government submitted that the first applicant had been detained in cell no. 41, and the second applicant in cells nos. 79, 82 and 105 at the detention centre.', '35. The surface area and the height of the ceilings in all the cells were identical and amounted to 8 sq. m and 2.8 m respectively. Each cell was equipped with four bunks. The applicants shared their cells with only three other persons. At the same time, in the same submission the Government further stated that in 2000 to 2001 the detention centre had been overcrowded owing to the high level of criminal activity in the area and the limited capacity of the centre. For these reasons the number of persons detained with the applicants had exceeded the required standard. In spite of these difficulties, each detainee in the applicants’ cells had been provided with a sleeping berth. However, the Government did not specify the exact number of persons detained with the applicants and the nature of the sleeping berth.', '36. The size of the windows was in accordance with the relevant regulations and comprised one-eighth of the cells’ floor space, providing the applicants with the possibility of reading and working under natural light. Each window was equipped with an air vent for additional ventilation; another source of ventilation was installed above the door. The temperature in the cells varied from +18ºC to +24ºC. The window air vents and doors were opened for ventilation when the inmates were taken for a walk. All cells were equipped with running water. The levels of temperature and the humidity in the cells, as well as the quality of water, complied with the relevant hygiene and sanitary regulations. No outbreaks of infectious or parasitogenic diseases were registered at the centre at the material time.', '37. Each cell in the centre was equipped with bulbs for daytime and night lighting. The night lighting was on from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. The toilet was separated from the living area by a curtain, which ensured privacy. There were no rodents or insects in the cells as the administration conducted a monthly disinfection; in addition, the staff of the medical centre regularly inspected the cells for insects and rodents.', '38. The applicants and other inmates of the detention centre were allowed to take a shower once every seven days; their bed linen was changed at the same time. The applicants were provided with individual bunks, bed linen, crockery and cutlery. They were given individual toiletry kits (containing soap, a toothbrush, a shaving kit and toilet paper). Additional toiletry items could have been provided to the applicants had they submitted a written request, but they had failed to do so.', '39. Open-air walks were permitted for one hour a day and there had been no instances of substituting a walk for a bath.', '40. The Government submitted that the applicants had been provided with medical assistance in accordance with the relevant regulations, although at the material time the medical unit had not had a licence to practise medicine. The applicants had undergone an initial medical examination on the date of their entry to the detention centre; as a result it had been established that they had been healthy. The medical unit of the detention centre had been supplied with the necessary equipment and medicine. Referring to a number of documents, the Government stated that during the entire period of their detention at the centre, the applicants had neither sought medical help nor complained to the administration about the failure of the medical services to provide them with requested treatment.', '41. In support of their position the Government submitted, among others, a number of information statements issued by the administration of IZ-25/1, witness statements of the personnel of the medical unit in IZ-25/1, records concerning the number of inmates in the cells; and copies of some documents from the investigation file.', '42. Until 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters were governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (Law of 27 October 1960 – “the old CCrP”).', '43. “Preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” (меры пресечения) included an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal security, bail and detention on remand (Article 89 of the old CCrP).', '44. The Russian Constitution of 12 December 1993 established that a judicial decision was required before a defendant could be detained or his or her detention extended (Article 22). Under the old CCrP, a decision ordering detention on remand could be taken by a prosecutor or a court (Articles 11, 89 and 96).', '45. When deciding whether to remand an accused in custody, the competent authority was required to consider whether there were “sufficient grounds to believe” that he or she would abscond during the investigation or trial or obstruct the establishment of the truth or reoffend (Article 89 of the old CCrP). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused’s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 91 of the old CCrP). Before 14 March 2001, detention on remand was authorised if the accused was charged with a criminal offence carrying a sentence of at least one year’s imprisonment or if there were “exceptional circumstances” in the case (Article 96).', '46. The old CCrP distinguished between two types of detention on remand: the first being “during the investigation”, that is, while a competent agency – the police or a prosecutor’s office – investigated the case, and the second “before the court” (or “during the judicial proceedings”), that is, while the case was being tried in court. Although there was no difference in practice between them (the detainee was held in the same detention facility), the calculation of the time-limits was different.', '47. After arrest the suspect was placed in custody “during the investigation”. The maximum permitted period of detention “during the investigation” was two months but it could be extended for up to eighteen months in “exceptional circumstances”. Extensions were authorised by prosecutors of ascending hierarchical levels. No extension of detention “during the investigation” beyond eighteen months was possible (Article 97 of the old CCrP).', '48. From the date the prosecutor forwarded the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention was “before the court” (or “during the judicial proceedings”). Before 14 March 2001 the old CCrP set no time-limit for detention “during the trial”.', '49. Under the old CCrP, the detainee or his or her counsel or representative could challenge before a court a detention order issued by a prosecutor, and any subsequent extension order. The judge was required to review the lawfulness of and justification for a detention or extension order no later than three days after receipt of the relevant papers. The review was to be conducted in camera in the presence of a prosecutor and the detainee’s counsel or representative. The detainee was to be summoned and a review in his absence was only permissible in exceptional circumstances if the detainee waived his right to be present of his own free will. The judge could either dismiss the challenge or revoke the pre-trial detention and order the detainee’s release (Article 220-1). An appeal to a higher court lay against the judge’s decision. It had to be examined within the same time-limit as appeals against a judgment on the merits (Article 331 in fine).', '50. Upon receipt of the case-file, the judge was to determine, in particular, whether the defendant should remain in custody or be released pending trial (Article 222 § 5 and Article 230 of the old CCrP) and to rule on any application by the defendant for release (Article 223 of the old CCrP). If the application was refused, a fresh application could be made once the trial had commenced (Article 223 of the old CCrP).', '51. At any time during the trial the court could order, vary or revoke any preventive measure, including detention on remand (Article 260 of the old CCrP). An appeal against such a decision lay to a higher court. It was to be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against the judgment on the merits (Article 331 of the old CCrP).', '52. Under the old CCrP, the duration of the trial was not limited in time.', '53. The 1995 Law on the conditions of detention of suspects and accused (закон «О содержании под стражей подозреваемых и обвиняемых в совершении преступлений») provided that inmates were entitled to medical assistance (section 17). If an inmate’s health deteriorated, the medical officers of the detention facility were obliged to conduct an immediate medical examination and inform him of its results in writing. If the inmate requested to be examined by staff of other medical institutions, the administration of the detention facility was to organise such an examination. If the administration refused, the refusal could be appealed against to a prosecutor or court. If an inmate suffered from a serious disease, the administration of the detention facility was obliged immediately to inform the prosecutor, who could carry out an inquiry into this matter (section 24).']","['3', '5']","['5-3', '5-4']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1941 and resided in Kazincbarcika. He died in March 2004.', '6. On 2 September 1994 the applicant brought an action in the Miskolc Labour Court against his former employer, a joint-stock company. He requested the court to hold that his employment contract had been terminated unlawfully, that he should be reinstated and that the agreement with the employer company to buy his shares from him be annulled.', '7. After a hearing on 30 November 1994, on 15 February 1995 the Labour Court discontinued the proceedings partly because the applicant’s action had been submitted outside the statutory time-limit, and partly because it had no competence in the case.', '8. On 11 May 1995 the Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén County Regional Court quashed part of the first-instance decision and appointed the Kazincbarcika District Court to deal with the applicant’s civil law claim.', '9. On 16 February 1996 the Supreme Court accepted the applicant’s petition for review and remitted the labour law aspects of the case to the Labour Court.', '10. Meanwhile, on 25 April 1995 the applicant instituted proceedings, seeking the payment of damages, additional wages and other benefits. After a hearing on 6 December 1995, on 28 March 1996 the Labour Court ordered that this action be joined to the original proceedings which were to be resumed pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision.', '11. After hearings on 17 May and 7 June 1996, on 3 July 1996 the Labour Court gave a partial judgment. It stated that the company had terminated the applicant’s employment unlawfully and ordered it to reinstate him.', '12. On appeal, on 28 November 1996 the Regional Court quashed the first-instance partial judgment and dismissed the applicant’s claim concerning the termination of his employment.', '13. In the proceedings concerning the remainder of the case, on 8 April, 4 September and 2 November 1997, the Labour Court held hearings. On 16 December 1997 it accepted part of the applicant’s claims for additional wages and outstanding benefits, but dismissed the remainder.', '14. On appeal, on 2 April 1998 the Regional Court considered the first-instance judgment to be a partial decision and confirmed its contents. It held that the Labour Court had failed to examine some of the applicant’s claims, and that in this respect the proceedings were to be continued.', '15. In the resumed first-instance proceedings, on 15 June 1998 the Labour Court transferred part of the applicant’s claims to the competent Kazincbarcika District Court. After a hearing on 13 January 1999, on 3 February 1999 it dismissed the applicant’s action.', '16. On 14 December 2000 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '17.
