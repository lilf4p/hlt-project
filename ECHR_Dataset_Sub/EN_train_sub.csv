The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Jelsa. 5. The applicant’s mother died on 1 May 1994 and inheritance proceedings were opened before the Stari Grad Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Starom Gradu). 6. On 8 June 1999 the court issued a decision distributing the property between the applicant and his brother.

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Procedural aspect),Anatoly Kovler;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Volodymyr Butkevych;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"6. The applicants were born in 1983 and 1981 respectively and live in Moscow. 7. On 14 September 2000 the first applicant was arrested on suspicion of having hijacked a car together with the second applicant and a Mr F., and was brought to Fili-Davydkovo police station. According to the first applicant, three police officers beat him severely, kicking him in the head and back, to force him to confess to twenty-five hijacking incidents which had occurred in that district of Moscow. After his resistance had worn down, the first applicant wrote a statement, prompted by the police officers, confessing to a car theft. The record of his arrest was drawn up at 3 p.m. 8. On the same day police officers arrested the second applicant. The second applicant submitted that on his arrest he had been placed in the boot of a car and had been brought to Fili-Davydkovo police station, where police officers had beaten him up and had forced him to confess to a car theft. 9. On 15 September 2000 the acting Kuntsevo district prosecutor questioned the applicants about their participation in hijacking incidents and authorised their release on their own recognisance. According to the Government, the applicants did not complain to the prosecutor about any police brutality. 10. On 16 and 18 September 2000 the applicants were examined in hospital no. 79 in Moscow. The first applicant was diagnosed with a compression fracture of the bodies of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae and the second applicant was diagnosed with injuries to the right side of the chest and neck. The first applicant was suffering from severe back pain, for which he was prescribed treatment and given a medical corset. For approximately four months he wore the corset and underwent medical treatment. 11. The applicants complained to the Kuntsevo district prosecutor that they had been ill-treated in the police station after their arrest. In November 2000 the Kuntsevo district prosecutor’s office initiated an inquiry into the applicants’ complaints. 12. On 22 January 2001 a senior assistant of the Kuntsevo district prosecutor declined to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers, finding no criminal conduct in their actions (Article 5 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The decision read as follows: “On 16 and 18 September 2000 the Fili-Davydkovo [police department] was informed by hospital no. 79 in Moscow that on those dates Mr F., [the second applicant] and [the first applicant] had on their own initiative requested medical assistance at hospital no. 79, where Mr F.... was diagnosed with..., [the second applicant] was diagnosed with an injury to the neck and the right side of the chest and [the first applicant] was diagnosed with a compression fracture of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae. Mr F., [the second applicant] and [the first applicant] explained that on 14 September 2000 they had been beaten up by police officers in Fili-Davydkovo police station. ... [The first applicant], a minor, questioned in the presence of his mother, stated that on the night on 14 September 2000 he, Mr F. and [the second applicant] had hijacked two cars...; he had been arrested by police officers and brought to the duty unit of Fili-Davydkovo police station; after his arrest, on 14 September 2000 at approximately 8.30 a.m. a police officer, whom [the first applicant] could not name, had entered the duty unit of Fili-Davydkovo police station and had taken [the first applicant] to his office on the second floor. In the course of the interview the police officer had urged [the first applicant] to confess to having committed a crime, kicked him several times in the small of the back and at the same time demanded that [the first applicant] confess to several other hijackings which he had not committed. Other police officers in plain clothes had entered the office where [the first applicant] was being questioned; they had hit [the first applicant] in different parts of his body and had demanded that he name the persons with whom he had committed criminal offences on 14 September 2000 and indicate their addresses. After his written confession ... had been obtained, he had been brought back to the duty unit of FiliDavydkovo police station. On 15 September 2000, after a measure of restraint in the form of a written undertaking had been imposed, [the first applicant] had been sent home. On 18 September 2000 he had sought medical assistance at hospital no. 79, where he had been diagnosed with a compression fracture of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae and had undergone treatment until 19 December 2000. According to forensic medical report no. 7867/17801 of the Bureau of Forensic Medicine, when [the first applicant] requested a medical examination no injuries were recorded on his body and the diagnosis of ‘an injury of the lumbar spine’ was not confirmed by objective clinical data and could not be subjected to forensic medical identification. When questioned on 15 September 2000 by the acting Kuntsevo district prosecutor, [the first applicant] stated that on 14 September 2000 he had been arrested by police officers on suspicion of having stolen cars in the district under the jurisdiction of the Fili-Davydkovo police department. He did not complain about the conduct of the police officers, stating that the police officers had not used force or any other pressure against him. The mother of the minor, [the first applicant], Ms A., who was questioned in the presence of Ms L., a lawyer from no. 10 Bar Association, stated that on 14 September 2000 at approximately 6 p.m. she had received a phone call from Fili-Davydkovo police station and had been informed that her son had been arrested on suspicion of a crime and had been kept in Fili-Davydkovo police station. On 14 September 2000 at approximately 7.30 p.m., Ms A. arrived at Fili-Davydkovo police station. From a conversation with an investigator she learned that her son had been arrested for having committed a hijacking in the district under the jurisdiction of the Fili-Davydkovo police department. The investigator allowed her to see and give food to her son. During a conversation in Fili-Davydkovo police station on 14 September 2000 her son did not complain about the state of his health and did not say anything about being beaten by police officers. On 15 September 2000 at 5.50 p.m. Ms A. took her son home... On 16 September 2000 her son complained to her of pain in his back and claimed that he had been beaten up by police officers in Fili-Davydkovo police station. Ms A. did not attribute sufficient weight to her son’s complaints and decided to treat him herself. On 18 September 2000 she and her son sought medical assistance at hospital no. 79, where he was diagnosed with a compression fracture of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae. Her son underwent treatment and was on sick leave from 18 September to 19 December 2000. ... [The second applicant] gave similar explanations, asserting that on 16 September 2000 he had sought medical assistance at hospital no. 79, where he had been diagnosed with an injury to the neck and [an injury] to the right side of the chest; he had not requested sick leave. He did not make any claims in respect of the police officers. An investigator from the Fili-Davydkovo police department, ... Mr E., stated that on 14 September 2000, ... [the first applicant] had been arrested at 3 p.m. ... and [the second applicant] at 9 p.m.; they had been questioned as suspects in relation to criminal case no. 6533 ... in the presence of a lawyer, Mr M. In the course of the interview the arrested persons did not make any complaints in respect of the police officers and did not complain about the state of their health; after a measure of restraint in the form of a written undertaking had been imposed, they were released on 15 September 2000. Mr L., a police officer at Fili-Davydkovo police station, explained during questioning that ... he had not questioned [the first and second applicants], the arrested persons, and had not obtained any written statements from them; he had not used any physical or psychological pressure against them. Another police officer, Mr Sh., stated during questioning that on 15 September 2000 he had been in his office, no. 23. An arrested person ([the first applicant], as it transpired later) suspected of having committed a hijacking had been there. The police officers, whose last names he did not know because he had worked in the police station for only about two months, had questioned [the first applicant]. The police officers asked [the first applicant] questions pertaining to car thefts; they had not used any physical, psychological or other pressure against [the first applicant]. A junior police officer of the Fili-Davydkovo police department, Mr Ma., gave a similar statement, asserting at the same time that when [the second applicant] had been brought from [his] place of residence he had not put him under any physical, psychological or other pressure. The arrestees had voluntarily, without duress, given statements pertaining to hijackings committed in the district under the jurisdiction of the Fili-Davydkovo police department. Another police officer, Mr A., stated when questioned that on 14 September 2000 he had had a conversation with [the first applicant], who had informed him that he, Mr F. and [the second applicant] had stolen cars in the district covered by the police department. When he had talked to [the first applicant], he had not used any physical or other pressure against [him]. Moreover, he, Mr A., had been involved in [the second applicant’s] transfer [to the police station]. During the transfer Mr A. and the other police officers had not used any force or other pressure against the arrestees. After [the second applicant] and Mr F. had been brought to the police station, Mr A. had talked to them in his office about car thefts committed by them. Mr F. and [the second applicant] had voluntarily, without duress, confessed to two hijackings in the district of the police department. Mr A. had not used physical, psychological or other pressure against the arrestees. Hence, no objective data and evidence confirming the use of physical or other pressure by the police officers against [the first and second applicants] ...was gathered during the inquiry. In view of the above, [I] conclude that there is no indication of a criminal offence ... in the police officers’ actions. However, the inquiry established that a minor, [the first applicant], had been held for a protracted period in Fili-Davydkovo police station before an investigator took the decision to detain [the applicants] ... Following [the first applicant’s arrest] at 3 p.m.... and [the second applicant’s] arrest at 9 p.m., they were held in the duty unit of Fili-Davydkovo police station and were not transferred to the detention unit at Krylatskoye police station. On discovering these violations of the law the prosecutor’s office issued a decision addressed to the head of the Fili-Davydkovo police department.” The decision of 22 January 2001 was not served on the applicants. 13. The applicants were committed to stand trial before the Kuntsevo District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”). On 9 February 2001 the District Court, composed of the presiding judge B. and two lay assessors P. and F., remitted the criminal case for additional investigation and dismissed the request for release of the second applicant, who had been remanded in custody on 22 November 2000. The District Court held that “the defendants had committed serious criminal offences” and that there were no grounds for releasing the second applicant. The lawyer for the first applicant, Ms Moskalenko, appealed against that decision, but later withdrew her statement of appeal. 14. On 24 May 2001 the applicants’ lawyers complained to the Kuntsevo District Court about the beating in the police station. They noted that a similar complaint about police brutality had been raised before the Kuntsevo district prosecutor’s office. The lawyers insisted that the results of the prosecutor’s inquiry were unknown to them and their clients and asked the District Court to request the materials from the inquiry. 15. On 25 May 2001 the trial began. The District Court was composed of the presiding judge B. and two lay assessors, B. and G. The applicants’ lawyers, relying on Articles 59 § 3 and 61 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, unsuccessfully sought the removal of the presiding judge, alleging her personal bias against the applicants. The applicants and their lawyers, referring to the hospital reports recording the applicants’ injuries, further complained to the District Court about the illtreatment occurring in the police station on 14 September 2000. 16. On 28 May 2001 the Kuntsevo District Court found the applicants guilty of aggravated car theft and sentenced them to three years’ imprisonment. As regards the allegations of police brutality, the District Court noted that the investigating authority had conducted an inquiry into the applicants’ complaints about the beatings and had decided not to institute criminal proceedings because the allegations had not been proven. 17. The applicants and their lawyers appealed. In their statements of appeal they complained, inter alia, that the applicants’ conviction contravened the principle of the presumption of innocence, as the presiding judge B. had already found them guilty in her decision of 9 February 2001, that the District Court had not examined their ill-treatment complaints thoroughly, that it had not asked the investigating authorities to produce the case file relating to the inquiry into the allegations of police brutality, and that they had learnt about the prosecutor’s decision of 22 January 2001 only during the trial proceedings. 18. On 17 July 2001 the Moscow City Court upheld the conviction, reduced the applicants’ sentence to two years’ imprisonment and ordered the first applicant’s conditional release, noting that his injury, namely a compression fracture of the 1st and 2nd vertebrae, warranted his release. The City Court held that the applicants’ complaints about the beatings had been “unfounded because these allegations were examined by the prosecutor’s office and then by the [District] Court, and were correctly dismissed because they had not been proven”. It further stated that the District Court had not committed any violations of criminal procedural law. 19. The RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure (in force until 1 July 2002, “the CCrP”) established that a criminal investigation could be initiated by an investigator on a complaint by an individual or on the investigative authorities’ own initiative, where there were reasons to believe that a crime had been committed (Articles 108 and 125). A prosecutor was responsible for overall supervision of the investigation (Articles 210 and 211). He could order specific investigative actions, transfer the case from one investigator to another or order an additional investigation. If there were no grounds to initiate a criminal investigation, the prosecutor or investigator issued a reasoned decision to that effect which had to be notified to the interested party. The decision was amenable to appeal to a higher-ranking prosecutor or to a court of general jurisdiction (Article 113). 20. An appeal against a decision of a first-instance court (including an order authorising or extending pre-trial detention) lies to a higher court. It must be lodged within ten days and examined within the same time-limit as an appeal against a judgment on the merits (Article 331 of the CCrP). 21. Under Article 59 § 3 of the CCrP a judge should not sit in a case if there are any grounds to conclude that he/she has a direct or indirect personal interest in the case. In such circumstances the judge should withdraw from the case; failing this, a party has the right to lodge a motion to challenge the judge (Article 60).",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

SERBIA,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky,"5. The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Mionica. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. On 7 November 2001 the applicant, a bus conductor, was dismissed by his employer, “Lasta Strela”, a transportation company based in Valjevo. 8. On 24 December 2001 he filed a claim with the Municipal Court in Valjevo (“the Municipal Court”), seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears. 9. Following a remittal of 14 April 2003, the next hearing in the case was scheduled by the Municipal Court for 27 September 2004. 10. Of the nine separate hearings scheduled between 27 September 2004 and 26 January 2006, it would appear that four were adjourned whilst five were held. As regards the former, two hearings were adjourned because the respondent and/or several witnesses had not been duly summoned and the other two because witnesses, of whom two were proposed by the applicant, had, though duly summoned, failed to appear in court (for which omission they were ultimately fined). 11. On 27 January 2006 the Municipal Court ruled against the applicant. 12. On 25 April 2006 the applicant was served with this judgment. 13. On 3 May 2006 the applicant filed an appeal with the District Court in Valjevo (“the District Court”). 14. On 18 December 2006 the District Court returned the case file to the Municipal Court, requesting it to submit certain missing documents. 15. On 29 March 2007 the District Court upheld the judgment rendered at first instance. 16. On 3 April 2008 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law (revizija). 17. Article 122 § 3 provided that all employment-related disputes were to be resolved by the courts within a period of 6 months from the date of institution of the proceedings. 18. This Act entered into force on 23 March 2005 and thereby repealed the Labour Act 2001. 19. The text of Article 195 § 3 of the Labour Act 2005 corresponds to Article 122 § 3 of the Labour Act 2001.",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1
3,001-58298,ENG,TUR,GRANDCHAMBER,1999,CASE OF SÜREK v. TURKEY (No. 4),2,"Violation of Art. 10;Preliminary objections rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, estoppel);Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings",John Freeland;Luzius Wildhaber;Paul Mahoney,"8. The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul. 9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (The Truth of News and Comments), published in Istanbul. 10. In issue no. 51 of the review, dated 13 March 1993, a news commentary entitled “Kawa and Dehak Once Again” was published. The article analysed possible events, which could occur during the upcoming celebrations of Newroz. 11. A translation of the relevant parts of the news commentary is as follows: “... It’s Newroz week in Kurdistan. The biggest confrontation between the demands of the Kurdish people and intolerance in the face of the expression of these demands occurs during these days. The tradition of rebellion is awakened. Dehak and Kawa are once again invested with flesh and bones. It is time to settle accounts. There is nothing vague about Kawa. All the mountains, all the cities are full of Kawa. There are millions of them. All right, who, then, is Dehak? Who is the candidate for representing Dehak in our day? Is it Demirel? Is it Güreş? The regional Governor? Or the new commander İlter? This time round, is Dehak represented by every counter-insurgency chief, indeed, every counter-insurgency operative, every special team member, every police commissioner or superintendent officer? Has Dehak become anonymous too? Be it as it may, but Dehak and Kawa will settle their accounts once again. ... Last year, a revolutionary publication described the days preceding Newroz as follows: ‘Nowadays over 200 thousand soldiers massed into Kurdistan. Tanks and weapons are sent over. Bombs are raining on Kurdish villages and mountains. The Chief of the General Staff has inspected the preparations for the offensive. Instructions are being issued to provincial and district governors, special team leaders, police chiefs and military officials. The Head of MİT intelligence agency talks of the prospect of much blood being shed. Members of Parliament are organising information-gathering trips in order to take the pulse of the people.’ ... Unlike previous years, the PKK-leaning Kurdistan National Assembly (KUM) is also expected to take on a role during Newroz this year. ... On the other hand emergency measures are being implemented in large cities outside Kurdistan where there are concentrations of Kurdish people. It is highly likely that there will be large demonstrations in the Kurdish quarters there.” 12. In the same issue and within the context of the above news commentary, an interview was also published by the Kurdish News Agency with a representative of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan (“the ERNK”), the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (“the PKK”). Both organisations are illegal under Turkish law. 13. A translation of the relevant part of the interview is as follows: “... We wish to emphasise this finding, indeed, we feel that it ought to be underlined. And we call on all European countries. We are open to any humanitarian, political solution, including the calls for an armistice. The PKK movement and its struggle are absolutely not terrorist movements. This misapprehension must be abandoned – it must definitely be abandoned – and a move must be made towards co-operation and support. The real terrorist is the Republic of Turkey. We believe that attitudes on this matter will be much clarified this year, that very positive dialogues will develop and that the Republic of Turkey will be gradually further isolated.” 14. On 14 March 1993 the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) ordered the seizure of all copies of issue no. 51 of the review, since it allegedly disseminated separatist propaganda. 15. In an indictment dated 22 April 1993, the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court, on account of the publication of the above news commentary, charged the applicant in his capacity as the owner of the review with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State. He was also charged with publishing the declaration of the ERNK (see paragraph 12 above). The charges were brought under sections 8 and 6 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (hereinafter “the 1991 Act”: see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), respectively. 16. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He pleaded that the incriminated news commentary did not fall within the scope of section 8 of the 1991 Act. He maintained that arguing and commenting on possible activities in which the PKK might engage during the Newroz celebrations could not be regarded as publishing a declaration of a terrorist organisation within the meaning of section 6 of the 1991 Act. As regards his freedom of expression, the applicant referred to Article 10 of the Convention and the case-law of the Commission and the Court. He stated that pluralism of opinion was essential in a democratic society including opinions which shock or offend. He argued that the provisions of sections 6 and 8 of the 1991 Act restricted freedom of expression in contravention of the Turkish Constitution and the criteria laid down in the case-law of the Commission and the Court. 17. In a judgment dated 27 September 1993, the Istanbul National Security Court found the applicant guilty of an offence under section 8 § 2 of the 1991 Act. The court first sentenced the applicant to a fine of 100,000,000 Turkish liras. However, having regard to the applicant’s good conduct during the trial, it reduced the fine to 83,333,333 Turkish liras. 18. In its reasoning, the court held that the incriminated news commentary contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act. The court concluded that it referred to a certain part of the Turkish territory as “Kurdistan” as well as a certain section of the population as “Kurds”, and amounted to propaganda against the indivisibility of the Turkish State. The court further observed that the review had also published the declaration of an illegal terrorist organisation in which the Republic of Turkey was referred to as a terrorist State. However, it considered that the declaration constituted part of the incriminated news commentary. Having regard to the provisions of Article 79 of the Turkish Criminal Code, the court found no grounds for a separate conviction under section 6 of the 1991 Act. 19. The applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Cassation. He relied on the defence grounds which he had invoked at his trial before the National Security Court. 20. On 8 February 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the National Security Court’s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence. On 29 November 1995 the applicant paid the last instalment of the fine imposed on him. 21. Following the amendments made by Law No. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicant’s case. On 22 April 1996 the court ruled that these amendments did not affect the applicant’s case as his sentence had already been executed. 22. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence…” Article 79 “A person who infringes various provisions of this Code by a single act, shall be punished under the provision which prescribes the heaviest punishment.” 23. The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” 24. The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: “It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations. … Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.” (before amendment by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” (as amended by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995) “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras… …” 25. The following amendments were made to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 after the enactment of Law 4126 of 27 October 1995: “In the month following the entry into force of the present Law, the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and, in accordance with the amendment ... to section 8 of Law no. 3713, shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections 4 and 6 of Law no. 647 of 13 July 1965.” 26. The Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provisions: “An appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment. Non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness.” “Unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases: 1- where the court is not established in accordance with the law; 2- where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating; …” 27. The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Istanbul National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section 8 of Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 23 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decisions included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified. 28. Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the following judgments: 19 November (no. 1996/428) and 27 December 1996 (no. 1996/519); 6 March (no. 1997/33), 3 June (no. 1997/102), 17 October (no. 1997/527), 24 October (no. 1997/541) and 23 December 1997 (no. 1997/606); 21 January (no. 1998/8), 3 February (no. 1998/14), 19 March (no. 1998/56), 21 April 1998 (no. 1998/87) and 17 June 1998 (no. 1998/133). 29. As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the scientific, historical and/or objective nature of the words used. 30. The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation of the National Security Courts are worded as follows: “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, ... or ... person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” “Judges … shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution…” “National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members, two substitute members, a prosecutor and a sufficient number of assistant prosecutors. The president, one of the regular members, one of the substitutes and the prosecutor, shall be appointed from among judges and public prosecutors of the first rank, according to procedures laid down in special legislation; one regular member and one substitute shall be appointed from among military judges of the first rank and the assistant prosecutors from among public prosecutors and military judges. Presidents, regular members and substitute members ... of National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years. Appeal against decisions of National Security Courts shall lie to the Court of Cassation. ...” “Military legal proceedings “The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve in the performance of their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law...” 31. Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide as follows: “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try persons accused of offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security.” “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members and two substitute members.” “The president of a National Security Court, one of the [two] regular members and one of the [two] substitutes ... shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether regular or substitute, military judges of the first rank…” “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Military Legal Service Act. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts … may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years… … If, after an investigation concerning the president or a regular or substitute member of a National Security Court conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of the person concerned, the duty station of that judge or the duties themselves … may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” “National Security Courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons charged with (a) the offences contemplated in Article 312 § 2 … of the Turkish Criminal Code …, … (d) offences having a connection with the events which made it necessary to declare a state of emergency, in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution, (e) offences committed against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free, democratic system of government and offences directly affecting the State’s internal or external security. …” “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals against the judgments of the National Security Courts.” “The rules governing the rights and obligations of … military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision …, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences they may commit in the performance of their duties ... shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their profession… The observations of the Court of Cassation on military judges, the assessment reports on them drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors … and the files on any investigations conducted in respect of them … shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, where a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court…” 32. The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: “The aptitude of military judges … appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Law and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a) The first superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether regular or substitute members … shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. …” “Members … of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service … shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and the legal adviser of the General Staff, the personnel director and the legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence…” “Military judges … shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces… … The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the superiors…” “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges … shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A. A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. … B. A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. … The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file…” “When military judges … sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts…” 33. Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a civil servant in order to influence the military courts.” 34. Under section 22, the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their professional advancement.","['10', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1965 and is serving a sentence of imprisonment in Uzbekistan. 7. The applicant arrived in Russia in July 2000 and resided in the town of Michurinsk in the Tambov Region. It appears that until mid-2003 he returned to Uzbekistan for several short periods of time. In 2004 he was convicted by a Russian court and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment for having used a false migration card. After his release, in October 2004 he moved to Usman, a provincial town in the Lipetsk Region, where he was employed as a cook. On 31 January 2005 the applicant sought a temporary residence authorisation (разрешение на временное проживание) and apparently applied for Russian citizenship. It appears that his application was rejected on 28 February 2006 (see paragraph 17 below). According to the applicant, he became aware of that refusal only on 29 September 2006. 8. Most recently, from 23 December 2005 to 23 March 2006 the applicant had a valid temporary residence registration (временная регистрация) in the Lipetsk Region. According to the applicant, on an unspecified date in 2006 the Chief Inspector of the Criminal Police of Usman in the Lipetsk Region refused to renew it. It appears, however, that no formal decision was issued. 9. According to the Uzbek authorities, in April 2005 two Uzbek nationals complained to the Uzbek National Security Service (NSS) that the applicant had been engaged in anti-constitutional activities during an unspecified period of time. He left Uzbekistan after his accomplices had been apprehended. 10. On 29 April 2005 the NSS of the Surkhandarianskiy Region initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 159 § 3 (b) and Articles 216, 244-1 and 244-2 of the Uzbek Criminal Code (see paragraph 76 below). They accused him of membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir (HT), a transnational Islamic organisation, which is banned in Russia, Germany and some Central Asian states. On 8 May 2005 the Uzbek authorities issued an arrest warrant in respect of the applicant with reference to the charges under Articles 159 and 244-1 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. 11. On 2 February 2006 the applicant was apprehended in the town of Gryazi in Russia and taken into custody. On 4 February 2006 the Gryazi Town Court of the Lipetsk Region authorised his detention with a view to extradition to Uzbekistan, relying on Article 108 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP). It did not set a time-limit for which that detention was authorised. The detention order was amenable to appeal to the Regional Court within a three-day time-limit. The applicant did not appeal. 12. In March 2006 the Uzbek Prosecutor General’s Office requested the applicant’s extradition and provided assurances that he would not be surrendered to another State without Russia’s consent and would not be prosecuted or punished for any offence committed prior to his extradition and for which extradition would have been refused; and that he would be able to leave Uzbekistan after being tried and serving his sentence. 13. On 12 April 2006 the Lipetsk regional prosecutor instructed the administration of the remand centre to keep the applicant in detention under Article 466 of the CCrP, the 1993 Minsk Convention and the Prosecutor General’s Instructions of 20 June 2002 (see paragraphs 53, 54 and 66 below). 14. On 22 September 2006 the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation rejected the extradition request because some of the acts imputed to the applicant were not criminal offences in Russia, while the others had been committed before becoming punishable under the Russian Criminal Code, or prosecution for such offences had become time-barred. 15. On 26 September 2006 the Prosecutor General’s Office informed the Prosecutor’s Office of the Lipetsk Region that the applicant’s extradition had been refused, and instructed that office to check the grounds for the applicant’s presence in the territory of Russia and to decide whether he should be removed from Russia. 16. On 28 September 2006 the regional prosecutor instructed the Gryazi Prosecutor’s Office to check the lawfulness of the applicant’s stay in Russia and to institute proceedings against him under the Code of Administrative Offences, if appropriate. The prosecutor wrote as follows: “...if a judge does not order administrative expulsion and if legal grounds obtain, it is necessary to decide on Mr Muminov’s deportation under section 25.10 of the Law on Entering and Leaving the Russian Federation and the Government’s Decree no. 199 of 7 April 2003...” On the same day, the Gryazi Prosecutor’s Office ordered the applicant’s release from custody. 17. The applicant was released on 29 September 2006. Immediately thereafter, the Gryazi Prosecutor’s Office accused him of residing in the territory of Russia in breach of Article 18.8 of the Code of Administrative Offences. It found in particular that the applicant’s application “for permission to temporarily reside in Russia” had been rejected by the Regional Office of the Federal Security Service (“FSB”) on 28 February 2006 and that his residence registration had expired on 23 March 2006. On the same date, the administrative file was examined by a judge in the Gryazi Town Court who discontinued the case for lack of a corpus delicti. The judge held in essence that although the applicant’s residence registration had expired on 23 March 2006, on that date and until 29 September 2006 he had been detained with a view to extradition. Having been released and charged on the same day, he could not have committed the offence imputed to him. The judgment became final after the expiry of the statutory time-limit for appeal. 18. While in detention, in April 2006 the applicant submitted to the Lipetsk Regional Migration Authority applications for refugee status and temporary asylum in Russia. On 12 April 2006 migration officers interviewed him in the remand centre. As can be seen from the interview record, signed by the applicant, he denied membership of any proscribed organisation; having learnt from his wife about the criminal charges against him in Uzbekistan, he had been planning to go there in order to clarify the situation but could not buy a train ticket. He indicated his “fear of being prosecuted for serious offences which he had not committed” as the reason for refusing to return to Uzbekistan. 19. In a decision of 17 April 2006 the Migration Authority refused to examine the applicant’s application for refugee status on the merits, concluding that he had left Uzbekistan for “economic reasons” falling outside the scope of an admissible refugee request and that he was refusing to return there because of the criminal prosecution against him. The Migration Authority also rejected his temporary asylum application on 2 May 2006, concluding that his fear of being prosecuted for offences could not be a valid reason for granting temporary asylum. The Authority found as follows: “...the applicant’s explanations are contradictory... On 12 April 2006 he explained that he had arrived in Gryazi to purchase a train ticket, whereas on 20 April 2006 he contended that he had been in Gryazi to seek assistance from a friend in order to lodge a complaint with the Strasbourg court. The applicant probably means the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, whereas he is a national of Uzbekistan, a Central Asian republic. Besides, a complaint before that court may be lodged after the applicant has exhausted all judicial remedies in his republic; in addition, he fled justice in Uzbekistan. Thus, the applicant is manifestly trying to hide his true intentions. All the reasons indicated by the applicant for not returning to Uzbekistan were examined together with his request for refugee status and did not justify granting such status. No other reasons were adduced in favour of granting such a status on the basis of humane considerations. According to information from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ‘... there was no ascertainable information about instances of torture or the sentencing of expelled Uzbek nationals to the death penalty... During the last two years Uzbekistan has taken certain measures for reform in this field... In December 2003 the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan prohibited lower courts from using in evidence confessions obtained under torture or without counsel being present. In September 2004 the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court upheld the inadmissibility of unlawfully obtained evidence...’ The seriousness of the charges against the applicant should be taken into account... The political and extremist activities of Hizb ut-Tahrir may represent a threat to national security...” 20. In August 2006 the applicant, with the help of the Civic Assistance Committee, a non-governmental organisation helping immigrants, retained Ms Biryukova to represent his interests in the domestic proceedings. On 15 September 2006 the applicant obtained a copy of the decision of 17 April 2006 and appealed against it. He pleaded that he had become a refugee “sur place”; being a Sunnite, he feared that he would be tortured by the Uzbek authorities in order to make him admit to the extremist charges against him. He referred to reports by the UN and international non-governmental organisations about cases of ill-treatment against several persons in a similar situation. 21. On 24 October 2006 the applicant was expelled to Uzbekistan (for further details see section D below). 22. On 27 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Lipetsk upheld the decision of 17 April 2006. The court concluded that the applicant had failed to adduce any evidence that he had been or would be persecuted for “political reasons”. 23. On 18 December 2006 the Lipetsk Regional Court set aside the judgment of 27 October 2006 and ordered a re-examination of the matter by the District Court. On 10 January 2007 the District Court again dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found as follows: “... [the applicant] failed to comply with Articles 56 and 57 of the Code of Civil Procedure requiring him to adduce evidence in support of his allegation of political persecution.... [H]e has already been residing unlawfully in Russia for a long time ... He neither submitted any evidence that he had left Uzbekistan for political reasons, nor has it been averred that his fears of persecution for political reasons were justified. He did not apply for refugee status after his unlawful entry into Russian territory. Thus, there were no legal grounds for examining his 2006 refugee application on the merits.” The applicant’s representative did not appeal against that judgment. 24. In the meantime, in early October 2006 the applicant obtained an appointment for an interview on 1 November 2006 at the Centre for Refugees in the Moscow Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. 25. On 16 October 2006 the Civic Assistance Committee requested the migration authorities to confirm the lawfulness of the applicant’s stay in Russia so that he could leave for another country that did not require a visa for Uzbek nationals. 26. The applicant was apprehended on 17 October 2006 on the premises of the Civic Assistance Committee, apparently because of his lack of a residence registration required under the Aliens Act (see paragraph 48 below). He was then taken to the Tverskoy District Office of the Federal Migration Authority. After an interview, he was brought before a judge of the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow, who found the applicant guilty of having resided in Russia in breach of the residence regulations. The judge imposed on him an administrative fine of 1,000 Russian roubles (RUB) and ordered his administrative expulsion from Russia, which is a subsidiary penalty under Article 18.8 of the Code of Administrative Offences. According to the text of the judgment, at the hearing the applicant conceded that he had been unlawfully resident in Russia and had no definite place of residence or source of income in Russia. According to the applicant, he was not allowed to contact the Civic Assistance Committee, to be represented by a lawyer retained by it or to speak during the hearing. In a separate decision given on the same date, the judge ordered the applicant’s immediate placement in the Severnyy Detention Centre no. 1 for Aliens. 27. On 18 October 2006 the FSB asked the administration of the detention centre not to deport the applicant without its consent and to coordinate with it all visits to the applicant, receipt of parcels by him or his telephone calls. 28. On 19 October 2006 the applicant’s counsel lodged a statement of appeal against the expulsion order with the Moscow City Court. A hearing was set down for 26 October 2006. 29. On 20 October 2006 the applicant issued Ms Chumakova with an authority form empowering her to institute proceedings before the European Court. 30. On 23 October 2006 the applicant requested the Court, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to prevent his expulsion to Uzbekistan. He feared immediate expulsion despite his pending appeal against the expulsion order and alleged that he would face a serious risk of ill-treatment and unfair prosecution if he were returned to Uzbekistan. 31. On 24 October 2006 the Court indicated to the Russian Government under Rule 39 that the applicant should not be expelled to Uzbekistan until further notice. The Russian Government were notified at 5.17 p.m. Strasbourg time (7.17 p.m. Moscow time) by e-transmission through the publication of the relevant letter on the secure website used for communication between the Registry of the Court and the Office of the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. 32. According to the Government, the applicant left Russia at 7.20 p.m. (Moscow time) on 24 October 2006 from Domodedovo Airport for Tashkent on board flight no. E3-265. The applicant’s representative submitted a letter dated 25 December 2006 issued by the Domodedovo Airlines Company, which read as follows: “Domodedovo Airlines cannot confirm that Mr P.T. Muminov was on board flight no. E3-265 from Domodedovo to Tashkent on 24 October 2006 since there is no boarding pass for that passenger.” As follows from a letter of 19 December 2006 from Uzbekistan Airways, Mr R. Muminov was on board flight no. HY-602 from Domodedovo to Tashkent on 24 October 2006. According to a copy of the log entries provided by the company and produced by the applicant’s representative, that flight left Moscow at 11.50 p.m. on 24 October 2006. 33. According to a report allegedly issued by the FSB on 22 October 2006, the applicant was questioned on 20 October 2006 in relation to his alleged extremist activities; “in view of his insincerity and taking into account the pressure by the human-rights organisations which attempt to present him as a victim of political repression, [the applicant] was removed from Russia”. 34. According to a press release issued by the FSB on 28 October 2006, the applicant was removed from Russia on 27 October 2006. 35. On 2 November 2006 the Moscow City Court quashed the expulsion order of 17 October 2006 and remitted the case to the District Court. The City Court found that the district judge had not specified the nature of the applicant’s allegedly unlawful conduct. The judge had not established the facts of the case, including the date of the applicant’s arrival in Russia, whether he had complied with his obligation to register at the place of his residence in Russia and when his registration had expired. Neither had the judge verified the authorities’ allegation that the applicant had been residing unlawfully in Russia since December 2005. 36. On 29 November 2006 the District Court re-examined the case and found that “the applicant had been lawfully present in the territory of Russia when he was first apprehended and remanded in custody”; he had then arrived in Moscow on 5 October 2006 in order to apply for refugee status at UNHCR’s Moscow office; he had stayed at the office of the Civic Assistance Committee until his arrest on 17 October 2006. The District Court also indicated that the applicant had appealed against the refusal to examine his application for refugee status and that a judgment had been given on 27 October 2006 and had not yet become final. The District Court concluded that the applicant had not committed the administrative offence of “breaching the residence regulations within the territory of the Russian Federation”, and discontinued the proceedings. 37. On 15 January 2007 the Dzhankurganskiy Criminal Court in Uzbekistan convicted the applicant of unlawful actions against the constitutional order and participation in the activities of a proscribed organisation, and sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment. According to the text of the judgment, “[the applicant] pleaded not guilty at the trial, denied the charges against him and fully retracted the statement he had made during the preliminary investigation while indicating that he had been compelled to sign that statement, which he had done without reading it”. With reference to statements from two witnesses and the applicant’s pre-trial statement, the trial court found that in 1999 the applicant had become a member of HT in Uzbekistan and had engaged in propaganda concerning its activities aimed at subverting the constitutional regime and creating an Islamist state. The judgment indicated that the applicant had been represented by a lawyer. The trial judgment was amenable to appeal. It is unclear whether the applicant exercised his right to appeal against it. 38. According to the applicant’s representative before the Court, the applicant had been refused permission to be represented by his privately retained counsel but legal-aid counsel had been appointed instead. Neither the applicant’s representative nor his family members had been informed of the exact place of his detention in Uzbekistan. 39. The applicant’s representative before the Court wrote to the Uzbek Prosecutor General’s Office asking for information regarding the place of the applicant’s detention and the conditions of access to him. Her request was forwarded to the prosecutor in the Surkhandaryinsk Region of Uzbekistan. On 17 January 2007 the prosecutor forwarded the request to the Surkhandaryinsk Regional Court. The applicant’s representative also wrote to the Uzbek Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No replies were received. 40. On an unspecified date, the Russian authorities sent a request concerning the applicant to the Uzbek authorities. On 6 March 2007 the Uzbek Ministry of the Interior replied and enclosed a letter in Russian from the applicant dated 20 December 2006 worded as follows: “... during my arrest and detention... the police and other law-enforcement officers did not violate my rights and did not exert any physical pressure upon me. I have no claims against the police officers in Moscow or Lipetsk or against any other law-enforcement authority in Russia. I confirm that this declaration is correct and written with my own hand.” 41. According to a linguistic expert report, produced by the applicant’s representative, the above letter did not contain any significant mistakes, whereas the applicant’s personal letters contained numerous mistakes reflecting his Uzbek mother tongue’s phonetics and grammar. The expert noted that the applicant would not have been able to acquire a sufficient command of the Russian language during the three months between the date of his sample letters (September 2006) and the letter in question (December 2006). The expert concluded that the letter of 20 December 2006 had not been written spontaneously by the applicant, who had transcribed the text from the original or written it from a letter-by-letter dictation by someone else. 42. On 28 October 2006 the Prosecutor’s Office of the Central Administrative District of Moscow initiated criminal proceedings on a complaint by the applicant’s representative about his hasty expulsion. 43. On 12 February 2007 the Moscow military prosecutor refused to bring criminal proceedings against any FSB officers in relation to the applicant’s hasty expulsion. The prosecutor stated: “... as a result of the joint operation by officials of detention centre no. 1, migration officers and FSB officers on 24 October 2006, [the applicant] was removed from Russia in breach of ... the Code of Administrative Offences... It transpires from the case file that the matter of his expulsion before the judgment ... acquired legal force was raised by the FSB before the migration authority and the administration of the detention centre... [I]t was established that the migration authority had purchased a flight ticket for [the applicant] but it had not been used ... thus, the exact time of his crossing the Russian border was not confirmed... According to Mr K., an FSB officer, Mr Muminov’s departure was delayed pending the arrival of Uzbek officials, who purchased a new ticket for him...” 44. On 20 April 2007 Mr G., Director of the Detention Centre for Aliens, was charged with abuse of power. Mr G. pleaded guilty at the trial. On 24 May 2007 the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow convicted him of abuse of power and sentenced him to a fine of RUB 35,000. It held, inter alia: “... being aware that the expulsion order in respect of Mr Muminov had not become final, Mr G. violated his defence rights and authorised the execution of the expulsion order at around 5 p.m. on 24 October 2006... As a result, Mr Muminov was put on flight no. HY-602 leaving for Tashkent... Besides, ... on 26 October 2006 the European Court of Human Rights indicated to the Russian authorities that he should not be removed from Russia. However, the Russian Federation was unable to comply with that decision as a result of Mr G.’s unlawful actions.” It appears that that judgment was not appealed against and became final. 45. No one may be subjected to torture, violence or any other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 21 § 2). The decisions and actions (or inaction) of State authorities, local self-government, non-governmental associations and public officials may be challenged in a court of law (Article 46 § 2). In conformity with the international treaties of the Russian Federation, everyone has the right to turn to inter-State organs concerned with the protection of human rights and liberties after all domestic remedies have been exhausted (Article 46 § 3). 46. Pursuant to the Agreement between the Russian and Uzbek Governments signed in Minsk on 30 November 2000, as amended in 2005, citizens of one of the two States were not required to have a visa to enter and stay in the territory of the other State (section 1). 47. Under the Law on Legal Status of Aliens in the Russian Federation (no. 115-FZ of 25 July 2002 – “the Aliens Act”), as in force at the material time, a foreign national could temporarily stay in the territory of Russia, or temporarily or permanently reside in it. A foreign national had to obtain a temporary residence authorisation (разрешение на временное проживание) in order to temporarily reside in Russia or a residence permit (вид на жительство) in order to permanently reside in Russia (sections 6 and 8, respectively). A temporary residence authorisation or a residence permit could be refused, inter alia, if an alien advocated a violent change of the constitutional foundations of the Russian Federation, otherwise created a threat to its security or citizens or supported terrorist (extremist) activities (sections 7 and 9). 48. A foreign national had to register his or her residence within three days of his or her arrival in Russia (section 20(1)). Foreign nationals had to obtain residence registration at the address where they were staying in the Russian Federation. Should their address change, such change was to be re-registered with the police within three days (section 21(3)). 49. A foreign national who breached the regulations on staying or residing in the Russian Federation, including failure to register his or her residence, was liable to an administrative fine with or without administrative expulsion from Russia (Article 18.8 of the Code of Administrative Offences). A decision on the administrative offence was enforced once it had become final (Article 31.2 § 2 of the Code). 50. Pursuant to the Instructions on deportation or administrative expulsion of an alien, adopted by the Ministry of the Interior on 26 August 2004, the authority in charge of the execution of an expulsion order which had become final was to determine the country of destination and make arrangements for the alien’s departure (point 22). 51. Under the Law on the Procedure for Entering and Leaving the Russian Federation (no. 114-FZ of 15 August 1996), as amended in 2006, a competent authority could decide that a foreign national’s presence in Russian territory was undesirable – even if it was lawful – if, for example, it created a real threat to the defence capacity or security of the State, to public order or health (section 25.10 of the Law). If such a decision was given, the foreign national had to leave Russia or else be removed from the country. The procedure for such removal was detailed in the Government’s Decree no. 199 of 7 April 2003. 52. Under the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP), the period of detention pending investigation could not exceed two months (Article 109 § 1) and could be extended by a judge up to six months (Article 109 § 2). Further extensions could only be granted if the person was charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 § 3). No extension beyond eighteen months was permissible and the detainee was to be released immediately (Article 109 § 4). 53. Upon receipt of a request for extradition not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, the Prosecutor General or his deputy was to decide on the measure of restraint in respect of the person whose extradition was sought. The measure of restraint was to be applied in accordance with the established procedure (Article 466 § 1). 54. Pursuant to the Instructions issued by the Prosecutor General on 20 June 2002, the procedure for the arrest and extension of detention of persons pending extradition was determined by international treaties to which the Russian Federation was a party. Chapter 54 of the CCrP was applicable in the parts complying with those treaties. Detainees’ release could be ordered by the Prosecutor General’s Office or by a court decision (point 2.9). 55. In a decision of 4 April 2006 the Constitutional Court held that the general provisions governing measures of restraint applied to all forms and stages of criminal proceedings, including proceedings on extradition. The Constitutional Court reiterated its settled case-law to the effect that excessive or arbitrary detention, unlimited in time and without judicial review, was not compatible with the Constitution in any circumstances, including in the context of extradition proceedings. It appears that the decision was published in July 2006. On 11 July 2006 the Constitutional Court declined jurisdiction in relation to a request by the Prosecutor General for clarification of that decision and indicated that courts of general jurisdiction were competent to decide on the procedure and time-limits which should apply for detention in extradition proceedings. 56. Chapter 16 of the CCrP laid down the procedure by which parties to criminal proceedings could challenge the acts or omissions of an inquirer, investigator, prosecutor or court (section 123). Those acts or omissions could be challenged before a prosecutor or a court. Article 125 provides for judicial review of a decision taken by inquirers, investigators, prosecutors not to initiate criminal proceedings, a decision to discontinue them or any other decision or omission which was capable of impinging upon the rights of persons involved in the proceedings (section 125). 57. The Custody Act laid down the procedure and conditions for the detention of persons who were apprehended under the CCrP on suspicion of criminal offences; it also applied to persons who were suspected or accused of criminal offences and who were remanded in custody (section 1). Persons suspected or accused of criminal offences had a right to lodge complaints with a court or another authority in relation to the lawfulness and reasonableness of their detention (section 17(1)(7)). 58. The Refugees Act (Law no. 4258-I of 19 February 1993) defines a refugee as a person who is not a Russian national and who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it (section 1(1)(1)). The migration authority may refuse to examine the application for refugee status on the merits if the person concerned has left the country of his nationality in circumstances falling outside the scope of section 1(1)(1), and does not want to return to the country of his nationality because of a fear of being held responsible for an offence (правонарушение) committed there (section 5(1)(6)). 59. Persons who have applied for or been granted refugee status cannot be returned against their will to the State of which they are a national where their life or freedom would be imperilled on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion (sections 1 and 10(1)). 60. Having received a refusal to examine an application for refugee status on the merits and having decided not to exercise the right of appeal under section 10, the person concerned must leave the territory of Russia within one month of receiving notification of the refusal if he or she has no other legal grounds for staying in Russia (section 5(5)). Under section 10(5), having received a refusal to examine the application for refugee status on the merits or a refusal of refugee status and having exercised the right of appeal against such refusals, the person concerned must leave the territory of Russia within three days of receiving notification of the decision on the appeal if he or she has no other legal grounds for staying in Russia. If, after the appeal has been rejected, the person concerned still refuses to leave the country, he or she is to be deported (section 13(2)). 61. If the person satisfies the criteria set out in section 1(1)(1), or if he or she does not satisfy such criteria but cannot be expelled or deported from Russia for humanitarian reasons, he or she may be granted temporary asylum (section 12(2)). Persons who have been granted temporary asylum cannot be returned against their will to the country of which they are a national or to the country of their former habitual residence (section 12(4)). 62. By a decision (решение) of 14 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation granted the Prosecutor General’s request and classified a number of international and regional organisations as terrorist organisations, including HT (also known as the Party of Islamist Liberation), and prohibited their activity in the territory of Russia. It held in relation to HT that it aimed to overthrow non-Islamist governments and to establish “Islamist governance on an international scale by reviving a Worldwide Islamist Caliphate”, in the first place in the regions with predominantly Muslim populations, including Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 63. Recommendation No. R (98) 13 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to Member States on the rights of rejected asylum seekers to an effective remedy against decisions on expulsion in the context of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, reads as follows: “Without prejudice to the exercise of any right of rejected asylum seekers to appeal against a negative decision on their asylum request, as recommended, among others, in Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (81) 16 of the Committee of Ministers..., 1. An effective remedy before a national authority should be provided for any asylum seeker, whose request for refugee status is rejected and who is subject to expulsion to a country about which that person presents an arguable claim that he or she would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2. In applying paragraph 1 of this recommendation, a remedy before a national authority is considered effective when:... 2.2. that authority has competence both to decide on the existence of the conditions provided for by Article 3 of the Convention and to grant appropriate relief;... 2.4. the execution of the expulsion order is suspended until a decision under 2.2 is taken.” 64. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights issued on 19 September 2001 a Recommendation (CommDH(2001)19) concerning the rights of aliens wishing to enter a Council of Europe Member State and the enforcement of expulsion orders, part of which reads as follows: “11. It is essential that the right of judicial remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the ECHR be not only guaranteed in law but also granted in practice when a person alleges that the competent authorities have contravened or are likely to contravene a right guaranteed by the ECHR. The right of effective remedy must be guaranteed to anyone wishing to challenge a refoulement or expulsion order. It must be capable of suspending enforcement of an expulsion order, at least where contravention of Articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR is alleged.” 65. For other relevant documents, see the Court’s judgment in the case of Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, §§ 36-38, ECHR 2007... 66. The Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (signed in Minsk on 22 January 1993 and amended on 28 March 1997), to which both Russia and Uzbekistan are parties, provides that an extradited person cannot be subject to criminal prosecution or punished for a criminal offence committed prior to extradition and in respect of which extradition was refused, without the consent of the extraditing State (Article 66 § 1). The extradited person cannot be surrendered to a third State without the consent of the extraditing State (Article 66 § 2). 67. In his report (E/CN.4/2003/68/Add.2) submitted in accordance with Resolution 2002/38 of the United Nations (UN) Commission on Human Rights, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, Theo van Boven, described the situation in Uzbekistan as follows: “40. According to the information received from non-governmental sources, torture is being used in virtually all cases in which articles 156, 159 and 244 CC [Criminal Code] ... are invoked, in order to extract self-incriminating confessions and to punish those who are perceived by public authorities to be involved in either religious, or political, activities contrary to State interests (socalled security crimes). These provisions, which are rather vaguely worded and whose scope of application may be subject to various interpretations, are said to have been used in numerous allegedly fabricated cases and to have led to harsh prison sentences. The four crimes that, following recent amendments, are now the only capital offences are said to lead to a death sentence only if they are combined with aggravated murder charges. Evidence gathering in such cases is said to rely exclusively on confessions extracted by illegal means. It is reported that religious leaflets as well as weapons or bullets have been planted as evidence that a person belongs to banned groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir, a transnational Islamic movement which calls for the peaceful establishment of the Caliphate in Central Asia. It is also reported that torture and ill-treatment continue to be used against inmates convicted on such charges, inter alia to force them to write repentance letters to the President of the Republic or to punish them further... 66. The combination of a lack of respect for the principle of presumption of innocence despite being guaranteed by the Constitution (art. 25) and [the Code of Criminal Procedure] (art. 23), the discretionary powers of the investigators and procurators with respect to access to detainees by legal counsel and relatives, as well as the lack of independence of the judiciary and allegedly rampant corruption in the judiciary and law enforcement agencies, are believed to be conducive to the use of illegal methods of investigation. The excessive powers in the overall criminal proceedings of procurators, who are supposed at the same time to conduct and supervise preliminary criminal investigations, to bring charges and to monitor respect for existing legal safeguards against torture during criminal investigations and in places of detention, make investigations into complaints overly dependent on their goodwill. 67. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of legal guarantees such as the right to habeas corpus and the right to prompt and confidential access to a lawyer and relatives. He further observes that pre-trial detainees are held in facilities which are under the same jurisdiction as investigators in the case... 68. The Special Rapporteur believes, on the basis of the numerous testimonies (including on a number of deaths in custody) he received during the mission, not least from those whose evident fear led them to request anonymity and who thus had nothing to gain personally from making their allegations, that torture or similar ill-treatment is systematic as defined by the Committee against Torture. Even though only a small number of torture cases can be proved with absolute certainty, the copious testimonies gathered are so consistent in their description of torture techniques and the places and circumstances in which torture is perpetrated that the pervasive and persistent nature of torture throughout the investigative process cannot be denied. The Special Rapporteur also observes that torture and other forms of ill-treatment appear to be used indiscriminately against persons charged for activities qualified as serious crimes such as acts against State interests, as well as petty criminals and others.” 68. In March 2005 the UN Human Rights Committee considered the second periodic report of Uzbekistan under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and adopted the following observations (CCPR/CO/83/UZB): “10. The Committee is concerned about the continuing high number of convictions based on confessions made in pre-trial detention that were allegedly obtained by methods incompatible with article 7 of the Covenant. It also notes that, while on 24 September 2004 the Plenum of the Supreme Court held that no information obtained from a detained individual in violation of the criminal procedure requirements (including in the absence of a lawyer) may be used as evidence in court, this requirement is not reflected in a law... 11. The Committee is concerned about allegations relating to widespread use of torture and illtreatment of detainees and the low number of officials who have been charged, prosecuted and convicted for such acts. It is a matter of further concern that no independent inquiries are conducted in police stations and other places of detention to guarantee that no torture or illtreatment takes place, apart from a small number of inquiries with external participation quoted by the delegation... 15. The Committee notes that while under domestic law individuals have access to a lawyer at the time of arrest, this right is often not respected in practice... 16. The Committee remains concerned that the judiciary is not fully independent and that the appointment of judges has to be reviewed by the executive branch every five years...” The applicant also referred to the 2001 report (CCPR/CO/71/UZB, § 14) by the UN Human Rights Committee and the 2002 report (CAT/C/CR/28/7, § 5 (e)) by the UN Committee against Torture. 69. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, stated at the Session of the UN Human Rights Council on 20 September 2006: “The practice of torture in Uzbekistan is systematic, as indicated in the report of my predecessor Theo van Boven’s visit to the country in 2002. Lending support to this finding, my mandate continues to receive serious allegations of torture by Uzbek law enforcement officials... Against such significant, serious and credible evidence of systematic torture by law enforcement officials in Uzbekistan, I continue to find myself appealing to Governments to refrain from transferring persons to Uzbekistan...” 70. In his 2006 report “Situation of human rights in Uzbekistan” (A/61/526) the UN Secretary General expressed his concern about the fate of individuals extradited or expelled to Uzbekistan: “20. UNHCR continues to be concerned about the fate of an increasing number of Uzbek asylum-seekers and refugees, some of whom fled the Andijan events, who have been detained in countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and forcibly returned to Uzbekistan despite a real risk of mistreatment in breach of international standards. In February 2006, 11 Uzbek asylum-seekers were forcefully returned from Ukraine to Uzbekistan. In a press statement of 16 February 2006, UNHCR said that it was appalled by this forceful deportation. Thus far, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not had access to the 11 individuals... According to information received by OHCHR, no access has been granted to these individuals since their return to Uzbekistan. 21. OHCHR is concerned about other individuals who have fled since the Andijan events and who are under pressure from the Government of Uzbekistan or the host country to return despite a real risk of mistreatment in breach of international standards... 46. In an interview of 10 April 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture said that ‘there is ample evidence that both police and other security forces have been and are continuing to systematically practise torture, in particular against dissidents or people who are opponents of the regime’... 48. The Human Rights Committee, in its concluding observations of 31 March 2005 (CCPR/OP/83/UZB), remained concerned about the high number of convictions based on confessions made in pre-trial detention that were allegedly obtained by methods incompatible with article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee expressed concern at the definition of torture in the Criminal Code of Uzbekistan. In addition, the Committee pointed to the allegations relating to widespread use of torture and ill-treatment of detainees and the low number of officials who have been charged, prosecuted and convicted for such acts. The Government of Uzbekistan was due to submit follow-up information by 26 April 2006 on these issues in accordance with the request of the Committee. So far, no such information has been submitted to the Human Rights Committee.” 71. In November 2007 the UN Committee against Torture considered the third periodic report of Uzbekistan (CAT/C/UZB/3) and adopted, inter alia, the following conclusions (CAT/C/UZB/CO/3): “6. The Committee is concerned about: (a) Numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations concerning routine use of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment committed by law enforcement and investigative officials or with their instigation or consent, often to extract confessions or information to be used in criminal proceedings; (b) Credible reports that such acts commonly occur before formal charges are made, and during pre-trial detention, when the detainee is deprived of fundamental safeguards, in particular access to legal counsel. This situation is exacerbated by the reported use of internal regulations which in practice permit procedures contrary to published laws; (c) The failure to conduct prompt and impartial investigations into such allegations of breaches of the Convention;... 9. The Committee has also received credible reports that some persons who sought refuge abroad and were returned to the country have been kept in detention in unknown places and possibly subjected to breaches of the Convention... 11. [T]he Committee remains concerned that despite the reported improvements, there are numerous reports of abuses in custody and many deaths, some of which are alleged to have followed torture or ill-treatment...” 72. In support of his allegation of the risk of ill-treatment in Uzbekistan, the applicant also submitted a copy of the third-party submissions by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the AIRE Centre in the cases of Ismoilov and Others v. Russia (no. 2947/06, judgment of 24 April 2008) and in Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey ([GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, ECHR 2005I); the 2005 report by the Memorial Human Rights Centre in cooperation with the International League for Human Rights in relation to the Second Periodic Report of Uzbekistan to the UN Human Rights Committee; the 2005 HRW Briefing Paper “Torture Reform Assessment: Uzbekistan’s Implementation of the Recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on Torture” and other documents from that organisation; and various news items available on Internet sites such as www.centrasia.ru. The above documents described a disquieting human-rights situation in Uzbekistan with reference to diverse examples and indicated a lack of ascertainable progress in this field. 73. In a comprehensive 2004 report entitled “Creating Enemies of the State: Religious Persecution in Uzbekistan”, Human Rights Watch provides the following analysis (internal footnotes omitted): “Members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, like Muslims labeled ‘Wahhabi’ by the state, are overwhelmingly self-defined Hanafi Sunnis, as are most Muslims in Uzbekistan, and not adherents of Wahabbism as it is understood in the Saudi Arabian context... Hizb ut-Tahrir members form a distinct segment of the independent Muslim population by virtue of their affiliation with a separate and defined Islamic group with its own principles, structure, activities, and religious texts. Hizb ut-Tahrir is an international Islamic organization with branches in many parts of the world, including the Middle East and Europe. Hizb ut-Tahrir propagates a particular vision of an Islamic state. Its aims are restoration of the Caliphate, or Islamic rule, in Central Asia and other traditionally Muslim lands, and the practice of Islamic piety, as the group interprets it... Hizb ut-Tahrir renounces violence as a means to achieve reestablishment of the Caliphate. However, it does not reject the use of violence during armed conflicts already under way and in which the group regards Muslims as struggling against oppressors, such as Palestinian violence against Israeli occupation. Its literature denounces secularism and Western-style democracy. Its anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements have led the government of Germany to ban it. The government of Russia has also banned the group, classifying it as a terrorist organization. Some in the diplomatic community, in particular the U.S. government, consider Hizb ut-Tahrir to be a political organization and therefore argue that imprisoned Hizb ut-Tahrir members are not victims of religious persecution. But religion and politics are inseparable in Hizb ut-Tahrir’s ideology and activities, and one of the chief reasons Uzbek authorities arrest members is the religious ideas Hizb ut-Tahrir promotes: the reestablishment of the Caliphate and strict observance of the Koran. Even if one accepts that there is a political component to Hizb ut-Tahrir’s ideology, methods, and goals, this does not vitiate the right of that group’s members to be protected from religion-based persecution. Hizb ut-Tahrir in Uzbekistan Hizb ut-Tahrir is not registered in Uzbekistan and is therefore illegal. It is referred to as a ‘banned’ organization, though in contrast to the means used by German authorities to ban Hizb ut-Tahrir, no single Uzbek administrative or judicial decision has ever prohibited the organization. Members meet in small groups of about five people, referred to as ‘study groups’ by members and as ‘secret cells’ by Uzbek government officials. Both sides acknowledge that the primary activity of these small groups is the teaching and study of Hizb ut-Tahrir literature, as well as traditional Islamic texts such as the Koran and hadith. Membership in the group is solidified by taking an oath, the content of which has been given variously as: being faithful to Islam; being faithful to Hizb ut-Tahrir and its rules; and spreading the words of the Prophet and sharing one’s knowledge of Islam with others. Law enforcement and judicial authorities generally considered both those who had and had not taken the oath as full-fledged members. In Human Rights Watch interviews and in court testimony, Hizb ut-Tahrir members have overwhelmingly cited an interest in acquiring deeper knowledge of the tenets of Islam as their motivation for joining the group. Hizb ut-Tahrir members in Uzbekistan, and likely elsewhere, regard the reemergence of the Caliphate as a practical goal, to be achieved through proselytism. Members in Uzbekistan distribute literature or leaflets produced by the organization which include quotations from the Koran, calls for observance of the basic tenets of Islam, and analysis of world events affecting Muslims, including denunciation of the mass arrest of independent Muslims in Uzbekistan... Human Rights Watch has documented 812 cases of arrest and conviction of the group’s members in Uzbekistan. The group itself estimated in June 2000 that police had arrested some 4,000 of its members in Uzbekistan during the government’s campaign against independent Islam since 1998. By November 2002 the German section of Hizb ut-Tahrir estimated that the government of Uzbekistan had imprisoned as many as 10,000 of the group’s followers. The Russian rights group Memorial reported 2,297 religiously and politically motivated arrests it had documented as of August 2001; the group estimated that more than half of the Muslims arrested for nonviolent crimes were those accused of Hizb ut-Tahrir membership. In addition to being arrested for membership and gathering to study, adherents of Hizb ut-Tahrir have been arrested, sometimes en masse, for possession or distribution of the group’s literature or, in some cases, because of simple, accidental proximity to those proselytizing for Hizb ut-Tahrir... Torture and Mistreatment in Pre-trial Detention Widespread torture of detainees is common in criminal investigations in Uzbekistan. In the campaign against independent Islam, police have systematically employed torture to coerce confessions and statements incriminating others. In the past two years, the international community has taken notice of the pervasive and serious nature of torture in Uzbekistan and its use in the campaign against independent Islam... ... Police and security agents torture independent Muslim suspects during the investigative phase to compel confessions or testimony against others. The interrogation of an independent Muslim generally centers on questions about the detainee’s beliefs, affiliation with Islamic groups, or association with well-known independent imams. The end product the police are seeking is a statement – prepared by police, signed by the detainee – that describes the detainee’s religious belief, practice, and affiliation rather than a criminal act. Because many of those detained on religion-related charges are held incommunicado, the interrogation may last up to six months. Through torture and threats – on which we present details below – agents have coerced detainees to name members of religious organizations, people who have attended mosque with them, or even friends and neighbors who may not in fact have shared their religious beliefs or affiliation. They also have forced detainees to admit to associations with individuals unknown to them. Police then arrested those named, or brought them in as witnesses, often coercing them into testifying for the prosecution. This coercive strategy produces a perpetual flow of names for the police and security services to pursue. Police sometimes arrest a suspect and torture individuals unknown to him into testifying against him...” The report summarises a number of cases of torture documented by Human Rights Watch, describing methods of torture used against Muslim detainees, including beatings by fist and with truncheons or metal rods, rape and sexual violence, electric shock, use of lit cigarettes or newspapers to burn the detainee, and asphyxiation with plastic bags or gas masks. The report also seeks to reveal the role torture plays in coercing testimony; judicial refusal to investigate victims’ allegations; and the courts’ practice of admitting as evidence testimony obtained under torture. The report also indicates that although Uzbek law provides for access to legal counsel from the moment of arrest, the investigating police frequently pressure detainees not to seek counsel. When detainees or their families attempt to engage an independent defence lawyer, authorities often refuse requests from the lawyer for access to his or her client, until the police have secured a confession from the accused. Police frequently pressure detainees or their families to accept the services of State-appointed lawyers who do not defend their client’s interests, and who are unlikely to lodge complaints against ill-treatment. Judges have ignored defendants’ court testimony about the torture they endured and have admitted as evidence confessions and other testimony obtained through torture during the investigation. 74. The 2005 US Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practice, released on 8 March 2006, provides the following information in relation to Uzbekistan: “Although the law prohibits such practices, police and the NSS [National Security Service] routinely tortured, beat, and otherwise mistreated detainees to obtain confessions or incriminating information... Defendants in trials often claimed that their confessions, on which the prosecution based its cases, were extracted as a result of torture... During the year the government took a few steps towards reform confined to education and outreach, while in large part it showed little will to address UN conclusions... Authorities treated individuals suspected of extreme Islamist political sympathies, particularly alleged members of HT [Hizb ut-Tahrir], more harshly than ordinary criminals. There were credible reports that investigators subjected pretrial detainees suspected to be HT members to particularly severe interrogation. After trial, authorities reportedly used disciplinary and punitive measures, including torture, more often with prisoners convicted of extremism than with ordinary inmates. Local human rights workers reported that common criminals were often paid or otherwise induced by authorities to beat HT members. As in previous years there were numerous credible reports that officials in several prisons abused HT members to obtain letters of repentance, which are required for a prisoner to be eligible for amnesty. According to prisoners’ relatives, amnestied prisoners, and human rights activists, inmates who refused to write letters disavowing their connection to HT were often beaten or sent into solitary confinement. During the year inmates and a guard at one prison corroborated reports that prison guards systematically beat suspected HT members following the March and April 2004 terrorist attacks... Authorities continued to arbitrarily arrest persons on charges of extremist sentiments or activities, or association with banned religious groups... Authorities made little distinction between actual members and those with marginal affiliation with the group, such as persons who had attended Koranic study sessions with the group. As in previous years, there were reports that authorities arrested and prosecuted persons based on the possession of HT literature. Coerced confessions and testimony were commonplace. Even persons generally known to belong to HT stated that the cases against them were built not on actual evidence, which would have been abundantly available, but on planted material or false testimony... Defense attorneys had limited access in some cases to government-held evidence relevant to their clients’ cases. However, in most cases a prosecution was based solely upon defendants’ confessions or incriminating testimony from state witnesses... During the year the BBC quoted a former Interior Ministry official who claimed that investigators often used beatings, psychotropic drugs, or threats against family members to obtain confessions from defendants...In many cases, particularly those involving suspected HT members, when the prosecution failed to produce confessions it relied solely on witness testimony, which was reportedly often also coerced...” 75. The Uzbek Criminal Code states that the Uzbek criminal law is based on the Constitution and recognised principles of international law such as the principle of legality, equality of citizens before the law, humanism and fairness (Articles 1 and 3). 76. Article 159 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, entitled “Attacks against the constitutional order of the Republic of Uzbekistan”, refers to public calls for unconstitutional change of the existing State structure, for the seizure of power or removal from power of legally elected or designated authorities or for the unconstitutional violation of the unity of the territory of the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as the dissemination of materials having such content. Such acts are punishable by a fine or up to three years’ imprisonment. When committed by an organised group or in its interest, they are punishable by up to ten years’ imprisonment (§ 3 (b)). Article 216 of the Code, entitled “Establishing Proscribed Non-governmental and Religious Organisations”, refers to establishing or resuming the activities of proscribed non-governmental and religious organisations, as well as active participation in their activities. Such acts are punishable by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years. Article 244-1 of the Code, entitled “Preparation or dissemination of materials constituting a threat to public safety and public order”, refers to the preparation or dissemination of materials expressing the ideology of religious extremism, separatism or fundamentalism, incitement to riot or the forced eviction of citizens or materials intended to cause public panic, after an official warning. Such acts are punishable by a fine or a term of imprisonment up to three years. Article 244-2 of the Code, entitled “Establishing, leading or participating in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organisations”, refers to the offence of establishing, leading or participating in religious extremist, separatist, fundamentalist or other prohibited organisations. Such acts are punishable by a term of imprisonment of up to fifteen years and, if they cause serious damage, up to twenty years. 77. The Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure states that the administration of justice is based on the principles of equality of citizens before the law and the courts, irrespective of their gender, race, nationality, language, religion, social origin, beliefs or personal or social status (Article 16). Judges, prosecutors and investigators must respect the reputation and honour of persons participating in the proceedings (Article 17). No one may be subjected to torture, violence and other forms of cruel or degrading treatment. Actions or decisions which are degrading, lead to the dissemination of a person’s private information, damage his or her health, or unjustifiably cause physical or moral suffering are prohibited. State authorities and public officers in charge of criminal proceedings must protect the rights and freedoms of the persons participating in those proceedings (Article 18). No one may be arrested or detained unless ordered by a court or prosecutor. A court or prosecutor must promptly release each person who is unlawfully detained beyond the time-limit authorised by the law or a court decision. A person’s private life, inviolability of his or her home, correspondence and telephone conversations are protected by the law. Damage caused to the person as a result of a violation of his or her rights or freedoms in the course of criminal proceedings must be compensated for in compliance with the provisions of the Code.","['13', '3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4']",[],['34'],[],[],1

The applicant company is owned by Mr Smail Smailagić who lived in Banja Luka, which is situated on the territory of the present day Republika Srpska, a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, until 15 May 1992 when he fled to Croatia and went to live in Porat-Červar. 9. On 13 August 1992 the Croatian Military Police requisitioned a vehicle belonging to the applicant company. 10. According to the Government the vehicle had been requisitioned by the military authorities from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Upon the request by the military authorities from Bosnia and Herzegovina for the return of vehicles which had been requisitioned in Bosnia and Herzegovina for military purposes, in case that they were located in Croatia, the Croatian Ministry of Defence conferred the applicant company's vehicle after having found it. The vehicle was conferred to the Bosnian authorities on 19 August 1993 and has ever since been in their possession. 11. According to the applicant the vehicle was requisitioned by the Croatian authorities and conferred to the Croatian para-military forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the so-called Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane). The applicant company repeatedly requested the Croatian Defence Council to return the vehicle, but to no avail. 12. On 11 October 1993 the applicant company filed a civil claim for damages in the amount of 15,600 German Marks (DEM) against the Republic of Croatia, with the Zagreb County Commercial Court (Okružni privredni sud u Zagrebu). It appears that the case was subsequently transferred to the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu). 13. On 15 May 1995 the Republic of Croatia filed its reply denying the plaintiff's claim. It requested the court to stay the proceedings until the end of war in Croatia. It stated further that the vehicle had been requisitioned only temporarily for needs of the army and would be returned to the applicant company after the war. 14. At the hearing on 14 September 1995 the applicant company specified the claim for damages seeking 58,000 Croatian Kunas (HRK). 15. On 12 March 1998 the applicant company requested the Ministry of Justice to speed up the proceedings. 16. On 13 July 1998 the court decided that an expertise be carried out in order to establish the value of the vehicle in question. The applicant company was invited to pay an advance for the costs of the expertise. 17. On 31 August 1998 the case-file was assigned to an expert who submitted his opinion on 5 October 1998. 18. It appears that the defendant asked the court to stay the proceedings claiming that it was uncertain whether the applicant company still existed because the excerpt from the Banja Luka Court registry on the applicant company's legal status was quite old. 19. On 4 May 1999 the court invited the company's representative to submit a new excerpt from the relevant registry. 20. The applicant company's legal representative informed the court that he no longer represented the applicant. 21. On 5 July 1999 the applicant company requested the court to schedule a hearing. 22. On 19 July 1999 the applicant company's representative submitted an uncertified excerpt from the Banja Luka Court's registry dating from 1990. 23. On 25 August 1999 the court invited the applicant to submit a new excerpt, not older than six months, showing that Mr Smailagić was entitled to represent the applicant company. 24. On 6 November 1999 Parliament introduced a change of the Civil Obligations Act which provided that all proceedings concerning actions for damages resulting from acts of members of the Croatian army or police when acting in their official capacity during the war in Croatia were to be stayed. 25. On 10 December 1999 the court stayed the proceedings pursuant to the above change in law. 26. On 29 December 1999 the applicant company appealed against the above decision claiming that the Zagreb Municipal Court erred in its application of the law as the vehicle in question was not taken by any member of the Croatian army or police acting in an official capacity but exclusively for the needs of the Croatian Defence Council, a military formation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, operating in that country. 27. It appears that on 15 November 2000 a party in some other proceedings concerning the same matter filed a constitutional claim challenging the above legislation. However, the Constitutional Court has not yet adopted any decision. 28. On 8 May 2001 the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) upheld the Zagreb Municipal Court decision of 10 December 1999. 29. On 16 June 2001 the applicant company filed a request for revision with the Zagreb Municipal Court, repeating its arguments from the earlier appeal. On 28 June 2001 the Zagreb Municipal Court rejected the above request as inadmissible. It found that the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku) allows a party to file a request for revision only against a final decision of an appellate court while the decision of the Zagreb County Court did not represent a final decision in that case. 30. On 21 July 2001 the applicant company appealed against the Municipal Court's decision. 31. On 2 October the Zagreb County Court dismissed the appeal. 32. Section 184 (a) of the 1999 Act on Changes of the Civil Obligations Act (Zakon o dopunama Zakonu o obveznim odnosima, Official Gazette no. 112/1999) provides that all proceedings instituted against the Republic of Croatia for damages caused by the members of the Croatian army or police when acting in their official capacity during the Homeland War in Croatia from 7 August 1990 to 30 June 1996 are to be stayed. 33. The Act also imposed an obligation on the Government to submit to Parliament special legislation, regulating the responsibility for such damages, at the latest within six months from the entry into force of the present Act. So far no new legislation has been introduced.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Yevpatoriya. 6. On 25 February 2004 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of drug dealing. On the same date a sachet of poppy straw was seized from his pocket. 7. On the same date the applicant complained to the Yevpatoriya Prosecutors’ Office that he had been ill-treated during his arrest, in particular that he had been handcuffed, beaten and blinded with a dark knitted hat and that he had suffered abrasions on his hands, face and back as a result of having been ill-treated. 8. On 16 March 2004 the Prosecutors’ Office refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant’s complaints, having found no appearance of criminal conduct on the part of the police officers. 9. On 13 April 2004 the Prosecutors’ Office of the ARC revoked this decision and ordered a further inquiry. Having examined available evidence and questioned witnesses, on 15 May 2004 the Yevpatoriya Prosecutors’ Office again refused to institute criminal proceedings for want of evidence of any ill-treatment. Based on the available materials, the applicant did not appeal against this decision. 10. On an unspecified date the applicant also complained to the Yevpatoriya Court that his detention had been unlawful. On 24 March 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court dismissed this complaint, attaching weight to the fact that on 27 February 2004 the lawfulness of the applicant’s detention was verified by a judge within the statutory seventy-two-hour time-limit. On 18 May 2004 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea upheld this decision. 11. On 25 February 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of drug dealing and following his arrest he was detained in a police station. 12. On 27 February 2004 the applicant was brought before the Yevpatoriya Court, which allowed the investigator’s request to continue his detention for ten days pending a determination of whether he should be charged. The court referred to the fact that the applicant was suspected of having committed a serious offence and that a sachet of poppy straw had been found on him. 13. On 3 March 2004 the applicant was indicted for drug dealing. 14. On 5 March 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court decided, in the applicant’s presence, that he should be remanded in custody for two months pending the outcome of the pre-trial investigation. By way of reasoning, the court cited Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and noted that the applicant might abscond, as he had been charged with a serious offence, and also that he might tamper with evidence. Moreover, the court noted that the applicant was alleged to have committed the offence while he had been subject to an undertaking not to abscond in connection with an investigation for another unspecified offence, which, at the material time, had been pending since 2001. 15. On the same date the applicant, represented by two lawyers, appealed. He maintained, in particular, that he was a former policeman with a clean record and that he had never previously been convicted. Furthermore, he stated that he lived permanently in Yevpatoriya, had a child, and suffered from chronic health conditions, in particular pyelonephritis. The applicant acknowledged that at the material time he had been subject to an undertaking not to abscond in connection with a different criminal investigation, but noted that he had never breached that undertaking since it had been put in place in 2001. On an unspecified date the Court of Appeal of the Crimea held a hearing and dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The applicant did not inform the Court whether he had been present at that hearing. 16. On 22 April 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court, having held a hearing in the applicant’s presence, allowed the investigator’s request to extend the applicant’s detention until 25 May 2004. By way of reasoning, the court noted that the prosecution objectively needed more time to complete the investigation. The court further rejected the applicant’s mother’s proposal to pledge her apartment as bail for the applicant’s release, referring to a risk that the applicant would reoffend given his previous conduct. Referring to a medical certificate, the court also dismissed the applicant’s allegations that his state of health was incompatible with his continued detention. 17. The applicant appealed, requesting that he be transported to the Court of Appeal for the hearing. He maintained that the case was not complex and that the failure of the investigative authorities to complete the investigation was only on account of a lack of diligence on their part. On 1 June 2004 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea considered the matter in the presence of the applicant’s advocate, but in the absence of the applicant himself, and upheld the previous decision. 18. In the meantime, on 24 May 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court, having held a hearing in the applicant’s presence, extended his detention until 15 June 2004 on essentially the same grounds as before. It additionally noted that the investigation had not been completed on account of the applicant’s own lack of cooperation. In particular, he had not agreed to confrontations taking place, his lawyer had been engaged in other activities on 14 May, and on 17 May he had also been examined by medical specialists. The applicant raised essentially the same arguments as stated above, and the court rejected them, referring to essentially the same reasons as it had previously. On 8 June 2004 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea upheld the decision of 24 May 2004. The applicant did not inform the Court whether he had been present at this hearing. 19. On 10 June 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court, having held a hearing concerning the extension of the applicant’s detention in his presence, authorised the extension until 25 June 2004 based on the necessity to carry out additional investigative activities, in particular to consider a request by the applicant’s lawyer to conduct another expert assessment. The applicant appealed, raising essentially the same arguments as before, and noting that since the investigation had almost been completed there was no risk that he would tamper with evidence or otherwise interfere with its effectiveness. On 6 July 2004 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea upheld the decision of 10 June 2004. The applicant did not inform the Court whether he had been present at this hearing. 20. In the meantime, on 17 June 2004 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea considered, as a court of first instance, the investigator’s request for an extension of the applicant’s detention and authorised the extension until 25 July 2004. It found that the situation remained unchanged from the time of the previous review, that the applicant’s detention was necessary to finish up the investigative activities, and that there was no reason to release the applicant. At the hearing the applicant himself was absent, but was represented by his advocate. 21. On 23 July 2004 the case was transferred to the Saky inter-regional prosecutor for approval of the indictment. By 28 July 2004 the case had been remitted to the Yevpatoriya Court for the commencement of trial proceedings. The applicant remained in custody, no new decision extending it having been taken. 22. On 31 August 2004 the Yevpatoriya Court held a preliminary hearing and found that the case was ready for trial. The court ordered that the applicant remain in detention, without specifying any reasons. 23. Between 1 September 2004 and 1 July 2005 the Yevpatoriya Court considered the applicant’s requests for his detention pending trial to be lifted on some fourteen occasions, in each case doing so on the same date as the request was lodged. The court dismissed all of these requests as unsubstantiated. 24. On 1 July 2005 the applicant was found guilty of drug dealing and abuse of office and sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. On 20 December 2005 and 17 March 2007 the Court of Appeal of the Crimea and the Supreme Court, respectively, dismissed the applicant’s appeals. The applicant did not present copies of the court decisions taken on the merits of his criminal case. 25. Between February and August 2004 the applicant was alternately held in the Yevpatoriya Temporary Detention Centre (the “IVS”) and two other facilities. 26. According to the applicant, the cell in which he was most often held in the Yevpatoriya IVS (cell no. 12) had measured about four square metres and had been shared by him with one to three other inmates. The cell had had no window. Sometimes a ventilator had been switched on, but the air it brought had come from other cells, including two cells where detainees who were sick with tuberculosis had been held. An electric light had been switched on all the time, interfering with detainees’ ability to sleep. On the other hand, this light had been so dim that it had not been possible to read. The cell had had no furniture. Detainees had taken turns to sleep on two bare mattresses and had put their food and personal belongings on the floor near them. The toilet had not been separated from the living area, and detainees had lacked privacy when using it. There had not been a sink and a tap had been situated some forty centimetres above the toilet. The water from the tap had been used for drinking, washing and flushing the toilet. The food had been very poor. Specifically, detainees had been given a piece of bread with tea for breakfast and dinner, and a bowl of soup and a plate of porridge for lunch. The cell had been infested with insects. Between 10 and 13 March 2004 the applicant had been detained in cell no. 3, where seven detainees had taken turns to sleep on two bunk beds. Detainees had not been taken out for exercise and had not been able to take a shower. On numerous occasions the applicant had asked to see a doctor, but his requests had been refused on account of a lack of funds. 27. The Government acknowledged that cell no. 12 had not had a window or beds. They noted, however, that it had had wooden planks on which the detainees could sleep, a toilet and ventilation. They further noted that cell no. 3 had been equipped with four bunk beds. The Government further submitted that the applicant had not been able to take a shower between 1 and 18 March 2004 and between 20 April and 21 May 2004 in view of his medical condition. For the same reason he had not always been taken outside for walks. The Government additionally noted that the applicant had been given sufficient access to medical services and that during the period at issue he had been visited by a doctor at least twelve times. 28. On 18 March 2004 the applicant was diagnosed with pneumonia and placed on in-patient treatment in the Simferopol SIZO hospital for a period of about one month. Upon his return to the IVS, on 15 and 17 May 2004 respectively the applicant was examined by doctors, diagnosed with chronic prostatitis and scabies and prescribed an unspecified treatment. 29. On 4 June 2004 the applicant was found to need in-patient treatment for scabies, as the previous doctors’ recommendations had not been followed. 30. On 8 June 2004 the applicant was hospitalised in the Saky hospital and was treated until 24 June 2004. According to the applicant, in the hospital he had stayed in a room with barred windows located on the fifth floor which had been guarded by two policemen, and he had been handcuffed to his bed at all times. He presented a photo of himself being handcuffed to a bed in support of his allegations. 31. On 17 June 2004 the Head of the Yevpatoriya Police Department conducted an internal investigation following the applicant’s complaints about the conditions of his detention. He noted, in particular, that as of the date of his placement in the Yevpatoriya IVS (25 February 2004), the IVS had been overpopulated by more than half of its capacity. He further noted that cell no. 12, in which the applicant had been held at that time, had not been equipped with beds but had had wooden planks and a shelf for personal belongings, that the detainees had been provided with mattresses and linen, that the cell had been well ventilated, and that it had offered sufficient artificial light. He further noted that during the period of his stay in the IVS the applicant had twice taken a shower. 32. According to the applicant, between February and July 2004 he lost forty kilograms in weight altogether. 33. On 1 June 2009 the applicant lodged a civil action with the Yevpatoriya Court complaining about the conditions of his detention in the Yevpatoriya IVS and seeking moral damages. 34. On 3 June 2009 the applicant was given a time-limit to rectify the procedural shortcomings of his submissions, in particular, to present evidence in support of his allegations, grounds for releasing him from the need to present such evidence, to specify, what were the unlawful actions or omissions of the State authorities causing him damage and to present his calculations for the amount of damage claimed. 35. On 11 June 2009 the court decided to leave the applicant’s claim without consideration on the basis that he had not rectified the procedural shortcomings of his submissions. 36. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of Ukraine can be found in the judgment in the case of Svershov v. Ukraine, no. 35231/02, § 39, 27 November 2008. 37. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine of 1960 can be found in the judgments in the cases of Molodorych v.

The applicant was born in 1947 and lives in Ljubljana. 6. On 6 January 1992 the applicant and her then husband F.B., who had decided to get divorced, entered into an agreement on the partition of their joint property. The agreement stipulated, inter alia, that F.B. would transfer to her, within one year, the ownership of premises on Zaloška Street, unless they agreed on a different location. The agreement further stipulated that if the stated obligations were not fulfilled, the applicant could terminate the agreement and claim a share of the joint property in accordance with the relevant domestic law. On 24 April 1992 the applicant and F.B. divorced. 7. Subsequently, F.B. did not transfer the ownership of premises on Zaloška Street to the applicant. However, on 24 September 1992 the applicant accepted the keys of certain premises on Trubarjeva Street. After F.B. had bought the latter premises, on 6 November 1992, he offered the applicant the possibility of signing a supplement to the agreement. According to the supplement, the applicant would receive forty per cent of the premises on Trubarjeva Street as a form of alternative performance of the relevant part of the agreement. The applicant refused to sign the supplement to the agreement. 8. On 3 May 1993 she instituted proceedings in the Ljubljana Basic Court (Temeljno sodišče v Ljublani) seeking termination of the agreement and partition of the joint property. 9. On 16 November 1993 F.B. died and his heirs, J.B.J, B.E.B. and M.B., took over his capacity in the proceedings. 10. On 9 November 1995 the court issued a partial judgment terminating the relevant agreement and rejecting the counter-claim lodged by J.B.J, B.E.B. and M.B (“the heirs”). 11. On 11 April 1996 the Ljubljana Higher Court (Višje sodišče v Ljubljani) quashed the first-instance court’s judgment and remitted the case for re-examination. The applicant then challenged that decision in an appeal on points of law, but that was rejected by the Supreme Court on 22 May 1997. 12. In the re-examination proceedings, on 14 September 1998, the (renamed) Ljubljana District Court (Okrožno sodišče v Ljubljani) issued a new judgment rejecting the applicant’s claim. The court considered that the relevant agreement was not a “fixed contract” (fiksna pogodba) which could be terminated without allowing additional time for its performance. Moreover, from F.B.’s conduct it had not been apparent that he was not going to honour his obligation. The applicant should therefore have offered an additional time-limit to F.B. In addition, the court found that F.B. had in large part fulfilled his obligations and that the applicant, by accepting the keys to the premises on Trubarjeva Street, had agreed to an alternative performance of the agreement. 13. On 31 March 1999 the Ljubljana Higher Court upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. It, however, amended certain parts concerning the payment of costs and expenses. 14. On 13 May 1999 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Vrhovno sodišče). She supplemented the appeal on 25 May 1999. 15. On 19 April 2000 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s appeal to the extent that it concerned the application of law by the lower courts, but dismissed the remainder. The Supreme Court considered that the interpretation of the relevant agreement concerned the application of the law. It then concluded that F.B. had not fulfilled his obligations by offering the applicant only a share of the premises on Trubarjeva Street. In addition, the applicant had not consented to the alternative performance nor had F.B. showed an intention to fulfil his obligations. The Supreme Court consequently varied the lower courts’ judgments and terminated the relevant agreement. As far as the partition of the joint property was concerned, the Supreme Court remitted the case to the first-instance court. 16. Two of the heirs (J.B.J. and B.E.B.) lodged a constitutional appeal complaining, inter alia, of the arbitrariness of the Supreme Court’s judgment and of a breach of the provision guaranteeing equal protection of rights (Article 22 of the Constitution). On 30 January 2001 the Constitutional Court (Ustavno sodišče) accepted the appeal for consideration, which is equivalent to declaring it admissible. On 10 May 2001 it upheld the appeal by five votes to three, quashed the Supreme Court’s judgment and remitted the case to the Supreme Court for re-examination (decision no. Up-232/00). It would appear that the applicant was informed of that decision (see paragraph 22 below), but there is no document in the case file certifying as to when. 17. The Constitutional Court found that the Supreme Court’s decision was based on the interpretation of the parties’ motivation and of the content of the agreement. In its view, such interpretation constituted an interference with the facts established by the lower courts. However, according to the domestic legislation, the Supreme Court, when deciding on an appeal on points of law, had jurisdiction only for the determination of legal issues. The Constitutional Court found that the Supreme Court’s decision was obviously erroneous and therefore arbitrary. This, and the fact that the Supreme Court had exceeded its jurisdiction, represented an interference with the appellants’ right to equal protection of rights. 18. In the re-examination proceedings, the Supreme Court, on 17 December 2001, again varied the lower courts’ judgments by terminating the relevant agreement and remitting the case to the first-instance court to determine the partition of the joint property. 19. After accepting for consideration the relevant part of the heirs’ further constitutional appeal on 17 June 2002, the Constitutional Court, on 12 December 2002, quashed the Supreme Court’s judgment, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law and upheld the Ljubljana Higher Court’s judgment of 31 March 1999. The decision was adopted by six votes to two (decision no. Up-140/02). 20. The Constitutional Court found that the Supreme Court had again dealt with questions of fact – a matter over which it had no jurisdiction; that it had failed to provide reasons for its decision, which was different from previous decisions adopted in other cases concerning the same issue; and that it had disregarded the instructions given by the Constitutional Court. The latter therefore again found a violation of the right to equal protection of rights. Using the special power afforded in section 60 of the Constitutional Court Act and because of the already lengthy duration of the proceedings, the Constitutional Court, in order to secure effective judicial protection, decided on the merits of the case itself and upheld the Higher Court’s judgment of 31 March 1999. 21. The Constitutional Court’s decisions of 10 May 2001 and 12 December 2002 noted, under paragraph 3, as follows: “in accordance with the provisions of sections 6 and 56 of the Constitutional Court Act, the Constitutional Court served the constitutional appeal on the Supreme Court, on the opposite party (plaintiff) to the proceedings [the applicant] and on the third defendant in the proceedings. None of them replied to the constitutional appeal.” 22. According to the applicant, she had not received a copy of the first constitutional appeal. On 4 July 2001, a note was prepared by an official in this connection on the Constitutional Court’s premises. The note, which appeared to be part of the file no. Up 232/00, mentioned that the constitutional appeal and admissibility decision of 30 January 2001 had been handed over to the applicant. 23. In addition, the applicant submitted to the Court copies of receipts relating to the attempt to serve the process by the Constitutional Court, concerning the file no. Up 140/02. It would appear that this process included a copy of the second constitutional appeal, the admissibility decision and a letter informing the applicant that the constitutional appeal had been accepted for consideration and that that the applicant should submit her comments within eight days. It transpires from the receipts that the process was sent by the Constitutional Court on 21 June 2002 but had not been served on the applicant. The address referred to in the receipts and the letter is different from the applicant’s address as mentioned in her claim and in the decisions issued in the domestic proceedings, including in the last Supreme Court judgment. According to the applicant, the address used to serve the process was actually the address of one of the other parties to the proceedings. 24. The Constitutional Court Act (Zakon o Ustavnem sodišču, Official Gazette no. 15/94) provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “For procedural questions which are not governed by this Act, the Constitutional Court shall apply the relevant provisions of legislation concerning [ordinary] court proceedings, taking into consideration the nature of the matter.” “After being accepted, a constitutional appeal shall be referred to the body which issued the decision against which the constitutional appeal is lodged, in order for that body to reply to the constitutional appeal within a given time-limit.” “1. If the Constitutional Court quashes a decision, it may also decide on a relevant right or freedom if such procedure is necessary in order to bring to an end consequences that have already occurred on the basis of the quashed decision, or if so required by the nature of the constitutional right or freedom, and provided that a decision can be given on the basis of information in the file. ....” 25. On 30 May 2007 the Slovenian Parliament adopted amendments to the Constitutional Court Act (Official Gazette no. 51/2007). Section 56 was amended to read: “1. If the Constitutional Court accepts a constitutional appeal for consideration, it shall inform the body which issued the decision against which the constitutional appeal is lodged accordingly. A Constitutional Court judge .... can request the body ... to submit information or an explanation necessary for the decision on the constitutional appeal. 2. In the above circumstances, the constitutional appeal should be sent to the persons who participated in the proceedings leading to the decision challenged in the appeal if that decision concerned one of their rights, obligations or legal interests, so that they can reply to it within a certain time-limit.” 26. Paragraph 3 of section 370 of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o pravdnem postopku, Official Gazette no. 26/1999, in force since 14 July 1999) provides that an appeal on points of law is not allowed in respect of an alleged erroneous or insufficient establishment of the facts. 27. Under section 394 of the Civil Procedure Act, proceedings which have been finally concluded by a court decision (pravnomočno končan) can be reopened at the request of a party to the proceedings, if, inter alia, that party did not have an opportunity to give testimony in court, due to some illegality, in particular lack of service. The final conclusion of the proceedings in principle refers to the final decision against which no ordinary appeal lies; that would normally be a decision of a first-instance court, or if an appeal has been lodged, that of a second-instance court. 28. Section 142 of the same act provides that certain documents (such as statements of claim, notices of extraordinary remedies or judgments which can be appealed against) should be served on parties in person. If the party is not found at his or her address, the server should leave a note informing him or her of a new date on which he or she is to be served with the process. If the party is not found at his or her address on that date, the server will serve the process on, inter alia, an adult family member, who will be required to accept the process. If that is not possible, the server will return the process to the court or leave it at a local post office. The server will leave a note at the party’s address informing him or her of the process and the fifteen-day deadline for its collection. The note shall also state the reasons why the process was left at the post office or the court and the date of that event. Under the above conditions and, as the case may be, after the expiry of the deadline, the process will be considered to have been effectively served on the addressee (sections 140-142). 29. The Government submitted six decisions by which the Constitutional Court had decided on requests for reopening of the proceedings before it. Two of them (decision no. U-I-18/99 of 4 October 2001 and decision no. U-I-217/02 of 17 March 2005) concern proceedings by which the constitutionality and legality of a statutory act were being challenged (postopek za oceno ustavnosti in zakonitosti). In both of them, the Constitutional Court found that neither the Constitutional Court Act nor any other legislation provided for the possibility of reopening such proceedings. 30. In the oldest of the remaining four decisions concerning proceedings in which a constitutional appeal had been dismissed (decision no. Up-95/95 of 26 February 1998), the panel of three members of the Constitutional Court (that is a formation in which a decision on admissibility is normally taken) dismissed the request for reopening. It explained that the appellant had not invoked any of the grounds which would justify reopening under the relevant provision of the Civil Procedure Act and section 6 of the Constitutional Court Act. Likewise, in all the remaining decisions (decision no. Up-189/01 of 21 November 2001, decision no. Up-524/01 of 13 January 2003 and decision no. Up-550/02 of 7 March 2006) the Constitutional Court found that the appellants had not demonstrated any grounds which could justify reopening under section 6 of the Constitutional Court Act and the relevant provisions of the legislation concerning court proceedings. It therefore rejected the requests, but added that this decision was taken “without considering the issue whether the reopening of the proceedings before the Constitutional Court was actually possible”.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The first applicant, M.D., is the mother of two minor children, the second and third applicants, R.D. and A.D. 7. Following reports to the Aġenzija Appoġġ (which forms part of the Foundation for Social Welfare Services and has as its aim the enhancement of the lives of people in need, through the provision and availability of professional care and support), an investigation by specialised social workers was undertaken in respect of the family. Meetings took place between the parents, social workers, professionals (doctors, police and lawyers) and the directors of the relevant agency. Finally, on the recommendation of the Director of Social Welfare, on 14 July 2005 the Social Policy Minister issued a care order under Article 4 (1) of the Children and Young Persons (Care Orders) Act (“the Act”) placing the two minors, R.D. and A.D., in an institution run by nuns. By a decision of 17 August 2005, after having heard the first applicant’s objections, the Juvenile Court confirmed the care order. It further solicited the social services to complete the fostering assessment of the maternal grandparents to enable the children to reside with them if it was found to be in their best interest. 8. At the same time, criminal proceedings were brought against the first applicant and her partner, X., who is the alleged father of the minor children. 9. By a judgment of 16 March 2006 the Court of Magistrates as a court of criminal judicature found X. guilty of cruelty towards the two children and failure to protect them, causing them slight injuries, and of excessive correction of the two minors (under twelve years of age). X. was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. His appeal having been withdrawn, the judgment became final. 10. By the same judgment, M.D. was found guilty of cruelty towards the two children and failure to protect them, and excessive correction of the two minors (under twelve years of age). She was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment, suspended for two years. M.D. appealed. 11. By a judgment of 4 August 2006 the Court of Criminal Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. Having assessed the evidence the court found that M.D. had been present when X. repeatedly beat the children, aged three and five, and, possibly because of his threats, had not had the courage to report him or ask the relevant authorities for assistance, with the result that the children were severely bruised. They also suffered from bald patches and lice-infested hair, symptoms of serious neglect on the part of the mother. She had also repeatedly behaved roughly towards her children. She was therefore guilty of the first charge by acts of commission and omission (in so far as she had not taken the requisite steps to protect her children). The court also confirmed her guilt regarding the charge of excessive correction of the two minors. Considering it appropriate, in the event that the children were ever returned to her, the court confirmed the sentence handed down by the first-instance court. 12. Under Maltese law the provisions of Article 197 (4) of the Criminal Code were applicable to a conviction for an offence under Article 247 A (see “Relevant domestic law” below). 13. At the start of the criminal proceedings the relationship between M.D. and X. ended. While the care order was in place, M.D. was given supervised contact with her children for one hour a week and eventually three hours a week. Later, in 2009, the children spent weekends and public holidays with her. 14. Attempts to persuade the Minister to revoke the care order failed. 15. On 19 April 2007 the first applicant, in her own name and on behalf of her children, instituted constitutional redress proceedings. She relied on Articles 6 § 1, 8 and 13 of the Convention, particularly on the basis that there existed no remedy under the Act providing for re-examination by an independent and impartial tribunal of an issued care order, since such a revision depended solely on the discretion of the Minister who had issued the order. The circumstances having changed, she requested the court to revoke the order and grant any other necessary remedy. 16. On 12 July 2007, the Civil Court (First Hall) rejected a plea of non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies by the State (namely, in reference to that provided in Subsidiary Legislation 285.01) since no proof had been submitted in corroboration at that early stage of the proceedings. It therefore decided to examine the case. 17. By a judgment of 2 April 2009 the Civil Court (First Hall) held that M.D. could only act in her own name, and did not have a right to act on behalf of her minor children. Indeed, according to Articles 8 and 9 of the Act, when a care order was issued the relevant parent was deprived of the right to represent his or her children or to sue on their behalf, and care and custody of the children concerned were entrusted to the Minister. It noted that in the proceedings nobody had requested the court to provide the children with a representative ad litem (Article 783 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (COCP)). 18. In respect of M.D., the court found a violation of Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention in that the law did not provide access to court to challenge the care order, but no violation of Article 8. It observed that the care order issued was a permanent one (valid until the minors reached 18 years of age). The Act provided for an objection to the care order to be lodged within twenty-one days of the order being issued, and that such an objection would be dealt with by the Juvenile Court. However, the applicant complained that it was not possible for an individual to request a revision of the order subsequently. The court considered that termination of custody fell under the concept of civil rights, particularly because a care order did not imply the end of natural ties between children and their parents. Consequently, a parent’s right of access to court and to the possibility to regain custody of his or her children was a living right. The court considered that the remedy relied on by the State, namely judicial review proceedings, would not be appropriate in the circumstances. Judicial review was concerned with assessing the decision-making process, but not the merits of a decision itself, as the court would not act as a court of appeal from the body involved. In the event that an administrative decision was quashed the court could only remit the case to the authority for reconsideration, at most requesting the authority to bear in mind the reasons for the quashing. Moreover, the Children and Young Persons Advisory Board (Article 11 of the Act) was simply an advisory board subject to the authority and discretion of the Minister. Therefore, it could not be considered an impartial and independent tribunal. It followed, from an analysis of Maltese law, that there was no remedy granting access to court for the applicant or anyone in her position seeking re-examination of the merits of a care order. This constituted a violation of Article 6 § 1, which absorbed Article 13. 19. Under Article 8 it held that the care order had been in accordance with the law and pursued a legitimate aim. While bearing in mind that M.D. had made improvements and was changing her life, it considered that the grounds on which the care order was based had not disappeared and in view of the frequent reviews of the situation by the social services it could not be said that her rights under Article 8 had been breached. 20. The court rejected the claim for the revocation of the care order but, in accordance with Article 242 of Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta, it ordered that a copy of the judgment be sent to the Speaker of the House of Representatives for consideration by parliament in respect of a possible amendment to the law, as the only remedy that could provide redress to the applicant was a legislative change providing for access to court in such a situation. 21. Both parties appealed. 22. By a judgment of 14 May 2010 the Constitutional Court observed that on the day when the care order was issued M.D. had lost care and custody of her children in favour of the Minister, and therefore it confirmed that in the absence of an appointment by the court, M.D. could not represent her children in the proceedings. Moreover, following her conviction, M.D. had lost all authority and rights over her children in view of the automatic application of Article 197 (4) of the Criminal Code and therefore, in the absence of any request to the court for representation of the minors, she could not act on their behalf according to Maltese law (see “Relevant domestic law” below), notwithstanding any different procedure which might be applicable before the European Court of Human Rights. In this light, in relation to the merits of the complaints under Articles 6 and 13, the court considered that in the present case, M.D. having lost all her parental rights as a result of her conviction, could not exercise any right in respect of which she was deprived of access to court. It followed therefore that no violation of Article 6 could ensue. The situation would have been different had the applicant been affected only by the care order (which solely took away the rights relating to care and custody) and not the subsequent conviction. Neither could it be said that any rights under Article 8 came into play, since the applicant had regular contact with her children. However, the first-instance judgment in relation to whether the Act contravened the applicant’s Article 8 rights had become final, as no appeal had been lodged in this connection. 23. The relevant articles of the Children and Young Persons (Care Orders) Act, Chapter 285 of the Laws of Malta, read as follows: Article 4 “(1) If, on representations made to him in writing by the Director of the Department responsible for social welfare and after giving the parents and the guardian, if any, of the child or young person an opportunity to express their views, and after hearing any other person he may deem likely to assist him, the Minister is satisfied that that child or young person is in need of care, protection or control, it shall be the duty of the Minister by an order in writing under his hand to take such child or young person into his care. (2) A copy of any order made by the Minister under subarticle (1) shall forthwith be sent by registered letter to the person exercising paternal authority over the child or young person, or to his guardian, if any, who shall be asked to state to the Director of the Department responsible for social welfare within twenty-one days from the date of receipt of the said letter, whether he objects to the said order. (3) If the person to whom the registered letter is sent under subarticle (2) shall, within the time therein prescribed, signify, even verbally, his objection to the order, the Director of the Department responsible for social welfare shall, not later than seven days from the date on which he shall have become aware of the objection, refer the case to the Juvenile Court in such manner as shall be prescribed by regulations made under article 13. (4) Where a case is referred to the Juvenile Court under subarticle (3), the said court shall, in such manner and within such time as shall be prescribed by regulations made under article 13, review the whole case and decide whether the child or young person is in need of care, protection or control and shall accordingly confirm or revoke the order made under subarticle (1). (5) An order made under subarticle (1) shall, unless it has ceased to have effect earlier, cease to have effect on the date on which the child or young person in respect of whom the order is made attains the age of eighteen years.” Article 8 “ The Minister shall, with respect to any child or young person committed to his care by an order made under article 3 or taken into his care by an order made under article 4(1), under article 5 or under article 6(1), have the same powers and duties with regard to his care and custody as the parents or guardian of such child or young person would, but for the order, have, and the Minister may, subject to any regulations made in pursuance of article 13, restrict the liberty of such child or young person to such extent as the Minister may consider appropriate (...)” Article 9 “Where a child or young person is in the care of the Minister in pursuance of this Act, it shall be the duty of the Minister to exercise his powers with respect to the care and custody of such child or young person so as to further his best interests and to afford him an opportunity for the proper development of his character and abilities (...)” 24. The relevant articles of the Criminal Code, Chapter 9 of the Laws of Malta, in so far as relevant, read as follows: Article 247A “(1) Whosoever, having the responsibility of any child under twelve years of age, by means of persistent acts of commission or omission ill-treats the child or causes or allows the ill-treatment by similar means of the child shall, unless the fact constitutes a more serious offence under any other provision of this Code, be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. (...) (3) The provisions of article 197(4) shall also apply in the case of an offence under this article, when the offence is committed by any ascendant or tutor.” Article 197(4) “(4) A conviction under this article shall entail the forfeiture of every authority and right granted to the offender over the person or property of the husband or wife or of the descendant to whose prejudice the offence shall have been committed, and, in the case of the tutor, his removal from the tutorship and his perpetual disability from holding the office of tutor.” Article 30 “(1) Without prejudice to the provisions of any other law imposing or authorising the suspension or cancellation of, or disqualification from holding or obtaining, any warrant, licence, permit or other authority held from the Government or any other public authority, where any person is convicted, whether as a principal or an accomplice, of a criminal offence which has been committed - (a) in or in connection with the exercise of any profession, art, trade, calling or other occupation for which a warrant, licence, permit or authority has been or may be issued to him by the Government or any other public authority; or (b) in the use or by means of any instrument, vehicle, substance or other thing whatsoever for the carrying, keeping or using of which a licence, permit or authority has been or may be issued to him, the court may, in addition to sentencing the person convicted as aforesaid to any punishment provided by law for the offence, order such person to be disqualified from holding or obtaining, for such time as the court deems fit, such warrant, licence, permit or authority. Provided that, where an application under this subarticle is refused, a further application thereunder shall not be entertained if made within three months after the date of the refusal. ” Article 28 A “(5) A suspended sentence which has not taken effect shall for all intents and purposes of law be deemed, except as provided in subarticle (1), to be a sentence awarding punishment and nothing in this article shall be deemed to effect - (a) the applicability of any other punishment which may be awarded, or any suspension, cancellation, disqualification, forfeiture, loss or removal which may be ordered, together with the punishment of imprisonment so suspended;” 25. Article 783 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “(1) In the cases referred to in this sub-title, the curator ad litem may be appointed by the same court before which the action has been brought, or is about to be brought, upon the application of any person interested. (2) The application for the appointment of a curator to represent a minor who desires to sue, may be made by any person.”","['6', '8']","['6-1', '8-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Timişoara. 6. At the material time he was a journalist at the newspaper Ziua de Vest in Timişoara. 7. On 16 June 2000 the applicant attended an official meeting between the prefect and representatives of the interns from the hospitals in the county who were on strike. Ms C.M.O., one of the interns' representatives, stated: “Because I refused to prostitute myself with Doctor [P.], Professor [D.] dismissed me from the Cardiology Centre.” 8. On 19 June 2000 the newspaper Ziua de Vest published an article by the applicant. The relevant parts read as follows: “Scandal in the medical world in Timişoara The president of the Interns Association in Timiş County, Dr [D.D.], says that 'Dr [P.] behaves in certain ways that we all know' A medical intern from Timişoara, whose name we shall not yet make public, declared on Friday, in front of the prefect [L.B.], that the director of the Timiş Public Health Direction, Dr [P.], had attempted to sexually blackmail her. 'Because I refused to prostitute myself with Doctor [P.], Professor [D.] dismissed me from the Cardiology Centre' declared the intern. The president of the Interns Association in Timişoara, Dr [D.D.], declared that he had not known about this case of sexual harassment, which he learned of only at the meeting with the prefect. 'Dr [P.] behaves in certain ways that we all know' said Dr [D.D.] ... Although we tried to get his comments on the accusations brought against him, Dr [P.] was unavailable.” A photo of P. featured in the article. 9. On 21 June 2000 P. lodged a criminal complaint for defamation against the applicant with Timişoara District Court. His complaint also concerned the company which published the newspaper. 10. The District Court heard evidence from C.M.O., who admitted to having made the assertion reproduced by the applicant but denied having given her permission for its publication. The prefect also confirmed that an intern had accused P. of sexual aggression during the meeting. 11. The applicant was heard by the court on two occasions. He pleaded not guilty and relied in his defence on his right to freedom of expression and the right to provide information about public figures. 12. On 20 March 2001 the District Court gave judgment. It acquitted the applicant on the ground that he had not intended to denigrate P. It found that the expression “sexual harassment” had not harmed P.'s dignity as it was a stylistic choice by the applicant. 13. Both parties appealed to the Timişoara County Court. On 18 May 2001 the court was addressed by the parties' counsels, who defended orally the grounds for their respective appeals. P.'s lawyer asked for the applicant's conviction. The applicant's lawyer and the company's representative requested that P. be compelled to pay court fees. The applicant was invited to speak only before the end of the hearing (ultimul cuvânt al inculpatului). In his address he asked that P.'s appeal be dismissed. 14. The final decision was adopted on the same day. The County Court quashed the judgment of 20 March 2001, re-examined the evidence and found as follows: “[the journalist] did not confine himself to merely providing information about the criticisms [expressed against P.] but added his own appreciation, which went beyond [C.M.O.]'s statements. ... Through its title and content, the article contains untrue statements and allegations and personal appreciations by [the applicant] which, if true, would render the victim liable to a criminal penalty or expose him to public opprobrium. By publishing the victim's photo, and by presenting the information that a scandal had been caused in the Timişoara medical world by [P.]'s behaviour ... [the applicant] acted with intent to denigrate the victim, the article being manifestly defamatory. The words “sexual blackmail and sexual harassment” cannot be regarded as having stylistic and literary value when an individual's image, dignity and honour are at stake.” 15. The County Court noted that a certain degree of aggressiveness was common in journalism. It therefore, although the facts met the legal criteria to constitute the criminal offence of defamation, the acts perpetrated and their consequences were not severe enough to come within the sphere of criminal law. Consequently, it acquitted the applicant and imposed an administrative fine of 500,000 Romanian lei (ROL). The court also found that the conditions had been met for the applicant's civil liability, and that of the publishing company, in respect of the prejudice caused to the victim. In consequence, it ordered the applicant and the company to pay ROL 5,000,000 to P. as compensation for non-pecuniary damage and ROL 2,000,000 for costs. Lastly, it ordered them to pay ROL 50,000 to the State in court fees. 16. On 3 October 2001 the applicant paid the administrative fine. 17. The relevant provisions of the Civil and Criminal Codes concerning insult and defamation and liability for paying damages in force at the material time are described in Barb v. Romania, no. 5945/03, §§ 19-20, 7 October 2008. 18. The Criminal Code has been amended repeatedly and in 2006 the Articles on insult and defamation were repealed (for details, see Cuc Pascu v. Romania, no. 36157/02, §§ 12-14, 16 September 2008). 19. However, in decision no. 62 of 18 January 2007 the Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional the removal from the Criminal Code of the Articles on insult and defamation. 20. Law no. 356/2006 amended the Criminal Code and made it mandatory for an appeal court to hear the accused where the first-instance court had acquitted him or her. Currently, where an appeal court quashes a judgment given by a first-instance court, it must decide on the evidence to be adduced and set a date on which it will take a statement from the accused if the latter was not heard or if he or she was acquitted by the first-instance court (Articles 38514 § 11 and 38516, as amended).","['10', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Pančevo, Serbia. 7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8. On 16 November 2003, the applicant was stopped and searched by a police officer at the main bus station in Belgrade and a packet containing 4.13 grams of cannabis was found on his person. 9. He was then taken to a police station but was released after a short period of time. Whilst in custody, an on-duty police officer issued a receipt confirming seizure of the cannabis in question (potvrda o privremeno oduzetim predmetima). This receipt was signed by the applicant and the officer and contained the applicant’s registered home address – M.K. Street no. 32, Pančevo. 10. In a subsequent incident report of the same date, however, the officer appears to have made a mistake by stating that the applicant’s address was M.K. Street no. 30 rather than no. 32. This report was neither seen nor signed by the applicant. 11. Having found his number in a telephone directory, on 6 July 2004 the police contacted the applicant’s father by telephone. He in turn informed the applicant that the police were looking for him. The applicant subsequently called the police and was told that he needed to come to the station in order to pick up the court summons. Upon arrival at the station, he was arrested and placed in detention. 12. It subsequently became clear that a detention order had been issued by the District Court (Okružni sud) in Belgrade on 29 June 2004, as part of the criminal proceedings brought against the applicant regarding the cannabis seizure of 16 November 2003. In its reasoning, the court first explained that the applicant had not appeared at the hearing scheduled for 17 March 2004 and noted that the return receipt attached to its summons had stated that he “was unknown at M.K. Street no. 30”. Secondly, the applicant had failed to appear at the following hearing scheduled for 20 May 2004 and the police, who had been ordered to serve the summons, had reported on 20 April 2004 that a neighbour had confirmed that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since 1999. Thirdly, on 20 April 2004 the police had also run a search in their database and had made additional inquiries, confirming that, as of 1986, the applicant’s registered residence was indeed M.K. Street no. 30, but could not discover any information concerning his current whereabouts. Finally, the court concluded that there was a sufficient factual basis to indicate that the applicant was hiding and/or in flight and had therefore ordered his detention. (It must, however, be noted that the neighbour’s statement and the original police report of 20 April 2004 were cited erroneously by the District Court and that in fact both had referred to M.K. Street no. 32 only, as the applicant’s registered residence, there being no mention of M.K. Street no. 30.) 13. On 29 June 2004 the District Court had also adopted a separate decision requesting the police to issue a wanted notice (poternica) and arrest the applicant. Therein the applicant’s address had again been stated as M.K. Street no. 30. 14. Various other documents successively referred to both addresses. Thus the District Court’s letter sent to the police on 20 May 2004 referred to M.K. Street no. 32 while all court summonses, the criminal complaint of 11 December 2003 (krivična prijava) and the indictment (optužni predlog) of 26 December 2003 consistently stated the applicant’s address as M.K. Street no. 30. 15. Throughout this time the applicant’s identity card, issued by the police on 30 August 2000, and his residence registration remained unchanged, stating his address as M.K. Street no. 32, Pančevo. 16. On 7 July 2004 the applicant’s lawyer filed an appeal by telegram against the District Court’s detention order of 29 June 2004. Therein he stated that the applicant had never lived at M.K. Street no. 30 and pointed out that his registered residence was in fact M.K. Street no. 32. The applicant consequently had no knowledge of the criminal proceedings against him; nor could he have deliberately avoided receiving the court summons. 17. On 8 July 2004 the applicant’s lawyer supplemented this appeal with additional written arguments requesting that the impugned detention order be revoked and his client released. In particular, he noted that the applicant had gone to the police station “of his own free will” as soon as he had found out that they were looking for him. Upon arrival at the police station, he had been arrested and it was then that he had first found out about the criminal charges against him. 18. On 12 July 2004 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Srbije) rejected the appeal. It did so without an oral hearing. In its ruling the Supreme Court affirmed the reasons for detention given by the District Court and further held that there was no evidence in the case file that the applicant’s correct address was indeed M.K. Street no. 32. On the contrary, police reports suggested that “the applicant’s residence throughout the proceedings had remained unknown”. 19. On 14 July 2004 this decision was received by the applicant’s lawyer. 20. On 16 July 2004 he filed a motion with the District Court, seeking the applicant’s release on bail or, alternatively, that his detention be replaced with a prohibition on leaving his place of residence until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The lawyer further noted that the applicant’s detention had been ordered due to the court’s error in the establishment of his true home address and concluded by requesting that a hearing in the case be scheduled urgently. 21. The District Court appears not to have considered this motion. 22. Following a hearing on 26 July 2004, the District Court found the applicant guilty of illicit possession of narcotics and fined him in the amount of 10,000 Serbian dinars (at the time approximately 128 euros). 23. In a separate decision of the same date the District Court released the applicant from detention. It held, inter alia, that “the current phase of the criminal proceedings had been completed” and that “the defendant had provided correct information about his present address”. 24. On 24 September 2004 the applicant filed a complaint with the Court of Serbia and Montenegro (Sud Srbije i Crne Gore). 25. Following the communication of the present application to the respondent State, the Government produced two signed witness statements, taken by the police on 23 January 2006, wherein the applicant’s neighbours, both residing at M.K. Street no. 32, confirmed that the applicant had indeed not been living there for years. One of them further specified that he had already told the police as much in April 2004, while the other recalled that the applicant had not been living at the address in question since 1999. 26. Articles 10 and 16, taken together, stated that the “provisions of international treaties on human and minority rights applicable in ... [the State Union of] ... Serbia and Montenegro shall be directly enforceable” and, further, that “the ratified international treaties” shall “have precedence” over domestic legislation. 27. Article 7 provided that “international treaties in force in the State Union [of Serbia and Montenegro] shall be guaranteed by this Charter and be directly applicable”. 28. Article 14 § 8 provided that a person “who has been deprived of his liberty unlawfully [nezakonito lišen slobode] shall have the right to compensation”. 29. Article 23 § 4 provided, inter alia, that a person who has been deprived of his liberty, “without any basis [bez osnova] ... shall have the right to ... compensation ...”. 30. The relevant provisions of this Code provide as follows: “The courts, as well as State bodies taking part in the criminal proceedings, shall establish truthfully and comprehensively all facts which are of importance for the adoption of a lawful decision. The courts and State bodies shall examine and establish with equal care facts which incriminate the defendant, as well as those in his favour.” “First instance courts sit in a panel of three judges [“Judicial Panel”] when deciding on appeals against rulings of the investigating judge and other rulings when it is so prescribed by this Code ... ” “The ... [defendant’s participation in the criminal proceedings may be secured by means of sending] ... summonses, his forcible production in court, the issuance of a prohibition of his leaving his place of residence, [as well as] through the imposition of bail or detention. The competent court shall ... [attempt not to apply] ... a more severe measure ... [in order to secure the defendant presence] ... if a less severe measure may achieve the same purpose. These measures shall be vacated ex officio when the reasons for their application have ceased to exist, or shall be replaced with other less severe measures once the conditions are met.” “The defendant is obliged to immediately inform the court of any change of address, as well as of his intent to change his abode. The defendant shall be informed of this obligation at his first hearing ... [or] ... upon receipt of the indictment ... and warned about the consequences ... [of any non-compliance] ... provided for under the Code.” “ ... [The court shall order the forcible production of the defendant before it if the defendant] ... could not be properly summoned and it is obvious from the facts that he has been avoiding receipt [of court summonses].” “If there are circumstances indicating that the defendant might abscond, hide, go to an unknown place or abroad, the court may, by a reasoned decision, prohibit him from leaving his place of residence. ... In the course of the [judicial] investigation the [measure] referred to in [paragraph 1] ... of this Article shall be ordered and vacated by the investigating judge, and when the indictment is preferred by the President of the Chamber. ...

The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Opole, Poland. 10. On 16 June 1995 the applicant was taken into custody by the police. On 17 June 1995 the Wrocław Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) dismissed his complaint about placing him in police custody. 11. On 17 June 1995 the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Wojewódzki) charged the applicant with aggravated fraud and remanded him in custody. The charges related to a period between 30 January and 3 March 1995 when the applicant, together with his accomplices, allegedly defrauded several individuals and businesses by obtaining from them under false pretences cash, automobiles, furniture, computers and other goods of a total value of PLN 1,050,000. In addition, the applicant was charged with possession of a forged passport. The Regional Prosecutor considered that the applicant’s detention on remand was warranted by the fact that he was charged with several criminal acts which caused a significant danger to society (stopień społecznego niebezpieczeństwa jest znaczny), as he had acted within a criminal organisation and had obtained valuable goods. In addition, the applicant’s criminal activity took place over a long time and it was probable that if released he would collude and try to destroy evidence. 12. On 10 July 1995 the applicant applied to the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor for release from detention. On 12 July 1995 the Regional Prosecutor rejected the application. He dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s claims that poor health and the financial situation of his family required his release. Moreover, the applicant’s contention that his illhealth called for release would be decided after a panel of medical experts had examined him. 13. On 24 and 26 July 1995 the applicant again made applications to the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor for release from detention. On 26 July 1995 his requests were dismissed. The Regional Prosecutor relied on a medical opinion issued by the Wrocław Prison Hospital, which stated that the applicant could remain in detention. In addition, he considered that since the applicant’s daughter and his cohabitee lived with the latter’s parents, there was no need for him to be released to care for them. 14. On 2 August 1995 the applicant made an application for release from detention. On 4 August 1995 the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor rejected his application. The prosecutor referred to the medical opinion of 19 July 1995, which confirmed that the applicant’s state of health allowed the continuation of his detention. Furthermore, he considered that the fact that the applicant’s daughter had recently received medical treatment in the infant pathology ward of the Wrocław Regional Hospital did not constitute a ground for the applicant’s release. The prosecutor also pointed out that the applicant’s cohabitee cared for his daughter. 15. On 9 August 1995 the Wrocław Appellate Prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Prosecutor’s decision of 26 July 1995. The Appellate Prosecutor considered that the evidence showed that the applicant had committed the criminal offences with which he was charged. Moreover, the state of health of his daughter did not require that he be released. The prosecutor was also of a view that the applicant’s detention was necessary to ensure the proper course of the proceedings. 16. On 23 August 1995 the applicant lodged with the Wrocław Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) a complaint about his detention. On 31 August 1995 the court transmitted it to the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor to consider it as a request to change the preventive measure applied to the applicant. On 1 September 1995 the prosecutor rejected the request. He dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s claims that his own state of health as well as that of several members of his family required his release from detention. In this connection, the prosecutor referred to medical opinions, which stated that the applicant was neither mentally ill nor retarded and that his detention would not cause any risk to his health and life. Furthermore, he considered that the investigation of the applicant’s claim that his detention constituted a hardship for his family had showed that it was unsubstantiated. 17. On 6 September 1995 the Wrocław Regional Court allowed the request submitted by the prosecution service and extended the applicant’s detention on remand until 30 November 1995. The court considered that the evidence collected in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against the applicant. It also relied on a significant danger to society caused by the criminal offences in question and the necessity to ensure the proper course of criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the court pointed out that the investigation of the case would have to be continued in order to clarify the applicant’s role in the commission of the criminal offences and to identify individuals who would be charged with receiving stolen goods from the applicant. Finally, the court considered that the applicant’s case did not disclose any of the grounds for release from detention listed in Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, i.e. danger to the detainee’s life or health and extreme hardship caused to either the detainee or his family. On 6 October 1995 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the Regional Court. 18. On 30 December 1995 the Wrocław Regional Prosecutor filed with the Wrocław Regional Court a bill of indictment against the applicant. 19. On 31 January 1996 the applicant asked the Wrocław Regional Court to release him from detention. On 5 February 1996 the court dismissed his request. It relied on a significant danger to society caused by the criminal offences with which the applicant was charged and the evidence on which they were based. The court was also of the view that the applicant’s family did not suffer hardship which would justify his release. 20. On 15 February 1996 the applicant again filed an application for release but on 22 February 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court rejected it. On 29 February 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision. The court observed that the applicant could apply for bail. 21. On 7 March 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court rejected the application for release filed by the applicant on 26 February 1996. On 1 April 1996 the court rejected the application lodged on 19 March 1996. 22. On 19 April 1996 the applicant made a further application to the Wrocław Regional Court for release from detention. On 25 April 1996 the court dismissed his application. It referred to the previous court decisions refusing his requests for release. Moreover, the court considered that the claim that the applicant’s father suffered hardship was unsubstantiated. 23. The date of the first hearing was fixed for 15 April 1996. However, it was cancelled because one of the defendants was ill and could not attend it. 24. On 16 May 1996 the applicant made an application to the Wrocław Regional Court for release from detention. On 30 May 1996 the court dismissed his request. It relied on a significant danger to society caused by the criminal offences with which the applicant was charged and the evidence on which they were based. The court further considered that the applicant’s detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of criminal proceedings. In addition, it observed that the applicant’s failure to pay child support did not warrant his release, as one of his children was in receipt of child support payments from the Child Support Fund (Fundusz Alimentacyjny). 25. On 31 June 1996 the Regional Court held a hearing. It was adjourned because two defendants failed to attend it. 26. On 8 July 1996 the applicant made an application to the Wrocław Regional Court for release from detention. On 15 July 1996 the court rejected his request. It relied on the grounds for continuing the applicant’s detention listed in previous court decisions. 27. On 5 August 1996 the applicant asked the Wrocław Regional Court to release him from detention. On 8 August 1996 the court dismissed his request. It considered that the evidence collected in the case sufficiently supported the charges laid against the applicant. As the charges could lead to a severe prison sentence, there was a risk of absconding. Furthermore, the court was of the view that the applicant’s inability to provide care to his children over a long period of time did not result in exceptional hardship for his family. 28. On 12 August 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release from detention filed on 6 August 1996. The court relied on the evidence collected in the case, which in its opinion supported the charges laid against the applicant. In addition, it considered that the prospect of a severe penalty, which could be imposed on the applicant, could prompt him to abscond. 29. On 19 August 1996 the Vice-President of the Wrocław Court of Appeal informed the Ministry of Justice and the applicant that the applicant’s case did not disclose that the proceedings had taken unreasonably long. In particular, he pointed out that thirteen individuals were accused in the case, the case file consisted of seventeen volumes and evidence had to be taken from fiftyeight witnesses. Furthermore, the VicePresident observed that the first hearing had been cancelled because one of the defendants had been ill. The second hearing had been adjourned until 30 August 1996 as two defendants had failed to attend it. Finally, he stated that “the judge rapporteur is dealing with twenty-five other cases and therefore is not able to decide this case sooner than is possible”. 30. On 30 August 1996 the Regional Court held a hearing. It was adjourned because some of the defendants failed to attend it. 31. On 3 September 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal allowed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 8 August 1996 rejecting his application for release from detention. The appellate court quashed the impugned decision and instructed the trial court to reconsider the applicant’s request. It acknowledged that “in the present case the detention on remand has lasted quite long”. In addition, the appellate court considered that the trial court’s statement on the applicant’s intention to abscond was not precise enough. As the applicant’s detention had already lasted sixteen months and as he was not charged with a serious offence, the mere reference to the possibility that the applicant could abscond because of the prospect of a severe penalty was not sufficient. The appellate court also observed that the trial court had not considered whether another preventive measure could replace the applicant’s detention on remand. 32. On 12 September 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s four applications for release submitted in August and September 1996. The court considered that the charges against the applicant were sufficiently supported by the evidence. Moreover, the difficulties in finding the applicant’s place of residence during the investigative stage of the proceedings and the prospect of a severe penalty showed that he could go into hiding if released from detention. The court further noted that the applicant could not be released on bail as he had stated that he had no funds to pay it. Finally, it considered that there was no evidence pointing towards the existence of any of the grounds for release provided for by Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 33. The hearing held on 13 September 1996 was adjourned until 27 September 1996 as some of the defendants failed to attend it because of ill health. 34. During the hearing held on 27 September 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court rejected the applicant’s application for release from detention. The hearing was adjourned because some of the defendants failed to attend it. 35. On 7 October 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 12 September 1996. The appellate court observed that the applicant’s release would delay the proceedings, as his cohabitee lived in Opole. It also noted that the applicant had contributed to the delay in the proceedings because on numerous occasions he had submitted requests and appeals. In addition, on several occasions a case file had been transmitted from the trial court to the Wrocław Detention Centre after the applicant had asked to consult it. 36. On 17 October 1996 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 27 September 1996. The appellate court referred to previous court decisions rejecting his applications for release from detention. The court further noted that although the length of the applicant’s detention could be worrying (trwa już niepokojąco długo), it had not been caused by the inactivity of the trial court. Moreover, the appellate court recommended that “more energetic steps” be taken to expedite the proceedings. Finally, it acknowledged that the state of health of the applicant’s cohabitee and his daughter was not good. However, the court was of the view that the applicant’s release would not contribute to the improvement of their health. 37. In a letter of 23 October 1996 the President of the Wrocław Regional Court advised the applicant that the trial court could not be blamed for the delay in the proceedings. He pointed out that the court had fixed numerous hearings, which had been adjourned because of the absence of defendants who had been ill. 38. During the hearing held on 25 October 1996 the applicant applied for bail. He proposed that the bail be set at PLN 2,000. However, the Wrocław Regional Court rejected the application. It gave the following reasons for its decision: “The circumstances raised by the accused in his application have already been considered by both the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal. Therefore, taking into account the fact that no new circumstances have taken place, it should be assumed that the reasons for continuing detention on remand have not ceased to exist.” 39. During the hearing held on 12 December 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court rejected the applicant’s application for release from detention. The hearing was adjourned because some of the defendants failed to attend it. 40. On 31 December 1996 the Wrocław Regional Court decided to request the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) to extend the applicant’s detention on remand. 41. On 7 January 1997 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s decision of 12 December 1996. The appellate court recalled that during the preceding ten months it had been considering on a monthly basis the applicant’s appeals against the trial court’s refusals to release him. It considered that the factual and legal circumstances concerning the applicant’s detention had not changed. 42. On 24 January 1997 the Supreme Court allowed the Regional Court’s request and extended the applicant’s detention on remand until 24 July 1997. It considered that the prolongation of the applicant’s detention was justified by the evidence, the possibility that he could go into hiding and the complexity of the case. It also observed that the delay in the proceedings was caused by the behaviour of defendants who had failed to attend hearings. The Supreme Court further reflected on the legality of the applicant’s detention between 1 and 24 January 1997. The relevant part of the court’s reasoning may be summarised as follows: The Supreme Court, noting that the application was filed on 31 December 1996 but posted as late as 13 January 1997, first considered what was the proper date of ‘lodging’ such an application for the purposes of Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Supreme Court next observed that, depending on the answer to this question, it would have to determine the legal consequences of a potential failure on the part of the Wrocław Regional Court to respect the rule laid down in Article 10 (a) § 2 of the Interim Law of 1 December 1995, which stated that in cases where no request for a further prolongation of detention on remand had been ‘lodged’, the detention on remand had to be lifted and the person concerned released not later than on 1 January 1997. The Supreme Court considered that it should also deal with the question of whether it was competent to rule on the application if it had been ‘lodged’ after the expiry of the term referred to in Article 10 (a) of the Interim Law of 1 December 1995, i.e. after 1 January 1997. Referring to the first question, the Supreme Court held that the proper date of ‘lodging’ an application under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had to be deemed either the date of posting the request or the date of submitting it to the registry of the Supreme Court since to hold otherwise would mean leaving a detainee without any guarantee that the Supreme Court was properly supervising his detention. Moreover, if the requesting court was not bound by any time-limits for submitting its application, detention, the most severe among the preventive measures, might continue for an unspecified and unlimited time outside the Supreme Court’s supervision. In consequence, an application under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a mere ‘proposal’ to continue detention, would, for all practical purposes, transform into a basis for continuing detention. Clearly, that was not the intention of the legislator. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that since in the applicant’s case no application for a further prolongation of his detention was ‘lodged’ before 1 January 1997, the applicant’s (and his co-defendants’) detention from that date to the date of its present decision lacked any legal basis and was, accordingly, unlawful. It went on to find that it was, nevertheless, competent to deal with the application lodged outside the relevant date. It considered that a lower court’s obligation to release a detainee in case of its failure properly to lodge an application under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure was one thing, but its right to make such an application at any time was another. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, the application in question should be deemed a “fresh application” and be examined as such. 43. On 28 January 1997 the Wrocław Regional Court held a hearing. 44. On 10 February 1997 the President of the Wrocław Court of Appeal informed the applicant that his complaints about his unjustified detention on remand were unsubstantiated. The President also recalled that on 24 January 1997 the Supreme Court had prolonged the applicant’s detention and that no hearings could be held in his case at the time when the Supreme Court had been considering the request to extend his detention. In addition, he observed that the next hearing was scheduled for 17 March 1997. 45. On 24 February 1997 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s challenge to one of the judges considering his case. 46. On 17 March 1997 the Wrocław Regional Court held a hearing. It was adjourned because some of the defendants failed to attend it. 47. During the hearings held on 17 April and 28 May 1997 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s applications for release from detention. The latter hearing was adjourned because some of the defendants failed to attend it. 48. The hearing held on 8 July 1997 was adjourned because some of the defendants did not attend it. 49. During the hearing held on 8 September 1997 the Wrocław Regional Court decided to sever the charges laid against three co-defendants and to consider them in separate proceedings because the co-defendants’ numerous failures to attend hearings resulted in the delay in deciding the applicant’s case. Thereafter, the proceedings were continued against the applicant and eight codefendants. 50. The next hearings were held on 13, 28 October and 25 November 1997. The hearing scheduled for 18 November 1997 was cancelled. 51. On 19 December 1997 the hearing was held before the Regional Court. It decided to request the Supreme Court to prolong the applicant’s detention on remand. 52. On 15 January 1998 the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention on remand until 31 March 1998. 53. During the hearing held on 30 January 1998 the Regional Court rejected the applicant’s requests that the charges against him be decided in separate proceedings and that he be released from detention. 54. On 3 and 17 March 1998 hearings took place before the trial court. 55. On 20 March 1998 the applicant was released from detention. 56. Subsequently, hearings were held on 17 April, 15 May, 5 June, 2 July, 3 September, 6 October, 30 November and 1 December 1998. 57. In the course of 1999 the Wrocław Regional Court held hearings on the following dates: 5 January, 4 February, 11 March, 14 April, 7 and 28 May, 9 June, 7 September, 29 October and 15 December. The hearings held on 7 September and 29 October 1999 were adjourned because a judge was ill. 58. On 14 January 2000 the court held a hearing. 59. During the hearings held between 25 November 1997 and 14 January 2000 the Wrocław Regional Court took evidence from more than fifty witnesses. 60. On 21 January 2000 the Wrocław Regional Court convicted the applicant and sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment and to a fine. On 14 April 2000 the applicant appealed against his conviction. 61. On 24 August 2000 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 62. On 24 October 2000 the Court received the applicant’s letter of 9 October 2000. The front of the envelope in which the letter was delivered bears a stamp in Polish: “Opole Detention Centre, Ward III, Received on 09.10.2000.” On the back of the envelope there is a stamp in Polish: “Censored. Opole, 19.10.2000”. The top edge of the envelope is sealed with Sellotape. The envelope is postmarked 19 October 2000. 63. Over the period to which the facts of the present case relate, i.e. from March 1995 to the beginning of 1999, Polish criminal legislation was amended on several occasions. In so far as the present case is concerned, there were two relevant amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the 1969 Code”), a law which is no longer in force as it was repealed and replaced by the socalled “New Code of Criminal Procedure” of 6 June 1997 (“the 1997 Code”), which entered into force on 1 September 1998. The first such amendment was made by the Law of 29 June 1995 on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes which entered into force on 1 January 1996, except the amendments relating to the imposition of detention on remand (in particular, those stating that only a judge was empowered to detain a suspect on remand); the entry into force of the latter amendments being postponed until 4 August 1996 (see below). The second amendment, effected by the Law of 1 December 1995 on Amendments to the Law of 29 June 1995 (“the 1995 Interim Law”) came into force on 1 January 1996. Section 10(a) of the Law introduced special interim rules governing the prolongation of detention on remand beyond the statutory time-limits laid down in Article 222 §§ 2 and 3 of the 1969 Code in cases where such detention had been imposed before 4 August 1996 (see below, 2 c) “Statutory time-limits for detention on remand”). 64. At the material time the 1969 Code listed as “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze), inter alia, detention on remand, bail and police supervision. Article 210 § 1 of the 1969 Code read (in the version applicable until 4 August 1996): “Preventive measures shall be imposed by the court; before a bill of indictment has been lodged with the competent court, the measures shall be imposed by the prosecutor.” Article 222 (in the version applicable until 4 August 1996) stated, in so far as relevant: “1. The prosecutor may order detention on remand for a period not exceeding three months. (1) the court competent to deal with the case, upon the prosecutor’s request, for a period not exceeding one year; (2) the Supreme Court, upon request of the Prosecutor General, for a further fixed term required to terminate the investigation.” Under Article 212 § 2 a detainee could appeal against a detention order made by a prosecutor to the court competent to deal with his case; however, he was not entitled to be brought before the judge dealing with his appeal. 65. Article 209 of the 1969 Code set out general grounds justifying imposition of preventive measures. That provision (as it stood at the material time) provided: “Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings if the evidence against the accused sufficiently justifies the opinion that he has committed a criminal offence.” Article 217 § 1 defined grounds for detention on remand. That provision, in the version applicable until 1 January 1996 provided, in so far as relevant: “Detention on remand may be imposed if: (1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when he has no fixed residence [in Poland] or his identity cannot be established; or (2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper conduct of proceedings by any other unlawful means; or (3) an accused has been charged with a serious offence or has relapsed into crime in the manner defined in the Criminal Code; or (4) an accused has been charged with an offence which creates a serious danger to society.” On 1 January 1996 paragraphs (3) and (4) were repealed. From that date on that provision read: “(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when his identity cannot be established or he has no permanent abode [in Poland]; or (2) [as it stood before 1 January 1996].” Paragraph 2 of Article 217 then read: “If an accused has been charged with a serious offence or an intentional offence [for the commission of which he may be] liable to a sentence of a statutory maximum of at least eight years’ imprisonment, or if a court of first instance has sentenced him to at least three years’ imprisonment, the need to continue detention in order to secure the proper conduct of proceedings may be based upon the likelihood that a heavy penalty will be imposed.” 66. The 1969 Code set out the margin of discretion as to maintaining a specific preventive measure. Articles 213 § 1, 218 and 225 of the Code were based on the precept that detention on remand, the most extreme among the preventive measures, should not be imposed if more lenient measures were adequate. Article 213 § 1 provided: “A preventive measure [including detention on remand] shall be immediately lifted or varied, if the basis therefor has ceased to exist or new circumstances have arisen which justify lifting a given measure or replacing it with a more or less severe one.” Article 225 stated: “Detention on remand shall be imposed only when it is mandatory; this measure shall not be imposed if bail or police supervision, or both of these measures, are considered adequate.” The provisions of the Code providing for “mandatory detention” (for instance, pending an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three years) were repealed on 1 January 1996 by the Law of 29 June 1995 referred to above. Finally, Article 218 provided: “If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand should be lifted, in particular, if: (1) it may seriously jeopardise the life or health of the accused; or (2) it would entail excessively burdensome effects for the accused or his family.” 67. Until 4 August 1996, i.e. the date on which the relevant provisions of the Law of 29 June 1995 on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes entered into force, the law did not set out any time-limits on detention on remand in court proceedings; it did so only in respect of the investigative stage (see above, 2a) Imposition of detention on remand; Article 222 in the version applicable until 4 August 1996). Article 222 of the 1969 Code in the version applicable after 4 August 1996 provided, in so far as relevant: “3. The whole period of detention on remand until the date on which the court of first instance gives judgment may not exceed one year and six months in cases concerning offences. In cases concerning serious offences [offences for the commission of which a person was liable to a sentence of a statutory minimum of at least 3 years’ imprisonment] this period may not exceed two years. 4. In particularly justified cases the Supreme Court may, on an application made by the court competent to deal with the case, ... prolong detention on remand for a further fixed period exceeding the time-limits set in paragraphs 2 and 3, when it is necessary in connection with a suspension of the proceedings, a prolonged psychiatric observation of the accused, when evidence needs to be obtained from abroad or when the accused has deliberately obstructed the termination of the proceedings in the terms referred to in paragraph 3.” 68. On 28 December 1996, by virtue of the Law of 6 December 1996, paragraph 4 of that Article was amended and the grounds for prolonging detention beyond the statutory time-limits included also: “... other significant obstacles, which could not be overcome by the authorities conducting the proceedings...” However, as already mentioned (see paragraph 63 above), under section 10 (a) of the 1995 Interim Law, different rules applied to persons whose detention on remand started prior to 4 August 1996. That section provided: “1. In cases where the total period of detention on remand which started prior to 1 August 1996 exceeds the [maximum] time-limits referred to in Article 222 §§ ... and 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure [as amended by the Law of 29 June 1995 on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes], the accused shall be kept in detention until the Supreme Court gives a decision on an application for prolongation of his detention under Article 222 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. In cases mentioned in paragraph 1, if no [such] application has been lodged, detention shall be lifted not later than 1 January 1997.” In cases where the Supreme Court dismissed an application under Article 222 § 4, a detainee had to be released. As long as it had not given its ruling, the application of the relevant court – which had the form of a decision (“postanowienie”) – was deemed to be a legal basis for the continued detention. 69. Article 24 § 1 of the 1969 Code read, in so far as relevant: “1. The court competent to deal with the charges laid against a principal offender shall be competent to determine the charges laid against all his accessories and/or other persons, if the offence[s] committed by the latter are closely related to that [or those] committed by a principal offender [and] if the criminal proceedings against [all of them] are pending simultaneously. 2. The cases of persons referred to in paragraph 1 shall be joined in the same proceedings; 3. In cases where circumstances have rendered a joint determination of all the charges referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 difficult [the court] may sever a specific charge [or charges] from the case ... .” A first-instance court could, either of its own motion or on an application made by a party, make a severance order at any time. 70. That offence, until 1 September 1998, was defined in Article 205 § 2 (1) of the Criminal Code of 1969, which provided: “Anyone who has committed aggravated fraud shall be liable to a sentence ranging from one to ten years’ imprisonment.” On 1 September 1998 the Criminal Code of 1969 was repealed by the socalled “New Criminal Code” of 6 June 1997 and, from then on, the offence of aggravated fraud has been defined by Article 294 § 1 read in conjunction with Article 286 § 1 of the New Criminal Code; the potential sentence still ranges from one to ten years’ imprisonment.",['5'],"['5-1', '5-3']",[],['34'],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1977 and 1963 respectively and live in Plovdiv. 7. On 21 September 1995 Mr Dimitrov was arrested by the police while trying to break into a car with two other individuals, M.M. and S.D. He was taken to a police station, where he made a written confession. M.M., who was apparently also taken into custody, made a confession as well and turned over to the police two radio cassette players stolen from two cars which he had broken into earlier. On the same day a police officer drew up a report on the incident. 8. On 1 November 1995 a police investigator interviewed S.D. who confessed that he had committed the offence in concert with Mr Dimitrov and M.M. 9. On an unspecified date in 1995 the case was given the number 1074/95. 10. On 19 February 2002 the investigator in charge of the case interviewed one of the police officers who had arrested Mr Dimitrov. On 21 February 2002 he interviewed the owner of one of the cars, and on the same day ordered an expert report on the value of the stolen goods. The report was ready the same day. On 1 March 2002 the investigator interviewed the owner of another car. 11. On 4 March 2002 Mr Dimitrov was formally charged with attempted theft committed in concert with M.M. and S.D. He was interviewed in the presence of his counsel and pleaded guilty. On the same day the investigator interviewed S.D. as a witness. It seems that neither M.M. nor S.D. were charged. 12. On 22 May 2002 the Plovdiv District Prosecutor’s Office, noting that in January 2000 M.M. had left Bulgaria and was in Spain, that it was impossible to establish the facts without interviewing him, and it was necessary to charge him as well, decided to stay the proceedings pending his return. On 11 April 2005, noting that on 28 March 2005 M.M. had come back from Spain, the same Public Prosecutor’s Office decided to resume the proceedings. 13. On 18 April 2005 M.M. was interviewed as a witness. He was interviewed again on 15 June 2005 in the presence of a judge. S.D. was also interviewed as a witness in the presence of the judge. It seems that neither M.M. nor S.D. were charged. 14. On 11 July 2005 Mr Dimitrov was allowed to acquaint himself with the case file. On 19 July 2005 the investigator recommended that he be brought for trial, and on 25 August 2005 the Plovdiv District Prosecutor’s Office indicted him. 15. The Plovdiv District Court (Пловдивски районен съд) heard the case on 18 May 2006. The prosecution and Mr Dimitrov stated that they had entered into a plea bargain. The court approved the bargain, sentenced the applicant to five months’ imprisonment, suspended, and terminated the proceedings. 16. On 11 March 1996 a criminal investigation was opened against Mr Hamanov, a bank branch manager, and several other individuals in connection with a number of financial transactions. After March 1996 the case went through a preliminary investigation, trial and appeal. Following a remittal to the preliminary investigation stage in June 2000, in April 2003 it was again pending before the prosecuting authorities. The detailed course of the proceedings up to April 2003 has been set out in paragraphs 1132 of the Court’s judgment in the case of Hamanov v. Bulgaria (no. 44062/98, 8 April 2004). 17. In September 2003 one of Mr Hamanov’s coaccused made a request under the new Article 239a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraphs 3840 below). On 31 October 2003 the Plovdiv District Court requested the Plovdiv District Prosecutor’s Office to send it the case file. On 6 November 2003 that Office forwarded the request to the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office, which was dealing with the case. 18. Apparently as a result of the above, on 10 November 2003 the Plovdiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office submitted to the Plovdiv Regional Court (Пловдивски окръжен съд) an indictment against Mr Hamanov and seven other accused. Mr Hamanov was accused of breaching his duties as bank branch manager by making thirtyfive unauthorised bank transfers, in breach of the applicable financial regulations, and by guaranteeing nine promissory notes, in breach of a resolution of the bank’s management board prohibiting branch managers from issuing such guarantees, and thereby causing the bank a pecuniary loss. The offences were characterised by the prosecution as abuse of office under Article 282 of the Criminal Code. Mr Hamanov was additionally charged with unlawfully acquiring and possessing ammunition. 19. On 30 January 2004 the court set the case down for trial. 20. Two hearings, listed for 26 April and 15 June 2004, were adjourned, the first because the State had not been properly summoned as a civil party, and the second because Mr Hamanov was ill and could not attend. 21. A hearing was held from 25 to 28 October 2004. On the lastmentioned date the court adjourned the case, finding that this was necessary in order to obtain the testimony of certain witnesses and experts who had failed to show up, and to hear additional witnesses called by the prosecution and the defence. 22. Three hearings, fixed for 23 February, 14 April and 13 June 2005, failed to take place, the first because Mr Hamanov’s counsel was absent, the second because another accused’s counsel had to be replaced, and the third because another accused was ill and could not attend. 23. A hearing was held from 26 to 30 September 2005. On the lastmentioned date the court adjourned the case, finding that this was necessary in order to obtain the testimony of certain witnesses and experts who had failed to show up, to hear additional witnesses called by the prosecution and the defence, and to obtain certain documents. 24. Two hearings, listed for 19 December 2005 and 23 February 2006, were adjourned because other accused and their counsel were ill and could not attend. 25. Two hearings were held from 25 to 28 April and from 26 to 28 June 2006. 26. The Plovdiv Regional Court gave its judgment on 29 June 2006, and handed down the reasons for it in March 2007. It convicted Mr Hamanov of guaranteeing the promissory notes, holding that this had amounted to wilful mismanagement contrary to Article 219 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 51 below), not abuse of office contrary to Article 282 of the Code. It acquitted him of the charge relating to the making of the thirtyfive bank transfers. In addition, it found Mr Hamanov guilty of possession of ammunition, but not guilty of acquiring it. In connection with the mismanagement, the court sentenced Mr Hamanov to four years and four months’ imprisonment and barred him from acting as a director of a commercial bank for four years and six months. In connection with the possession of ammunition, it sentenced him to a fine of ten Bulgarian levs. In determining the quantum of the punishment to be imposed in relation to the mismanagement, the court noted the following: “Bearing in mind the legal characterisation of the [offence] committed by [Mr Hamanov] ..., [his] dangerousness, [his] personality, the long period during which [he] was criminally prosecuted, and the need to attain the aims of the punishment ..., the court considers that [he] should be sentenced in line with Article 54 of the [1968 Criminal Code – see paragraph 50 below], under predominantly mitigating circumstances. The court finds that those circumstances were [the applicant’s] clean criminal record, his good character, the fact that [he] is in employment at the time of delivery of this judgment, [his] stable family and social situation, [and] the partial confession that he made during the trial. The aggravating circumstances [consist in] the perseverance, determination and coordination displayed by [Mr Hamanov] in carrying out [his] criminal acts. ... In view of the established caselaw that, when accompanying a sentence of imprisonment, [occupational debarment] cannot be shorter than that imprisonment, and bearing in mind the significant amount of time which has elapsed since the commission of the offence ... the court considers that is must bar [Mr Hamanov] from acting as a director of a commercial bank for a period of four years and six months...” 27. Between 10 and 13 July 2006 Mr Hamanov and the other accused, as well as the prosecution, appealed against the judgment. 28. On 17 May 2007 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal (Пловдивски апелативен съд) set the appeals down for hearing on 28 June 2007. However, the hearing failed to take place on that date because another accused did not have legal representation. It was held on 27 September 2007. 29. The Plovdiv Court of Appeal gave its judgment on 23 October 2007, fully upholding the lower court’s judgment. 30. Mr Hamanov and the other accused appealed on points of law. 31. The hearing before the Supreme Court of Cassation (Върховен касационен съд) was fixed for 4 April 2008, but was adjourned because the civil party had not been properly summoned and because another accused who wished to be present was prevented from attending. It took place on 9 May 2008. 32. The Supreme Court of Cassation gave its judgment on 9 July 2008, upholding the part of the lower court’s judgment concerning Mr Hamanov in its entirety. 33. Article 31 § 1 of the 1991 Constitution provides as follows: “Anyone charged with an offence shall be brought before a court within the time established by law.” 34. Under Article 130 of the Constitution, the Supreme Judicial Council is the principal body concerned with the administration of the judiciary (which, in Bulgaria, comprises the courts, the prosecutor’s offices and the investigation services). It has the power to, inter alia, appoint, promote, demote and dismiss judges, prosecutors and investigators (Article 129 § 1 and Article 130 § 6 (1)) and impose the harshest disciplinary punishments (Article 130 § 6 (2)). 35. A 2007 amendment to the Constitution added a new Article 132a, which envisaged the creation of an Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council. The Inspectorate, which consists of a chief inspector and ten inspectors, is tasked with checking the work of the judiciary without infringing the independence of judges, prosecutors or investigators (Article 132a § 6). It can act either of its own motion or pursuant to reports by private individuals, legal persons or State authorities (Article 132a § 7). It has the power to refer matters to the appropriate authorities, or make suggestions or reports to them (Article 132a § 9). 36. Section 7(1) of the 2007 Judiciary Act provides that “[e]veryone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal”. 37. Sections 4060 of the Act govern the structure, powers and operations of the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council (see paragraph 35 above). One of the Inspectorate’s tasks is to check the processing of cases and their completion within the prescribed time-limits (section 54(1)(2)). It carries out planned annual checks or unplanned checks prompted by reports (section 56(1)). After carrying out a check of the work of an individual judge, prosecutor or investigator, the Inspectorate draws up a report containing its findings and recommendations, if any (section 58(2)). That report is presented to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned and to his or her hierarchical superior (section 58(3)). The hierarchical superior must then, within the time set in the report, inform the chief inspector about the implementation of the recommendations (section 58(4)). 38. An amendment to the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure that came into force in June 2003 introduced the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial if the investigation had not been completed within two years in cases concerning serious offences and one year in all other cases (new Article 239a). Paragraph 140 of the amendment’s transitional provisions provided that that possibility applied with immediate effect in respect of investigations opened before June 2003. 39. The procedure under that Article was as follows. The accused person had to submit a request to the relevant court, which then had seven days to examine the file and rule on the request. It could refer the case back to the prosecuting authorities, giving them two months to submit an indictment against the accused or, alternatively, to drop the charges against him or her. If the prosecuting authorities failed to do so, the court was bound to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the person who had made the request. If the prosecuting authorities did submit an indictment, but the court found that the pretrial investigation had been tainted by serious breaches of the rules of procedure, the court had to refer the case back to the prosecuting authorities, which then had one month to rectify those breaches and resubmit the indictment. If they failed to re-submit the indictment or to rectify the breaches highlighted by the court, or committed fresh breaches of the rules of procedure, the court had to discontinue the criminal proceedings. 40. The 2003 amendment was put before Parliament with the reasoning that it was necessary in order to secure observance of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time guaranteed by the Convention. 41. In a judgment of 1 July 2010 (реш. № 340 от 1 юли 2010 г. по к. н. д. № 271/2010 г. ВКС, I н. о.), the Supreme Court of Cassation analysed in detail the manner in which Article 239a was to be applied and held that a failure to finalise the procedure under that provision did not automatically put in jeopardy the fairness of the ensuing trial. It was precisely during that trial – as opposed to the pretrial phase of the proceedings – that the accused would be able to obtain a determination of the criminal charges against him or her in fully adversarial proceedings conducted in line with the requirements of, inter alia, the Convention. 42. The 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure came into force on 29 April 2006, superseding the 1974 Code. Its Article 22 provides as follows: “1. The court shall examine and decide cases within a reasonable time. 2. The prosecutor and the investigating authorities must ensure that the pretrial proceedings are conducted within the timelimits laid down in this Code. 3. Cases in which the accused is remanded in custody shall be investigated, examined and disposed of as a matter of priority.” 43. Articles 368 and 369 of the 2005 Code, which superseded Article 239a of the 1974 Code, provided as follows: “1. If, in pretrial proceedings, more than two years have passed since a person has been charged with a serious offence, or one year in the case of other offences, the accused may request that his or her case be examined by the court. 2. In the cases envisaged in subparagraph 1 the accused shall file a request with the relevant firstinstance court, which shall request the case file immediately.” “1. The court, consisting of a single judge, shall rule on the request within seven days. If it finds that the requirements of Article 368 § 1 are in place, it shall return the case to the prosecutor and give him or her two months within which he or she must submit an indictment, a proposal for the imposition of an administrative punishment, or a plea agreement, or discontinue the criminal proceedings and inform the court accordingly. 2. If, within the abovementioned period of two months, the prosecutor does not carry out any of the measures referred to in subparagraph 1 or if the court does not approve the proposed plea bargain, the court, sitting as a single judge and in private, shall request the case file and shall discontinue the criminal proceedings by means of a decision. After the delivery of the decision the criminal proceedings shall continue with regard to the other accused as well as with regard to the other offences with which the accused has been charged. 3. If the prosecutor carries out [one of] the steps referred to in subparagraph 1, but the pre-trial proceedings have been tainted by substantive breaches of the rules of procedure, the court, sitting as a single judge and in private, shall discontinue the judicial proceedings and refer the case back to the prosecutor for rectification of the breaches and resubmission of the case to the court within one month. 4. If within the timelimit referred to in subparagraph 3 the prosecutor does not submit the case to the court or the substantive breaches of the rules of procedure have not been made good, or further ones have been committed, the court, sitting as a single judge and in private, shall discontinue the criminal proceedings by means of a decision. 5. The decisions referred to in subparagraphs 2 and 4 shall be final.” 44. On 25 March 2010 Parliament repealed Articles 368 and 369 with effect from 28 May 2010. 45. On 29 April 2010 the President of the Republic challenged the repeal, along with certain other amendments to the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure, before the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 28 September 2010 (реш. № 10 от 28 септември 2010 г., по к. д. № 10/2010 г., обн., ДВ, бр. бр. 80 от 12 октомври 2010 г.) that court examined the repeal by reference to, inter alia, Article 13 of the Convention. It noted that, unlike Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Bulgarian Constitution did not explicitly lay down as a basic right the right of those charged with criminal offences to have the charges against them examined and to have the criminal proceedings against them finalised within a reasonable time. However, it analysed in detail the terms of Article 31 § 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 33 above) and held that that provision was to be construed as containing a procedural obligation to comply with the statutory timelimits for conducting and finalising the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings, with a view to bringing those charged with criminal offences to trial. It thus served the same purpose as Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, albeit only in relation to the first phase of criminal proceedings. The court continued: “As noted above, the [abolished remedy] was intended to serve as an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention in order to ensure the right to have a criminal case examined within a ‘reasonable time’ during the pretrial phase of the proceedings. The Constitutional Court finds that the repeal of that remedy is not unconstitutional, because it does not remove the disciplining procedural timelimits envisaged under Article 31 § 1 of the Constitution. Statutory limitations on the duration of the two parts of the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings – ‘investigation’ and ‘steps to be taken by the prosecutor after the investigation has been completed’ – still exist and continue to be applied. ... The repealed ... Articles 368 and 369 of the Code contained the implicit assessment of the legislature that, in view of the need to complete criminal proceedings within a reasonable time, it was unacceptable for a person to remain charged in pretrial proceedings for more than two years in cases of serious offences and for more than one year in cases of lesser offences. In most cases those timelimits would be longer than the sum of the timelimits under Article 234 §§ 15 and Article 242 § 3 of the Code. An exception could occur only if the duration of the investigation was extended, exceptionally, to more than six months by the head of a regional or higher prosecutor’s office or a person designated by him or her (Article 234 § 3 of the Code). Only then would the repeal lead to a restriction of a procedural right and raise the question whether, in the light of Article 31 § 4 of the Constitution and Article 18 of the Convention, that restriction did not exceed what was required for the administration of justice. The Constitutional Court does not accept the argument that the legislative change destroys the right of the accused to have their cases examined within a ‘reasonable time’, as required under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure laid down the basic principle that cases are to be examined and decided within a reasonable time, requiring the authorities in charge of pretrial investigations to comply with procedural timelimits (Article 22 of the Code). The constitutional amendments in 2006 and the new [Judiciary Act], adopted in 2007, put in place additional safeguards for the faster examination of cases and for avoiding their undue protraction. The repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not affect that system of rules. Its aim was to improve the law in order to ensure good justice, which is [a legitimate aim]. The main weakness of the repealed procedure was that it used a formal, purely quantitative criterion to measure ‘reasonable time’ during the pretrial phase of the proceedings. It is true that in most cases such an approach would lead to a correct assessment – something fully logical in view of the fact that under the rules of procedure a person can be charged only if there already exists ‘enough evidence’ that he or she is guilty. However, in some complex cases that criterion might, contrary to the public interest that all offenders be brought to justice, give the accused an undue advantage – for instance in cases in which it proves to be genuinely difficult to trace and charge accomplices, cases in which the need arises to gather additional evidence, including through letters rogatory, cases in which the accused has slowed down the proceedings, etc. It is no wonder that the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention is quite flexible. That Court uses three criteria to assess the relevant period: the factual and legal complexity of the case, the conduct of any authorities involved and the conduct of the person concerned [(see Eckle v. Germany, 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51; Zimmermann and Steiner v. Switzerland, 13 July 1983, Series A no. 66; Kreps v. Poland, no. 34097/96, 26 July 2001; and S.H.K. v. Bulgaria, no. 37355/97, 23 October 2003)]. It is equally possible to exceed a reasonable time while formally complying with the applicable timelimits and to comply with the ‘reasonable time’ requirement while exceeding the applicable timelimits. The European Court of Human Rights finds breaches of the ‘reasonable time’ requirement only on the basis of delays attributable to the authorities. In view of that, the Constitutional Court considers that by repealing [Articles 368 and 369] of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure the legislature sought to achieve a constitutionally legitimate aim – to ensure the interests of justice while taking into account the right to ‘a hearing within a reasonable time’, as construed by the European Court of Human Rights. In so far as in exceptional cases the new legal framework could restrict the rights of the accused, one should take into account that there exists a balancing mechanism, namely the requirement under Article 234 §§ 8 and 9 of the [Code] for all preventive measures [such as pretrial detention or house arrest] to be set aside after the expiry of timelimits that are identical to those under the repealed provisions. It is also important to examine whether the repeal of the possibility for accused persons to request that their case be brought for trial does not create a lacuna in the law, in breach of the requirement of Article 13 of the Convention for effective remedies in respect of the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention and in particular the right of those charged with criminal offences to have their cases examined within a reasonable time. In its caselaw the European Court of Human Rights has held that remedies are effective if they can prevent the alleged violation or its continuation, or provide adequate redress for any violation that has already occurred [(see Kudła v. Poland [GC], no. 30210/96, § 158, ECHR 2000XI)]. In a number of judgments, that Court has noted that before the introduction of Article 239a of the [1974] Code of Criminal Procedure our State did not make available a remedy complying with the requirements of Article 13, read in conjunction with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and capable of ensuring that the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings does not exceed a reasonable time [(see Osmanov and Yuseinov v. Bulgaria, nos. 54178/00 and 59901/00, 23 September 2004; Mitev v. Bulgaria, no. 40063/98, 22 December 2004; and Sidjimov v. Bulgaria, no. 55057/00, 27 January 2005)]. In those circumstances, the answer to the above question depends on whether, from the creation of that remedy in 2003 until its abolition in 2010, the State has created alternative mechanisms ensuring the availability of effective remedies in respect of the right to have charges examined within a reasonable time during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings. In [our] view, that has been done, as far as rules are concerned. An amendment to the Constitution [which came into force in February 2007] created a new independent body, the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, which may act pursuant to requests by the persons concerned, a category which includes those charged with a criminal offence. That Inspectorate checks the work of the judicial authorities and has the power to report and make proposals to all State authorities, including the competent judicial authorities (Article 132a §§ 6 and 9 of the Constitution). The Inspectorate’s powers have been laid down in more detail in the new [Judiciary Act]. It may now check ‘the way in which judicial, prosecutorial and investigation case files are being opened and processed, as well as their completion within the prescribed timelimits’ (section 54(1)(2) of the Act). Under section 58(3) of the Act, the results of such checks have to be made available not only to the judge, prosecutor or investigator concerned, but also to the head of the relevant department of the judiciary. That head must then inform the chief inspector whether any recommendations given have been complied with within the timelimit set in the Inspectorate’s report (section 58(4) of the Act). If it is necessary to prevent or overcome an undue delay during the pretrial phase of criminal proceedings, the authority in charge of ensuring compliance with the Inspectorate’s directions is the head of the relevant department of the prosecuting authorities. He or she has the power to take various measures: organisational (under section 136(4) of the Act), disciplinary (to impose certain light sanctions under section 311(1) of the Act or to initiate disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council) and procedural (to set aside or vary the decisions of the lower prosecutors, to give mandatory directions or personally to take the necessary procedural steps, as possible under Article 46 § 3 of the [2005] Code of Criminal Procedure, [or] to exercise control over the activities of the investigating authorities in line with Articles 196 and 197 of the [same Code]). It can therefore be accepted that the repeal of [Articles 368 and 369 of the Code] does not lead to a legal vacuum incompatible with Article 13 of the Convention. Naturally, the mere existence of rules does not preclude the risk of future judgments in which the European Court of Human Rights will find violations in respect of Bulgaria. All State authorities must take into account the general statement made in Kudła, cited above, namely that the remedy required by Article 13 must be effective in practice as well as in law.” 46. Section 1 of the 1988 State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (“the 1988 Act”), as in force since July 2006, provides as follows: “The State and the municipalities shall be liable for damage caused to individuals and legal persons by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by their organs and officials, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of administrative action.” 47. Section 2(1)(2) of the Act provides as follows: “The State shall be liable for damage caused to individuals by organs of [the investigation], the prosecution and the courts through unlawful: ... 2. bringing of criminal charges, if the person concerned has been acquitted or if the criminal proceedings are discontinued because the offence was not committed by the person concerned, or [that person’s] act does not constitute a criminal offence...” 48. Individuals who have been acquitted or had the proceedings against them discontinued on one of the grounds set forth in section 2(1)(2) – which, according to an interpretative decision of the Supreme Court of Cassation (тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2005 г. по тълк. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК на ВКС), include discontinuance because the charges have not been made out – can obtain compensation for the mere fact that criminal proceedings have been instituted against them. According to the same decision, compensation is due in respect of the proceedings themselves and in respect of any incidental measures, such as pretrial detention. The decision also says that compensation is due in cases of partial acquittal, where there is an established causal link between the charges in respect of which a person has been acquitted and the damage sustained. 49. In several judgments given between 2005 and 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation, when fixing the amount of damages it awarded pursuant to such claims, had regard to, among other factors, the length of the proceedings (реш. № 1599 от 22 юни 2005 г. по гр. д. № 876/2004 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 1017 от 15 декември 2005 г. по гр. д. № 524/2004 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 2851 от 23 януари 2006 г. по гр. д. № 2252/2004 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 429 от 30 март 2006 г. на гр. д. № 3163/2004 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 156 от 10 май 2006 г. по гр. д. № 2633/2004 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 1557 от 27 декември 2006 г. по гр. д. № 2800/2005 г., ВКС, IV г. о.; реш. № 1323 от 27 ноември 2007 г. по гр. д. № 1400/2006 г., ВКС, I г. о.; реш. № 148 от 11 февруари 2008 г. по гр. д. № 1518/2007 г., ВКС, V г. о.; реш. № 692 от 12 май 2008 г. по гр. д. № 2394/2007 г., ВКС, IV г. о.). The examination of those claims lasted between three and seven years in total. 50. Under Article 54 § 1 of the 1968 Criminal Code, when sentencing a convicted offender the court has to fix the punishment within the limits set by law, by reference to the Code’s general rules and taking into account the dangerousness of the offence and of the offender, the motives, as well as all other aggravating and mitigating circumstances. 51. Article 219 § 1 of the Code makes it an offence for officials or managers to fail to take due care in managing or keeping secure the assets entrusted to them, where such failure results in substantial losses, destruction or dissipation of such assets, or other substantial damage to the undertaking or the economy. The punishment can be up to three years’ imprisonment. Article 219 § 3 provides that if the offence has been committed wilfully, it is punishable by up to eight years’ imprisonment. Article 219 § 4 provides that if the offence is particularly serious, the punishment ranges between one and five years if the offence has been committed negligently, and one and ten years if it has been committed wilfully. 52. On 2 December 2010, during its 1100th meeting, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted an Interim Resolution on the execution of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights concerning the excessive length of judicial proceedings in eightyfour cases against Bulgaria (CM/ResDH(2010)223). The resolution reads: “The Committee of Ministers, under the terms of Article 46, paragraph 2, of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter “the Convention”), Having regard to the number of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (“the Court”) finding Bulgaria in violation of Article 6, paragraph 1 and Article 13 of the Convention on account of the excessive length of judicial proceedings and the absence of an effective remedy in this regard (see Appendix III to this resolution); Recalling that excessive delays in the administration of justice constitute a serious danger, in particular to respect for the rule of law and access to justice; Recalling also its Recommendation Rec(2010)3 to member states on the need to improve the effectiveness of domestic remedies for excessive length of proceedings, and emphasising the importance of this question where judgments reveal structural problems likely to give rise to a large number of further similar violations of the Convention; Having examined the information supplied by the Bulgarian authorities concerning the measures taken or envisaged in response to those judgments (see Appendix I), including the statistical data on the length of judicial procedures (see Appendix II); Assessment of the Committee of Ministers I. Individual measures Having noted the individual measures taken by the authorities to provide the applicants redress for the violations found (restitutio in integrum), in particular the acceleration, as far as possible, of proceedings which were still pending after the findings of violations by the Court; Noting however with concern that the domestic proceedings in seven cases are still pending before the domestic courts and that the authorities have been unable to provide information about two other cases (see Appendix I); CALLED UPON the Bulgarian authorities to provide for acceleration as much as possible of the proceedings pending in these cases, in order to bring them to an end as soon as possible, and to inform it of the progress of proceedings in the two afore-mentioned cases; II. General measures 1) Measures aimed at reducing the length of judicial proceedings Noting the numerous violations found by the Court on account of the excessive length of civil and criminal proceedings in Bulgaria, revealing certain structural problems in the administration of justice at the time of the relevant facts; Welcoming the numerous legislative reforms adopted by the authorities in order to remedy these structural problems and in particular the adoption of the new codes of criminal and civil procedure (see Appendix I); Welcoming likewise the other measures taken by the authorities to increase the efficiency of the judicial system, and in particular the establishment of assessment and monitoring mechanisms, including the collection and analysis of statistical data; Noting that the 2009 statistics show a reduction in the backlog in the Bulgarian courts as a whole, and an increase in the number of cases dealt with in the space of 3 months (see Appendix II); Noting however that, according to the statistics, the backlog in the district courts located in regional centres has increased slightly by reason of the substantial rise in the number of cases registered, and that those courts were responsible for examining half the cases pending in the country in 2009 (see Appendix II); Noting also that the legislative reforms introduced between 2006 and 2010 have not yet produced their full impact on the length of proceedings and that a longer period of time is needed before the effectiveness of all the measures taken can be fully and completely assessed; ENCOURAGED the Bulgarian authorities to pursue their efforts in following up the reforms introduced, in order to consolidate their positive effects, in particular as regards the situation in the district courts located in regional centres; CALLED ON the authorities to continue to monitor the effects of these reforms as it proceeds, with a view to adopting, if appropriate, any further measure necessary to ensure its effectiveness, and to keep the Committee informed of the developments in this regard; 2) Measures relating to the effectiveness of remedies Recalling that the Court has found numerous violations of the right to an effective remedy in contesting the excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria, revealing certain structural problems in this field; Recalling its Recommendation Rec(2010)3 encouraging states to introduce remedies making it possible both to expedite proceedings and to grant compensation to interested parties for damage suffered; Noting with interest that Articles 25557 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide that, if a court does not take a procedural step in due time, the parties may at any time apply to the superior court for a time-limit to be set for the taking of the procedural step in question, thus affording a remedy designed to speed up the civil proceedings (see Appendix I); Noting also that there exist in criminal law certain forms of nonpecuniary redress, such as the possibility of reducing the sanction, where there is a finding of excessive length of proceedings; Noting however that at the present time no domestic remedy is available for expediting excessively lengthy criminal proceedings or obtaining pecuniary compensation if appropriate (see Appendix I); Welcoming in this context the reform undertaken by the authorities aimed at introducing into Bulgarian law a compensatory remedy where excessive length of judicial proceedings is alleged (see Appendix I); INVITED the Bulgarian authorities to complete as soon as possible the reform undertaken in order to introduce a remedy whereby compensation may be granted for prejudice caused by excessive length of judicial proceedings, and to keep the Committee informed of its progress and of any other measure that may be envisaged in this field; Having regard to the foregoing, the Committee of Ministers DECIDED to resume its examination of progress made at the latest: – by the end of 2011, with regard to the question of effective remedy; – by mid2012, with regard to the question of the excessive length of judicial proceedings.” 53. An appendix to the resolution summarised the information provided by the Bulgarian Government on the measures taken by the Bulgarian authorities in that domain. It reads: “I. Individual measures The proceedings which were still pending before the domestic courts at the time when the Court gave its judgments have been terminated in most of the cases. At the present time, the proceedings have not yet been terminated in the Belchev, Hamanov, Nedyalkov, Valkov, Kamburov, Kavalovi and Merdzhanov cases. Information is still awaited also on the state of progress in the proceedings in the Kolev and Sidjimov cases. II. General measures 1) Measures aimed at reducing the length of proceedings – Legislative measures ... A new Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCrP”), adopted in 2005, came into force on 29 April 2006. Like the new CCvP, it aims in particular to speed up criminal proceedings. For example, it prescribes short time-limits for the examination of a case and for postponement of its examination (Articles 252, 271 and 345) and the more widespread use of simplified procedures (Articles 356361, 362367 and 370374). According to the 2009 report of the president of the Supreme Court of Cassation on the work of the courts, the simplified judicial procedures most often used in 2009 in the field of criminal justice related to summary judicial investigation and plea bargaining between the accused and the prosecution (an agreement enabling the prosecution to be terminated provided the court approves). The other important provisions of the CCrP provide for: – the obligation on the courts and bodies responsible for the preliminary investigation to examine criminal cases within a reasonable time; in addition, cases in which the accused is held in detention must be given priority over other cases by the courts examining and judging them (Article 22); – time-limits for termination of the preliminary investigation and prohibition on the use in court of any evidence obtained outside the time-limit (Article 234); – the introduction of summary judicial investigation in courts of first instance; this procedure makes it possible for the accused to obtain a reduction of sentence if he admits the offence and relinquishes the production of evidence, provided he is assisted by counsel (where necessary appointed by the court); – broader applicability of the simplified procedure whereby the accused may be absolved of his criminal responsibility and an administrative penalty imposed instead. Furthermore, the 2005 CCrP was amended in 2010 for the purpose, in particular, of avoiding (a) unjustified referrals at the preliminary investigation stage (Article 249 § 3) and (b) postponement of the hearing where the representative of the accused fails to appear without good reason (Article 94). In addition, it is to be noted that now the possibility for the prosecution to bring further charges during the judicial investigation has been widened, even if those charges relate to different facts or an offence carrying a more severe penalty (Article 287 § 1). Some other changes are aimed at reducing the excessive formalism of criminal procedure in Bulgaria (for example, the abrogation of the requirement that the investigator draws up a formal document setting out his conclusions – Articles 231235). – Administrative measures designed to improve the organisation and management of the courts Among other reforms designed to improve the efficiency of the Bulgarian judicial system, should be mentioned the creation in 2007 of an electronic commercial register managed by an administrative agency (see the commercial register law in force since 1 July 2007). Thus the regional courts which were responsible for registering commercial companies in the past have been absolved of that responsibility. Furthermore, following the adoption of the new Code of Administrative Procedure in 2006, 28 administrative courts were set up in 2007. These new administrative courts have powers previously exercised by the regional courts. In addition, as an ad hoc measure aimed at lightening the workload of the Supreme Court of Cassation, labour disputes pending before it when the 2007 CCvP came into force have been transferred to the appeal courts. It should also be pointed out that the judicial authorities now have access to the national database containing the population register, which should overcome certain delays arising from requests for information needed to take judicial proceedings forward. Finally, Bulgaria has achieved a high level of computerisation designed to assist both judges and other personnel (for further details, see the 2010 report of the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice – CEPEJ). Moreover, the courts are continuing their efforts to improve their IT equipment in order to communicate with parties. Those efforts were recently rewarded by the award of the 2010 “Crystal Scales of Justice” prize to the Yambol administrative court for the work it has done to improve users’ understanding of judicial procedure. – Mechanisms for periodic assessment and monitoring of the work of the courts Two bodies – the Supreme Judicial Council Inspectorate and the Ministry of Justice Inspectorate – have the main responsibility for monitoring and assessing the work of the courts, prosecution services and investigating magistrates. The Supreme Judicial Council Inspectorate, established in 2007, comprises an inspectorgeneral and ten inspectors elected by Parliament for terms of five and four years respectively (Article 132a of the Constitution). It oversees the administrative organisation of the courts, prosecution services and bodies in charge of preliminary investigations, together with the proper organisation of preliminary investigations and cases pending before prosecutors and courts. In particular, the inspectorate oversees compliance with the time-limits laid down by law for dealing with cases. It carries out its tasks (a) through planned regional inspections and (b) through inspections focussing on particular questions. It may also conduct inspections in response to reported irregularities ([sections] 54 and 56 of the [2007 Judiciary Act]). Following inspections, it makes recommendations, particularly concerning compliance with the timelimits laid down by law for dealing with cases. Implementation of its recommendations is monitored in the course of followup inspections. The inspectorate may also make proposals to courts’ administrative authorities and to the Judicial Service Commission for the imposition of disciplinary penalties on judges, prosecutors and investigating magistrates (see “Disciplinary measures” below). The work of the inspectorate is covered in the progress report of the Supreme Judicial Council. The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate oversees, among other things, the manner in which case registration and handling are managed, as well as closure of cases within the legal time-limits. This inspectorate organises thematic controls in accordance with a programme approved by the Ministry of Justice. It may make recommendations and supervises their implementation in the course of subsequent inspections. The Ministry of Justice Inspectorate is also responsible for overseeing application of the new CCvP and CCrP. During inspections already carried out, it has observed some of the causes of procedural delays and made recommendations in this regard. Furthermore, the presidents of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court are required to present annual reports on the functioning of trial and appeal courts, in addition to annual reports on their own activities ([sections 114(1) and (2) and 122(1) and (2)] of the [2007 Judiciary Act]). Lastly, each year the Supreme Judicial Council centralises and analyses the statistics on the work of all the country’s courts (cf. Appendix II). – Disciplinary measures Under the [2007 Judiciary Act], systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down in procedural laws, and action or inaction such as to delay proceedings in an unjustified manner, are disciplinary offences ([section] 307 § 4). The Judicial Service Commission has the power to impose disciplinary penalties (other than comment and reprimand, which are imposed by the hierarchical superior) on judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The public bodies responsible for enforcing judicial decisions and the bodies responsible for entries in the land registry may be sanctioned by the Ministry of Justice ([section] 311). The authorities have stated that during the period 20072009 the number of disciplinary proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council rose steadily (13 in 2007, 28 in 2008 and 83 in 2009). By way of example, in 2009 seven judges and one head of administration were sanctioned, mainly for systematic failure to comply with the time-limits laid down by law. Among them, three judges were dismissed and three others had their salaries reduced by 10 to 25% for periods of up to a year. – Longterm strategies The Bulgarian authorities have adopted several strategies on judicial reforms. For example, a criminal policy strategy for the period 20102014 has been adopted, the principal objective being to further reduce the excessive formalism of criminal procedure. It should be noted that the amendments to the 2010 CCrP were decided on the basis of this strategy (see above). Further, in 2009 the government adopted a plan to eradicate the causes of violations of the Convention found by the European Court in its judgments concerning Bulgaria. That plan was drawn up by a working party which included representatives of the Ministry of Justice as well as human rights activists. Among the tangible results obtained on the basis of this plan, should be mentioned the working party set up to introduce an application for compensation in cases of excessive length of judicial proceedings (see below). In June 2010 the government adopted the strategy on continued judicial reforms in Bulgaria following its accession to the European Union. 2) Measures relating to the effectiveness of remedies ... – Remedy concerning speeding up of criminal proceedings The provisions of Articles 368 and 369 of the new CCrP, which incorporated Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP, envisaged the possibility for the accused to request referral of his case to the competent court once a period of 1 to 2 years, depending on the gravity of the charges, had elapsed since the start of the preliminary inquiry. The court to which that request was submitted could order the prosecuting authority to complete the preliminary inquiry within a period of two months or else bring the criminal proceedings to an end. In the Ganchev judgment (No. 57855, §§ 26-34, 12 July 2007), the European Court declared the complaint based on Article 6 § 1 inadmissible for failure to exhaust the domestic remedies, because the applicant had not availed himself of the remedy provided for in Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP. However, it should be noted that in another case examined by the European Court (Shishkovi against Bulgaria, No. 17322/04, 25 March 2010), the application of Article 239a of the 1974 CCrP was the cause of the closure of a criminal inquiry into illtreatment. In that case the European Court found a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. Articles 368 and 369 were abrogated as from 28 May 2010. The authorities indicated in this connection that the abrogated provisions had mainly served as a reason for terminating the criminal proceedings, without guaranteeing a full inquiry. They consider that new provisions relating to the possibility of imposing disciplinary penalties for systematic failure to comply with timelimits or for unjustified delays could be seen as a guarantee of expeditious criminal proceedings (for more details, see the Government’s reply to one NGO’s observations on this point on the Committee of Ministers website: DHDD(2010)335). – Compensatory remedy The European Court has consistently pointed to the absence in Bulgarian law of a remedy enabling compensation to be obtained for excessive length of judicial proceedings (see, for example, the Mincheva against Bulgaria judgment cited above, § 107). In this connection the Government has indicated that, in the context of implementing a plan to eradicate the causes of the violations found by the European Court in judgments concerning Bulgaria, it has set up a working party to prepare a bill amending the law on the responsibility of the state and municipalities for prejudice caused to individuals. This bill envisages, in particular, the introduction of an application for compensation in cases of unjustified delay in the proceedings. This working party has drafted a bill providing that the state may be held responsible, in addition to the cases already settled, where unjustified delay in civil, criminal and administrative proceedings are attributable to the judicial authorities. As regards criminal proceedings, it should also be noted that certain forms of nonpecuniary redress exist in cases of excessive length of proceedings, such as the possibility of reducing the penalties. This form of redress has been recognised by the European Court as an effective remedy in certain circumstances (Bochev against Bulgaria judgment of 13 November 2008, § 83).” 54. A second appendix to the resolution contained statistical data on the processing of cases in the Bulgarian courts. It reads (footnotes omitted): “I. Statistics on length of judicial proceedings before the Bulgarian courts 1) Data for Bulgarian courts as a whole The general trend which emerges from the data available shows that, despite a resurgence in the number of cases registered, the number of cases terminated for all courts is on the increase (in 2009 it was 4.59% higher than in 2007, and 15.46% higher than in 2008). Similarly, the backlog facing the courts as a whole decreased for the second year running. Thus the decrease in the number of cases pending at the end of 2009 is of 10.26% as compared with 2007 and of 2.35% as compared with 2008. The number of judges, taking all courts together, was 2,162 in 2009, 1.45% more than in 2007 and 1.74% more than in 2008. 2) Supreme Court of Cassation – Criminal bench One consequence of the entry into force of the 2005 CCrP was a fall in the number of cases registered, since judgments delivered on appeal upholding the judgments delivered at first instance are now not subject to review by the Supreme Court of Cassation. Thus, while the criminal bench had examined 3,950 cases at public hearings in 2006, the corresponding figures for 2008 and 2009 were 2,081 and 1,955 cases respectively. In 2009 the criminal bench registered 131 cases more than in 2008, and its backlog also increased (from 279 cases at the end of 2008 to 383 cases at the end of 2009). However, that increase in the backlog had no major effect on the length of proceedings before the criminal bench. Indeed, in 2009, the proceedings following appeals in cassation and applications for reopening of procedures took between 3 and 4 months, as in 2008. ... 4) Appeal courts The backlog in the appeal courts is constantly decreasing. The number of cases pending at the end of 2009 (1,713) decreased by 45.89% as compared with 2007 and by 22.28% as compared with 2008. 5) Military [courts] The same trend is observed in military [courts]. In 2009, the backlog decreased by 52.07% as compared with 2007 and by 35.20% as compared with 2008. 6) Regional courts and the Sofia City [C]ourt The creation in 2007 of 28 administrative courts, as well as an agency responsible for entries in the commercial register, led to a significant decrease in the number of cases registered by regional courts in 2009 (42.73% fewer than in 2007 and 2.64% fewer than in 2008). Cases pending at the end of 2009 numbered 23,392, a figure 31.76% lower than in 2007 and 15.99% lower than in 2008. 7) District courts located in regional centres The backlog in these courts at the end of 2009 had grown by 1.05% as compared with 2007 and by 7.03% as compared with 2008. This increase is due to the rise in the number of cases they had to deal with in 2009 (23.05% more than in 2007 and 18.29% more than in 2008), and despite a larger number of cases terminated during that year (28.36% more than in 2007 and 20.70% more than in 2008). In 2009 the district courts located in regional centres registered 285,547 cases; 94,317 cases were registered by the Sofia district court, i.e. 33% of all cases newly registered with the courts in this category. 8) District courts located outside regional centres The backlog in these courts at the end of 2009 had fallen (by 12.64% as compared with 2007 and by 7.54% as compared with 2008) notwithstanding an increase in the number of cases they had to deal with (11.30% more than in 2007 and 15% more than in 2008). This trend was due to the increase in the number of cases terminated in 2009 (16.47% more than in 2007 and 19.72% more than in 2008). It is also to be noted that in 2009, 92,541 cases were concluded within three months, a figure 22.88% higher than for 2007 and 25.71% higher than for 2008. ... II. Statistics for the length of preliminary investigations In 2009, cases in which the preliminary investigation was under way numbered 213,151, a figure 4% higher than for 2008. Investigations started during 2009 numbered 139,894, 6% more than for 2008. Investigations initiated during the year represented 66% of investigations under way in 2009. The backlog at the start of 2009 consisted of 73,257 cases being investigated. The backlog at the end of 2009 consisted of 52,511 cases being investigated (as against 59,048 in 2007). As regards cases in which the investigation was suspended, their number fell from 961,713 in January 2007 to 654,334 at the end of 2009. In 98% of these cases, the reason for suspension is the impossibility of identifying the perpetrator of the criminal offence.” 55. In Resolution 1787 (2011) on the implementation of the Court’s judgments, adopted on 26 January 2011, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe noted “with grave concern” the continuing existence of “major systemic deficiencies which cause large numbers of repetitive findings of violations of the Convention and which seriously undermine the rule of law” in some Member States of the Council of Europe. One of those was the “excessive length of judicial proceedings” (paragraph 5.1). The Assembly, in particular, urged Bulgaria to, inter alia, “pursue its efforts to solve the problem of excessive length of court proceedings” (paragraph 7.1 in fine).","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1957, 1985 and 1982 respectively and live in Otočac. 5. On 3 November 1991, during the Homeland War in Croatia, an arrest warrant, signed by the then head of Otočac police station (Policijska postaja Otočac) J.O., was issued in respect of M.S., the first applicant's husband and the second and third applicants' father, born on 23 June 1948 and of Serbian ethnic origin, who was suspected of having committed the criminal offence of terrorism. On the same day two police officers from the station, D.R. and J.R., went to the applicants' flat in Otočac and arrested M.S., who was taken to J.O. 6. On the same day, at an unspecified time, two other police officers from the same police station, D.V. and M.Č., took M.S. to the Police Department of the nearby town of Gospić and handed him over to I.O., the Head of the Gospić Operational Headquarters (Operativni štab Gospić). They saw I.O. handcuffing M.S. and then went back to Otočac. The whereabouts of M.S. have remained unknown ever since. 7. At the request of his family, M.S. was presumed dead from 2 November 1996 onwards by virtue of a decision of the Otočac Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Otočcu) of 26 March 1998. 8. The applicants allege that in the same period a number of individuals of Serbian ethnic origin had disappeared or had been killed in the area around the nearby town of Gospić. 9. In the days following the arrest of her husband by the police, the first applicant telephoned the local authorities in Otočac and Gospić on numerous occasions to enquire about his fate, but to no avail. 10. On 17 December 1991, after the first applicant had made enquiries to the Ministry of the Interior (the “Ministry”) regarding her husband, the Ministry sent an official letter to Otočac police station enquiring as to the whereabouts of M.S. since his arrest on 2 November 1991. On 18 December 1991 J.O. replied that M.S. had been arrested on 3 November at 11 a.m. and taken to Gospić County Prison (Okružni zatvor Gospić) the same day. 11. On 20 December 1991 the Ministry sent an official letter to the Gospić Police Department enquiring as to M.S.'s whereabouts. 12. On 21 December 1991 the Gospić Police Department replied that M.S. had been arrested by officers from Otočac police station and that the Gospić Police Department had not been informed of his arrest. They further stated that, to their knowledge, M.S. had been taken to Zagreb County Prison (Okružni zatvor Zagreb). Further to this, on 11 January 1992 the Gospić Police Department informed the Ministry that M.S. had never been detained in Gospić County Prison. 13. On 27 October 1992 the Ministry sent a letter to both Otočac police station and the Gospić Police Department enquiring as to the whereabouts of M.S. and whether he had been listed as a missing person. 14. On 29 October 1992 M.Č., one of the above-mentioned police officers from Otočac police station, drew up a report stating that after he had been arrested on 3 November 1991 M.S. had been taken to the Gospić Operational Headquarters and handed over to its head, I.O. He also stated that there was no further information as to M.S.'s whereabouts. 15. On 14 July 1999 the first applicant sent a letter to the Minister of Justice calling for an official investigation into the disappearance of her husband. On 4 February 2000 the letter was forwarded to the State Attorney with a request that appropriate steps be taken. The first applicant was served with a copy of that request, but received no further information. 16. The first applicant sent a second letter to the Ministry of Justice on 23 May 2000 seeking information about the steps taken in order to establish the circumstances of her husband's disappearance. 17. On 7 July 2000 the Gospić County State Attorney's Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Gospiću) ordered investigative measures in connection with the disappearance of M.S. and asked the Otočac police to conduct an interview with former police officer D.R. and former head of the police station J.O. about the disappearance of M.S. The Otočac police interviewed D.R. on 10 July 2000. He said that in the autumn of 1991 he and another police officer, J.R., had arrested M.S. in his flat in Otočac pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by J.O. They had taken M.S. to J.O. and left. 18. On 11 July 2000 the Otočac police informed the Gospić County State Attorney's Office that they had not been able to interview J.O. because he had moved to Zagreb. 19. In a letter sent to the Ombudsman on 2 February 2001, the first applicant complained that no action was being taken in respect of the inquiry into the fate of her husband. On 13 March 2001 the Ombudsman's Office asked the applicant to explain what exactly her request was. 20. On 14 June 2002 police officer, D.R., since retired, was interviewed at Otočac police station. He said that in November 1991 he had been a police officer at that station and that during that period M.S. had been brought to the premises of Otočac police station, where he had been briefly detained and then transferred to Gospić by two police officers, M.Č. and D.V. 21. On 15 June 2002 J.R., the aforementioned police officer from Otočac police station, made a written statement that on 3 November 1991 he and another police officer, D.R., had executed an arrest warrant and arrested M.S. in his flat in Otočac. They had handed him over to J.O. and left. 22. On 18 June 2002 former police officer D.V. was interviewed at Otočac police station. He said that he could not remember a person named M.S. but did remember having on one occasion, together with his colleague M.Č., driven an official police vehicle to Gospić, but could not say for what purpose. 23. The Otočac police informed the Gospić Police Department of the result of the interviews on 19 June 2002 and the Gospić County State Attorney's Office on 26 June 2002. 24. On 9 February 2004 the first applicant officially registered M.S. with the Otočac police as a missing person. On 19 March 2004 the Otočac police informed the Gospić police that M.S. had been listed as a missing person and asked them to carry out an inquiry because M.S. had disappeared on the territory under their jurisdiction. On 30 March 2004 the Gospić police asked the Gospić Prison authorities whether they had a record of M.S. having been detained there in November 1991 and whether I.O. had had any function at Gospić Prison at that time. 25. On 1 April 2004 the Gospić Prison authorities informed the Gospić police that M.S. had never been registered as having entered that prison and that I.O. had had no function at the prison, but had been head of the Gospić Operational Headquarters. 26. On 8 April 2005 the Gospić police asked the Ličko-Senjska Police Department (Policijska uprava ličko-senjska – the former Gospić Police Department) to request the Zagreb Police Department to interview I.O., who was now living in Zagreb. On 16 April 2004 the Ličko-Senjska Police Department duly made that request. 27. On 22 April 2004 the Zagreb Police Department interviewed I.O. He stated that during the Homeland War in Croatia, as an officer in the Croatian Army, he had arrived in Gospić on 30 August 1991 and left sometime at the end of September 1991. He had no knowledge of the arrest and disappearance of M.S. 28. On 7 May 2004 the first applicant asked the State Attorney to take steps in order to establish the whereabouts of her husband. 29. In May 2004 the State Attorney sent a letter to the Rijeka County State Attorney's Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Rijeci) stating that in September 2000 his office had already forwarded to the Rijeka Office a request that an investigation be carried out into the death of M.S., in particular in connection with the criminal proceedings opened in 1999 against a certain T.O. and other persons. The first applicant's submissions from 2000, in which she stated that she had received no information in reply to her enquiry about the circumstances of her husband's death, were enclosed. The State Attorney requested all information about M.S. that had been obtained during the investigation concerning T.O. and his accomplices. A copy of this letter was served on the first applicant. 30. On 3 June 2004 the Gospić County State Attorney's Office informed the Ličko-Senjska Police Department about the interview with I.O. and also said that the records of the Military Police Administration showed that I.O. had not been on their payroll. 31. On 18 June 2004 the Zagreb Police Department interviewed J.O. He stated that from September 1991 to 15 February 1992 he had been head of Otočac police station and that sometime in October or November 1991 an order had been given for M.S. to be arrested and taken to the Gospić Police Department for questioning on suspicion of having participated in the criminal offence of kidnapping a driver in the spring of 1991. He did not know who had given that order but was sure that it had not been him. J.O. also said that he had not seen M.S. when he was taken to the Otočac police but that he knew that M.Č., together with one or two other police officers, had taken M.S. to the Gospić police in a police car. He had no knowledge as to what had happened there but had heard rumours that on the same day M. S. had run away to the occupied territories. 32. On 13 July 2004 the Zadar Police Department (Policijka uprava zadarska) interviewed Ž.B., who had been Head of the Public Safety Operational Tasks Division of the Gospić Police Department (načelnik Odjela operativnih poslova javne sigurnosti Policijske uprave Gospić) in the period between 1 August and 30 November 1991. He had no knowledge of the arrest and disappearance of M.S. and had never heard of a person of that name. 33. On 24 August 2004 the Ličko-Senjska Police Department interviewed I.D., a retired police officer from the Gospić Police Department who said that he had not ordered the arrest of M.S. and that it had most likely been J.O. who had ordered it. He had not witnessed M.S. being brought to the Gospić Police Department. 34. In October 2004 the Deputy State Attorney sent a letter to the first applicant telling her that both the Gospić Police Department and the Gospić County State Attorney's Office had been ordered to take all necessary steps to establish the circumstances of her husband's disappearance. 35. On 11 November 2004 the Gospić County State Attorney's Office asked the Gospić County Court (Županijski sud u Gospiću) to hear evidence from witnesses J.S. (the first applicant), J.O., M.Č., D.V., D.R., J.R. and I.O. At hearings held on 23 and 24 November 2004 an investigating judge of the Gospić County Court heard evidence from all these witnesses, save J.O. All of them repeated what they had already said to the police. Further to this, on 10 February 2005 an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) heard evidence from J.O. He repeated the statement he had made to the police. 36. At the end of 2004 the first applicant wrote to the Vice-President of the Government, enquiring about the progress of the investigation, and the latter forwarded the letter to the State Attorney. In February 2005 the Deputy State Attorney informed the applicant that in November 2004 a request for an investigation into the disappearance of M.S. to be opened had been lodged with the Gospić County Court (Županijski sud u Gospiću). On 10 February 2005 the investigating judge assigned to the case heard evidence from a number of witnesses. 37. In August 2005 the first applicant's counsel sought information about the investigation from the Gospić County Court. 38. In September 2005 the Gospić County State Attorney's Office informed the applicant that those responsible for the disappearance of her husband had yet to be identified. The Gospić County State Attorney asked the Gospić Police Department to continue with their efforts to establish the circumstances of M.S.'s disappearance. 39. In December 2005 the first applicant's counsel asked the State Attorney to transfer the case to another State Attorney's office, objecting to the lack of impartiality of the Gospić County State Attorney's Office on the grounds that the investigation had revealed involvement on the part of the local authorities in the disappearance of M.S. 40. In January 2006 the State Attorney replied to the first applicant's counsel that he had asked for a report from the Gospić County State Attorney's Office and the local police. 41. In July 2006 the first applicant's counsel told the representatives of the OSCE Mission to Croatia that the investigation was ineffective. In August 2006 the Mission enquired of the State Attorney as to progress with the investigation. 42. At the same time the first applicant's counsel requested that M.S. be listed as a disappeared person with the Department for Detained and Disappeared Persons and provided information as to where his body might be found. Soon afterwards, the Ministry of Family, Homeland War Veterans and Intergenerational Solidarity (Ministarstvo obitelji, branitelja i međugeneracijske solidarnosti) informed the representative that three corpses of unidentified persons had been found as a result of exhumation at a graveyard in Vraneš. In connection with this the members of the Skendžić family gave samples of their blood. 43. In October 2006 the State Attorney's Office informed the OSCE Mission to Croatia that further information had been requested from the Gospić County State Attorney's Office. The latter ordered the local police authorities to undertake further steps in order to identify the perpetrators. However, no further steps were taken. 44. On 6 September 2007 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint about the ineffectiveness of the investigation. The proceedings are still pending. 45. In March 2002 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the Otočac Municipal Court seeking damages in connection with M.S.'s disappearance. 46. In a judgment of 6 May 2005 the Municipal Court established that M.S. had been arrested by the police and alive while in police custody and that therefore the State was responsible for his disappearance and death. It awarded the applicants each 230,000 Croatian kunas (HRK) for non-pecuniary damage in respect of their suffering for the death of a close relative, and also a monthly allowance to the first applicant until her death and to the second and third applicants for as long as they attended school. The relevant part of the judgment reads: “... the arrest warrant issued by the Otočac police station on 3 November 1991 in respect of M.S., on the basis of which he was brought to that station, and at the same time the lack of any evidence that M.S. was handed over to any other State body, leads this court to establish the defendant's responsibility. ... As stated above, the fact that there is no evidence that the Otočac police station handed the detainee M.S. over to any other State body is crucial for the question of the defendant's responsibility because the issue of control over the detainee includes taking of responsibility for his safety and for the protection of his physical integrity. The evidence given by the witnesses, in particular the police officers who participated in M.S.'s arrest and his transfer to Gospić, shows that their actions violated the detainee's fundamental human rights and freedoms guaranteed under the Croatian Constitution, which cannot be restricted even at the time of ... the immediate war danger ... as well as the rights guaranteed by the Code on Criminal Procedure then in effect. It has been established that the defendant, in addition to infringing the procedure prescribed by law, did not secure to the detainee the protection of his physical integrity and life, which resulted in his disappearance and presumption of his death. In such a way, it is clear that damage was caused by unlawful and incorrect acts on the part of the State bodies, namely, the Ministry of Interior ... ... This court has no doubt that the suffering on account of the death of a husband and father cannot be translated into money: it concerns just satisfaction so that the plaintiffs may be at least partially helped in regaining their mental balance, which was certainly upset by the loss of a husband and father. In assessing the amount of just satisfaction for the plaintiffs' suffering, the court has had particular regard to the circumstances and manner in which the deceased M.S. disappeared, and accordingly considers the plaintiffs' sufferings as being particularly serious. The court has taken into account that the deceased, M.S., was arrested by the legitimate authorities and that since he was taken from his home, his family – the plaintiffs – have had no further information about [his whereabouts]. Of course the fate of the plaintiffs' husband and father has given rise to an exceptionally frustrating and stressful situation for the plaintiffs as a family, in particular seeing that the family has never learned the complete truth about his disappearance. In her statement the first plaintiff vividly described the atmosphere of utter despair and uncertainty which the plaintiffs felt at the time when M.S. was arrested and then disappeared, stressing that she had taken tranquilisers because she had received no answers as regards the fate of her husband. The statement of the second plaintiff that as a six-year old child she had been constantly crying, that she and her brother had retreated into themselves and that she would like to know at least where her father had been buried so that she could attend his grave on All Saints Day was also moving. The third plaintiff, who was three at the time of [the disappearance of his father], stressed the strong bond between himself and his father and the time of his arrest and uncertainty about his fate, describing it as 'horrible in which he cannot remember a single nice moment.' It is clear that the mental suffering caused by the loss of a parent or a husband is immeasurable. In the case at issue the plaintiffs' suffering has an additional dimension owing to the fact that they still do not know the exact circumstances of M.S.'s death or the place of his grave.” 47. The part of the judgment concerning the award for non-pecuniary damage was upheld by the Gospić County Court on 12 January 2006, whereas the part concerning the monthly allowance was quashed. On 10 October 2007 the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) upheld the County Court's judgment concerning the award for non-pecuniary damage. This judgment was fully enforced on 29 April 2008. 48. The proceedings concerning the claim for a monthly allowance resumed before the Otočac Municipal Court, which delivered a fresh judgment on 11 February 2009, again awarding the applicants a monthly allowance, which was upheld by the Gospić County Court on 3 July 2009. 49. On 31 August 2009 the applicants sought enforcement of that judgment in the Otočac Municipal Court and an enforcement order was issued on 9 September 2009. 50. However, upon a request by the State on 22 September 2009, the enforcement of the judgment was adjourned on the grounds that the State had in the meantime lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, which was still pending.",['2'],[],[],[],[],[],1

MALTA,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed,David Scicluna;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"6. The applicants were born in 1952, 1954, 1961, 1960, 1964, 1963 and 1945 respectively and live in Malta. They are certified public accountants acting personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership Deloitte & Touche Certified Public Auditors & Accountants. 7. On an unspecified date the applicants were sued, personally and in their capacity as partners of the partnership Deloitte & Touche Certified Public Auditors & Accountants, as auditors of PCO Ltd, in a civil action by a company, V. The latter claimed that the applicants’ audit firm had acted negligently and fraudulently in its drawing up of PCO Ltd’s audit report/financial statements, and was therefore liable for the losses sustained by V as a result of its reliance on those documents. 8. During the proceedings the applicants raised a preliminary plea to the effect that reliance by V. on the audit report when taking a particular credit decision, and knowledge on the part of the applicants of such reliance when taking that decision, were lacking. These requirements were fundamental to this type of action. 9. On 1 December 2003 the Civil Court dismissed this plea in a preliminary judgment. 10. On 3 December 2003 the applicants requested special leave to appeal the preliminary judgment under Article 231 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (“COCP”). On 12 December 2003, the Civil Court in its ordinary jurisdiction granted leave to appeal. 11. On 29 December 2003 the applicants lodged an appeal. 12. On 8 June 2004, having heard the parties’ arguments, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal as out of time. It noted that while the legislator had clearly established that the time-limit for lodging an appeal against an interlocutory decree ran from the date of authorisation to appeal, in respect of an appeal against a “judgment” the legislator had made no distinction between a “judgment” and a “partial judgment” (sentenża parżjali). It followed that the twenty-day time-limit which ran from the date of delivery of a judgment according to Article 226 (1) of the COCP applied also to appeals necessitating prior leave to appeal. 13. On 17 September 2004 the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings before the Civil Court in its constitutional jurisdiction, claiming that such an erroneous interpretation by the Court of Appeal deprived them of access to court. 14. On 15 November 2006 the Civil Court upheld the applicants’ claims, finding that a right to appeal could not arise before leave to appeal had been given. Moreover, an appellant did not have to tolerate the delays of a court in giving leave to appeal. The Court of Appeal’s interpretation had therefore deprived the applicants of access to court in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. It declared the Court of Appeal’s judgment null and void. 15. On 2 March 2007 the Constitutional Court, on appeal by the Attorney General, acknowledged that the interpretation given to the law had been erroneous, thereby depriving the applicants of their right to appeal at an early stage. Nevertheless, it did not uphold the first-instance judgment, since a wrong interpretation did not suffice to lead to a violation of the Convention. While reiterating that an appeal could be heard before the Court of Appeal only once, it considered that the applicants had the opportunity to appeal in the civil case after the final judgment. Thus, given that a defect in first-instance proceedings could be remedied on appeal, the right to a fair hearing would similarly not be violated if a remedy which had been inappropriately denied became available at a later stage of the proceedings. 16. Article 231 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure (“COCP”) (Chapter 12 of the Laws of Malta), at the relevant time, read as follows: “Where several issues in an action have been determined by separate judgments, appeal from any such judgments may only be entered after the final judgment and within the prescribed time, to be reckoned from the date of such final judgment; and in such an appeal express mention of the judgment or judgments appealed from shall be made: Provided that an appeal from such separate judgments may be entered before the final judgment only by leave of court to be read out in open court; such request for leave to appeal shall be made either orally immediately after the delivery of such judgment or by application within six days from such judgment.” 17. The Article was amended in 2005, whereby the following phrase was added to the proviso: “and when such leave to appeal from such separate judgments is granted the time for the filing of the appeal in respect thereof shall commence to run from the day on which the said leave is read out in open court.” 18. Article 226 (1) of the COCP reads as follows: “An appeal is entered by means of an application to be filed with the registry of the Court of Appeal within twenty days from the date of the judgment.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

ITALY (No. 2),3,Violation of Art. 8 with regard to release of transcripts into the public domain;Violation of Art. 8 with regard to reading out of transcripts at trial;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,Christos Rozakis,"10. The applicant, an Italian national born in 1934, was the general secretary of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) from 1976 to 1993. From 1983 to 1987 he was Prime Minister of Italy. As of April 1994 (according to the applicant) or May 1994 (according to the Italian authorities), he lived in Hammamet (Tunisia). 11. The proceedings to which this application relates were part of the criminal proceedings brought by the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office during the so-called “clean hands” (mani pulite) campaign. 12. Between January and October 1993, the Milan Public Prosecutor issued twenty-six notices of prosecution (avvisi di garanzia) in respect of the applicant, in particular for corruption, dishonest receipt of money by a public officer, concealment of dishonest gain and offences against the legislation on the financing of political parties. 13. On 10 May, 10 September 1993 and 7 May 1994 the Rome Public Prosecutor also issued notices of prosecution in respect of the applicant for dishonest receipt of money by a public officer, offences against the legislation on the financing of political parties, corruption and misuse of public office. 14. The prosecutions against the applicant and other figures in politics, business and public institutions received attention from the media. 15. Amongst the cases against the applicant was that of Metropolitana Milanese, which concerned payments of large sums of money made between 1983 and 1992 by a number of firms to the representatives of political parties and the influence the latter exerted on the board of directors of the Metropolitana Milanese company with a view to awarding contracts to those firms in connection with works on the Milan underground system. 16. On 8 June 1994 the investigating judge committed the applicant and twenty-nine co-defendants for trial before the Milan District Court. The applicant was charged, in particular, with interference with freedom of contract and corruption. 17. The first trial hearing took place on 20 September 1994. The applicant was not present and the District Court accordingly declared him absent (contumace). Some of the accused requested and obtained a plea bargain, while the position of some other accused persons was separated from that of the applicant. The trial before the Milan District Court thus continued only against the applicant and five co-defendants. The Metropolitana Milanese company joined the proceedings as a civil party. 18. In a decision of 7 July 1995 the Milan District Court remanded the applicant in custody. On 12 July 1995 counsel for the applicant informed the Milan District Court that he had learned of that decision through the press and asked for a copy of it. On 20 July 1995 the Milan District Court declared the applicant to be latitante, that is, to be deliberately evading the court's jurisdiction. 19. The applicant appealed against the decision of 7 July 1995. In an order of 25 September 1995, the Milan District Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. The court held that once the preliminary investigation was completed it was for the trial court to consider whether there were substantial indications of guilt and whether in particular there was still a danger that the applicant would abscond. In this respect the court noted that since 5 May 1994 it had been impossible to find the applicant in Italy and that in the various proceedings brought against him a number of coercive measures had been ordered that could not be enforced. Moreover, in judgments of 29 July 1994 and 7 December 1994 the applicant had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment. In the District Court's view, the applicant's lengthy stay abroad demonstrated his determination to evade the coercive measures ordered against him in 1994. 20. On 17 and 19 July 1995 the Public Prosecutor sought an order for the interception of the applicant's telephone calls between Italy and his home in Hammamet. The interceptions were aimed at gathering information with a view to arresting the applicant. 21. In a decision of 21 July 1995 the Milan District Court allowed those applications with a view to facilitating the arrest of the applicant. The court noted that the interceptions had a legal basis and were essential to supervise the applicant's movements and his personal and international relations which had allowed him to continue absconding. The interceptions, carried out by a specialist branch of the Italian police, began on 20 July 1995 and were concluded on 30 September 1995. 22. At the same time, the Public Prosecutor sought an order for the interception of the applicant's telephone calls between Italy and his home in Hammamet in the context of a set of criminal proceedings for defamation which were pending against the applicant. The Milan investigating judge allowed the interceptions with a view to gathering evidence against the applicant and to identifying the accomplices. The interceptions, carried out by a specialist branch of the Italian police, began on 1 August 1995. The prosecution applied for four extensions of the duration of the interceptions, which were allowed by the investigating judge on 4 and 12 August, and on 1 and 14 September 1995. A request for a further extension was refused on 30 September 1995. The interceptions were thus concluded on 3 October 1995. 23. At the hearing on 29 September 1995 in the case of Metropolitana Milanese, the Public Prosecutor in charge of the applicant's case, Mr Paolo Ielo, filed the transcripts of the telephone interceptions with the registry and asked that they be admitted as evidence against the applicant. The prosecution argued that they were necessary to assess the applicant's personality in order to determine the sentence if he were convicted, and that they could support the prosecution's allegation that the applicant intended to continue to abscond. The prosecution subsequently read out in court certain extracts of interceptions with a view to proving: a) that the applicant could leave Hammamet; b) that the applicant had started or influenced two virulent press campaigns against a magistrate of the Milan District Court and against an Italian political party; c) that the applicant was collecting information concerning certain politicians and magistrates, with a view to damaging their reputation; d) that the applicant continued to show aggressiveness towards the magistrates who were investigating him. The Public Prosecutor compared the applicant's conduct to that of a “certified criminal” (criminale matricolato) who attacked all those who had done their job and had tried to do it well. The Public Prosecutor declared that the transcripts of the telephone conversations were at the disposal of the District Court and of the defendants. 24. The transcript of the speech given by Mr Ielo at the hearing of 29 September 1995 reads as follows: “I am submitting these further pleas under Article 507. I have already explained why I intend to submit these documents, which consist, firstly, of assessments of Craxi's criminal potential, within the meaning of Article 133, with reference in particular to his conduct after the offence was committed, and, secondly, of assessments as to whether the measure affecting his personal freedom should be maintained for the reasons for which it was decided on, and whether it should be extended for other reasons. I shall try to be extremely brief, although what I have to say will take a little time. I have tried to divide the documents submitted according to subject-matter, and have put together the telephone transcripts - the documents include the measures authorising the telephone tapping and the confiscation orders, which were moreover confirmed by the tribunale della libertà [the court responsible for deciding on the justification for measures restricting personal freedom or property rights]. The first set consists of telephone transcripts and clearly shows that Craxi can move about in Hammamet. This seems self-evident, yet Craxi is someone who, during the proceedings - all the proceedings taking place in Milan - said he had a legitimate reason for not attending and sent doctors' certificates. First he complained that the trials were not taking place, and now that the trials are taking place he wants them postponed on the grounds that he has a legitimate reason for being unable to attend. It is absolutely clear from these telephone transcripts that Craxi is someone who is able to move from the address of the subscription to the telephone line on which he receives calls. Why is this important? The reason is clear: Craxi is such a liar that he continues to lie even before the courts, saying things that are untrue and belied by documentary evidence. The second point concerns Craxi as a danger to the community, in particular his capacity to operate in the current situation, and become involved in the processes whereby public opinion is shaped and in other processes, which I shall discuss. In my opinion, two operations are particularly important - two press campaigns which were co-ordinated ... or at any rate two press campaigns in which Craxi clearly played an important role. The first is a recent one: I am referring to the telephone calls on 14 September 1995 - I apologise for the vulgarity, but I am reporting the speech of others and am not responsible. Subscriber Craxi, talking to Luca Iosi, says, 'the son of the hero' - the reference to Di Pietro is clear. An incomprehensible sentence 'He contributes to the tune of 2,400,000 a year, no less, when it all comes out.' Luca Iosi says, 'Now we take the wraps off the case and then we shoot him in the balls.' A week later the front page news is: 'Di Pietro too, has a house in the centre for 240,000.' The second press campaign was co-ordinated directly from Hammamet. It is the press campaign that was waged in Italia Settimanale, whose editor is Alessandro Caprettini. What happened? In a nutshell, Craxi sent Alessandro Caprettini a file on the [Northern] League, concerning alleged arms dealings by the League, and Alessandro Caprettini willingly received and published it. What is particularly important is that, in my opinion, the file came from Craxi himself: it was found on Craxi's computer or, rather, on the computer in Craxi's office in via Boezio in Rome and, in particular, was referred to in the conversation between Caprettini and Craxi, in two respects. Firstly, the subscriber - when I say subscriber, I mean Craxi - says, word for word, 'In any case we can do more with them - we can investigate but we can also raise questions.' What he means is that they can be used to raise questions about the Northern League, an Italian political party receiving special attention from a fugitive from justice, who agrees with the editor of a weekly to launch a campaign of this type. The second important thing is: 'Of course I publish the article, and then I go to a prosecutor who is a friend of mine and say, “Hey, look into this affair, will you?” - but this is the sort of thing one does nothing about'. Further evidence that Craxi is a liar comes from an article in the Indipendente, which published the news that Craxi had denied being the author of the material sent to Italia Settimanale. I am producing this evidence to make it clear that when we talk of Craxi it is not like shooting at the Red Cross: we are talking of someone who is fully active and has a great capacity to influence the media. In this connection, there is a set of telephone transcripts which show that Craxi was in constant contact with journalists in a wide variety of areas. Let us now move on to the last three points which, I believe, deserve a minimum of attention. There is documentary proof, and proof from the telephone transcripts, that Craxi is mounting dossiers in Hammamet against some political activists. I am referring - with particular regard to the evidence that has been found - to dossiers against D'Alema. He is engaging in “dossierism” ... The President: What does the neologism mean? Compiling information or a dossier? The Public Prosecutor: Compiling information in order to attack someone's reputation. This is an activity that was also to be pursued against judges, including myself, but we shall discuss that later. I said “dossierism”, which consists in compiling information that can damage people's reputation. This is documented by the telephone transcripts. One alarming aspect, in my view, is that it provides further evidence of Bettino Craxi's criminal potential. I am talking about compiling dossiers of information designed to damage the reputation of certain eminent people, and I am thinking of D'Alema, Prodi and Del Turco, about whom I shall talk in connection with a specific note that was found in Craxi's office. The dossiers were mounted with a certain Tina Soncini Massari from Bologna, who is an old friend of Craxi's - by friend I mean someone with whom he had relations which were, I imagine, of a political nature - to the extent that Tina Soncini Massari appears on a list of presents that Craxi gave. She is a leading supporter of Gelli, and is known to the judicial authorities for having arranged to put the Bologna judicial authorities off the track when they were investigating the massacres, by bribing witnesses. In this connection, I can produce evidence that identifies Tina Soncini Massari: the order from the Bologna investigating judge, Dr Grassi if I am not mistaken, which shows that the most recent contact between Gelli and Tina Soncini Massari dates back to 1993, and which makes it clear that she attempted to put the investigators off track and bribed witnesses in the course of the proceedings. These are the sort of people Bettino Craxi, a fugitive from justice who is the subject of pre-trial detention orders, uses in order to hinder investigations. You will be able to see for yourselves what these documents contain, and I shall not dwell on them. What is significant is another note on Del Turco also found in Craxi's office. I shall read you out the beginning so you can understand what all this is about. The Italian Socialist Party administration has always helped to support the Socialist current of the CGIL [Federation of Italian Trade Unions]. Del Turco took over from Marianetti, and the flow of money never stopped. 'On average, Del Turco received 20 to 30 million a month from Balzamo. On the occasion of every election or conference, there were extraordinary payments for instance, and so it went on', and the note continues with information about the politician. There are also telephone transcripts of statements by Bitetto in which he appears to be talking about D'Alema ... These are statements that have been filed and can be seen by anyone: it is clear to all why they are important from a criminal point of view. Then there are documents that show that Bettino Craxi has, or at any rate had, relations with important members of the Italian institutions. I am referring in particular to the telephone transcript of 2 September 1995, during which the subscriber, Craxi, talks to Margherita - she is not identified, who says: 'Alberto told me that he attended a meeting between Arafat and Silvio, and they spent ten minutes talking about you alone. Arafat came to Tunisia to see you and told Silvio Berlusconi to tell you that he too would be happy to have you as his guest in Palestine.' Again in connection with the capacity for communication of the accused, Bettino Craxi, who I repeat is a fugitive from justice and the subject of an arrest warrant for corruption with aggravating circumstances, there is a letter which the State Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister's office sent to Craxi's secretary on 25 June, in which the State Under-Secretary to the Prime Minister's office writes: “Dear Serenella, what you feared has happened, although both Giachieri and Carbonoli promise their good offices and will put things right'. Basically, this concerns a recommendation addressed to the State Under-Secretary, who hastens to reply, saying ... Serenella is Serenella Carloni. And let it be clear that Serenella Carloni is nobody in her own right, and yet as Bettino Craxi's secretary she was still able, on 22 June 1995, to make recommendations concerning the allocation of service areas in Perugia. The last point on which I intend to dwell is the constant attacks by Bettino Craxi on those who investigated him. The right to defend oneself is sacred and culminates in a fair trial, but when it is exercised by attacking those involved in the proceedings, those who carried out the investigations, it is, in my view, proof of a very highly developed potential for crime. A note found in Craxi's office - Craxi's own office - you may, if you wish, in this connection hear Simonetta Carloni, who, I repeat, confirmed this - contained, among other pleasantries, a very precise reference in time in the form of Dell'Utri's release from prison - it is dated after Dell'Utri's release. Among the pleasantries, the note says: 'The Di Pietro case must become an exemplary case: we must get to the bottom of things because all the conditions are right. The usual logic of hitting one person in order to teach a hundred others a lesson. Forza Italia must regain its independence and this means it must not be subjected to the requirements of allies and exposed to dangers and uncertainty. There are key targets, particularly the Milan Pool [a group of Milan public prosecutors waging war on corruption]. We need to have the courage to call for its arrest before they do. We need to denounce the damage caused by the revolt. We must begin by using people as examples and waging war. We need to use parliamentary force in every way possible. This includes calling for enquiries with a lot of publicity and denouncing abuses of authority - by Craxi. There is the seizure of the parliamentary question from Maiolo, faxed by the Forza Italia parliamentary group ... Luca Mantovani, who sent it for information to Bettino Craxi two days later with a covering letter which says: 'I would point out, inter alia, that Maiolo has in the last few hours been collecting more documentation with a view to asking further questions in the near future about the management of the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office.' There are telephone transcripts in which we read: 'We need to bombard them in the press'. There are also attacks connected with what was published in Il Mattino. There is something for everyone - not just for the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office. There are attacks on other colleagues and references to other colleagues. A woman talking to Craxi says, 'He's bewildered too' and says that the person in question was used by the Milan group as a killer; she says she has heard from Biondi that the person coming down to speak is virtually in the service of Caselli. I will spare you all the rest because you can read it for yourself. I shall just read you one extract, partly because it concerns me and partly because it concerns these proceedings. 'So why doesn't someone else come?', with reference to Salamone, who is clearly involved ... he knows the truth of the matter. 'I think Milan stopped him.' 'I am about' - here it is the subscriber, Bettino Craxi, speaking - 'to denounce this Ielo. Both Borelli's statements against Mancuso and the statements by Ielo come under Article 289 [of the Criminal Code]'. He is speaking to a certain Salvatore, who has not yet been identified, but I hope very soon to identify him, who repeats, 'Yes, but he's dealing with it.' Craxi replies, 'He has nothing to do with this.' The person to whom he is speaking says, 'No, of course not. The minister's dealing with it.' The President: The public prosecutor is requested to bring the charges without making allusions or taking stands, or making comments of a personal nature. The public prosecutor: President, the charge is based on the premise that these telephone transcripts show, within the meaning of Article 133, behaviour - and this is where the accused, Bettino Craxi, has committed an offence - worthy of a certified criminal - it is the behaviour of someone who attacks all those who have simply done their job, because that is what they are paid to do and that is what they have chosen to do, and have sought to do it properly, but he doesn't care, he has to attack them and ... President: We have understood why the public prosecutor has asked for these documents to be produced. Public Prosecutor: The evidence submitted has been greatly summarised, President, because there is further material and I am at the disposal of defence counsel and the court. Ah, wait a minute - there are all the measures authorising the requests for telephone tapping and seizures; they are all appended. The President: Appended to the individual sets of evidence ... these pleas from the public prosecutor ... Let us begin to hear Craxi's defence counsel, who is the person most directly concerned, and then if the others want to intervene ...” 25. The applicant's lawyer requested to be granted access to the decisions authorising the interceptions and to all the documents to which the Public Prosecutor had made reference. He declared that he would have commented on them at a later stage, observing, anyway, that some of the facts imputed to his client could not be described as aggressive behaviours, being rather simple statements of the truth. 26. The District Court reserved its decision on the prosecution's request of admittance of evidence until the hearing of 19 October 1995. The transcripts of the telephone conversations intercepted on the applicant's line were made available to the parties immediately after the hearing of 29 September 1995. Mr Guiso, the applicant's lawyer, was provided with the file including all the transcripts and afforded the possibility of making written submissions. 27. Respectively on 2 and 9 October 1995, the two applicant's counsels (Mr Lo Giudice and Mr Guiso) were informed that the telephone interceptions had been filed with the Public Prosecutor's Office's registry. The applicant's counsels subsequently objected to the admission of the interceptions as evidence. In particular, they argued that contrary to Article 268 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter, the “CPP”) the District Court had failed to hold a specific sitting before the trial hearing in the presence of both the defence counsels and of the prosecution in order to select those interceptions that were significant and exclude those considered illegal. Further, the prosecution had failed to apply for an extension of the fifteen-days duration of the telephone tapping, so that those interceptions which had been carried out after the first fifteen days were illegal and could not be used. 28. The content and the name of the interlocutors of certain telephone conversations were subsequently published in the press. 29. In particular, ""L'Unità"" of 30 September 1995 published an article entitled “Dossier and conspiracies against Di Pietro [one of the magistrates of the clean hands team]"". It stated that the interceptions made on the applicant's phone showed that he was preparing a defamatory campaign against some political men with the help of a ""lady from Bologna"", who was a member of an illegal association of free-masons. Moreover, in one of the interceptions Mrs Margherita Boniver (an Italian politician) had told Craxi that Mr Berlusconi (the current Prime Minister of Italy) had had a conversation with Mr Arafat about him and that Arafat would have ""invited"" Craxi. In another telephone call, the son of one of the applicant's lawyers had said that ""the Minister"" would have commenced proceedings against Mr Paolo Ielo. 30. On the same day, as well as on 1 and 2 October 1995, L'Unità also published the following extracts from some of the intercepted phone calls. Conversation on 26 July 1995 with a certain Luca: Craxi (speaking with Luca): “This Salamone [the Public Prosecutor of Brescia] is another one who wants to make a show of himself, I am going to see whether there are elements to introduce a criminal complaint against him.” Conversation on 28 July with an unknown woman: Woman: “I'm in a telephone box in Rome. I saw that friend of yours from the Senate.” Craxi: “Why has this big friend of mine failed to say one single word?” Woman: “He leaves the comments to you. He is lost and says that this person had been used by the Milan group as a killer. He says that he knew from Biondi that the one who spoke is in practice a servant of Caselli [a well-known Italian magistrate].” Craxi: “Ah, yes?” Woman: “Concerning the story of the brother.” Conversation on 3 August 1995 with an unidentified friend: Craxi: “They should go and see. It should be established whether a magistrate can buy a Mercedes at a very favorable price. May he borrow money from a friend in order to pay his gambling debts? So all this is legitimate, it can be done. Let's put it in the law: magistrates may borrow money without paying legal interests.” Conversation on 14 August 1995 with an unknown man: man: “Next week I will provide you with all the things you asked me on kronos [a press agency], the most important thing [is] that, at least until one month and a half ago, I do not know if now he has been revoked, Prodi was a counsellor of its biggest company.” Craxi: “Ah, ah, ah, very well, give me all the data, please.” man: “Counsellor of its biggest company, one of the five members of the directing body was Prodi, so ...” Craxi: “Super, then I would like to have the material concerning that other thing ...” Conversation on 25 August 1995 with Mr Filippo Facci [a journalist]: Craxi: “... There are some pillars in Tangentopoli [term used by the press to design the corruption system disclosed by the clean hands inquiry] that stayed outside, they should be all those who stayed inside, then we can find the solution, but no kidding, I am not getting upset because of the apartment of D'Alema [an Italian politician who had subsequently been the Prime Minister of Italy] ... ” Facci: “Sorry, the phone fell while I was taking the book, pages 192 and 193, where it speaks about Giovannini ...” Craxi: “There is a tale, not really about that thing which will make a little scandal, but it will be a regular contract on which it was not possible to lay ... lies are others and this one Giovannini is another Greganti, close to D'Alema, fuck him. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Rome opened an inquiry for calumny, but the day of reckoning will come, son of ...” Conversation on 2 September 1995 with a certain Valterino: Craxi: “What is going on with the inquiry of Salamone? Now it does not concern Di Pietro, but myself?” Valterino: “These are saying that they brought papers against you.” Craxi: “What papers?” Valterino: “The papers concerning the search.” Craxi: “The papers concerning the search have nothing to do with Di Pietro.” Conversation on 2 September 1995 with lawyer Guiso: Guiso: “Di Pietro is in Cernobbio. Today Il corriere della sera says that he is nobody, and he had been recommended - and this is very important - by an agent of the branch of the American police investigating on financial matters. He is substantially accompanied by him, please consider that he had been three months in America and appears in Cernobbio, he should speak this morning on the subject “foreign politic, ethic and finance.” Craxi: “It's crazy, but it is the subject of the Mac Namara Foundation.” Guiso: “[This] shows that he was linked to America, not at all the uncertain future he had declared when he abandoned his post. Then, a journalist gave me a book with plenty of information. I cannot send it to you by fax as the characters are very small.” Craxi: “Send it to me to that address by DHL. To that address you know.” Conversation on 5 September 1995 with a journalist of “Il Messaggero”: Journalist: “Did you hear about the new Italian politicians?” Craxi: “Who are they?” Journalist: “Di Pietro.” Craxi: “A little adventurous trafficker (avventuriero trafficante).” Conversation on 6 September on Craxi's line in Hammamet. Mrs. Tina Soncini speaks with a certain Michele: Soncini: “I have interesting news to give him.” Michele: “He says you can send a fax.” Soncini: “I will send it tomorrow with some references to Bologna.” Michele: “Let's use a code, a slightly modified code, we know of what kind of persons we are speaking about.” Soncini: “I will send some telephone numbers ... I had been told that the mother is a very worldly-minded person.” Michele: “Newly rich, all this is useful for us, maybe also apartments ...” Conversation on 6 September 1995 with a certain Simona: Craxi: “The problem was to build up the physiognomy of the personage ... In sum, this is the clue, it seems he had made a number of things on which he was wrong.” Simona: “It is an enormous thing, there are ten documents per day.” Craxi: “The trials he made, I know about something, we should look at them, people say that the tribunal shut the door in his face, they speak about the preparation of some books by certain friends, ask to send them the list of the members of the publishing house.” Conversation on 11 September 1995 with Mr De Jorio, a journalist: Craxi: “You should speak with somebody who will come and speak to me. The problem ... is to have the hands free and to have information.” De Jorio: “We have some.” Craxi: “What is a newspaper like this doing, scandal and satire, isn't it?” De Jorio: “We were the sole newspaper is Italy which published documents on red gladio [a secret organization that the communist party was suspected to have built in order to achieve its aims during the cold war] ... judges have discontinued the proceedings on this matter.” Craxi: “It is not the only matter on which they discontinued proceedings, there is a systematic tendency to discontinue proceedings concerning the communist party.” De Jorio: “Do you know what we have discovered? That apart from Pio La Torre, also the gangster Felice Cavallero Pollini was a member of gladio and had been trained abroad ... also the one of the gold of Dongo.” Craxi: “There are many things. They believe they have solved the problem with the scapegoat, they are under an illusion, they should have killed me, but as they did not succeed in this ... they tried twice, once the American intelligence, once the English one.” De Jorio: “Mr. President, be careful, I know that here in Italy they want to organize [something], to come [over there] and take you, it seems they are offering 60 million [lire, which is approximately 30 987 euros] per person, within the intelligence, in order to take you and to bring you elsewhere.” Craxi: “All right, all right, try to do so.” De Jorio: “I am telling you this because a person I trust during his last meeting with me ... I know that a group Z has been constituted, kept in the shade of a free-masons organisation constituted by approximately 600 magistrates, and the head of this group would be Scalfaro [the President of the Italian Republic at the relevant time].” Craxi: “I heard about this thing, but I do not believe it, I am not convinced.” Conversation on 12 September 1995 with an unidentified journalist: journalist: “Will Salamone come [to see you in Hammamet]?” Craxi: “I have no idea. I am here, everybody knows where I can be found.” Conversation on 12 September 1995 with an unknown journalist: Journalist: “I will state that you said: “I have friends not only in the Arabic world and I think that in a European capital a center such as the Wiesenthal center will be built, [and this center] will investigate the judicial clans and all those who in these past three years had acted unfairly against me and against many other people.” Craxi: “No, that is not good. First of all it is not only against me, it is not the judicial clans, but all the clans including the judicial ones ... [a center which] looks after and will look for the truth ... So much truth which still has to come out.” Journalist: “Then I ask you the thing on Di Pietro and then you will answer “I'm writing a book which will be entitled “Mimì an Italian miracle.” Craxi: “No, I want to write, I want to write a little book, not a book ... It's too important.” Conversation on 21 September 1995 with Mr Pierangelo Maurizio, a journalist: Maurizio: “Now I'm working for “Il tempo”, and the television show of Gianfranco about Cinquestelle has started again ... I saw that thing about Enel [the Italian electric energy producing company].” Craxi: “This story on today's “Il giornale” is the end of the world, do you know whom the political personality I am referring to is?” Maurizio: “No, frankly not.” Craxi: “It's D'Alema, there is a statement [made by] Bitetto [a director of Enel who was accused of corruption and made statements calling into question the criminal liability of Craxi and other politicians].” Maurizio: “... about which you speak in your books.” Craxi: “I wasn't aware, there is a statement [made by] Bitetto exposing that years ago, but there is a continuity in the criminal offence, he took part in a meeting in Bari or Brindisi in which were present D'Alema, the regional secretary of PSI and others, where he, as a representative of Enel ... discussed the contracts for public works in Brindisi.” Maurizio “What about this statement?” Craxi: “I have it, I will forward it to you.” Maurizio: “Maybe, I will call you tomorrow.” Craxi: “Now a number of things will come out on that young man.” Maurizio: “They are getting a different turn ... all the things about D'Alema.” Craxi: “Those things from Venice are the less [important], there are other things ... I would like to be personally informed. I would like to have a fax number where I can send things to you.” Conversation on 23 September 1995 with a certain Rosario: Rosario: “The fax is broken, I would have liked to send you some extracts from yesterday's and today's newspapers concerning that little dog named Lulù [probably, the former Milan magistrate Antonio Di Pietro] and his son. Did you see them?” Craxi: “Yes, yes, thanks.” Conversation on 23 September 1995 with Roberto “Bobo” Craxi, the applicant's son: Bobo: “The thing will come out next Monday.” Craxi: “Not the next one.” Bobo: “Not the next one, also because next [Monday] there is the Andreotti case. It will come out Monday, it's 25 pages and they will anticipate it.” Craxi: “all right, it will be a hot week and they will be afraid.” Conversation on 23 September 1995 with Mrs Pia Luisa Bianco, a journalist: Bianco (speaking with Craxi): “The thing has already been paged up. I will forward it to you in advance ... we will put a big emphasis on it, we already have an agreement with Il corriere della sera in the sense that they will make big titles, don't worry because it is very well managed, you will see, it will have a big impact.” Conversation on 24 September 1995 with Mrs. Tina Soncini: Soncini: “Apart from these documents, I have a channel to acquire more detailed information, but I need that you organize an appointment.” Conversation on 25 September 1995 with a certain Luca: Craxi: “They should be attacked frontally, without fear, to Mancuso they are doing ... This Ielo is behaving like a pure mafioso, an arrogance from the power.” Luca: “There is no other alternative but screaming it in their face, we will do it, we will do it. Here everything is all right except for that little asshole of Intini [an Italian politician].” Conversation on 25 September 1995 with a certain Salvatore [probably Mr Salvatore Lo Giudice, the son of one of the lawyers officially representing Craxi in the Metropolitana Milanese trial. Mr Salvatore Lo Guidice, who is also a lawyer, acted as his father's substitute during some hearings]: Salvatore: “Yes, he will think about it.” Craxi: “He has nothing to do with this.” Salvatore: “No, sure he has, the ministry will think about this.” Craxi: “Because it's 289 [Article of the Criminal Code punishing the attempt to impede the functioning of the Constitutional organs].” Salvatore: “This is something up to him.” Craxi: “To introduce a claim calmly is one thing, but one cannot make all the comments and the political polemics, the speculation made by Ielo is a defamatory one.” Salvatore: “But now the serious point is to give him a hand. It is essential to break them on this Venice thing which is the only one they are afraid of, so as he has a number of suspicions, he needs it as he needs bread.” Craxi: “I am completely unaware of that story.” Salvatore: “I have a lot of material.” Craxi: “I will immediately deal with this matter, tomorrow I will send faxes and then I will keep [you] informed.” Salvatore; “Then, it is important to ask for the availability of the State.” Craxi: “Is it enough that it arrives immediately, then you will call when it leaves.” Salvatore: “We are doing everything very quickly, then I will go directly to Rome. In any case this one with whom we are working together can be trusted, then the serious thing is that he is using the same elements of Milan, therefore it would be a big mess if it comes out that with the same elements Milan failed to proceed, there are many ideas to be used.” Conversation on an unspecified date with a certain Mr. Paolo Farina: Craxi: “That one is an idiot, a first-class idiot.” Farina: “He was replaced by ...” Craxi: “He was replaced because he was incompetent.” Farina: “He was replaced by Andò.” Craxi: “He was incompetent.” Farina: “He tried to suggest that his replacement ...” Craxi: “Of course not ...” Farina: “They presented themselves as supporters of An [Alleanza nazionale, an Italian political party].” Craxi: “Precisely ... but that one is an idiot, an unpretentious personage, I do not know how he could have arrived there.” L'Unità also reported that in another conversation with an unknown person, Craxi had showed his appreciation for a recital with Pavarotti transmitted by the Italian television; when he had learned that his friend had not seen it, he had said: “Phone Rossella [the director of a news bulletin] and make them send the cassette to you.” 31. “Il Giorno” of 30 September 1995 published an article entitled “The attempts to create false evidence by the friend of the head of P2 [an illegal free masons association]”. It made reference to a telephone conversation that the applicant had had on 24 September with Mrs Tina Soncini, in which the discussion concerned “documents made ad hoc” in order to be sent to an editorial company. The article reported the links allegedly existing between Mrs Soncini and Mr Licio Gelli, head of the P2. 32. “La Repubblica” of 30 September 1995 published an article entitled “We will ask for the arrest of the [clean hands] Pool”. As far as it concerned the telephone interceptions, the article indicated the names of some journalists who had spoken with the applicant on the phone, and the content of the telephone conversation with Mrs Boniver reported by L'Unità. La Repubblica moreover reported the content of a phone call that the applicant had had with Mr Luca Iosi, his “speaker in Italy”, on 14 September 1995. The conversation at issue was interpreted as an attempt to attack Mr Di Pietro in relation to an apartment rented to his son. Its content was the following. Iosi: “The son of the hero contributes each year for 2 400 000 lire [approximately 1 239 euros].” Craxi: “So much... When will this thing come out?” Iosi: “Now we will make the case grow and then we will shoot them right in the balls [Italian expression which means to attack someone hardly], 200 000 lire [approximately 103 euros] in spite of the rent rates and formally in his own name only in order to put his son in it.” 33. La Repubblica also reported the content of some telephone conversations the applicant had had with Mrs Tina Soncini, with a certain Anna, with Mr Alessandro Caprettini (the director of an Italian newspaper), with Mrs Alda D'Eusanio and Mr Enrico Mentana (two journalists), and with a certain Ugo. Their content is the following. Conversation on 21 July 1995: Craxi: “Enrico, in this moment you are not helping me.” Mentana: “You mean, honouring the truth.” Craxi: “By reporting the things I am saying, for the Holy Virgin's sake, nothing more ... The boys from Giovine Italia [a political organisation] did something this morning.” Mentana: “I'm not aware of this.” Craxi: “Think about it, nobody was there, there were no televisions, now you should report this news, report this news at least, they were one hundred, they are good, I have sent a memorial of historical nature, something about the Giovine Italia of Mazzini [an Italian patriot] ... if you continue, you will see the little surprise.” Conversation on 24 July 1995: Craxi: “I should come as I came many times in Italy with moustaches: in fact I was coming with a wig and false moustaches ... Idiots.” D'Eusanio: “This is the moment to do something about the procedural guaranties, about the magistrates, about the pentiti, Contrada, Tortora [persons accused by pentiti in mafia trials], if you are not taking advantage from these occasions, there would be nothing you could do.” Craxi: “Let's say the truth, there are some gangs organising a push-off, real gangs.” D'Eusanio: “Bettino [nick-name of Craxi], there are idiots, inefficient persons, cowards.” Craxi: “no, no, they reached an agreement, and lack of courage is inside the information, as all this wouldn't happen if there weren't a number of cowards in the newspapers and the televisions.” D'Eusanio: “My director is a person who believes in nothing, therefore he is keen on his position and there is somebody protecting him and his friends [to continue] believing in nothing.” Conversation on 3 August 1995: Caprettini: “I believe, the funny thing is the following, you know what I am going to do, I will of course publish this thing, then I will address myself to a magistrate friend and then I'll tell him: let's investigate on this matter, so we'll keep the problem alive.” Conversation on 29 August 1995: Craxi (speaking with Ugo): “I can't understand what is going on in Italy, if we are going to the elections immediately or not; in the affirmative, there is nothing to do; in the negative, in eight months time we will sort out a socialist list, we will put a nice pink carnation [the symbol of the PSI] on it. I will make the socialist list being made, no kidding. This situation cannot be accepted anymore.” Conversation on 20 September 1995: Soncini: “I had information about this, it is hearsay, the father of D'Alema in 1941 was the Secretary of the Guf [University fascist group] of Ravenna, it is for sure.” Craxi: “I would like to have a more precise ..” Soncini: “I can provide you with the whole story, because after having caused the death of three hundred people, he told it to a journalist.” Craxi: “And then we will deal also with the betrayer.” Conversation on 25 September 1995: Craxi: “Send me a text.” Anna: “it is very important, I will send it to you and you will forward it to the Public Prosecutor of Venice, Mr Nordio ... Now the important point is to give them a hand, to attack them on this Venice thing which is the only one they fear ... this person who is working with us is somebody I trust, then the serious thing is that he is using the same elements of Milan, which will prove that with the same elements Milan failed to proceed.” 34. La Repubblica also reported the following telephone conversation current on 10 August 1995 between Anna Craxi, the applicant's wife, and Mrs Veronica Berlusconi, the wife of the actual Prime Minister of Italy. Veronica Berlusconi: “Anna, how are you?” Anna Craxi: “And how do you do, everything all right?” Veronica Berlusconi: “Everything all right, we arrived in Sardinia two days ago. The trip was extremely tiring ...” 35. La Repubblica noted that “the day on which Lady Veronica made her polite phone call to her friend, the husband of the latter had already been declared latitante [which means deliberately evading justice] by the Milan District Court”. 36. Il corriere della sera of 1 October 1995 published the content of a telephone conversation that the applicant had with a certain Salvatore, afterwards identified as Mr Salvatore Lo Giudice. The text is the following. Salvatore: “We should say we are ready to be heard. Because this is an interesting situation. I had a number of contacts with this magistrate.” Craxi: “All right. In the meanwhile I do not even know what these things are.” Salvatore: “It's obvious, but he knows that it is not absolutely irrelevant.” Craxi: “In view of a speech of a general nature.” Salvatore: “Correct. He knows that [this] has nothing to do with that other story; it's only stuff he inserted in order to come and hear you.” Craxi: “Send me a text.” Salvatore: “It's very important. I'll send it and you will forward it to Mr Nordio, Public Prosecutor attached to the Venice District Court. Do you have that note?” Craxi: “I did not even read it.” Salvatore: “Look at it, because it is a serious thing. There won't be any problem with Tunisia.” Craxi: “Here they are a little bit upset with Italy, in general. I will intervene.” Salvatore: “In this way, we will create a great problem for them, as this [person] told me very interesting things. For instance, he has consulted Digos [a branch of the Italian police], and you are in the list of latitanti. So a big contrast will be created, which would help us a lot.” Craxi: “Why?” Salvatore: “Because then we will be able to prove that the order declaring you latitante was arbitrary. So, if we can bring him [seeing you] it would be difficult for them to justify the fact that you are evading justice.” Craxi: “So the other one is not going to come?” Salvatore: “He has been blocked in Milan.” Craxi: “I do not believe it.” Salvatore: “Yes, I know it for sure, he told me. This one, on the contrary, is ready to do seas and mountains [Italian expression which means everything is necessary in order to achieve one's aims].” Salvatore: “Then at the Ministry there is an agreement, it would be ...” 37. On the same day Il corriere della sera published an interview with Mr Salvatore Lo Giudice, who explained that the telephone call at issue did not concern a “conspiracy” organised by the applicant, and a letter of Mrs Belusconi, challenging the opportunity of putting in the file the conversation she had had with the applicant's wife. Articles appeared in Il Corriere della sera and in other newspapers concerning interviews and declarations made by Mr Nordio, Public Prosecutor attached to the Venice District Court, who criticised the release into the public domain of the telephone interceptions and declared that he had never followed irregular procedures in order to serve the interests of the applicant. The latter was at freedom to believe that he could have taken advantage from the legitimate and impartial investigations that Mr Nordio was making. Other declarations made by the persons who spoke with the applicant on the phone were published by the press, as well as the replies of the applicant to the speech made by Mr Paolo Ielo on 29 September 1995. The applicant stated, in particular, that the Public Prosecutor at issue was a “certified liar” (bugiardo matricolato) and had used a “Stalinist” language. 38. In the following days, La Repubblica, L'Unità and Il Corriere della sera published articles which referred to the above mentioned telephone conversations and to the speech made by Mr Paolo Ielo at the hearing of 29 September 1995. They included attempts to interpret the precise meaning of the conversations. Some of the newspapers commented that the transcripts of the telephone conversations showed, together with other elements, that the applicant was trying to use his influence and his relationships to organise a defamatory campaign against his political adversaries and against the magistrates who were investigating on him. It was moreover discussed in the press whether the applicant had the power to influence the political line of the party Forza Italia, with some members of which he had, apparently, kept close contacts. La Repubblica of 2 October 1995 published an article written on 18 September 1995 by the applicant himself and containing considerations of a political nature. 39. Mr Paolo Ielo granted the press a number of interviews on the matter; he declared he regretted having compared the applicant to a “certified criminal”, but that it was his duty to control the telephone conversations of a person who was deliberately evading a court order. Even if the telephone interceptions did not disclose any criminally relevant behaviour, they should be taken into account in order to assess the applicant's personality and to fix the penalty that the Public Prosecutor could have demanded at the outset of the court proceedings. 40. At the hearing of 19 October 1995 the Milan District Court asked the parties to clarify who had disclosed to the press the content of the telephone interceptions before the competent judicial authority had had the opportunity of pronouncing itself on their admissibility. Mr Ielo pointed out that immediately after the hearing of 29 September 1995, the file containing all the telephone interceptions had been forwarded to Mr Guiso, the applicant's lawyer; the file had been returned to the Public Prosecutor Office only the following Monday, when part of the transcripts had already been released into the public domain. Mr Ielo concluded that the Public Prosecutor could not be held responsible for the divulging of these acts. The representative of the civil party declared that he had nothing to say on this point: he had not copied the transcripts and he had not given them to third persons. Mr Guiso confirmed the version given by Mr Ielo. He indicated that he had copied the file which had been forwarded to him, but that this was done in a particularly secret manner, in order to protect the applicant's interests and to avoid any divulging which could be prejudicial for him. Some journalists had requested to be granted access to the transcripts, but Mr Guiso had categorically refused. Mr Giuso underlined that, as prescribed by the law, the file with the transcripts had been made available to all the parties of the trial, and not only to the applicant's defence lawyers. Mr Guiso concluded that the divulging of the transcripts was clearly due to the action of third persons. He was not interested in that, the only point he wanted to raise being why the telephone interceptions had been presented at the public hearing. The lawyers of the other accused persons declared that they were not responsible for the disclosure. 41. In an order of 19 October 1995, the Milan District Court found that contrary to the applicant's allegations (see paragraph 27 above), the failure to hold a specific hearing prior to the trial in order to select the intercepted telephone conversations did not amount to a violation of the relevant provisions of Italian law. The District Court first observed that according to Article 271 of the CPP and to the Court of Cassation's case law, failure to respect the formalities indicated in Article 268 §§ 4 and 6 of the CPP did not prevent the use of the interceptions. It moreover noted that according to Article 295 § 3 of the CPP, the said Article 268, which concerned wire-tapings made during the preliminary investigations, could apply to the trial phase only “if possible”. In the present case, the selection of the material had been made in the presence of the parties and in its “natural” place, which was the trial hearing. The District Court however decided not to make use of the information yielded by the telephone interceptions made between 20 July and 3 August 1995, in that they were relevant but not “absolutely necessary” within the meaning of Article 507 of the CCP in order to assess the applicant's personality. The District Court further held that the interceptions made after 3 August 1995 could not be used as evidence, as no application had been made by the prosecutor for an extension of the duration of interception, nor could such authorisation be considered as having been implicitly granted for as long as the applicant would be absconding. 42. In a judgment of 16 April 1996, the Milan District Court convicted the applicant to a penalty of eight years and three months' imprisonment and to a fine of 150 million Italian lire (approximately 77,468 euros). This sentence was confirmed on appeal on 5 June 1997. However, the appeal judgment was quashed by the Court of Cassation and the case was re-heard by the Milan Court of Appeal, which, on 24 July 1998, reduced the penalty imposed on the applicant to four years and six months' imprisonment. This decision became final on 20 April 1999. 43. The applicant complained about the unfairness of the Metropolitana Milanese criminal proceedings in the ambit of application no 63226/00, introduced on 15 October 1999. In a decision of 14 June 2001, the Court declared this application inadmissible. 44. Article 430 § 1 of the CPP allows the Public Prosecutor to accomplish, even after the committal for trial, further investigation acts (attività integrativa di indagine) with a view to presenting requests to the trial judge. All the documents concerning these acts are immediately filed with the Public Prosecutor's registry. Counsels for the defendants and for the civil party are granted access to the acts at issue and may obtain a copy of them. Article 268 of the CCP states that the Public Prosecutor should file in its registry the transcripts of any telephone conversation which has been wire-tapped. Counsels for the defendants and for the civil party are granted access to these transcripts and may obtain a copy of them. 45. Article 114 § 1 of the CCP prohibits the partial or total publication of any act or document to which the secrecy rule applies. According to Article 329 of the CCP, this rule of secrecy covers all the acts made by the Public Prosecutor or the police during the investigations, but ceases to apply at the end of the preliminary investigations. Once the trial has commenced, the prohibition to publish covers all the acts included in the Public Prosecutor's file (fascicolo del pubblico ministero) until the delivery of the appeal judgment (see Article 114 § 3 of the CCP). The acts not covered by the secrecy rule can always be published (see Article 114 § 7 of the CCP). 46. According to Article 268 § 6 of the CPP, the representatives of the parties are informed that, within a determined time-limit, they may examine the transcripts of the interceptions and hear their content. Once this time-limit has expired, the judge should order the inclusion into the file of all the conversations which are not manifestly irrelevant. He should proceed, even ex officio, to the exclusion (stralcio) of the material whose use is prohibited. The Public Prosecutor and the defence lawyers have the right to take part to the exclusion procedure and are informed about it at least twenty-four hours in advance (Il pubblico ministero e i difensori hanno diritto di partecipare allo stralcio e sono avvisati almeno ventiquattro ore prima). According to Article 271 of the CPP, the results of the telephone interceptions cannot be used if they have been done in cases non permitted by law or if the prescriptions of Articles 267 and 268 §§ 1 and 3 have not been respected. Article 295 § 3 of the CPP stipulates that in order to facilitate the researches of a person who is deliberately evading the court's jurisdiction, the Public prosecutor or the judge may order telephone interceptions. In this case, the provisions of Article 268 should apply “if possible” (ove possibile).",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1
16,001-57600,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,1987,CASE OF W. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 6-1;Just satisfaction reserved,C. Russo;N. Valticos,"8. The applicant, who is a British citizen born in 1951 and lives in England, was married in June 1973. He and his wife have three children; the present case concerns only the youngest of them, S, who was born on 31 October 1978. The couple has a history of serious marital and financial difficulties. 9. On 1 March 1979, when the applicant’s wife was suffering from post-natal depression and alcoholism, S was placed by his parents into the voluntary care (see paragraphs 35-37 below) of the local authority (""the Authority""). He stayed with foster parents on a temporary basis, returned home on 8 March at the applicant’s request and was again placed voluntarily in care on 21 March. After one day at home on 13 April, he was again voluntarily returned to care and remained with foster parents until 18 May. He then spent a period with his parents before once more, on 5 June, returning to and remaining in voluntary care, subject to parental visits and some weekends at home. 10. Following a suggestion made by her to the Authority’s social workers, the applicant’s wife took S home on 14 August 1979 but subsequently changed her mind and returned him to the foster parents. On 16 August, the Authority, which had already given previous consideration to such a course, passed resolutions assuming the parental rights of the applicant and his wife over S (see paragraph 38 below). It had apparently not informed them that such resolutions were proposed, but on 7 September it reached an agreement with them that S would be returned to them in February 1980 if they overcame their domestic difficulties. In any event, the applicant did not exercise his right to object to the resolution affecting him (see paragraph 39 below). 11. On 22 November 1979, the day after the applicant’s wife had been admitted to hospital for treatment following a deterioration in her alcoholism, the Authority reviewed the family circumstances. It was concluded that the prospects of S’s rehabilitation were poor but that the aforementioned agreement should be retained, the social workers responsible considering that there could be no postponement of the date for S’s return to his natural parents beyond February 1980. In case it proved impossible to effect the return at that time, it was also agreed that the possibility of finding long-term foster parents should be examined as a contingency plan. 12. S spent four days over Christmas 1979 with his natural family. The applicant continued to look after his two older children but in January 1980 they were placed temporarily into voluntary care as he was threatened with loss of his job if he did not resume work; the placement was intended to end on his wife’s discharge from hospital. A social worker saw the applicant’s wife in hospital on 22 January and reported that she seemed worried at the prospect of the children’s return home. The social worker warned her that, as regards S, the alternative would be his placement in long-term care. On 31 January, the social worker saw the applicant in connection with his matrimonial difficulties and the future of the two older children, but the prospect of S not being returned to his natural parents was not discussed. 13. On 14 February 1980, the Authority passed resolutions to assume parental rights over the two older children. According to the applicant, he raised no objection since it was agreed between the parents and the Authority’s care officers that these children would be returned to their parents over a period. They were in fact returned on 1 August 1980 and have remained at home ever since. The applicant and his wife contend that they understood the agreement to envisage the return of S as well. 14. According to the report of the Local Ombudsman (see paragraph 22 below), the social workers responsible for S and the remainder of the applicant’s family reached the conclusion in January or February 1980, from their nearly continuous review of the circumstances, that the arrangement for returning S to his natural parents would not work in view of the prognosis for the applicant’s wife’s alcoholism and the apparent breakdown of the marriage. On an unrecorded date, an unspecified person or persons in the Authority’s Social Services Department decided that S should not return home but should be placed with foster parents on a long-term basis with a view to adoption and that the natural parents’ access to him should be restricted. There is no recorded minute of any decision to this effect having been taken by the Authority in a formal manner at that time and the possibility of such placement was apparently not mentioned to the applicant when the social workers saw him on 31 January nor to his wife on 14 February, when they visited her to inform her of the resolutions concerning the two older children. Although it appears from the Local Ombudsman’s report that the parents had on previous occasions been made aware of the possibility that S might be placed in long-term care, he was clearly not satisfied that the likely course of events with regard to S had been made sufficiently plain to them and that they had been properly consulted before the decision was taken not to return the child to them. In any event, on 20 and 26 March respectively, the applicant and his wife were informed of the decision orally by the social workers responsible. According to the Local Ombudsman’s report, the social worker dealing with the case was not sure that even then either parent clearly understood what was being said about S’s future, their concern at the time being ""totally focused"" on the two older children. 15. On 31 March 1980, the Authority’s Adoption and Foster Care Committee, without further reference to the applicant or his wife, considered and approved the proposal to place S with long-term foster parents and to restrict his natural parents’ access to him. The Committee was told by the social workers responsible that the applicant and his wife, who were neither present at nor knew of the meeting, disagreed with the proposal. The minute of the Committee’s discussion records: ""It was suggested that if there was to be no parental contact the mother particularly would ‘search to the ends of the earth for [S]’. However, parental contact to be controlled and not at [the foster parents’] home."" The Authority informed the Local Ombudsman in the course of his enquiries that, in its view, this minute reflected the intention that the applicant and his wife should not know where S was placed. In any event, it clearly records a decision that access should be restricted, both as to location and frequency, but not terminated. 16. On 22 April 1980, the senior social worker responsible for the case visited the applicant and his wife to inform them that S was being moved to new foster parents; the record of his visit states that he told them that he was not prepared to disclose where the foster parents lived. In addition, it appears that since the Area Director of Social Services considered that access would jeopardise the chances of S developing a satisfactory relationship with the new foster parents, he had decided that the applicant and his wife should not be allowed to visit S. It is not revealed how, if at all, this decision to terminate access derived from the discussions of the Adoption and Foster Care Committee as recorded in the minute quoted above. According to the Government, the applicant was made aware of this decision in May. 17. On 9 May 1980, S was moved to a new foster family for long-term fostering, with a view to adoption. 18. Some time after May 1980 and apparently as a result of the shock of being sentenced to prison for theft, the applicant’s wife made a remarkable recovery from her alcoholism. The couple also resolved their matrimonial difficulties. They continued to seek access to S and protested to the Social Services Department at the refusal thereof; a meeting for them to see the child at the social services building was eventually arranged in July 1980. Having consulted solicitors in September with a view to challenging the Authority’s actions, the applicant and his wife were granted legal aid to apply to a juvenile court to discharge the Authority’s parental rights resolutions concerning S (see paragraph 40 below) and proceedings were issued on 4 November. At the request of the Authority, the hearing, originally fixed for 11 December, was postponed to 8 January 1981. On 16 January, the juvenile court held that both of the resolutions should ""henceforth be terminated"", thereby permitting S to be returned to the applicant and his wife. 19. On the same day, the Authority appealed to the Divisional Court against the juvenile court’s decision (see paragraph 41 below) and also issued proceedings in the local District Registry of the High Court to have S made a ward of court (see paragraphs 42-44 below). There followed a period of uncertainty as to which of these proceedings the Authority would pursue. On 5 February 1981 (the last possible day to prevent the wardship from lapsing; see paragraph 44 below), the Authority took out a notice for an appointment, to be held on 3 March, for hearing the summons initiating the wardship. On that day, when the Authority applied to the High Court for directions, the applicant’s solicitor challenged the propriety of the wardship proceedings as a duplication of the jurisdiction and this question was referred as a preliminary issue to be heard before a High Court judge. On 25 March, the judge permitted the Authority, which undertook to withdraw its appeal before the Divisional Court, to continue with the wardship proceedings; he directed that the case be heard as soon as possible and ordered that it be set down in the first week of June, no earlier date being available having regard to the expected length of the hearing. 20. The case was heard on 15-18 and 22 June 1981. After evaluating the evidence submitted in relation to S’s well-being and the applicant’s circumstances (including a report of 9 June from an independent welfare officer), the High Court held that the wardship should continue and directed that the child should remain with the foster parents with whom he had been placed in May 1980 (see paragraph 17 above): there was no longer any practical alternative to this, too long a period having elapsed since S’s last contact with his natural parents (on 25 July 1980) for any change to be justified. The High Court also held that the applicant and his wife should not have access to the child, noting that restoring rights of access would only encourage them in their attempts to have S returned to them, a course which would not be in his best interests. However, in the course of his judgment, the judge stated: ""I can only say that it is extremely unfortunate that these [wardship] proceedings were not heard within a matter of a week or so after the [juvenile court’s] decision. I see no reason why they could not have been ... However, the hearing did not take place and the parents and the Court are now faced with the fact that a further four months have gone by in which S has become even closer to his foster parents."" ""... I am not happy about the use of section 2 [of the Children Act 1948] powers to change the status of the child and to cut the parents out of his life, and I am unhappy about a decision arrived at by the local authority without the parents being heard or having the opportunity to make their own representations to the decision-making body ..."" The judge also commented on the ""massive help"" received by the parents from the social services. 21. An appeal by the applicant to the Court of Appeal was dismissed on 6 October 1981. The Court of Appeal expressed its sympathy for the natural parents, describing the case as ""tragic"", but stressed that its duty was to arrive at a decision which was in the best interests of the child and that ""the question from beginning to 1end is whether the child’s best interests would be served by remaining with his foster parents or by being transferred to his natural parents"". Although the Court recognised that ""both the mother and the father deserve all the credit for pulling themselves out of an appalling situation"" and that they had ""succeeded remarkably"" in coping with their older children, it found that S presented ""a different problem"" in the light of the fact that he had spent almost the whole of his life in the care of other people. 22. The applicant referred the matter to the Local Ombudsman, who has the task of investigating complaints made by a member of the public claiming to have sustained injustice in consequence of maladministration in connection with action taken by a local authority in the exercise of its administrative functions. In his report of 28 February 1983, the Local Ombudsman upheld the applicant’s allegation of maladministration in the way in which the Authority had taken its decisions concerning S, stating in particular that he criticised ""the failure to put the parents properly in the picture before firm decisions were taken"". 23. On 23 March 1982, the foster parents with whom S had been placed in May 1980 were granted leave to apply to adopt the child (see paragraph 53 below). An adoption order relating to him was made on 5 October 1984, the High Court having decided to dispense with the applicant’s consent (see paragraph 52 below). 24. In the law of England and Wales, there are a number of different and partially co-ordinated procedures for dealing with the welfare of children. Whilst the oldest of these is the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court, it has for many years co-existed with, but not been ousted by, various statutory provisions whereby a child who is at risk may be put into the care of a local authority. Although the terms are not wholly accurate, the legislation is commonly divided into two categories: the first provides for ""compulsory care"", by establishing machinery whereby a local authority can obtain a court order committing a child to its care; the second concerns ""voluntary care"", the machinery here being originally designed to meet an emergency situation without the need of recourse to the courts. At any given time, there are approximately 86,000 children in public care in England and Wales, of whom 70,000 are not living with their parents or a relative. The statutory provisions have been amended on several occasions and many of them were repealed and replaced by the Child Care Act 1980 (""the 1980 Act""), a consolidating measure the greater part of which came into force on 1 April 1981. In the following summary of the law in force at the time of the present case, the original enactments are cited first and any corresponding provision of the 1980 Act in force at the relevant time is indicated in square brackets. By way of general background information, the summary covers all three of the procedures referred to above (namely those relating to compulsory care, voluntary care and wardship), but in the present case it was the machinery for voluntary care and the wardship jurisdiction of the High Court which were directly relevant. 25. The principal statute concerning compulsory care is the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 (""the 1969 Act""), as amended by the Children Act 1975 and then partly replaced by the 1980 Act; it enables a local authority to obtain, as a temporary measure, a ""place of safety order"" and, as longer-term measures, a variety of other orders. 26. Under section 28(1) of the 1969 Act, any person, including a local authority, may apply to a justice of the peace for authority to detain a child and take him to a place of safety; the justice may grant the application if he is satisfied that the applicant has reasonable cause to believe, inter alia, that the child’s proper development is being avoidably prevented or neglected or his health is being avoidably impaired or neglected or he is being ill-treated, or that he is exposed to moral danger. A ""place of safety order"" so granted lasts for a maximum of 28 days and cannot be extended. The person detaining the child must as soon as possible take such steps as are practicable for informing his parent of the detention and the reason for it. If the local authority wishes to retain the child in protective surroundings after the 28-day period, it has either to make the child a ward of court (see paragraphs 42-44 below), or to institute care proceedings under section 1 of the 1969 Act (see paragraphs 27-29 below), or to apply to a justice or a magistrates’ court for an interim order under section 28(6) (see paragraph 32 below); if an application of the last kind is refused, the child’s immediate release ""may be ordered"". 27. Under sections 1 and 2(2) of the 1969 Act, a local authority which reasonably believes that there are grounds for making an order as to the care and control or supervision of a child is, subject to certain exceptions, under a duty to institute care proceedings by bringing the child before a juvenile court. 28. In care proceedings instituted by a local authority, the parties are the local authority and the child, but not the latter’s parents. The child is entitled, subject to his means, to legal aid and it is open to him to have his parents conduct the case on his behalf either directly or through a lawyer. If the child is of sufficient competence, he may decide that he wishes to be separately represented. A natural parent who is not acting on behalf of the child is entitled to be notified of and to attend the hearing and to give and call evidence challenging the allegations made by the local authority. As a matter of practice, the court will also allow such parent to cross-examine witnesses on behalf of the local authority and to have separate legal representation. 29. If the court before which the child is brought is satisfied that one of the grounds specified in section 1 of the 1969 Act exists and that the child is in need of care or control which he is unlikely to receive unless an order is made, it may make, inter alia, a supervision order, a care order or an interim order. The specified grounds include those on which a place of safety order may be made (see paragraph 26 above). 30. A supervision order is an order placing the child under the structured supervision of the local authority; subject thereto, he may continue to live with his parents. 31. A care order is an order committing the child to the care of the local authority. The latter will have the same powers and duties with respect to the child as his parent or guardian would have apart from the care order (section 24 of the 1969 Act [10(2) of the 1980 Act]), except that it cannot cause the child to be brought up in any religious creed other than that in which he would otherwise have been brought up and it cannot agree to the child’s adoption. 32. An interim order is a care order limited to a specified period not exceeding 28 days; it may be renewed on application (section 22 of the 1969 Act). It may be made if the juvenile court hearing the care proceedings is not in a position to decide which of the other specified orders ought to be made (section 2(10)) or, alternatively, during the currency of a place of safety order (see paragraph 26 above). The powers and duties of the local authority under an interim order are the same as under a full care order (see paragraph 31 above). 33. A full care order normally terminates when the child in question attains the age of 18 (section 20(3)(b) of the 1969 Act). In addition, under sections 21(2) and 70(2), the juvenile court may, on application by the child or his parent on the child’s (but not his own) behalf and if it considers it appropriate, discharge the care order and may, on discharging it, make a supervision order in respect of the child. Such applications may be made every three months or, with the juvenile court’s permission, more frequently (section 21(3)). The paramount consideration in deciding whether to discharge the order is the interests of the child. 34. Under sections 2(12) and 21(4) of the 1969 Act, the child in respect of whom the care order was made, or his parent on the child’s (but not his own) behalf, may appeal to the Crown Court against the making of a care order, against the refusal of an application to discharge a care order or against the making of a supervision order on its discharge. The Crown Court will review the decision by way of re-hearing the case. From the Crown Court a further appeal may, with leave, be made to the High Court by way of case stated; thereafter an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and, in rare cases, to the House of Lords. The local authority has no general right to appeal against a juvenile court’s refusal to make a care order, except on a point of law to the High Court. 35. The principal statute concerning voluntary care is the Children Act 1948 (""the 1948 Act""), as amended by the Children Act 1975 and then replaced by the 1980 Act. This legislation in effect enables a parent to place his child into the care of a local authority; at the initial stage the authority acquires no special status in relation to the child but a different situation may arise subsequently. 36. Section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] imposes on the local authority a duty to receive into its care a child under 17 where it appears, inter alia, that his parents or guardian are for the time being or permanently prevented by illness, incapacity or other circumstances from providing for his proper accommodation, maintenance and upbringing and that the intervention of the authority is necessary in the interests of the child’s welfare. Whilst the authority must, save as otherwise provided in the Act, keep the child in its care so long as his welfare requires it and he has not attained the age of 18, it is also under a duty to endeavour to secure the resumption of parental care where this appears consistent with the child’s welfare. 37. Section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] specifies that it does not entitle the local authority to keep the child in care if any parent or guardian desires to take over that care. However, if the child has been in care throughout the preceding six months, no person may take him away unless he has given at least 28 days’ notice of his intention to do so or has the authority’s consent (section 1(3A) [13(2)]). Moreover, if a parent requests the return of the child, the authority is not compelled to comply regardless of his welfare (Lewisham London Borough Council v. Lewisham Juvenile Court Justices [1979] 2 All England Law Reports 297). If it then considers the transfer of care to the parent to be inconsistent with that welfare, it may either pass a parental rights resolution (see paragraph 38 below) or apply to make the child a ward of court (see paragraphs 42-44 below). 38. If it appears to a local authority in relation to any child who is in its care under section 1 of the 1948 Act [2 of the 1980 Act] that, inter alia, a parent of his is unfit to have the care of the child on account, notably, of his habits or mode of life or of having consistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge the obligations of a parent, the local authority may resolve that there vest in it the parental rights and duties with respect to that child (section 2(1) [3(1)]). The rights and duties which so vest are all rights and duties which by law the mother and father have in relation to a legitimate child and his property, including ""a right of access"" but excluding the right to agree or refuse to agree to the making of an adoption or certain related orders (section 2(11) of the 1948 Act [3(10) of the 1980 Act] and section 85(1) of the Children Act 1975). Before passing a parental rights resolution, the local authority must consider a report from its Social Services Department on the desirability of assuming parental rights, which report should contain all the material necessary for the proper exercise of the authority’s discretion. In deciding the matter, the authority is to regard the interests of the child as of paramount importance and the views of the parents on the proposal are to be taken into account. 39. If the parent has not already consented in writing to the parental rights resolution and his whereabouts are known, he must be served with notice of it, indicating his right to object by counter-notice within one month (section 2(2) and (3) of the 1948 Act) [3(2) and (3) of the 1980 Act]). If such objection is made, the resolution lapses on the expiry of 14 days from service of the counter-notice (section 2(4) [3(4)]). However, within that period, the local authority may ""complain"" to a juvenile court, in which event the resolution will not lapse until the complaint is determined; on hearing the complaint, the court may order that the resolution is not to lapse, provided that it is satisfied that the grounds for the resolution were made out when it was passed and subsist at the time of the hearing and that the continuation of the resolution is in the child’s interest (section 2(5) [3(5) and (6)]). 40. A parental rights resolution continues in force until the child attains the age of 18, unless it is previously rescinded by the local authority or terminated by a juvenile court (section 4 of the 1948 Act [5 of the 1980 Act]). The parent concerned, even if he did not originally object to the parental rights resolution, may apply to a juvenile court for its discharge. The court may grant the application if it is satisfied that there were no grounds for the making of the resolution or that it should be terminated in the child’s interests (section 4(3)(b) [5(4)(b)]). An application based on the original foundation for the resolution can, however, be entertained only if lodged within six months of its adoption (section 127 of the Magistrates’ Court Act 1980). 41. Under section 4A of the 1948 Act [6 of the 1980 Act], an appeal (by the parent or the local authority) lies to the Family Division of the High Court from the making by a juvenile court of an order confirming (under section 2(5) [3(6)]) or discharging (under section 4(3)(b) [5(4)(b)]) a parental rights resolution, or from a juvenile court’s refusal to make such an order. A further appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and, with leave, to the House of Lords. 42. The Family Division of the High Court has an inherent jurisdiction, independent of statutory provisions and deriving from the prerogative power of the Crown acting in its capacity as parens patriae, to make a child a ward of court. 43. The effect of wardship is that custody, in a broad sense, of the child is vested in the court itself; it assumes responsibility for all aspects of his welfare and may make orders on any relevant matter whatsoever, notably as regards the care and control of and access to the child and his education, religion or property. In making such orders, the court is required to treat the child’s welfare as the ""first and paramount consideration"" (Guardianship of Minors Act 1971, section 1). Unless terminated earlier by order of the court, the wardship continues until the child attains his majority. Where there are exceptional circumstances making it impracticable or undesirable for the ward to be, or continue to be, under the care of his parents, the court may make an order committing him to the care of the local authority (Family Law Reform Act 1969, section 7(2)), subject to the power of the court to give directions (Matrimonial Causes Act 1973, section 43(5)(a)). In such circumstances, custody of the child remains with the court and it is for the court, and not the local authority, to take major decisions regarding the ward’s future; it retains, inter alia, jurisdiction to make orders for access to the child. 44. Wardship proceedings may be instituted by anyone who can show an appropriate interest in the child’s welfare. An application for a wardship order has to be made by originating summons. The child becomes a ward immediately the summons is issued but the wardship automatically lapses after 21 days unless within that time an appointment is made for the hearing of the summons. This appointment is normally held before a registrar who, subject to an appeal to a judge, may give interim directions on such matters as access to the child and may decide that other interested parties be joined in the proceedings. A judge will hear contested wardship proceedings and also applications - which can be made at any time by any party - for the variation or discharge of an existing wardship order or for directions on such matters as access to or the education of the child. From the judge’s order, an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal and thence, with leave, to the House of Lords. The child may be represented in wardship proceedings by a guardian ad litem appointed by the court; this is usually the Official Solicitor, who is a full-time public employee entirely independent of the executive. Under the Rules of the Supreme Court, it is possible to seek an order expediting the proceedings, notably if a party thereto is dilatory. 45. The functions of a local authority in child-care matters are exercised and decisions are taken either by its Social Services Committee or by a sub-committee or an officer to whom powers have been delegated. At the time relevant to the present case, the practice varied from authority to authority, there being no precise requirements or guidance even of a non-statutory kind, and much depended on the nature or gravity of the decision to be taken. Whether the child is in its care by virtue of the 1948 [1980] or the 1969 Act, the local authority must give first consideration to the need to safeguard and promote the child’s welfare throughout his childhood, and must so far as practicable ascertain his wishes and feelings regarding the decision and give due consideration to them, having regard to his age and understanding (section 59 of the Children Act 1975 [18(1) of the 1980 Act]). Authorities’ decisions in this area are, in fact, often based on the outcome of case reviews or case conferences. The authority is under a statutory duty to review the case of each child in its care at six-monthly intervals (section 27(4) of the 1969 Act) and, as a matter of practice, the child’s position will in addition be regularly examined at case conferences. Reviews and conferences will be attended notably by the social workers responsible and senior officials of the authority’s Social Services Department, as well as by such other persons as health visitors, doctors and police officers. 46. A parent may on occasion be allowed or invited to attend a case review or case conference or part thereof, although he has no legal right to do so. His contacts with the social workers constitute the most usual channel for the communication of his views on matters to be decided by the authority. In the absence of legal proceedings, the parent cannot compel the local authority to produce or permit inspection of the minutes of its relevant meetings or reports produced thereat, although the authority has a discretion to allow such inspection. In proceedings for judicial review (but not in juvenile court proceedings), the court may order the pre-trial disclosure of such documents, but only after leave to institute the proceedings has been obtained (see paragraph 48 below); however, this would be a rare occurrence, the general rule being that the documents are privileged and not open to inspection. 47. A parent whose child is in the care of a local authority is not automatically deprived of access to him. The continuation of access is, however, a matter within the discretionary power of the authority (per Lord Wilberforce in A v. Liverpool City Council [1981] 2 All England Law Reports 385). Thus, under English law, the question whether and to what extent a parent is to have access to his child who is in public care was, at the relevant time, within the competence of the local authority to decide, without any application to a court. Both the 1948 [1980] Act and the 1969 Act reflect the general idea that continuation of parental access to children in public care is in many cases normal and desirable: the former allows the local authority to contribute to the costs of parental visits and the latter makes special provision for certain cases where the parents have not visited the child during a certain period of time. 48. The statutory remedies described in paragraphs 33-34 and 39-41 above, whereby a parent may challenge or seek the discharge of a care order or a parental rights resolution, are directed to the order or resolution as such, there being, at the relevant time, no specific statutory remedy whereby he could contest the isolated issue of a decision to restrict or terminate his access to his child. A decision of a local authority concerning access can, however, be challenged by way of an application for judicial review. Anyone who wishes to make such an application must first seek, normally within three months of the decision, the leave of the court. The circumstances where judicial review will lie may be briefly summarised as follows: (a) the authority acted illegally, ultra vires or in bad faith; (b) the authority failed to take into account relevant considerations, took account of irrelevant considerations or came to a decision to which no reasonable authority could have come (Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 King’s Bench Reports 223); (c) the authority failed to observe statutory procedural rules or to act fairly (see notably R v. The Bedfordshire County Council, ex parte C and R v. The Hertfordshire County Council, ex parte B, Times Law Reports, 19 August 1986). The remedy of judicial review is concerned with reviewing not the merits of the decision in question but rather the decision-making process itself, and the court will not act as a ""court of appeal"" from the body involved. Thus, where on a successful application for judicial review the court quashes an authority’s decision, it will normally remit the matter to the authority for reconsideration; it may, however, also direct the authority to reach a conclusion in accordance with the court’s findings (Rules of the Supreme Court, Order 53, rule 9(4)). 49. In certain circumstances, the wardship jurisdiction may also be invoked to question the decisions of a local authority or a juvenile court relating to a child in the former’s care. The general rule is that the prerogative power of the Crown is not for all purposes ousted or abrogated by the exercise of the duties and powers conferred on local authorities by legislation. In the leading case of A v. Liverpool City Council, the House of Lords examined the relationship between the wardship jurisdiction and the authorities’ statutory powers. Their Lordships were unanimously of the view that the courts had no reviewing powers as to the merits of local authority decisions, notably on such matters as access to the child: the general inherent power of the court in its wardship jurisdiction was available to fill gaps or supplement the powers of local authorities but not to supervise (except on judicial review principles; see paragraph 48 above) the exercise of discretion within the field committed to them by statute. Sometimes, however, the local authority itself may invite the supplementary assistance of the court and the wardship may then be continued with a view to action by the court. The foregoing limits on the High Court’s powers apply only where the wardship proceedings concern a child who is already in public care. If he is not, the High Court can examine fully such questions as access and make such order as it considers to be in his best interests. 50. The inability of parents to approach the courts, save as explained above, where decisions are made by a local authority affecting access to their children led Parliament, in the Health and Social Services and Social Security Adjudications Act 1983, to modify the law on this point. Under the new provisions - which came into force on 30 January 1984, that is after the events giving rise to the present case -, a local authority may not refuse to make arrangements for access to a child in care and may not terminate such arrangements unless it has first given notice to the parent. The latter then has a right to apply to a juvenile court for an access order, requiring the local authority to allow access subject to such conditions as the court may specify. Where an access order has been made, there is a right to apply for variation. An appeal against the juvenile court’s decision lies to the High Court. Any court dealing with the matter must regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. This new remedy applies only to decisions refusing or terminating access; in all other cases, the nature and extent of access remain within the local authority’s discretion. 51. In December 1983, the Government published a Code of Practice on Access to Children in Care. This document stresses the importance of involving the child’s natural parents in the local authority’s decision-making process in this area and of informing them fully and promptly as to the substance of decisions concerning access. 52. A court cannot make an adoption order in respect of a child unless, inter alia, it is satisfied that each parent freely and unconditionally agrees (Children Act 1975, section 12). However, such agreement may be dispensed with upon a number of grounds specified in that section, notably that the parent is withholding consent unreasonably or has persistently failed without reasonable cause to discharge his parental duties. In reaching any decision relating to the adoption of a child, a court must have regard to all the circumstances, first consideration being given to the need to safeguard and promote his welfare throughout his childhood (Children Act 1975, section 3). 53. Adoption proceedings in respect of a child who is a ward of court may not be instituted without the leave of the High Court. On an application for leave, the court’s function is to consider whether the proposed adoption application is one that might reasonably succeed, the merits of the matter being examined subsequently, once leave has been granted and after compliance with the requirements concerning notices and reports.","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
17,001-58245,ENG,FRA,GRANDCHAMBER,1998,CASE OF LEHIDEUX AND ISORNI v. FRANCE,2,Violation of Art. 10;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,C. Russo;John Freeland;R. Pekkanen,"9. Mr Lehideux, the first applicant, who was born in 1904 and died on 21 June 1998 (see paragraph 8 above), was formerly an administrator and later a director of several companies – including Renault France – and lived in Paris. From September 1940 to April 1942 he was Minister for Industrial Production in the Government of Marshal Pétain and, from 1959 to 1964, a member of the Economic and Social Committee. He was the President of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain. The second applicant, Mr Isorni, who was born in 1911 and died on 8 May 1995 (see paragraph 2 above), was formerly a lawyer practising in Paris. As First Secretary of the Conference of Pupil Advocates of the Paris Bar, he was officially appointed to assist the President of the Bar Association in defending Marshal Pétain at his trial before the High Court of Justice. On 15 August 1945 the High Court of Justice sentenced Philippe Pétain to death and forfeiture of his civic rights for collusion with Germany with a view to furthering the designs of the enemy. 10. On 13 July 1984 the daily newspaper Le Monde published a one-page advertisement bearing the title “People of France, you have short memories” in large print, beneath which appeared in small italics, “Philippe Pétain, 17 June 1941”. The text ended with an invitation to readers to write to the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain and the National Pétain-Verdun Association. 11. The text, which was divided into several sections each beginning with the words “People of France, you have short memories if you have forgotten…” in large capitals, recapitulated, in a series of assertions, the main stages of Philippe Pétain’s life as a public figure from 1916 to 1945, presenting his actions, first as a soldier and later as French Head of State, in a positive light. In respect of the 1940–45 period, the text contained the following passage: “PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES – IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN... – That in 1940 the civil and military authorities had led France to disaster. Those responsible begged him to come to its assistance. By his call to the nation of 17 June 1940 he secured an armistice and prevented the enemy from camping on the shores of the Mediterranean, thereby saving the Allies. Power was then legally conferred on him by the Parliamentary Assemblies, in which the Popular Front had a majority. The grateful French people rightly saw him as their saviour. There were ‘forty million Pétainists’ (Henri Amouroux). How many no longer remember this and how many have disavowed it? – That in the thick of difficulties which no French Head of State had ever known, Nazi atrocities and persecutions, he protected them against German omnipotence and barbarism, thus ensuring that two million prisoners of war were saved. – That he provided daily bread, re-established social justice, defended private schools and protected a pillaged economy. – That, through his supremely skilful policy, he managed to send a personal representative to London on the very same day that he went to Montoire, thereby allowing France, in defeat, to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the Germans and the Allies and, through his secret agreements with America, to prepare and contribute to its liberation, for which he had formed the army of Africa. – That he preserved for France virtually every part of what people then still dared to call the French Empire. – That he was threatened by Hitler and Ribbentrop for resisting their will, and that on 20 August 1944 German troops carried him off to Germany. PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES – IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN... – That, while he was a prisoner of the enemy, Philippe Pétain was prosecuted on the orders of Charles de Gaulle for betraying his country, whereas he had done all he could to save it. – IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN... – That, having escaped from Germany, he returned to France, however great the personal risk to himself, to defend himself against that monstrous accusation and to try to protect, by his presence, those who had obeyed his orders. PEOPLE OF FRANCE, YOU HAVE SHORT MEMORIES – IF YOU HAVE FORGOTTEN... – That the prosecution, with the collusion of persons in the highest authority, used a forgery, as in the Dreyfus case, to secure his conviction and that at ninety years of age he was condemned, in haste, to death...” 12. On 10 October 1984 the National Association of Former Members of the Resistance filed a criminal complaint, together with an application to join the proceedings as a civil party, against a Mr L., the publication manager of Le Monde, for publicly defending the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, and against Mr Lehideux as President of the Association for the Defence of the Memory of Marshal Pétain, Mr Isorni as the author of the text complained of and a Mr M., as President of the National Pétain-Verdun Association, for aiding and abetting a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy. The civil party argued that the text was an apologia which contravened the criminal law since it tended to justify the policy of Marshal Pétain, who had been found guilty by the High Court of Justice on 15 August 1945 (see paragraph 9 above). 13. The applicants denied that their advertisement constituted a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, but acknowledged that the spirit of the text was consistent with their aim of having the judgment of the High Court of Justice overturned and rehabilitating Marshal Pétain. 14. On 29 May 1985 the public prosecutor filed his final submissions recommending that the charges be dropped on the ground that the offence had not been made out. He considered that “the political and historical light” in which the applicants had portrayed Philippe Pétain’s policy during the period 1940 to 1944 was “radically different from the approach adopted by the High Court of Justice”: “far from glorifying the policy of collaboration, the defendants ... [gave] credit to Marshal Pétain – the fact that their historical perception [might] appear incorrect, misguided or partisan being of little consequence – for his endeavours and actions to protect France and its people and his contribution to the country’s liberation...”. He added that, although their aim had been to enhance Philippe Pétain’s image and praise his conduct during the Second World War, this positive assessment could be construed as a public defence of his actions “only by arbitrarily separating the image thus embellished from its supporting text and its link with the purely extrinsic information which, for the most part, was contained in the documents on the High Court’s file”. He concluded that “it might appear strange to commit for trial before the Criminal Court the authors and producers of a text which glorifies an individual, not for the crimes of which he was convicted, but for the beneficial actions which he is deemed to have performed for the good of France, its people and, secretly, the Allies”. 15. The investigating judge did not follow the public prosecutor’s submissions. In an order of 4 June 1985, he committed Mr L., the applicants and Mr M. for trial before the Criminal Court on charges, against the first defendant as principal and the others as accomplices, of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy, defined in section 24(3) of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881. The investigating judge observed: “a public defence means a speech or text which tends to defend or vindicate a doctrine or an action”. He noted that the applicants had presented Marshal Pétain’s policy during the period 1940 to 1944 in a favourable light, crediting him with endeavours and actions to protect France and its people, whereas the same events had been the subject of lengthy, detailed reasoning in the judgment of the High Court of Justice convicting Marshal Pétain. He therefore considered that the part of the published text referring to the 1940–45 period incorporated, developed and glorified the grounds of defence submitted by Pétain at his trial before the High Court of Justice and therefore amounted to a “justification of the actions and policies of Marshal Pétain, convicted under Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code” then in force. 16. On 27 June 1986 the Paris Criminal Court, the proceedings before which had been joined by the Resistance Action Committee and the National Federation of Deported and Interned Members of the Resistance and Patriots, as civil parties, acquitted the defendants and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the civil parties’ application. The court stated that its task was “not to take sides in the historical controversy which, for more than forty years, has pitted the Resistance associations against Philippe Pétain’s supporters”, but to determine whether the offence had been made out in the instant case. In that connection, the court specified that, “according to the civil parties’ and the public prosecutor’s own submissions, the defendants [were] being prosecuted for their opinions...” and that “no restrictions [could] be imposed on freedom of expression other than those derived from statute, strictly interpreted...”. The court held that only the part of the text referring to the 1940–45 period could be construed as a public defence of the crimes of collaboration with the enemy. It noted that this part of the text was clearly a eulogy of Philippe Pétain, an appeal in his defence designed to create a shift in public opinion favourable to the reopening of his case. It considered, however, that the offence had not been made out, for the following reasons: the text contained “no attempt to justify collaboration with Nazi Germany”, but stated that Marshal Pétain’s aim had been to “facilitate the Allies’ victory”; Marshal Pétain’s collaboration with Nazi Germany was neither acknowledged nor presented in a favourable light; the fact that the judgment of the High Court of Justice constituted res judicata did not in any way prevent the defenders of Marshal Pétain’s memory from criticising it; the text was part of a campaign in which the second applicant had been engaged since 1945 to have the judgment of the High Court of Justice overturned, an objective which was “perfectly legal”. The court emphasised, “for the avoidance of any doubt”, that its judgment “should not be deemed to favour one of the arguments put forward in the historical controversy”. 17. The National Association of Former Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed. 18. In a judgment of 8 July 1987 the Paris Court of Appeal held, firstly, that the combined effect of Article 2 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 was that the civil parties did not have standing to trigger a public prosecution and, secondly, that the prosecutor’s submissions on their complaint did not satisfy the formal requirements laid down on pain of nullity in the same Act. The court therefore declared the prosecution and subsequent proceedings null and void. 19. The National Association of Former Members of the Resistance and the Resistance Action Committee appealed on points of law against the above judgment. 20. In a judgment of 20 December 1988 the Court of Cassation (Criminal Division) held that the Paris Court of Appeal had erred in law. Accordingly, it quashed the judgment of 8 July 1987 in its entirety and remitted the case to the same Court of Appeal with a differently constituted bench. 21. On 26 January 1990 the Paris Court of Appeal declared the two civil party applications admissible, set aside the acquittals and awarded the civil parties damages of one franc. It also ordered the publication of excerpts from the judgment in Le Monde. In its judgment it held that the three constituent elements of the offence of making a public defence of the crimes of collaboration had been made out. It found, firstly, that the public element had been made out owing to the fact that the text in question had been published in Le Monde. It went on to say that the text contained an “apologia” for the crimes of collaboration, and that the mental element had been made out, for the following reasons: “The glorification of Pétain by the authors of this manifesto is conveyed by the celebration of what they seek to portray as great deeds; thus, equal prominence is given, for example, to the victory at Verdun and the defeat at Abd-el-Krim, attributed to Pétain like the securing of the armistice in 1940 and ‘his policy’, described as ‘supremely skilful’: ‘He managed to send a personal representative to London on the very same day that he went to Montoire, thereby allowing France, in defeat, to maintain its position between the contradictory demands of the Germans and the Allies and, through his secret agreements with America, to prepare and contribute to its liberation, for which he had formed the army of Africa’. Praise of the Montoire policy is thus magnified by reference to its supposed results. This is indeed an unreserved eulogy of a policy which is none other than that of collaboration. The significance of the meeting between Pétain and Hitler at Montoire on 24 October 1940 to which the authors of the advertisement refer were specified as follows in a radio broadcast by Pétain of 30 October 1940: ‘It is in honour and in order to maintain French unity, a ten-centuries-old unity, within the framework of constructive action for a new European order that I today embark upon the path of collaboration.’ The order referred to here was none other than the Hitlerian order based on racism defined in Mein Kampf, to which Pétain had just officially subscribed in advance by signing, on 3 October 1940, the so-called Act relating to aliens of Jewish race, who were later to be interned in camps set up in France for that purpose, in order to facilitate their conveyance to the Nazi concentration camps which were their intended destination. Through the absence from the text of any criticism of these artfully concealed facts or even any attempt to distance its authors from them, this manifesto does indeed, therefore, implicitly but necessarily, contain an apologia for the crimes of collaboration committed, sometimes with the active participation and sometimes with the tacit consent of the Vichy Government, that is of Pétain and his zealots, in the very ‘atrocities’ and ‘Nazi persecutions’ to which the text refers. The court is forced to the above conclusion without taking sides in the historical controversy between those who think that Pétain was really playing a double game supposedly beneficial to the French and those who place reliance only on Pétain’s avowed policies and publicly announced official decisions, regardless of the excuses that he was able to put forward or that his supporters now seek to cloak him in. Accordingly, this court finds that the advertisement in issue did contain the apologetic element of the offence charged. In addition, for the offence to be made out, the mental element must be established. The accused, headed by Jacques Isorni, the author of the manifesto, are seeking revision of the judgment given by the High Court of Justice on 14 August 1945, which sentenced Pétain to death, forfeiture of his civic rights and confiscation of his possessions for collusion with Germany, a power at war with France, with a view to furthering the enemy’s designs, this conduct constituting offences defined by and punishable under Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code. The accused, with the exception of [Mr L.], all claim responsibility for the text in issue and maintain that their object in publishing it was to create a shift in public opinion which, in their view, would increase support for a decision to reopen the case. This goal, pursued unremittingly by Jacques Isorni in particular, Pétain’s former defence counsel before the High Court, who seeks to have a new judicial decision substituted for the High Court’s judgment, is considered by that lawyer to be a sacred duty of the defence. However legitimate on his part and the part of those who expressed their support for his action their intention to have the case reopened may have been, it did not justify the use of unlawful means to further that aim, since they knew that by putting forward an unqualified and unrestricted eulogy of the policy of collaboration they were ipso facto justifying the crimes committed in furtherance of that policy, and therefore cannot have acted in good faith.” 22. The applicants, Mr M. and Mr L. appealed on points of law against the above judgment. In their statement of the grounds of appeal they relied on Article 10 of the Convention and complained that they had been convicted for their opinions. Their aim had been to defend what they considered to be just in the action of a convicted person, without glorifying war crimes or the crimes of collaboration of which he had been convicted in the judgment which they were seeking to have overturned. They asserted that the Court of Appeal had found them guilty of making an “implicit apologia”, constituted more by what they had not said than by the content of the text itself, holding that the manifesto in issue “implicitly but necessarily” contained an apologia for the crimes of collaboration and convicting them for what they had not written and the criticisms they had not made, despite the fact that they had referred in their text to Nazi atrocities and barbarism. 23. On 16 November 1993 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeals on the following grounds: “Having regard [to the] findings [of the Court of Appeal] the Court of Cassation, whose task is to determine whether the text prosecuted under section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 constitutes a public defence of the crimes contemplated in that Act, is satisfied from its examination of the article in question that the passage referred to by the Court of Appeal falls within the contemplation of the aforementioned Act. In presenting as praiseworthy a person convicted of collusion with the enemy, the text glorified his crime and, in so doing, publicly defended it. The mental element of the offence can be inferred from the deliberate nature of the acts on account of which the defendants were charged. In delivering that judgment, the Court of Appeal did not exceed its powers. Nor did it infringe the right to freedom of expression protected by Article 10, paragraph 1, of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, since the exercise of that right may, under paragraph 2 of that Article, be subject to certain restrictions prescribed by law, where these are necessary, as in the instant case, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety.” 24. In 1984 section 23 of the Freedom of the Press Act of 29 July 1881 read as follows: “Where a crime or major offence is committed, anyone who, by uttering speeches, cries or threats in a public place or assembly, or by means of a written or printed text, drawing, engraving, painting, emblem, image, or any other written, spoken or pictorial item sold or distributed, offered for sale or exhibited in a public place or assembly, or by means of a placard or notice exhibited in a place where it can be seen by the public, has directly and successfully incited another or others to commit the said crime or major offence shall be punished as an accomplice thereto.” 25. At the same time, section 24 provided that “anyone who, by one of the means set out in section 23, has made a public defence of ... the crimes of collaboration with the enemy” was to be liable to one to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from three hundred to three hundred thousand francs. 26. The French courts have gradually clarified the conditions for the application of the provisions making public defence of a crime a criminal offence. The Court of Cassation has ruled that public defence of the crimes defined in section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 is a separate offence from unsuccessful incitement to commit one of the crimes listed in sub-sections 1 and 2 of the same section and that the constituent elements of each of those offences must not be confused (Crim. 11 July 1972, Bull. crim. no. 236). As early as 1912 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation held that public defence of a criminal amounted to public defence of his crime (Crim. 22 August 1912, Bull. crim. no. 46). That case-law was upheld by a decision to the effect that the glorification of a person on the basis of facts constituting one of the crimes or major offences listed in section 24(3) of the 1881 Act constituted the crime of public defence defined in and punishable under that Act (Crim. 24 October 1967, Bull. crim. no. 263). Publication of a text which is likely to incite any reader to judge favourably the German National Socialist Party leaders convicted of war crimes by the Nuremberg International Tribunal and constitutes an attempt to justify their crimes in part is a public defence of war crimes (Crim. 14 January 1971, Bull. crim. no. 14). A public defence of the crime of theft is made out where an article is published which, far from merely relating a criminal theft, presents it as a praiseworthy exploit and expresses the hope that the perpetrator will escape all punishment (Crim. 2 November 1978, Bull. crim. no. 294). The offence is made out where an apologia is presented in indirect form (Paris, 25 February 1959, D. 1959. 552). Lastly, it is the Court of Cassation’s task to determine whether a text prosecuted under section 24(3) of the Act of 29 July 1881 partakes of the nature of a public defence of crime as defined therein (Crim. 11 July 1972, Bull. crim. no. 236). 27. Law no. 90-615 of 13 July 1990 (“the loi Gayssot”) added to the Freedom of the Press Act a section 24 bis making liable to one year’s imprisonment and a fine of 300,000 French francs, or one of those penalties only, those who “deny the existence of one or more crimes against humanity as defined in Article 6 of the Statute of the International Military Tribunal annexed to the London agreement of 8 August 1945 which have been committed either by the members of an organisation declared criminal pursuant to Article 9 of the Statute or by a person found guilty of such crimes by a French or international court”. Section 48-2 of the Freedom of the Press Act, also inserted by the loi Gayssot, provides: “Any association which has been lawfully registered for at least five years at the relevant time, and whose objects, according to its articles of association, include the defence of the moral interests and honour of the French Resistance or deportees, may exercise the rights conferred on civil parties in connection with public defence of war crimes, crimes against humanity or the crimes of collaboration with the enemy and in connection with the offence defined in section 24 bis.” 28. Articles 75 and 87 of the Criminal Code, applied by the High Court of Justice in its judgment of 15 August 1945 convicting Marshal Pétain, provided at that time: “Any French citizen who colludes with a foreign power with a view to inciting it to engage in hostilities against France, or provides it with the necessary means, either by facilitating the penetration of foreign forces into French territory, or by undermining the loyalty of the army, navy or air force, or in any other manner, shall be guilty of treason and sentenced to death.” “Any attempt to overthrow or change the government ..., or to incite citizens or inhabitants to take up arms against the imperial authority shall be punishable by deportation to a military fortress.”",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1

By a decision of 22 June 2000 the Ministry of Security of Tajikistan instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on account of his membership of “the illegal extremist-religious party 'Hizb ut-Tahrir'”. The decision stated that the applicant had committed a number of serious and particularly serious crimes, namely, incitement to overthrow the political regime in Tajikistan and dissemination of material containing incitement to religious hatred. On the same date the Ministry of Security of Tajikistan placed the applicant on a search list, drew up an arrest warrant in his name and suspended the investigation because the applicant's whereabouts were unknown. 8. The applicant fled to Moscow in 2001. 9. Between 27 October and 7 December 2001 the applicant was kept in detention in Russia with a view to his extradition. He was subsequently released because no formal request for his extradition was received. 10. The applicant registered his place of residence in Russia with the relevant authorities. 11. On 28 November 2007 the applicant was arrested by servicemen of the Moscow Department of the Federal Security Service and police of the Odintsovo District. 12. In the morning of 30 November 2007 the applicant was questioned in the absence of a lawyer. The servicemen who carried out the interview threatened to use violence against the applicant and his family unless he voluntarily agreed to leave Russia for Tajikistan. According to the applicant, he was not informed of the reasons for his arrest in the course of the interview. Neither did he have access to a lawyer during the two following weeks in detention. 13. On 30 November 2007 the Odintsovo Town Court of the Moscow Region (“the Town Court”) ordered the applicant's placement in custody pending his extradition. The term of detention was not specified. 14. Between 30 November 2007 and 30 January 2008 the applicant was kept in a temporary detention facility of the Odintsovo District Department of the Interior. In the meantime his wife was expelled to Tajikistan. 15. On 21 December 2007 the Prosecutor General of Tajikistan sent a request for the applicant's extradition to the Prosecutor General of Russia and enclosed a copy of the decision of 22 June 2000 to charge the applicant with membership of a proscribed organisation and copies of the search and arrest warrants. 16. On 4 June 2008 the Deputy Prosecutor General of Russia ordered the applicant's extradition to Tajikistan to face criminal prosecution. The order stated that the applicant had been charged with membership of a proscribed religious-extremist organisation and dissemination of material containing incitement to religious hatred. 17. The applicant challenged the extradition order of 4 June 2008 in court. 18. On 22 August 2008 the Moscow City Court upheld the order of 4 June 2008. It reasoned that there were no legal grounds impeding the applicant's extradition to Tajikistan because the applicant was a Tajik national and his request for political asylum had been rejected. The applicant's claims that he was not guilty of the crimes of which he had been charged had been examined and dismissed “on the ground that issues of falsification of charges in his respect by law-enforcement agencies of Tajikistan [were] not subject to examination in the course of [that] court hearing”. It further stated that allegations of persecution on religious grounds had not been confirmed by reliable evidence, and concluded as follows: “[Mr] Khodzhayev does not have refugee status in the Russian Federation, has not been and is not being persecuted on grounds of his race, religion, citizenship, nationality or association with a particular group [and] has not applied for Russian citizenship or political asylum.” 19. On 28 October 2008 the Supreme Court of Russia examined an appeal by the applicant against the judgment of 22 August 2008 and dismissed it, reproducing the reasoning of the Moscow City Court verbatim. 20. On 11 January 2008 the applicant lodged a request for political asylum with the Moscow Department of the Federal Migration Service (“the Moscow FMS”). 21. On 11 January 2008 the applicant requested protection from the Russian Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“the UNHCR Office”). It appears that UNHCR Office staff were not allowed to visit the applicant over the following months. 22. On 16 May 2008 the Moscow FMS refused to grant the applicant political asylum. On an unspecified date the applicant was notified of that decision. 23. The applicant challenged the Moscow FMS's decision of 16 May 2008 in court. On an unspecified date the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow refused to admit the applicant's statement of claim because he had failed to pay the court fee. The applicant appealed. 24. On 18 November 2008 the Moscow City Court quashed the decision of the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow and ordered it to admit the applicant's statement of claim with no court fee. It appears that the proceedings challenging the Moscow FSM's decision are now pending before the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow. 25. On 26 November 2008 UNHCR Office staff interviewed the applicant. 26. On 22 June 2000 an investigator from the Tajik Ministry of Security, having obtained a prosecutor's approval, issued an arrest warrant in respect of the applicant. 27. In July 2001 the applicant arrived in Russia illegally looking for well-paid employment. During the following six years the applicant filed no request to register himself as a temporary resident with Russian migration offices. Neither did he lodge a request for asylum. The applicant did not have a migration card. 28. On 27 October 2001 the applicant was arrested in Moscow pursuant to Article 61 of the Minsk Convention as a person put on an international wanted list. 29. On 7 December 2001 the applicant was released from custody because no request for his extradition had been received. 30. On 19 February 2002 the Tajik Prosecutor General's Office requested the Russian Prosecutor General's Office to extradite the applicant. 31. On 27 February 2002 the Russian police were instructed to search for the applicant. 32. On 28 November 2007 the applicant was arrested by servicemen of the Federal Security Service and the police. 33. On the same date the applicant was questioned by an official of the Odintsovo prosecutor's office. The written statement signed by the applicant certified that he was fluent in Russian and did not need an interpreter. The statement reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “... I am aware of the fact that my name has been put on a wanted list in Tajikistan. I cannot give any details concerning the criminal case against me in Tajikistan. The investigative documents from Tajikistan that I have been provided with contain my personal data but I did not commit the crimes mentioned in them. I cannot submit more information on the substance of the criminal case against me. ... I am not being persecuted in Tajikistan for political reasons. I am a Tajik national and I have not applied for political asylum or refugee status to any agencies, consulates, embassies or representative offices.” 34. On 30 November 2007 the Town Court held the hearing and examined the Odintsovo prosecutor's office's request to authorise the applicant's placement in custody pending extradition. The request that mentioned the fact that the applicant had been suspected of serious and particularly serious crimes in Tajikistan was read out in the courtroom. In the document entitled “Decision concerning the choice of custodial detention as a preventive measure” the Town Court observed that the applicant was suspected of creating a criminal organisation, inciting to racial and religious hatred and calling for the overthrow of the Tajik constitutional regime and ordered the applicant's placement in custody pursuant to the Minsk Convention and Article 108 of the CCP. The Town Court reasoned that the applicant was a foreign national, had no permanent employment or place of residence and, unless detained, might abscond, continue his illegal activities or interfere with the course of criminal proceedings. The applicant was advised of his right to appeal against the decision before the Moscow Regional Court within three days. 35. On 24 December 2007 the Tajik Prosecutor General's Office requested the Russian Prosecutor General's Office to extradite the applicant as a person charged with terrorism-related crimes. 36. On 28 December 2007 the Town Court ordered the applicant's placement in custody pending extradition pursuant to Articles 108 and 466 of the CCP. The document was entitled “Decision concerning the choice of custodial detention as a preventive measure”. The applicant was advised of his right to appeal against the decision before the Moscow Regional Court within three days. 37. The applicant did not appeal against the Town Court's decisions of 30 November and 28 December 2007. 38. On 11 January 2008 the applicant argued for the first time that in Tajikistan he had been persecuted on political grounds in his letters to the UNHCR Office and the Moscow FMS. 39. On 4 June 2008 the Russian Deputy Prosecutor General granted the Tajik Prosecutor General's Office's request and ordered the applicant's extradition. The applicant was advised of his right to appeal against the order within ten days. 40. On 28 July 2008 the applicant appealed against the extradition order. 41. On 5 August 2008 the Moscow FMS received the applicant's request for temporary asylum. 42. On 22 August 2008 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the extradition order. 43. On 27 August 2008 the applicant appealed against the judgment of 22 August 2008. 44. On 28 October 2008 the Russian Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the judgment of 22 August 2008. On 13 November 2008 the applicant was served with the appeal court's decision. 45. On 24 January 2008 the Russian Prosecutor General's Office received the applicant's counsel's request to allow UNHCR Office staff to visit the applicant. A request made by the UNHCR Office reached the Russian Prosecutor General's Office only on 23 July 2008. The request did not contain the personal details of the staff in question. As soon as those details had been communicated by the UNHCR Office, the Russian Prosecutor General's Office issued a permit to visit the applicant. 46. On an unspecified date the UNHCR Office informed the prosecutor's office of the Moscow Region that the applicant was eligible for international protection. 47. On 26 February 2008 the applicant requested the Moscow FMS to grant him refugee status. 48. On 20 March 2008 officials of the Moscow FMS visited the applicant in the remand prison and interviewed him. 49. The applicant was provided with ample opportunities to substantiate his fears of persecution in Tajikistan. He was interviewed by State officials in this respect on several occasions. 50. On 16 May 2008 the Moscow FMS, having thoroughly studied the applicant's request, dismissed it and refused to declare the applicant a refugee. The applicant appealed against that decision. 51. On 3 July 2008 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow refused to admit the applicant's appeal against the Moscow FMS's decision of 16 May 2008 and invited the applicant to eliminate the discrepancies in his appeal by 18 July 2008. 52. On 25 August 2008 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow ruled that the applicant's appeal against the Moscow FMS's decision should not be examined because the applicant had failed to eliminate the discrepancies referred to in the ruling of 3 July 2008. 53. On 26 November 2008 the applicant's request for temporary asylum was dismissed. 54. On 18 November 2008 the Moscow City Court quashed the ruling of 25 August 2008 and remitted the matter for fresh examination at first instance. 55. On 12 March 2009 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed the applicant's appeal against the Moscow FMS's decision of 16 May 2008. 56. Chapter 13 of the CCP governs the application of preventive measures. Placement in custody is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a crime punishable with at least two years' imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 § 1). A request for placement in custody should be lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 108 § 3). The request should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 § 4). A judge's decision on placement in custody may be challenged before an appeal court within three days (Article 108 § 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 § 1) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 109 § 2). Further extensions up to twelve months may be granted on an investigator's request approved by a prosecutor of the Russian Federation only if the person is charged with serious or particularly serious criminal offences (Article 109 § 3). 57. Chapter 16 of the CCP lays down the procedure by which acts or decisions of a court or public official involved in criminal proceedings may be challenged. Acts or omissions of a police officer in charge of the inquiry, an investigator, a prosecutor or a court may be challenged by “parties to criminal proceedings” or by “other persons in so far as the acts and decisions [in question] touch upon those persons' interests” (Article 123). Those acts or omissions may be challenged before a prosecutor (Article 124). Decisions taken by police or prosecution investigators or prosecutors not to initiate criminal proceedings, or to discontinue them, or any other decision or inaction capable of impinging upon the rights of “parties to criminal proceedings” or of “hindering an individual's access to court” may be subject to judicial review (Article 125). 58. Upon receipt of a request for extradition not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, the Prosecutor General or his deputy is to decide on the measure of restraint in respect of the person whose extradition is sought. The measure of restraint is to be applied in accordance with the established procedure (Article 466 § 1). 59. The Constitutional Court examined the compatibility of Article 466 § 1 of the CCP with the Russian Constitution and reiterated its constant case-law that excessive or arbitrary detention, unlimited in time and without appropriate review, was incompatible with Article 22 of the Constitution and Article 14 § 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in all cases, including extradition proceedings. 60. In the Constitutional Court's view, the guarantees of the right to liberty and personal integrity set out in Article 22 and Chapter 2 of the Constitution, as well as the legal norms of Chapter 13 of the CCP on preventive measures, were fully applicable to detention with a view to extradition. Accordingly, Article 466 of the CCP did not allow the authorities to apply a custodial measure without complying with the procedure established in the CCP, or in excess of the time-limits fixed therein. 61. The Prosecutor General asked the Constitutional Court for an official clarification of its decision no. 101-O of 4 April 2006 (see above), for the purpose, in particular, of elucidating the procedure for extending a person's detention with a view to extradition. 62. The Constitutional Court dismissed the request on the ground that it was not competent to indicate specific criminal-law provisions governing the procedure and time-limits for holding a person in custody with a view to extradition. That was a matter for the courts of general jurisdiction. 63. In this decision the Constitutional Court reiterated that Article 466 of the CCP did not imply that detention of a person on the basis of an extradition request did not have to comply with the terms and time-limits provided for in the legislation on criminal procedure. 64. By a decision (решение) of 14 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation granted the Prosecutor General's request and classified a number of international and regional organisations as terrorist organisations, including HT (also known as the Party of Islamist Liberation), and prohibited their activity in the territory of Russia. It held in relation to HT that it aimed to overthrow non-Islamist governments and to establish “Islamist governance on an international scale by reviving a Worldwide Islamist Caliphate”, in the first place in the regions with predominantly Muslim populations, including Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 65. Recommendation No. R (98) 13 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to Member States on the rights of rejected asylum seekers to an effective remedy against decisions on expulsion in the context of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights reads as follows: “Without prejudice to the exercise of any right of rejected asylum seekers to appeal against a negative decision on their asylum request, as recommended, among others, in Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (81) 16 of the Committee of Ministers..., 1. An effective remedy before a national authority should be provided for any asylum seeker, whose request for refugee status is rejected and who is subject to expulsion to a country about which that person presents an arguable claim that he or she would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2. In applying paragraph 1 of this recommendation, a remedy before a national authority is considered effective when:... 2.2. that authority has competence both to decide on the existence of the conditions provided for by Article 3 of the Convention and to grant appropriate relief;... 2.4. the execution of the expulsion order is suspended until a decision under 2.2 is taken.” 66. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights issued a Recommendation (CommDH(2001)19) on 19 September 2001 concerning the rights of aliens wishing to enter a Council of Europe Member State and the enforcement of expulsion orders, part of which reads as follows: “11. It is essential that the right of judicial remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the ECHR be not only guaranteed in law but also granted in practice when a person alleges that the competent authorities have contravened or are likely to contravene a right guaranteed by the ECHR. The right of effective remedy must be guaranteed to anyone wishing to challenge a refoulement or expulsion order. It must be capable of suspending enforcement of an expulsion order, at least where contravention of Articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR is alleged.” 67. For other relevant documents, see the Court's judgment in the case of Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, §§ 36-38, ECHR 2007... 68. When performing actions requested under the Minsk Convention, to which Russia and Tajikistan are parties, a requested official body applies its country's domestic laws (Article 8 § 1). 69. Upon receipt of a request for extradition the requested country should immediately take measures to search for and arrest the person whose extradition is sought, except in cases where no extradition is possible (Article 60). 70. The person whose extradition is sought may be arrested before receipt of a request for extradition if there is a related petition. The petition must contain a reference to a detention order and indicate that a request for extradition will follow (Article 61 § 1). If the person is arrested or placed in detention before receipt of the extradition request, the requesting country must be informed immediately (Article 61 § 3). 71. The person detained pending extradition pursuant to Article 61 § 1 of the Minsk Convention must be released if the requesting country fails to submit an official request for extradition with all requisite supporting documents within forty days from the date of placement in custody (Article 62 § 1). 72. Conclusions and Recommendations: Tajikistan, issued by the UN Committee Against Torture on 7 December 2006 (CAT/C/TJK/CO/1), refer to the following areas of concern regarding the human-rights situation in the country: “The definition of torture provided in domestic law ... is not fully in conformity with the definition in article 1 of the Convention, particularly regarding purposes of torture and its applicability to all public officials and others acting in an official capacity. ... There are numerous allegations concerning the widespread routine use of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement and investigative personnel, particularly to extract confessions to be used in criminal proceedings. Further, there is an absence of preventive measures to ensure effective protection of all members of society from torture and ill treatment. ... The Committee is also concerned at: (a) The lack of a legal obligation to register detainees immediately upon loss of liberty, including before their formal arrest and arraignment on charges, the absence of adequate records regarding the arrest and detention of persons, and the lack of regular independent medical examinations; (b) Numerous and continuing reports of hampered access to legal counsel, independent medical expertise and contacts with relatives in the period immediately following arrest, due to current legislation and actual practice allowing a delay before registration of an arrest and conditioning access on the permission or request of officials; (c) Reports that unlawful restrictions of access to lawyers, doctors and family by State agents are not investigated or perpetrators duly punished; (d) The lack of fundamental guarantees to ensure judicial supervision of detentions, as the Procuracy is also empowered to exercise such oversight; (e) The extensive resort to pretrial detention that may last up to 15 months; and (f) The high number of deaths in custody. ... There are continuing and reliable allegations concerning the frequent use of interrogation methods that are prohibited by the Convention by both law enforcement officials and investigative bodies. ... There are reports that there is no systematic review of all places of detention, by national or international monitors, and that regular and unannounced access to such places is not permitted.” 73. Amnesty International in its document “Central Asia: Summary of Human Rights Concerns: March 2007 – March 2008” describes the situation regarding freedom of religion in Tajikistan as follows: “Members of religious minorities and human rights defenders were concerned that decisions taken by the authorities restricted freedom of religion and belief. During the second half of 2007 unregistered mosques were closed down or demolished in the capital, Dushanbe. ... A proposed new law on religion raised fears that unregistered religious activity would be banned. The draft law proposed stringent registration requirements which would make it very difficult for religious minorities to apply or re-apply for legal status. It also proposed to limit the number of registered places of worship and to ban missionary activity. Pending the adoption of the new law the government was not accepting new applications for legal status from religious groups. ... In November [2007] the UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, Asma Jahangir, published a report on her visit to Tajikistan earlier in the year. The report's conclusions emphasized the “need to devise educational policies aimed at strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights and eradicating prejudices, which are incompatible with the freedom of religion or belief”. The conclusions also stressed that registration procedures for religious groups should be straightforward and that “[r]egistration should not be a precondition for practising one's religion”. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Tajikistani authorities ensure that “any measure taken to combat acts of terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law.” She stressed that “an independent, neutral and impartial judiciary and prompt access to a lawyer [were] vital to safeguarding also the freedom of religion or belief of all individuals and religious communities”. 74. The World Report Chapter: Tajikistan by Human Rights Watch, released in January 2009, describes the human-rights situation in the country as follows: “Religious Freedom At this writing, the government had not yet sent to parliament a controversial draft law on religion that had been sharply criticized in 2007. Under the draft law, all religious groups must reregister and meet such onerous conditions as providing the address of any person who, at any point during the past 10 years, has been a member. The draft also prohibits foreigners from chairing religious organizations. ... Actions in the Name of Countering Terrorism and Extremism Following a recommendation by the prosecutor general, the Supreme Court of Tajikistan designated Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group that supports the reestablishment of the Caliphate, or Islamic state, by peaceful means, an ""extremist"" organization. The government continued to arrest alleged Hizb ut-Tahrir members and convict them either of sedition or incitement to racial, ethnic, or religious hatred, often simply for possessing the organization's leaflets. ... Torture and Deaths in Custody Tajikistan's definition of torture does not comply fully with the UN Committee Against Torture's recommendations to the country in December 2006. In a positive move, in March 2008 the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to make evidence obtained under torture inadmissible in court proceedings. Experts agree that in most cases there is impunity for rampant torture in Tajikistan. In one of the few cases that reached the courts, two policemen in Khatlon province were convicted in August 2008 for ill-treating minors; one of the two received a four-year prison sentence, and the other a suspended sentence. NGOs and local media reported at least three deaths in custody in 2008, including the death from cancer of the ex-deputy chair of the Party of Islamic Revival Shamsiddin Shamsiddinov. The party alleged his arrest in 2003 was politically motivated and claimed that his life could have been saved had he been allowed to undergo surgery. In an April 1, 2008 decision (Rakhmatov et al. v. Tajikistan) the UN Human Rights Committee found that Tajikistan violated the rights, including freedom from torture, of five applicants, two of them minors when they were arrested. Tajikistan failed to cooperate with the committee's consideration of the complaint. Similar violations were established in an October 30, 2008 decision (Khuseynov and Butaev v. Tajikistan)”. 75. The 2008 US Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, released on 25 February 2009, provides the following information in relation to Tajikistan: “Tajikistan ... is an authoritarian state, and political life is dominated by President Emomali Rahmon and his supporters... The government's human rights record remained poor, and corruption continued to hamper democratic and social reform. The following human rights problems were reported: ... torture and abuse of detainees and other persons by security forces; threats and abuse by security forces; impunity of security forces; lengthy pretrial detention; denial of right to fair trial; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; prohibited international monitor access to prisons; ... restrictions on freedom of religion, including freedom to worship; ... The law prohibits ... practices [of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment]; however, security officials reportedly employed them. Officials did not grant sufficient access to information to allow human rights organizations to investigate claims of torture. Security officials, particularly from the Ministry of Interior (MOI), continued to use beatings or other forms of coercion to extract confessions during interrogations. Beatings and other mistreatment were common also in detention facilities. A 2008 study by the Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, a local NGO, credibly found a bias in the criminal justice system toward law enforcement officials exacting confessions from those who are arrested. Articles in the criminal code do not specifically define torture, and the country's law enforcement agencies have not developed effective methods to investigate possible violators. ... The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) continued to refuse access to prisons or detention facilities to representatives of the international community and civil society seeking to investigate claims of harsh treatment or conditions. Some foreign diplomatic missions and NGOs were given access to implement assistance programs or carry out consular functions, but their representatives were limited to administrative or medical sections, and they were accompanied by ministry of justice personnel. The government has not signed an agreement with the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to allow free and unhindered access to prisons and detention centers, and ICRC's international monitoring staff has not returned to the country since departing in 2007. During the year detainees and inmates complained of harsh and life-threatening conditions, including overcrowding and lack of sanitary conditions. Disease and hunger were serious problems, but outside observers were unable to assess accurately the extent of the problems because of lack of access. Organizations that work on prison issues reported that infection rates of tuberculosis and HIV was significant, and that the quality of medical treatment was low. ... The government has not substantially altered the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) since the Soviet period, and the criminal justice system failed to protect individuals from arbitrary arrest or detention. There were few checks on the power of prosecutors and police to make arrests. ... Victims of police abuse may submit a formal complaint in writing to the officer's superior. However, most victims chose to remain silent rather than risk retaliation by the authorities. ... Prosecutors are empowered to issue arrest warrants, and there is no requirement for judicial approval of an order for pretrial detention. The law allows police to detain a suspect without a warrant in certain circumstances, but a prosecutor must be notified within 24 hours of arrest. Pretrial detention may last up to 15 months in exceptional circumstances. Local prosecutors may order pretrial detention for up to two months; subsequent detentions must be ordered by progressively higher level prosecutors. A defendant may petition for judicial review of a detention order. However, judges rarely questioned detention decisions, and observers regarded this review as a formality. Individuals have the right to an attorney upon arrest, and the government must appoint lawyers for those who cannot otherwise afford one. In practice the government did not always provide attorneys, and those it did provide generally served the government's interest, not the client's. There is no bail system, although criminal case detainees may be released conditionally and restricted to their place of residence pending trial. According to the law, family members are allowed access to prisoners only after indictment; officials occasionally denied attorneys and family members access to detainees. The authorities held many detainees incommunicado for long periods without formally charging them. ... Although the law provides for an independent judiciary, in practice the executive branch and criminal networks exerted pressure on prosecutors and judges. Corruption and inefficiency were significant problems. The C[ode of Criminal Procedure] gives the prosecutor a disproportionate degree of power in relation to judges and defense advocates. This power includes control of the formal investigation and oversight of the entire case proceedings. ""Supervisory powers"" provided by law allow prosecutors to protest a court decision outside of normal appeal procedures. Prosecutors effectively can cause court decisions to be annulled and reexamined by higher courts indefinitely after appeal periods have expired. These powers are an impediment to establishing an independent judiciary. The president is empowered to appoint and dismiss judges and prosecutors with the consent of parliament. Judges at all levels often were poorly trained and had extremely limited access to legal reference materials. Low wages for judges and prosecutors left them vulnerable to bribery, which remained a common practice. Judges were subject to political influence. Trials are public, except in cases involving national security. The authorities have denied access to monitoring organizations to trials without cause. A panel consisting of a presiding judge and two ""people's assessors"" determines guilt or innocence. Qualifications of the assessors and how they are determined is unclear, but their role is passive, and the presiding judge dominates the proceedings. According to the law, cases should be brought before a judge within 28 days after indictment; however, most cases were delayed for months. Under the law, courts appoint attorneys at public expense; however, in practice authorities often denied arrested persons access to an attorney. Those who were indicted were invariably found guilty. Judges often gave deference to uncorroborated testimony of law enforcement officers, especially members of the [Ministry of Security], and often discounted the absence of physical evidence. According to the law both defendants and attorneys have the right to review all government evidence, confront and question witnesses, and present evidence and testimony. No groups are barred from testifying, and, in principle, all testimony receives equal consideration. The law provides for the right to appeal. The law extends the rights of defendants in trial procedures to all citizens. ... The constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, in practice the government continued to impose restrictions and respect for religious freedom continued to deteriorate. The Council of Ulamo, a committee of Islamic clergy, provides interpretations of religious practice that imams throughout the country are required to follow. While the council is officially an independent religious body, in practice it is heavily influenced by the government. The Department of Religious Affairs (DRA) at the Ministry of Culture is responsible for general regulation of all religious organizations. The DRA, in consultation with local authorities, registers and approves all religious places of worship. For Muslims, the DRA controls all aspects of participation in the hajj, including choosing participants. President Rahmon established a Center for Islamic Studies during the year to guide religious policy. The government continued to impose limitations on personal conduct and to restrict activities of religious groups that it considered ""threats to national security."" ... Government officials visited mosques on a regular basis to monitor activities, observe those who attended the mosques, and examined audio and video materials for evidence of extremist and antigovernment material. The DRA continued to test imams on their religious knowledge and to ensure they followed official positions on religious issues. ... Government concerns about foreign influence resulted in restrictive measures against minority religious groups. The government continued its ban on HT [Hizb utTahrir], which it classified as an extremist Islamic political movement, and authorities introduced restrictive measures against another Islamic group, the Salafis. ...”","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4']",[],[],[],[],1

GREECE,3,Preliminary objection rejected (six months);Preliminary objection joined to merits and rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,Nicolas Bratza,"8. On 25 October 1990 and 9 November 1990 criminal complaints were lodged against the applicant for instigation to fraud and for issuing checks for the payment of which there were no adequate funds. The prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against him. 9. In 1994 the investigating judge ordered the applicant’s provisional detention (warrant No. 22/94). However, the applicant evaded arrest. 10. On 5 August 1994 the indictments chamber of the first instance criminal court (simvulio plimmeliodikon) of Athens decided to commit the applicant for trial to the three-member Court of Appeal (trimeles efetio) of Athens, sitting as a first instance court, on the above charges. The chamber confirmed the investigating judge’s warrant concerning the applicant’s detention. 11. On 2 February 1995 the indictments chamber decided to commit the applicant for trial on a number of supplementary charges. 12. The applicant was arrested on 2 September 1995. Until 30 October 1995 the applicant was deemed to be serving a sentence that had been imposed on him for unrelated offences in 1989. As a result, the applicant’s detention on remand on the fraud and other charges mentioned above officially started on 30 October 1995. 13. On 17 July 1996 the applicant applied for his provisional release. On 22 August 1996 the indictments chamber of the Court of Appeal of Athens rejected his application. 14. On 2 September 1996 the applicant appeared, together with MB, JK and DK, before the three-member Court of Appeal of Athens. He was represented by counsel who also acted for MB and JK. The trial lasted until 3 September 1996 when the court heard the final submissions of the parties on the question of guilt of the applicant and his co-defendants. Then the court withdrew for deliberations in the course of which it decided to acquit the applicant and convict MB and JK. 15. The relevant decision was pronounced and then the court heard submissions on the sentences to be imposed on MB and JK. Counsel who represented the applicant as well as MB and JK was heard in this connection. The court withdrew for deliberations in the course of which it decided on the penalties to be imposed. It also decided that “the applicant should not be compensated for the time he spent in detention on remand”. The relevant decision was pronounced on the same day, i.e. on 3 September 1996. 16. However, its text was finalised (katharographi) on 9 December 1996. The applicant was informed of this development later on and obtained a certified copy on 28 July 1997. 17. The Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: “Persons who have been detained on remand and subsequently acquitted ... have the right to request compensation ..., if it has been established in the proceedings that they did not commit the criminal offence for which they have been detained on remand.” “The State does not have any obligation to compensate a person who ... has been detained on remand if the latter, intentionally or by gross negligence, was responsible for his own detention.” “Upon an application submitted orally by the person who has been acquitted, the court which heard the case shall decide on the State's obligation to pay compensation in a separate decision issued at the same time as the verdict. However, the court may also issue such a decision proprio motu ... The decision regarding the obligation of the State to pay compensation cannot be challenged separately; it is, however, quashed when the decision on the principal issue of the criminal trial is reversed.” “The person who has suffered prejudice may request compensation at a later stage before the same court. In these circumstances, the application must be submitted to the public prosecutor of this court strictly within forty-eight hours from the pronouncement of the judgment in open court.” “After it has been decided that the State must pay compensation, the person entitled thereto may bring his claim before the civil courts, which may not re-examine the existence of the State's obligation.” “Persons who have been unfairly ... detained on remand must be compensated for any material prejudice they have suffered as a result of their ... detention. They must also be compensated for moral damage ... .”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Istanbul. 4. On an unspecified date in the late 1980s the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü) (“the General Directorate”) decided to partially expropriate the applicant’s land located in the Küçükçekmece district of Istanbul. The applicant only found out about this expropriation in May 2004. 5. On 21 May 2004 the applicant brought a civil action before the Küçükçekmece Civil Court for additional expropriation compensation. 6. On 21 June 2004 the title to the property was transferred to the General Directorate. 7. On 19 July 2005 the Küçükçekmece Civil Court awarded the applicant 783,749,741,900 Turkish liras (TRL) as additional compensation, plus interest at the statutory rate. 8. On 6 March 2006 the Court of Cassation upheld the first-instance court’s judgment. 9. The applicant subsequently initiated execution proceedings before the Şişli Execution Office to obtain her additional compensation. 10. On 31 July 2008 the applicant received a partial payment of 1,159,699.20 Turkish liras (TRY). 11. On 5 August 2008 the applicant brought a case before the Şişli Execution Court in respect of the General Directorate’s outstanding debt and the interest rate that should be applied to that amount. 12. On 24 October 2008 the Şişli Execution Court held that the General Directorate had an outstanding debt of TRY 479,605.44, payable with an interest rate of 30% running from 31 July 2008. 13. On 14 November 2008 the General Directorate appealed the judgment of the Şişli Execution Court. On 2 June 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld that judgment. 14. On 12 April 2010 the General Directorate paid the applicant TRY 745,797.18 to discharge its outstanding debt, together with interest. 15.

THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"9. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Portsmouth. In 1980 he joined the Royal Navy. 10. In or around early 1996, he was charged, pursuant to section 42 of the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (“the 1957 Act”), with three civilian offences (one under the Theft Act 1968 and two under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981). He was also charged, inter alia, on four counts of misapplication of public property contrary to section 30 of the 1957 Act. The charge sheet was signed by the convening authority, Rear Admiral N.E. Rankin (Flag Officer Portsmouth). 11. By convening order dated 1 February 1996, the convening authority acknowledged receipt of the “circumstantial letter” and ordered the convening of a court-martial for 26 February 1996 (see paragraph 21 below). He appointed the Prosecutor by name (of lower rank and in the convening authority’s chain of command). He also appointed the President of the court-martial and the other four members by name: all were subordinate in rank to the convening officer but were not in his chain of command. The Judge Advocate was also appointed by name by the convening authority and was not in the latter’s chain of command. 12. Advised that he could be represented by a civilian or naval lawyer, the applicant instructed a civilian lawyer, his current representative. 13. The court-martial took place on board HMS NELSON on 18 March 1996 and the applicant pleaded guilty to all charges. Having presented evidence in mitigation of sentence, he was sentenced, inter alia, to four months’ imprisonment, to be discharged from the navy and to stoppages of pay in the sum of 2,655 pounds sterling. 14. By letter dated 19 April 1996 the applicant was informed that his petition against sentence, which had been reviewed on behalf of the Admiralty Board by the Naval Secretary/Director General Naval Manning, had been rejected but that he could request that the petition be further considered by the Admiralty Board. He subsequently renewed his petition against sentence. On 17 May 1996 he was released from prison and by letter dated 7 June 1996 he was notified that his petition had been rejected. 15. The law and procedures in respect of naval courts-martial were contained in the Naval Discipline Act 1957 (“the 1957 Act”) and in certain statutory instruments made under the 1957 Act including the Naval Courts-Martial General Orders (Royal Navy) 1991 (“the 1991 Orders”). Following the Commission’s report in the case of Findlay v. the United Kingdom, certain provisions of the 1957 Act were amended by the Armed Forces Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”) which Act came into force on 1 April 1997 (Findlay v. the United Kingdom, no. 22107/93, Commission’s report of 5 September 1995 and, see also, judgment in that case of 25 February 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I). Sections A-G below concern the applicable law and practice prior to the entry into force of the 1996 Act. 16. Under section 42 of the 1957 Act “civilian” offences were also offences under the 1957 Act. Accordingly, even if the charge amounted to a civilian offence, in most cases naval personnel could be tried on that charge by the naval authorities under the 1957 Act. 17. At the material time a naval court-martial consisted of between 5-9 naval officers not below the rank of lieutenant, though the rank of the members might have been higher depending on the rank of the accused. Not all members belonged to the same ship or naval establishment and the captain and executive officer of the accused’s ship could not sit on the court-martial. 18. A President of the court-martial was appointed from the members. A Judge Advocate also took part in every naval court-martial. The Prosecutor could be a legally qualified naval officer or any other competent person. In exceptional cases, a civilian lawyer was appointed to act as Prosecutor. 19. An accused was allowed to engage, inter alia, an officer or civilian counsel (“the accused’s friend”) who advised the accused, examined the accused if he desired to give evidence, cross-examined witnesses for the prosecution and examined witnesses for the defence. If the accused wished to be represented by a civilian lawyer he could apply to the convening authority for approval of legal aid. 20. The convening authority was an officer authorised by the Defence Council to convene a court-martial. Appendix 5 to Volume II of the Manual of Naval Law (published by the naval authorities) gave a list of officers who could act as convening authority: Commander in Chief, Fleet; Commander in Chief, Naval Home Command; Flag Officer Plymouth; Flag Officer Scotland and Northern Ireland; Flag Officer Naval Aviation; Flag Officer Portsmouth; Flag Officer Surface Flotilla; Flag Officer Sea Training; Commander UK Task Force; and Commander British Forces Gibraltar. 21. An application for a court-martial to be held was generally made to the convening authority by the Commanding Officer by way of a “circumstantial letter”. This letter reported the circumstances upon which a charge was based in sufficient detail to show the real nature and extent of the offence. Any statement made by the accused in the course of inquiries, during investigation or after he was charged had to be forwarded in a separate document annexed to the letter. A charge sheet in the prescribed form, a list of witnesses for the prosecution, summaries of evidence of those witnesses and a list of exhibits which the Prosecutor proposed to put in evidence accompanied the letter. 22. Based on the material submitted, the convening authority decided on the charges to be retained against an accused and, if he was satisfied with the charge sheet accompanying the circumstantial letter, he could countersign the charge sheet. He also decided on the necessity to hold a court-martial on the charges retained. In this latter respect, the convening authority was guided by the principles issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and was not to order the holding of a court-martial unless satisfied that the charges were correct, that the evidence was sufficient (namely, that there was a realistic prospect of a conviction) and that there was a “service interest” in trying the matter by court-martial. In convening the court-martial, the convening authority appointed the date, time and place for trial. 23. The convening authority appointed the President and other members of the court-martial. He also appointed, or directed an officer to appoint, a Judge Advocate and a Prosecutor. He ensured that the accused was properly assisted. In this latter respect, and unless the accused wished to represent himself or to instruct civilian counsel, the convening authority would nominate a competent naval officer to act as the accused’s friend. 24. The convening authority could, in exceptional circumstances, countermand the ordering of a court-martial before its commencement and dissolve a court-martial during the trial if circumstances arose which, in his opinion, rendered such action necessary (orders 13(2) and 28(2) of the 1991 Orders). 25. The Judge Advocate of the Fleet was appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the Lord Chancellor and was removable on the same authority for inability or misbehaviour. He had to be a barrister or advocate of not less than ten years’ standing. He acted as legal advisor to the Admiralty Board on matters regarding the administration of justice under the 1957 Act. It was his duty to review all contested courts-martial whether the verdict was guilty or not guilty and, in particular, he advised that Board whether a court-martial had been properly conducted according to law and whether the conviction could stand, he gave a view on the sentence and he drew attention to any gross errors or irregularities. He also gave the Chief Naval Judge Advocate his view as to the manner in which the naval barristers had conducted themselves as Judge Advocate, Prosecutor and as the accused’s friend. As a result of the latter advice, “there may well be downstream actions issuing guidance either specifically or generally” (Manual of Naval Law, Appendix 5). 26. The Chief Naval Judge Advocate was a serving officer of the rank of captain of the Royal Navy and he was also a barrister. The Chief Naval Judge Advocate was assisted by a staff of serving naval officers who were barristers. His duties included assisting and consulting with the Judge Advocate of the Fleet, advising on the selection and appointment of naval barristers and sitting as Judge Advocate at naval courts-martial where the seriousness of the charges, the complexity of the trial, the rank of the accused or the interests of the Service so required. 27. In all other cases, a Judge Advocate was appointed to a court-martial from the staff of the Chief Naval Judge Advocate. 28. Before the trial the Judge Advocate appointed informed the convening authority of any defect in the constitution of the court-martial. He advised the court-martial, whether his opinion was requested or not, upon all questions of law and procedure which arose and the court-martial had to accept his advice unless there were weighty reasons for rejecting it, in which case those reasons had to be recorded. 29. The Judge Advocate had to ensure that the accused did not suffer any disadvantage during the hearing in consequence of, inter alia, the accused’s position, ignorance or incapacity to examine witnesses. Before the closing of the trial the Judge Advocate summed up the relevant law and evidence. The Judge Advocate was not present when the court considered its finding and, if during the court-martial’s deliberations on the charges further advice was required, the court-martial had to receive that advice in open court. The Judge Advocate advised the court-martial on sentence but not in open court. 30. The accused could object to any particular member of the court-martial and to its general constitution. If the objection to the President was upheld the court had to adjourn until another was appointed. If an objection to a member was upheld, another member could be appointed from the “spare members list” and, if an objection as to the constitution of the court-martial was upheld, the court-martial had to adjourn and report the matter to the convening authority. All members of the court and any other officers of the court-martial had to take a prescribed oath or affirmation (section 60 of the 1955 Act). The opinion of the President and of each member of the court-martial had to be given orally and on each charge separately, and their opinions had to be given in order of seniority commencing with the junior in rank. The vote of the majority determined sentence. 31. Before the court accepted a plea of guilty, the Judge Advocate had to ensure that the accused understood the charge to which he had pleaded and the different procedure which would result from that plea. The Prosecutor then read the circumstantial letter. Before the court proceeded to deliberate on sentence, the Prosecutor, whenever possible, called relevant witness evidence on information in the possession of the naval authorities as to the accused’s background and history which might have rendered the accused more likely to commit the offence, as to his service history and as to his previous convictions. The accused could also give evidence and call witnesses in mitigation. The court-martial had to take note of the accused’s naval record (for example, awards for gallantry). The members of the court-martial retired (with the Judge Advocate) to consider the sentence. The court-martial did not give reasons for its decision on sentence. 32. Having received the report of the finding and sentence, the convening authority took the necessary steps to give effect to the sentence (either by a committal order or otherwise) or he could order the suspension of the sentence pursuant to section 90 of the 1957 Act. Chapter 15 of the Manual of Naval law (Volume II) pointed out that before the convening authority gave effect to or suspended the sentence, he (or, inter alia, the Commander in Chief) had to satisfy himself so far as he was able, that no errors had been made in the conduct of the court-martial likely, in his opinion, to invalidate the finding of the court-martial. If he doubted the correctness of the finding, in fact or in law, or the legality of the sentence, he could not execute the sentence pending reference to the Defence Council. In such circumstances, the accused was retained in custody or the sentence was suspended under section 90 of the Act. 33. The convening authority (among other naval authorities) could at any time, and had to at intervals of not more than three months, reconsider any case of suspension and if on reconsideration it appeared that the conduct of the offender since his conviction had been such as to justify a remission of sentence, he had to remit the whole or any part of it (section 92 of the 1957 Act). 34. A certified transcript of the proceedings was completed and sent through the commander-in-chief or senior naval officer to the Defence Council. The Defence Council could, at any time, review a finding of guilt, any sentence awarded in respect of such a finding and any finding by a court-martial that a person was unfit to stand trial or was not guilty by reason of insanity. This had to be done by the Defence Council in the case of a court-martial as soon as practicable after the receipt of the record of proceedings (section 70(1) of the 1957 Act). 35. A convicted person could also petition the Defence Council against the findings or sentence or both (section 70(2) of the 1957 Act). Having reviewed the petition, the Defence Council could, inter alia, quash or alter findings, authorise a re-trial and annul, remit or alter sentences. However, those powers could be, and were normally, carried out by the Admiralty Board or by any officer so empowered by the Admiralty Board. Once an appeal was lodged with the Courts-Martial Appeal Court, the review functions of the Defence Council ceased. 36. The Courts-Martial Appeal Court (“CMAC”) was established by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1951 and was confirmed by the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968. The CMAC had the same status and, in essence, the same procedure as the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal and considered appeals from courts-martial. The judges of this court included ordinary and ex officio judges of the Court of Appeal and such judges of the High Court as were nominated by the Lord Chief Justice. There was no provision for an appeal against sentence only, although certain powers of revising such sentences, pursuant to an appeal against conviction, were available to the CMAC. Once an application to the CMAC was received by the Registrar of the CMAC, the Defence Council’s duty to review ceases. 37. The changes to the naval court-martial system brought about by this Act are set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Grieves v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 57067/00, §§ 16-62, ECHR 2003XII).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in the town of Saransk in the Mordoviya Republic. 5. In 1990 the applicant obtained a State special-purpose commodity bond (облигация государственного целевого беспроцентного займа). By its terms the Government undertook to give her a Russian-made VAZ passenger car. 6. It appears that in 1993 the applicant requested the State to comply with its obligation, but it could not be fulfilled for want of cars. 7. After the change in legislation in 1995 and 1996, the applicant became entitled to compensation in the amount equal to the car value, as described in the bond and determined in co-ordination with car manufacturers at the moment of redemption. 8. It appears that in August 1998 the applicant received partial compensation. 9. In November 1999 she sued the Government for the full market value of the car. 10.

On 27 June 1991 the Jastrzębie Zdrój District Prosecutor issued a warrant of arrest against the applicant who was suspected of attempted manslaughter, robbery and rape. He was arrested on the same day. 8. On 23 September 1991 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) prolonged the detention on remand until 30 November 1991 finding a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crimes in question. The Court considered that certain witnesses had to be heard and that expert opinions should be taken. 9. On 29 November 1991 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor transmitted the bill of indictment to the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant was charged with attempted manslaughter, assault, causing severe bodily harm, use of a dangerous weapon, aggravated theft, rape and theft. 10. On 14 January 1992 the applicant requested the Katowice Regional Court to release him. On 20 January 1992 the Court refused to order the applicant's release in view of the seriousness of the offences concerned. 11. On 4 March 1992 the first hearing was held before the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant requested that the case be transmitted to the Jelenia Góra Regional Court as most witnesses lived nearby. He requested access to the case-file in order to read it in a detailed manner. The Court refused the first request and complied with the second. 12. On 2 April 1992 the applicant failed to appear before the Court. It transpires from the minutes of the hearing that he had refused to leave the prison cell as he felt unwell. A prison physician stated that there were no medical objections to the applicant's participation in the hearing. The hearing set for 20 May 1992 was not held for the same reason. 13. On 30 June 1992 the Court heard the applicant, who denied his involvement in the crimes concerned, and another accused. The hearing was adjourned for 24 September 1992. At this date the court heard four witnesses and further questioned the applicant. On 25 September 1992 five further witnesses were heard. The hearing was adjourned until 18 November 1992. 14. Subsequently the judge rapporteur fell ill. He remained on sick leave from 10 November 1992 to 31 August 1994. The case was assigned to a new panel of judges. 15. On 16 April 1993 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice about the length of the proceedings. 16. The hearing fixed on 18 June 1993 was adjourned as the applicant's officially appointed counsel requested that the case be assigned to another lawyer in view of his bad health. 17. On 2 August 1993 the hearing was recommenced in view of the change in the composition of the court. The court questioned the applicant and another co-accused. The hearing was adjourned for 8 and 14 September 1993. 18. On 5 August 1993 the officially appointed lawyer informed the court that the applicant had withdrawn his power of attorney. At the hearing set for 8 September 1993 this lawyer was not present. The Court adjourned the hearing until 14 September 1993 and assigned two new lawyers for the applicant's defence. As they failed to appear at the hearing on 14 September 1993, the Court adjourned the hearing until 4 October 1993. 19. On 4 October 1993 one of the officially appointed lawyers requested that the hearing be recommenced. The Court complied with this request and again questioned the applicant and another co-accused. 20. On 3 November 1993 the applicant complained to the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) about the length of the proceedings in his case and on 18 November 1993 to the Minister of Justice. 21. At the hearing on 19 and 22 November 1993 the court heard sixteen witnesses. At the hearing on 7 January 1994 only two out of fifteen witnesses who were to be heard on that day complied with the summonses. The Court imposed fines on some of them. 22. On 15 December 1993 the President of the Katowice Regional Court requested the President of the Criminal Division of that Court to follow closely the progress in the case and to prepare each month a progress report, with a first date set for 7 January 1994. 23. By a letter of 7 February 1994 the applicant requested the court to recall two of the counsel assigned to his case under the legal aid scheme and to assign the case to the lawyer who had been representing him at the beginning of the proceedings. On 21 February 1994 the court refused, having noted that the first officially appointed counsel had fallen ill; subsequently the applicant had withdrawn the power of attorney of the second counsel; and the third counsel had retired. The court further pointed out that granting the applicant’s request would have resulted in a fifth lawyer financed by the legal aid scheme representing the applicant in the proceedings. 24. On 23 February 1994 three witnesses were heard. On 28 February 1994 the hearing was adjourned as the president of the court fell ill. 25. On 14 March 1994 the President of the Katowice Regional Court reiterated his request to the President of the Criminal Division to supervise the proceedings and to present a first report on the progress by 10 May 1994. 26. On 30 March 1994 the Ombudsman requested the President of the Katowice Regional Court to inform him about the progress in the case. 27. At a hearing on 23 May 1994 five witnesses out of eighteen summoned for that date complied with the summonses. The applicant requested to be released. The court, having heard the prosecutor’s argument in reply, refused to release him in view of the seriousness of the crimes he was charged with. The court further considered that there was the risk of collusion. On 25 May 1994 the applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Katowice Court of Appeal. On 1 June 1994 the Katowice Court of Appeal upheld the contested decision. The Court observed that the applicant was suspected of serious crimes and that there was a risk of collusion. The Court noted that there was progress in the case as hearings were being held. Thus, even regard being had to the fact that the applicant had been detained on remand for three years, there were no reasons which would justify his release. 28. On 5 June 1994 the applicant again requested that his counsel be changed. 29. On 7 June 1994 the Ombudsman again requested the President to inform him about the progress in the case and to indicate whether there were still grounds for detention on remand. 30. On 20 June 1994 the Regional Court ordered that accused Z.P. be released in view of his poor health. 31. On 28 June 1994 the applicant requested his release, relying on his rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights. 32. On 4 July 1994 the Katowice Regional Court refused to release the applicant. The Court noted that the applicant was suspected of dangerous crimes. It also considered that there was a risk of collusion and that, if released, the applicant would jeopardise the criminal proceedings by trying to bear pressure on witnesses and by contacting another co-accused who was not detained. 33. On 16 July 1994 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice about the length of the proceedings. 34. From June to September 1994 the Court composed a list of the addresses of witnesses who had failed to appear on 23 May 1994. In particular, the court had to establish the address of the rape victim. 35. On 11 October 1994 three witnesses out of the eighteen summoned for that date complied with the summonses. The applicant requested a medical examination in view of his gastrological problems. The court ordered the medical services of the Krakow Detention Centre to submit a medical opinion as to their gravity. Another coaccused, who had been released on 23 June 1994 in view of his illhealth, failed to appear. 36. On 28 October 1994 the applicant refused to leave the prison cell. A medical opinion of 14 November 1994 stated that he suffered from chronic gastritis, but could be treated in the prison. 37. In a letter of 10 November 1994 the applicant challenged the judges. He referred to the fact that on 11 October 1994 the court had ordered the police to force him to leave his cell in order to attend the hearing. On 12 December 1994 the Katowice Regional Court refused to comply with this request. 38. At the hearing on 10 January 1995 two out of ten witnesses appeared before the court. On 31 January 1995 three witnesses were heard. On 7 February 1995 the applicant refused to leave the prison cell, declaring that he felt unwell and he had not received the summons. The court adjourned the hearing in order for a physician to established whether the applicant’s condition prevented him from attending the hearing. Having examined the applicant, the physician stated that there were no medical objections to the applicant’s participation in the hearing. 39. Further hearings were held on 7 March and 22 March 1995. On 22 March 1995 the Court convicted the applicant of attempted manslaughter, rape and aggravated theft and sentenced him to twentyfive years' imprisonment. 40. On 19 October 1995, following the applicant’s appeal, the Katowice Court of Appeal in part quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered that the case be reconsidered. On 27 May 1997 the Katowice Regional Court again convicted the applicant and imposed a sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment. 41. The Polish Code of Criminal Procedure, enacted in 1969 applicable at the material time, listed as so-called “preventive measures”, inter alia, detention on remand, bail and police supervision. The authorities competent to decide on detention on remand were provided for in Articles 210 and 212 of the Code, which read as follows: ""1. Preventive measures [i.e. detention on remand, bail and police supervision] shall be imposed by the court; before a bill of indictment is lodged with the court, they shall be ordered by the prosecutor (...)."" ""1. A decision concerning preventive measures may be appealed [to a higher court] .... 2. A prosecutor's order on detention on remand may be appealed to the court competent to deal with the merits of the case...."" 42 43. The courts, when ruling on the prosecutor’s request submitted in pursuance of Article 222 of the Code, were under an obligation to determine the period for which detention could be prolonged. If the court refused to grant the prosecutor’s request for prolongation of detention or if the prosecutor had failed to submit a request for such prolongation before or on the expiry of the last detention order, the detained person had to be released. 44. Article 213 of the Code provided that a preventive measure should be immediately quashed or altered if the basis therefor had ceased to exist or if new circumstances had arisen which justified quashing or replacing a given measure which a more or less lenient one. 45. Under Article 217 § 1 (2) and (4) of the Code, detention on remand could be imposed if there was a reasonable risk that an accused would attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the due course of the proceedings by any other unlawful means, or if the accused had been charged with an offence posing a serious danger to society. 46. Under the provisions of the 1969 Code there were three different legal avenues whereby a detained person could challenge the lawfulness of his or her detention and thus possibly obtain release. Under Article 212. § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure he could appeal to a court against a detention order given by a prosecutor (see § 41 above). Under Article 222 §§ 2(1) and 3 he could lodge an appeal against a further decision by that court prolonging his detention at a prosecutor's request. Finally, Article 214 of the Code stated that an accused could at any time apply to the authority conducting the criminal proceedings, i.e. the prosecutor or the court, depending on the stage the proceedings had reached, to have a preventive measure quashed or altered. 47. Imposition and prolongation of preventive measures, including detention on remand, were examined by the courts in proceedings held in camera. The presence of the parties at court sessions other than hearings, including sessions held in proceedings concerning review of detention on remand, was regulated in Articles 87 and 88 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which, insofar as relevant, provided: ""The court pronounces its decisions at a hearing if the law provides for it; and otherwise, at a court session held in camera. ..."" ""A court session in camera may be attended by a prosecutor (...); other parties may attend if the law provides for it."" 48. A new Code of Criminal Procedure was enacted by the Sejm (Parliament) on 6 June 1997. It entered into force on 1 September 1998. Pursuant to Article 249 of the new Code, before deciding on the application of the preventive measures, the court shall hear the person charged with offence. The lawyer of the detainee should be allowed to attend in the court session, if he or she is present. It is not mandatory to inform the lawyer of the date and time of the court session, unless the suspect so requests and if it will not hinder the proceedings. 49. The court shall inform the lawyer of a detained person of the date and time of court sessions at which a decision is to be taken concerning prolongation of detention on remand, or an appeal against a decision to impose or to prolong detention on remand is to be considered.","['5', '6']","['5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1959 and resides in the village of AchkhoyMartan in the Chechen Republic. She is the mother of Mr Timur Beksultanov, born in 1980. 6. In the applicant’s submission her family members, including Timur Beksultanov, were victims of continuing persecution on the part of the domestic authorities. In July 2003 Timur Beksultanov even had to quit his job as a coach in the Achkhoy-Martan local sports centre. Furthermore, on several occasions (the applicant did not furnish the exact dates) servicemen of the federal forces allegedly burst into the applicant’s house, searched it and intimidated the applicant and members of her family. 7. On 7 July 2003 the prosecutor’s office of the Achkhoy-Martan District (“the district prosecutor’s office”) opened a criminal case against Timur Beksultanov under Articles 205 § 2 (terrorism), 208 § 2 (participation in an illegal armed group), 222 § 2 (aggravated possession of weapons) and 317 (assault on a law-enforcement officer) of the Criminal Code (“CC”). The case file was assigned the number 44050. It appears that Timur Beksultanov was put on a list of wanted persons in connection with those proceedings. 8. According to the applicant, Timur Beksultanov denied the charges against him and intended to appear at the district prosecutor’s office. 9. On 2 October 2004 Mr I.M., an officer of the police special-purpose squad (“OMON”), came to the applicant’s house and asked Timur Beksultanov to follow him to an unidentified destination “to explain that [Timur Beksultanov] was not implicated in any terrorist activities”. The two men got into I.M.’s vehicle, a VAZ-2107, and drove off. The applicant memorised only a sequence of three figures from the car number plate, namely “940”. 10. The following account of the events is based on the information allegedly obtained by the applicant from two persons, one of them being identified by her as “a shepherd” and another as “a villager of AchkhoyMartan”. The applicant did not indicate the names of those witnesses or furnish copies of their statements. In her submission, the witnesses did not wish to give their names because they feared reprisals. 11. According to the applicant, one of the witnesses told her that at about 11 a.m. on 2 October 2004 he had seen a convoy of several armoured personnel carriers (“APCs”) and UAZ vehicles stationed at a crossroads between three villages, where one of the roads led to Shaami-Yurt. There had been numerous servicemen near the vehicles. A VAZ-2107 vehicle had approached the convoy. Timur Beksultanov and I.M. had got out of the vehicle and the servicemen had requested their identity papers. Having checked them, the servicemen had twisted Timur Beksultanov’s arms and had started beating him up. When he had fallen on the ground, the witness had heard several shots and had seen that Timur Beksultanov was wounded in his thigh. Immediately thereafter an officer had approached Timur Beksultanov and had shot him in the shoulder. After that the servicemen had put Timur Beksultanov in an APC and had driven off to an unknown destination. The servicemen had not done anything to I.M., who had got back inside his vehicle and had driven away. According to the applicant, the witness had not been able to hear everything which had occurred at the crossroads but had clearly seen what had been going on there. 12. On 2 October 2004, several hours after her son’s abduction, the vehicle in which he had been placed by his abductors, was stationed at the Achkhoy-Martan Department of the Interior (“the ROVD”). 13. The applicant learnt about the apprehension of Timur Beksultanov from the relatives of I.M. on 3 October 2004. 14. According to written statements by Zh.E., M.G., Z.M. and R.B., dated 20 December 2004 and furnished by the applicant, those persons submitted that on 2 October 2004 they had seen Timur Beksultanov get inside a vehicle together with a man who introduced himself as I.M., an OMON officer. I.M. had picked up Timur Beksultanov at the applicant’s house to accompany him to the law-enforcement authorities because the former wished to surrender in connection with the criminal charges against him. Zh.E., M.G., Z.M. and R.B. stated that on the following days they had learnt that I.M. had taken the applicant’s son into an ambush to deliver him to the authorities. 15. The applicant has had no news of Timur Beksultanov since 2 October 2004. 16. The Government submitted that the domestic proceedings had obtained no evidence that Timur Beksultanov had been abducted by State agents. 17. On 8 October 2004 the applicant complained in writing about the abduction of Timur Beksultanov to various State bodies, including the President of the Commission for Prisoners and Missing Persons with the President of the Russian Federation, the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Military Circuit, the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment (UGA), the Prosecutor of the Chechen Republic and the district prosecutor’s office. In those complaints she submitted that, at about noon on 2 October 2004, armed men who had been wearing camouflage uniforms and had arrived in several APCs, military UAZ vehicles and a private vehicle, had stopped I.M.’s vehicle with plate no. “940” and had taken away Timur Beksultanov. The abduction had occurred at the crossroads between three villages, where one of the roads led to Shaami-Yurt. In her complaints the applicant also claimed that, according to I.M., as of 6 October 2004 her son was still alive and was held in Khankala. 18. On 25 October 2004 the prosecutor’s office of the Chechen Republic (“the republican prosecutor’s office) forwarded the applicant’s complaint about the abduction of Timur Beksultanov for examination to the district prosecutor’s office. 19. On 5 November 2004 the Office of the Ombudsman of the Russian Federation forwarded the applicant’s complaint about “the abduction of T. Beksultanov by officers of the special-purpose Department of the Sunzhenskiy Department of the Interior” to the Prosecutor General’s Office. 20. On 9 November 2004 the applicant re-submitted her complaint of 8 October 2004 to the same State authorities. 21. On 1 December 2004 the republican prosecutor’s office replied to the applicant that her complaint about the abduction of Timur Beksultanov had been appended to case file no. 44050 opened against him in July 2003. She was also notified that Timur Beksultanov had been put on a federal list of wanted persons and that measures aimed at establishing his whereabouts were under way. 22. On 3 December 2004 the military prosecutor’s office of the North Caucasus Circuit forwarded the applicant’s complaint about the abduction of her son to the UGA military prosecutor’s office and advised the applicant that she was to address all her queries to that body. 23. On 21 December 2004 the Ministry of the Interior of the Chechen Republic notified the applicant that they had forwarded her complaint about the abduction of her son to the district prosecutor’s office. 24. On 10 February 2005 the prosecutor’s office of military unit 20102 informed the applicant that they were verifying the information contained in her complaint about the abduction of her son and that they would notify her about their decision in due course. 25. On 12 February 2005 the Chechen Department of the Federal Security Service (“the Chechen Department of the FSB”) informed the applicant that they had forwarded her complaint about the abduction of Timur Beksultanov to the district prosecutor’s office for examination. 26. On 16 February 2005 the Chechen Department of the FSB replied to the applicant’s repeated complaint that on 2 October 2004 they had not carried out any special operations in the Achkhoy-Martanovskiy District. The letter also stated that the department officials had not arrested Timur Beksultanov. 27. By a letter of 4 March 2005 the prosecutor’s office of military unit no. 20102 notified the applicant that their inquiry had not established the implication of servicemen of the federal forces in the abduction of Timur Beksultanov. The letter also pointed out that the applicant’s complaint about the apprehension of Timur Beksultanov had been appended to case file no. 44050 opened against him on 7 July 2003 and in connection with which he had been put on the list of wanted persons. On 19 February 2005 the preliminary investigation in case no. 44050 had been adjourned owing to the fact that the whereabouts of Timur Beksultanov remained unknown. The district prosecutor’s office was taking investigative steps to establish his whereabouts with a view to prosecuting him for the crimes of which he was suspected. 28. On 17 May 2005 the applicant’s representatives wrote to the prosecutor of the Achkhoy-Martan District, enquiring, among other things, whether the district prosecutor’s office had launched an investigation into the abduction of Timur Beksultanov and what steps it had taken to establish his whereabouts. They also requested that the applicant be provided access to the relevant documents. 29. On 29 December 2005 the applicant’s representatives complained to the republican prosecutor’s office that they had not received a reply to their letter of 17 May 2005. It appears that their repeated query was also left without reply. 30. On 23 January 2007 the applicant’s representatives wrote to the prosecutor of the Achkhoy-Martan District and the republican prosecutor’s office, reiterating the questions raised in their letters dated 17 May and 29 December 2005. 31. On 7 February 2007 the republican prosecutor’s office replied to the applicant’s representatives that Timur Beksultanov had been put on the federal list of wanted persons in connection with criminal case no. 44050. The investigators of that criminal case had verified the applicant’s version that her son had been abducted by unidentified persons on 2 October 2004. However, apart from the applicant’s own statement, no objective evidence had been obtained to the effect that her son had, indeed, been abducted. At the same time, the investigators had sufficient reasons to believe that the applicant was deliberately complaining about the abduction of Timur Beksultanov in order to shield him from the criminal responsibility for the crimes he had committed. 32. On 25 May 2009 the applicant wrote to the head of the investigating department of the investigating committee with the Prosecutor’s Office in the Chechen Republic. She reiterated the circumstances of her son’s disappearance and requested to be informed whether the authorities had opened an investigation into his disappearance and what steps they had taken to elucidate it. 33. On 24 September 2009 the Chief Military Prosecutor’s Office replied to the applicant that they had forwarded her complaint about the abduction of her son to the military prosecutor’s office of the United Group Alignment (“the UGS prosecutor’s office”). 34. By a letter of 6 October 2009 the district prosecutor’s office informed the applicant’s husband that they had received the complaint about the abduction of his son. The letter stated that Timur Beksultanov was being searched for on suspicion of having committed a number of serious crimes, in connection with which criminal proceedings had been instituted against him. The authorities were carrying out unspecified measures to examine the submissions concerning Timur Beksultanov’s allegedly unlawful arrest. 35. The Government submitted that the domestic authorities had not opened a separate investigation into the disappearance of Timur Beksultanov because he had been placed on a wanted list in connection with the criminal proceedings in case no. 44050 instituted against him. All the applicant’s submissions concerning his alleged abduction had been examined within the framework of the criminal proceedings in case no. 44050. The Government refused to provide the Court with a full copy of criminal case file no. 44050, without providing an explanation. The information provided by the Government and contained in the documents submitted by them may be summarised as follows. 36. On 6 July 2003 the district prosecutor’s office instituted criminal proceedings against a number of persons, including Timur Beksultanov, on suspicion of participation in illegal armed groups, assault on officers of lawenforcement authorities and possession of arms (Articles 317, 208 § 2 and 222 § 2 of the CC). The decision stated, in particular, that on 5 July 2003 officers of the Achkhoy-Martan police department had carried out an operation aimed at arresting members of illegal armed groups. In the course of the operation they had stopped a vehicle with Timur Beksultanov, R.K. and U.S. inside. R.K. had opened fire on the police officers, had wounded one of them and had been killed in the ensuing skirmish. The police officers had arrested U.S., whilst Timur Beksultanov had managed to escape. The case file was assigned the number 44050. 37. On 8 July 2003 a further criminal case was opened against Timur Beksultanov and R.K. under Article 317 of the CC on suspicion of an armed assault on a police officer, who had been severely wounded. The case file was given the number 44052. 38. On 21 July 2003 investigators of the district prosecutor’s office searched the applicant’s home in connection with the proceedings in case no. 44050. The related decision stated that there was information that Timur Beksultanov was hiding from investigators at his mother’s home at 23 Budennogo Street in Achkhoy-Martan. According to the search record of the same date, 400 grams of trotyl were discovered at the applicant’s home. 39. Between 21 July and 20 August 2003 a number of local police departments and other law-enforcement authorities were instructed to search for Timur Beksultanov in connection with the criminal proceedings against him. It transpires that in the same time span a number of expert examinations concerning the weapons seized from the crime scenes and the trotyl found at Timur Beksultanov’s home were conducted. Further expert examinations with a view to establishing the severity of the injuries inflicted on the victims were carried out; the victims and some witnesses to the assaults were interviewed in the same period of time. 40. On 6 October 2003 criminal cases nos. 44050 and 44052 were joined; the new case file was assigned the number 44050. 41. On 29 November 2003 Timur Beksultanov’s name was put on a wanted list as a person suspected of a number of crimes; the lawenforcement authorities of the Achkhoy-Martan district were instructed to search for him. 42. Between 29 November and 3 December 2003 the investigators interviewed a number of witnesses about the circumstances of the crimes imputed to the applicant’s son. 43. On 5 December 2003 the criminal case against U.S. was severed from the proceedings in case no. 44050. 44. On 6 December 2003 the investigation in case no. 44050 was suspended. 45. It appears that between December 2003 and September 2004 the investigators instructed a number of law-enforcement authorities to search for Timur Beksultanov but their requests yielded no results. 46. On 10 September 2004 the district prosecutor’s office received yet another criminal case file no. 38567 opened against Timur Beksultanov on 19 April 2004 on suspicion of unlawfully selling a pistol to a third person. On 10 September 2004 case file no. 38567 was joined to case file no. 44050; the new case file was assigned the number 44050. 47. On 15 September 2004 the investigation in case no. 44050 was suspended owing to its failure to locate Timur Beksultanov. 48. On 19 January 2005 the investigation in case no. 44050 was resumed. The decision stated, in particular, that on 17 October 2004 the district prosecutor’s office had received the applicant’s complaint that on 2 October 2004 persons in camouflage uniforms had arrested Timur Beksultanov at the “Kavkaz” highway near the Shaami-Yurt woodland and had taken him to an unknown destination. It further stated that the applicant’s submissions were to be examined and that operational and search measures aimed at locating Timur Beksultanov were to be activated. 49. On 26 January 2005 the district prosecutor’s office instructed its counterparts and departments of the interior in the Chechen Republic and other regions of Russia to inform it whether they had arrested the applicant’s son, held him in detention or otherwise had any information on his whereabouts. They were also requested to ensure that the search for Timur Beksultanov be activated. It appears to follow from the replies of the relevant authorities, dated between February and May 2005, that those measures yielded no results and that no relevant information was obtained following the investigators’ request. 50. On an unspecified date in January 2005 the investigators interviewed the applicant. Her interview record, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “... [Timur Beksultanov] had worked as a coach at the local school before 2003. In 2003 I learnt that he had a pistol. He explained to me that he needed it for self-defence ... Some time later our close relative M.B. attempted to kill his sister A.B., who was allegedly leading an immoral life ... Subsequently we heard rumours that my son had given the pistol to M.B. Several days later police officers stopped a car with my son and two other persons inside to arrest them. My son managed to escape but they had seized his passport and pistol. One of the persons in the car had opened fire on the policemen and was shot dead. After that the authorities had started persecuting our family. On several occasions persons in camouflage uniforms and masks burst into our house, looking for [Timur Beksultanov], whose name had by that time been placed on a wanted list. On several occasions I tried to persuade him to surrender but he was afraid of getting a long prison term or disappearing ... Until autumn 2004 [Timur Beksultanov] had succeeded in hiding from authorities. However, at some point I talked him into surrendering and he promised to do so by 7 October 2004. At about 11 a.m. on 2 October 2004 [Timur Beksultanov] left home together with I.M., an OMON officer. They went to Grozny in I.M.’s silvery VAZ-2109 vehicle with licence plate containing figures “904” [sic]. [Timur Beksultanov] promised me that he would return ... that evening, but he did not return. On 3 October 2004 an unknown man came to my house and told me that Timur had been arrested. He explained that on 2 October 2004 he had taken his cattle to a river not far from Shaami-Yurt, close to the road between Katyr-Yurt and Shaami-Yurt. There he had seen a number of military vehicles, including several APCs, military UAZ vehicles and a UAZ-469 vehicle. One of the APCs had the licence plate number “E-422”. The vehicles had been stationed at a crossroads. The man had then seen a silvery VAZ-2109 vehicle move in the direction of Shaami-Yurt. When the VAZ2109 had approached the military vehicles, they encircled it and shots had been fired. One of the men from the VAZ-2109 vehicle, who had been beaten up, had been placed in a UAZ vehicle and the other had been taken by his hands and feet and thrown in an APC, following which the military vehicles had driven off in the direction of Achkhoy-Martan through the village of Katyr-Yurt. The man had heard that the call sign of the servicemen had been “Falcon”. During the events described by him, the man had hidden in the bushes by the road. ... He refused to give his name or to testify before any law-enforcement authorities. According to the man, one of the APCs had white colouring, from beneath which green colour could be seen. When the servicemen had taken off, they had left the VAZ-2109 vehicle behind. Following that we contacted the authorities and started searching for our son on our own on the outskirts of the village of Shaami-Yurt; ... the villagers told us that they had seen military vehicles and had heard the shooting but when we asked them to give their names, they refused and stated that they would not testify before any lawenforcement authorities. On the second day of our search I learnt that the vehicle in which my son had gone to Grozny together with I.M. had been brought to the local ROVD by police officer D. on the order of the head of the [Achkhoy-Martan] ROVD. Some time later I learnt that that vehicle had been transferred to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. I also learnt that after a while I.M. was released and that he started working [in the police] again. I also learnt that during his arrest my son had been wounded in the right side of the chest and in the right thigh. I don’t know if he is alive or not. There were many rumours about my son’s placement in various power structures of the FSB in Khankala; I mentioned all that information in my complaints to the authorities.” 51. On 1 February 2005 the investigator in charge of case no. 44050 instructed the Achkhoy-Martan police to examine the applicant’s submissions concerning the abduction of her son by, in particular, identifying and interviewing any witnesses to his apprehension (particular attention was to be paid to persons residing in the vicinity of the crossroads between Shaami-Yurt and the “Kavkaz” motorway). 52. It appears that following the investigator’s instructions the police interviewed five residents of Shaami-Yurt; they all stated that they did not know anything about the abduction of the applicant’s son. 53. On 27 June and 9 July 2005 a number of law-enforcement authorities forwarded to the district prosecutor’s office the applicant’s further complaints about the abduction of her son by camouflaged armed men and instructed the latter body to examine her submissions and to inform her of any decisions taken by 20 July 2005. 54. On an unspecified date in 2005 the head of the criminal police of the ROVD Mr V.K. issued a certificate (справка), which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “The ROVD has operational information [оперативная информация] to the effect that on 3 October 2004 unidentified officers of security forces stopped on the ‘RostovBaku’ motorway a civilian vehicle in which, according to the available sources, Timur Beksultanov, born in 1980, residing at 25 Budennogo Street, Achkhoy-Martan, was found. The ROVD received no complaints from the relatives of [Timur Beksultanov] about his arrest or abduction. The Achkhoy-Martan ROVD has no information on ‘Akhmed’, who had been arrested together with [Timur Beksultanov]. There is information that military armoured vehicles were used during [Timur Beksultanov’s] arrest. There is no information on Beksultanov’s ensuing whereabouts or the persons who had arrested him.” 55. On 19 February 2005 the district prosecutor’s office suspended the investigation in case no. 44050, owing to its failure to find Timur Beksultanov. By the same decision the district prosecutor’s office instructed the ROVD to continue carrying out operational and search measures aimed at locating Timur Beksultanov. 56. The investigation in case no. 44050 is still pending. 57. For a summary of the relevant domestic law see Akhmadova and Sadulayeva v. Russia (no. 40464/02, §§ 67-69, 10 May 2007).","['13', '2', '3', '5']",[],[],[],[],[],1

MOLDOVA,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"7. The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Chişinău, Moldova. He was a student at the time of the events and earned a stipend of 50 Moldovan Lei (MDL). 8. On 18 April 2000, between 9.30 a.m. and 12.30 p.m., the applicant attended a demonstration against the decision of the Municipal Council to abolish urban transport privileges for students. The demonstration was not authorised in accordance with the law and it appears from the statements of the parties that its organisers did not even apply for authorisation. The demonstration took place on the Great National Assembly Square in Chişinău. In the beginning it was peaceful, but later some of the demonstrators started to throw eggs and stones at the Municipality building and the police intervened. 9. Around 12.30 p.m. the applicant was arrested by the police on grounds of being an active participant in an unauthorised demonstration in breach of Article 174/1 § 4 of the Code of Administrative Offences (hereinafter referred to as the “CAO”). He was brought to the precinct police station an hour later. Between 1.30 p.m. and 7.00 p.m., he was detained in the police station and interrogated by several criminal investigators. 10. In his written statement given at the police station, the applicant mentioned, inter alia, that he had been arrested by the police when he and a journalist from the National Radio approached a group of policemen beating up a student. Since he had written on his forehead the word “STUDENT”, the police arrested him. He stated that he was an active participant but that he was not involved in violence. 11. On an unspecified date, the district police completed the administrative case file in connection with the offence committed by the applicant, mentioning inter alia that he had actively participated in an unauthorised meeting that had taken place in front of the building of the Municipal Council. The case was then referred to the competent district court. 12. Following an oral hearing on 19 April 2000, the Centru District Court imposed on the applicant an administrative fine of MDL 36 (the equivalent of 3.17 euros (EUR) at the time) provided for in Article 174/1 § 4 of the CAO. In its order, the court stated, inter alia, that the applicant had actively participated in a demonstration of students, which had been carried out without authorisation from the Municipal Council, and that he had admitted having participated in the demonstration. 13. On 28 April 2000 the applicant lodged an appeal against the above order. He argued that the fine had been unlawfully imposed on him and that the sanction was contrary to the freedom of assembly and to the right to strike guaranteed by Articles 40 and 45 of the Constitution. 14. On 4 May 2000 at 10 a.m. the Chişinău Regional Court heard the applicant’s appeal in his absence and dismissed it. 15. According to the Government the summons for the hearing was sent on 2 May 2000 by regular post and should have arrived at its destination on 3 May 2000. 16. According to the applicant, it was sent on 3 May 2000 and was received by him on 4 May 2000 after 10 a.m. 17. The postmark on the envelope, applied by the outgoing post office (namely, by the first post office through which the envelope was routed) indicates the date of 3 May 2000. The postmark applied by the incoming post office is not entirely legible. 18. On 5 May 2000, the applicant appeared before the Registry of the Chişinău Regional Court to inquire about his case. He was issued with a copy of the judgment of the Chişinău Regional Court of 4 May 2000 dismissing his appeal and upholding the order of the District Court of 19 April 2000. 19. On 10 May 2000 the applicant filed a request for annulment (contestaţie în anulare) with the Chişinău Regional Court against its decision of 4 May 2000, arguing that he had not been properly summonsed and consequently did not have a fair trial. The court refused to register the request on the ground that the CAO did not provide for such a remedy. On 18 May and 22 June 2000 respectively, the court rejected the repeated requests lodged by the applicant and his lawyer. 20. On 18 May 2000, the applicant accompanied by a lawyer of the Helsinki Committee of Human Rights and by an advocate made another attempt to file a request for annulment with the Registry of the Chişinău Regional Court but the Registry refused to register it. 21. On 12 June 2000, following the bailiff’s request, the applicant paid the fine provided for in the decision of 19 April 2000. 22. The relevant provisions of the Code of Administrative Offences in force at the material time read: The Code of Administrative Offences aims at the protection of the personality, the rights and the legal interests of the physical and moral person, property, the State and public order, as well as at finding, preventing and eliminating the consequences of administrative offences and at educating citizens in the spirit of respect for the law. ... The sanction for the attempt to commit an administrative offence is established in accordance with the article which provides for the responsibility for that offence. Only persons who were 16 years old at the moment of the commission of an administrative offence can be held responsible. The person who has committed an administrative offence while acting in legitimate defence shall not be responsible... The administrative sanction is a measure of responsibility and is applied in order to educate the person who committed an administrative offence, as well as to deter any future similar acts by the perpetrator himself or by others. In case of evasion of payment of a fine imposed for an administrative offence in bad faith, the court may replace the fine with imprisonment of ten days for every MDL 18, the maximum term being thirty days. (În caz de sustragere cu rea-voinţă de la achitarea amenzii aplicate pentru contravenţia administrativă savârşită, instanţa judecatorească poate înlocui această sancţiune cu arest administrativ, calculându-se zece zile de arest pentru un salariu minim, termenul fiind cel mult treizeci de zile.) The conversion of an administrative fine into imprisonment is ordered by a court following a request lodged by the bailiff in accordance with Article 26 of the CAO. According to the Government, the courts can convert administrative fines into imprisonment when the following circumstances are present: - when a person who knows about a fine imposed on him/her refuses to appear before a bailiff after multiple summonses; - when the offender does not have any revenue or goods that could be sold; - when the offender is unemployed and accordingly does not have a salary from which the fine could be deducted; - when the offender has failed to comply with the time limit set by a court for the payment of an administrative fine. A judgment by which an administrative fine is converted to imprisonment can be challenged before the hierarchically superior court. A person to whom such a measure is applied can always bring it to an end, by paying the administrative fine. The conversion cannot be made in respect of pregnant women, women who have children under twelve years of age, persons aged under eighteen and invalids of the first and second degree. As to the latter provision the parties submitted copies of seven recent judgments in which administrative fines have been converted into imprisonment, in some of which the conversion had been ordered in the absence of the offender and not in a public hearing. In one of them the conversion was made due to the offender’s failure to pay an administrative fine in time. At the same time the Government submitted copies of letters addressed to the Government Agent by presidents of thirteen courts in which it was stated that in the last two years their courts had converted administrative fines into imprisonment in twenty six cases. The circumstances that mitigate the administrative responsibility are: 1) repentance of the offender; 2) prevention by the offender of the negative effects of the offence and voluntary compensation for the damage caused; 3) committing the offence under influence of strong emotions or amidst difficult personal or family circumstances; 4) committing the offence as a minor; 5) committing the offence as a pregnant woman or as a woman who has a child aged under one year. The circumstances that aggravate the administrative responsibility are: 1) the continuation of illicit behaviour in spite of the demand to refrain from it, made by an authorised person; 2) the commission of a similar administrative offence for the second time within one year or the commission of an offence by a person who had earlier committed a criminal offence; 3) involving a minor in an activity contrary to CAO; 4) the commission of an offence by a group of people; 5) the commission of an offence during natural calamities...; 6) the commission of an offence while under influence of alcohol.... (2) The organisation and holding of an assembly without a prior declaration deposited with the Municipal Council or not authorised by it, and in breach of the conditions (manner, place, time) concerning the conduct of a meeting as indicated in the authorisation shall be punishable by a fine to be imposed on the organisers (leaders) of the assembly in an amount equal to between ten and twenty five times the minimum wage.... (4) Active participation in an assembly referred to in paragraph 2 of the present article shall be punishable by a fine in an amount between MDL 36 and 90. The hearing regarding an administrative offence shall be conducted in the presence of the suspect. If the suspect is absent, the hearing can take place only when it is proved that he or she was informed in due time about the place and the time of the hearing and if he or she did not submit any request for adjournment. A decision of the first instance court regarding an administrative offence may be challenged before the hierarchically superior court, by an application lodged by the interested person or by the prosecutor. When the parties have been informed in due time about the date of the hearing but do not appear, the appeal may be heard in their absence.... In examining a case regarding an administrative offence, the appeal instance may render one of the following decisions: 1) to leave the challenged decision unchanged and to reject the appeal application; 2) to quash the challenged decision and to order a re-examination by the first instance court; 3) to quash the challenged decision and to send the file to the investigation organs; 4) to quash the challenged decision and to stop the proceedings; 5) to change the administrative sanction and to mitigate the sanction imposed. The appeal instance may quash the challenged decision for the following reasons: when the first instance court committed procedural mistakes or when it applied the wrong law. A decision which is correct on its merits cannot be quashed for procedural reasons, except in the following circumstances: 1) the case was examined by a set of judges which was not composed in accordance with the law; 2) the decision was not signed by the judge who examined the case or it was signed by a judge who did not participate at the trial of the case; 3) the decision was not pronounced by the judge who examined the case; 4) there were no minutes of the hearing, contrary to the law; 5) the case was examined without an interpreter, contrary to the law. After examining the case, the appeal instance pronounces its decision. The decision does not have to contain any reasoning. If an offender does not pay the fine within the time provided for in Article 292 of the present Code, the amount of the fine shall be compulsorily deducted from his or her salary, pension, stipend or other income in accordance with the rules set in the Code of Civil Procedure. If the offender does not have an employment or if the deduction of the fine from the salary, pension, stipend or other income is not possible, the amount of the fine shall be recovered from the forced sale of his or her personal belongings or of his or her part of a co-ownership.... 23. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure in force at the material time read: The accused is called before the investigator by means of a summons. The summons is handed to the accused and the certificate confirming the date of the receipt is returned to the investigator. The summoning can also be done by telephone or by telegram. 24. The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure in force at the material time read: The court informs the parties to the proceedings about the date and the place of the hearing by means of a summons.... The summons is to be handed to the parties in due time, so that they have enough time to prepare for the hearing in front of the court. In any event, the summons should be handed to the defendant at least three days ahead of the hearing. 25. In a book entitled “The Procedure in Administrative Offence cases” by Sergiu Furdui (judge at the Supreme Court of Justice in Moldova), (Chişinău 2000), the author states the following: “The Code of Administrative Offences provides for a number of procedural measures such as: detention, body search, search of property, administrative arrest... The CAO provides for few procedural guarantees as it does not guarantee legal aid, presumption of innocence, etc. The CAO cases are heard by criminal sections of the courts.... Only the convicted person may pay the administrative fine... It is illegal for the fine be paid by somebody else”.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
27,001-57765,ENG,NLD,CHAMBER,1992,CASE OF ABDOELLA v. THE NETHERLANDS,3,Preliminary objection rejected (out of time);Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,N. Valticos,"6. On 18 January 1983 Mr Abdoella was taken into police custody and charged with incitement to murder. He was subsequently detained on remand. On the conclusion of the investigations, in which several suspects were involved, he was summoned, on 14 April, to appear for trial before the Regional Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of The Hague. On 17 May 1983 he was convicted and sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment less the time already spent in police custody and in detention on remand. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal (Gerechtshof) of The Hague. By judgment of 29 August 1983 it upheld the Regional Court’s decision. The applicant then, within the time-limit of fourteen days prescribed by Netherlands law (see paragraph 11 (d) below), introduced an appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) by means of a statement made at the registry of the Hague Court of Appeal. The documents of the case were sent by the registry of that court to the registry of the Supreme Court and received there on 3 July 1984. The Procurator-General in his advisory opinion proposed its dismissal. However, by judgment of 15 January 1985, the Supreme Court quashed the Hague Court of Appeal’s judgment on technical grounds and referred the case to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. The registry of the Supreme Court sent the documents to the registry of the Amsterdam Court on 1 February 1985; they were received on the same day. 7. On 31 May 1985 the Attorney-General at the Amsterdam Court of Appeal issued a summons against the applicant. The Court of Appeal heard the case on 28 June 1985. During the hearing the applicant requested a suspension of his detention on remand and also an adjournment of the hearing in order to have examined two witnesses who had been summoned at the request of the defence but who had failed to appear. The Court of Appeal refused the first request. However, with the agreement of counsel for the defence it adjourned the hearing until 20 September 1985; the reason given for a delay of that length (see paragraph 11 (a) below) was that the court’s calendar for the intervening period did not permit an earlier date. The Court of Appeal resumed its hearing on 20 September 1985, at which point the witnesses who had failed to appear on 28 June were examined. It refused a new request by the applicant for suspension of his detention on remand. By judgment of 4 October 1985 the Court of Appeal convicted the applicant and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment less the time already spent in police custody and detention on remand. 8. Within the time-limit of two weeks prescribed by Netherlands law, Mr Abdoella introduced a second appeal on points of law to the Supreme Court by means of a statement made at the registry of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal. Pending the hearing of that appeal the applicant made a number of requests to the Amsterdam Court of Appeal concerning his detention on remand. It suspended the measure for two weeks in April 1986 and again for two weeks in July 1986. However, on 29 October 1986 it rejected a request, based inter alia on Articles 5 para. 3 and 6 para. 1 (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) of the Convention, for the detention to be terminated or else suspended. In April 1987 the Amsterdam Court of Appeal again granted two weeks’ leave, but refused to terminate or otherwise suspend the detention. 9. The documents of the case were sent by the registry of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to the registry of the Supreme Court, which received them on 15 September 1986. On a date in October 1986, the President of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court set the hearing for 10 February 1987. The applicant, through his counsel, subsequently filed his grounds of appeal. Counsel for the defence proposed five grounds of appeal. The first of these, the only one which raised points with which this Court is concerned, was a complaint about violation of, inter alia, Article 5 para. 3 in conjunction with Article 5 para. 1 (c) and Article 6 para. 1 (art. 5-3, art. 5-1-c, art. 6-1) of the Convention. The explanatory note emphasised that the applicant had been in police custody and detention on remand since 18 January 1983 and that, as a consequence, both he and his family had developed psychiatric problems. Detention on remand had only been suspended twice on this ground, in each case for two weeks, the last such occasion having been in July 1986. Although the case was not complex, it had already taken more than four years, so that the ""reasonable time"" laid down by Article 5 (art. 5) of the Convention had been exceeded. A separate assessment of the various phases of the proceedings led to the same conclusion: in particular, the lapses of time involved in the first appeal on points of law, that involved in the procedure before the Amsterdam Court of Appeal and the treatment of the second appeal on points of law were such that the said provisions had not been complied with. In accordance with the advisory opinion filed on 10 March 1987 by the Procurator-General the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal by judgment of 19 May 1987. It held, inter alia, that it had to be assumed that neither the applicant nor his counsel had raised the issue of the length of the proceedings at the Amsterdam Court of Appeal’s hearings on 28 June 1985 and 20 September 1985; that the mere circumstance that the preparation of the case and its examination by the Regional Court and the Court of Appeal of The Hague and the Supreme Court had taken two years (less some days) did not in itself oblige the Amsterdam Court of Appeal to address explicitly the question whether or not the case had been decided within a reasonable time; and that in addition, taking into account the time that had elapsed between the Amsterdam Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 October 1985 and the Supreme Court’s 1987 hearing, no violation of Articles 5 para. 3 and 6 para. 1 (art. 5-3, art. 6-1) of the Convention had taken place. The personal circumstances of the applicant did not warrant any other conclusion. 10. On 4 June 1987 Mr Abdoella submitted a request for a pardon. This was refused on 12 November 1987 by the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie). An application for review was lodged by the applicant on 28 December 1987 but declared inadmissible by the Supreme Court on 6 December 1988. The applicant was released from prison on 22 December 1989. 11. The following is a translation from the original Dutch of the relevant provisions of the Netherlands Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering). ""1. If the accused is in detention on remand, the following paragraphs of this article shall apply. 2. If the Regional Court suspends the examination at the hearing for a fixed period, it shall as a rule set the period of the suspension at no longer than one month. For compelling reasons, which are to be mentioned in the official record, it can decide on a longer period, but in no case more than three months. 3. ..."" For the purposes of this provision, a month is taken to mean thirty days (Article 136 para. 1). Article 277a is equally applicable to proceedings before the Court of Appeal (Article 415). ""1. The judgment shall be signed within twice twenty-four hours after its pronouncement by the judges who heard the case and by the registrar who was present at the deliberations. 2. If one or more of them are unable to do so, this shall be mentioned at the end of the judgment. 3. As soon as the judgment is signed, and in any case after the end of the period laid down in the first paragraph, the accused or his counsel can take cognisance of it and of the official record of the hearing."" This article too is equally applicable to proceedings before the Court of Appeal (Article 415). ""1. An objection [against a default judgment], an appeal or an appeal on points of law shall be lodged by means of a statement to be made by the person exercising that legal remedy at the registry of the court by which or at which the decision was given. 2. ... 3. ..."" ""1. An appeal must be filed: a. if the summons to appear at the hearing has been notified to the accused in person or the accused has appeared at the hearing, within fourteen days after the pronouncement of the final judgment; b. in other cases, within fourteen days after a circumstance has occurred from which it follows that the accused is aware of the judgment. 2. ..."" ""1. After an appeal is filed, the registrar of the District Court shall send the documents of the case to the registrar of the Court of Appeal as soon as possible. 2. ..."" ""1. An appeal on points of law must be filed: a. if the summons to appear at the hearing has been notified to the accused in person or the accused has appeared at the hearing, within fourteen days after the pronouncement of the final judgment; b. in other cases, within fourteen days after a circumstance has occurred from which it follows that the accused is aware of the judgment. 2. ..."" ""1. The prosecution (Openbaar ministerie) is obliged, on pain of inadmissibility of the prosecution, to file, together with its appeal or within ten days thereafter, at the registry of its court, a written statement of its grounds of appeal on points of law. 2. The accused by whom or in whose name an appeal on points of law has been filed is entitled to file such a written statement with the Supreme Court until the day of the hearing at the latest. 3. The registrar of the court which delivered the judgment shall send the documents of the case to the registrar of the Supreme Court within thirty days after the time-limit for the prosecution to file its written statement has expired or after it has filed a written statement earlier. 4. ..."" In practice it was generally assumed that the time-limit according to paragraph 3 of this article was fifty-four days after the date of pronouncement of the Court of Appeal’s judgment, irrespective of whether or not the prosecution had lodged an appeal on points of law. Before the Act of 14 January 1976 (Staatsblad (Official Gazette) 9), which altered (inter alia) Article 433 para. 3, this provision, like Article 409, provided only that the documents were to be sent in ""as soon as possible"". The time-limit of thirty days was introduced ""with a view to expediting the transmission of the file"". By the Act of 27 November 1991 (Staatsblad 663), which came into force on 1 May 1992, the time-limit of thirty days incorporated in the third paragraph of Article 433 in 1976 was removed; that paragraph now once more provides that the documents are to be sent in ""as soon as possible"". The reasons given therefor were firstly that, according to the case-law of the Supreme Court (see paragraphs 13 and 14 below), non-compliance with Article 433 para. 3 did not entail nullity and the rights of the accused in case of unreasonable delay in the proceedings before the Supreme Court were in any case protected by Articles 6 para. 1 (art. 6-1) of the Convention and 14 para. 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Secondly, it was pointed out that in practice this time-limit was only rarely met and that it appeared inappropriate to maintain a provision which ""in relation to the - speedy - pursuit of the proceedings before the Supreme Court creates expectations which in practice can hardly if at all be fulfilled"". ""1. After the documents have been at the registry for a period of eight days, they shall be taken by the Procurator-General against receipt and forwarded to the Supreme Court along with his proposal for fixing a hearing date. 2. The president shall fix the date for the hearing and shall appoint a rapporteur to report at the hearing."" 12. After referral by the Supreme Court, the documents of the case must be sent by its registry to the registry of the court which is to retry the case. However, due to the fact that the Code of Criminal Procedure contains no provisions at all relating to proceedings after referral, a provision comparable to Articles 409 and 433 and applicable in these cases does not exist. 13. Non-compliance with Article 409 para. 1 or Article 433 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not, according to the case-law of the Supreme Court, entail nullity: that sanction is not expressly provided for; neither are these provisions so essential that non-compliance should ipso facto lead to nullity. However, non-compliance is relevant in connection with the question whether the requirement of trial ""within a reasonable time"" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention has been complied with (see, for instance, the judgments of the Supreme Court of 23 September 1980, NJ (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie) 1981, 116, and 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813). 14. The case-law of the Supreme Court relating to the requirement of ""trial within a reasonable time"" within the meaning of Article 6 (art. 6) of the Convention in general, and more especially in relation to the question of the consequences of non-compliance with Articles 409 para. 1 and 433 para. 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, may be summarised as follows. (a) If the court decides to impose a more lenient sentence, it must take into account the extent of the violation and also indicate the reduction which it has thought fit to apply (see, for instance, the Supreme Court’s judgments of 29 January 1985, NJ 1985, 690; 7 April 1987, NJ 1987, 587; 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813; 25 April 1989, NJ 1989, 705). (b) In order to determine whether or not a ""reasonable time"" has been exceeded, the court must consider both the various phases of criminal proceedings and their overall time-span and take into account all appropriate circumstances in reaching its decision, such as the complexity of the case, the conduct of the accused and the way in which the case has been handled by the competent authorities (see, for instance, the judgment of the Supreme Court of 19 February 1985, NJ 1985, 581). (c) As the decision as to whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded is thus partly dependent on the assessment of factual circumstances, the Supreme Court, which essentially has competence only as regards points of law, can examine the validity of the decision of the judge of fact only to a limited degree; thus a judgment can only be quashed if it reveals an incorrect view of the concept of trial within a reasonable time or of the standards set out in the preceding paragraph, or if the grounds given for its decision are insufficient (see, for instance, the judgments of the Supreme Court of 5 January 1982, NJ 1982, 339; 9 March 1982, NJ 1982, 409; 11 May 1982, NJ 1983, 280; 12 October 1982, NJ 1983, 371; 3 January 1984, NJ 1984, 403; 29 January 1985, NJ 1985, 690; 10 December 1985, NJ 1986, 480; 1 November 1988, NJ 1989, 680; 31 October 1989, NJ 1990, 257). Although the Supreme Court has held that delaying criminal proceedings for more than two years does not in itself warrant the conclusion that a ""reasonable time"" has been exceeded (see its judgment of 16 December 1986, NJ 1987, 637), it is commonly assumed that in its above-mentioned limited assessment it applies, as a general guideline, a rule presumed to have been derived from the report of the Commission of 12 March 1984 in application no. 9193/80 (Marijnissen) (Decisions and Reports 40, pp. 83-99) endorsed by the Committee of Ministers in its resolution of 25 January 1985 (DH (85)4). This rule may be summarised as follows: in principle, a ""reasonable time"" has been exceeded if the proceedings in one of their phases have not been pursued for more than two years due to circumstances for which the accused is not responsible; if such an eventuality occurs and is pleaded by the defence, then a rejection of that plea must be particularly well reasoned. The character of this rule as a general guideline implies, on the one hand, that under certain circumstances stagnation for a shorter period may be a reason for applying such strict requirements to the grounds given for rejecting the defence’s plea that a reasonable time has been exceeded and, on the other hand, apparently, that exceeding the time-limit of two years may sometimes, perhaps also depending on the further circumstances of the particular case, be allowed to pass. (d) The courts must also address ex officio the question whether a reasonable time has been exceeded. However, it must only appear from the judgment that this has been done if there are special circumstances. In considering whether or not such special circumstances are present, the Supreme Court uses the general guideline, mutatis mutandis, indicated in sub-paragraph (c). This means that, as a rule, it only holds the lower courts bound to address ex officio the question whether or not a reasonable time has been exceeded if it appears from the documents that the proceedings have been held up for more than two years due to reasons for which the defence cannot be held accountable. However, if there are special circumstances, the courts are obliged to address the question ex officio even if the period of inactivity is shorter (see, for instance, the Supreme Court’s judgments of 1 July 1981, NJ 1981, 625; 1 May 1990, NJ 1990, 641). (e) The Supreme Court applies these rules itself in the procedure of appeal on points of law and thus addresses, ex officio if need be, the question whether it must be assumed that the duration of proceedings in this phase has led to excessive length of the proceedings. In this connection, it appears from its abundant case-law that the time elapsed between the filing of the appeal on points of law and the sending in of the documents to the registry of the Supreme Court has some significance: if this causes such a delay that the case comes up before the Supreme Court for the first time more than two years after the appeal on points of law was filed, then as a rule the judgment will be quashed and the case will be referred for retrial, at which point the judge of fact will have the options indicated in sub-paragraph (a) above of declaring the prosecution inadmissible or of reducing the sentence. However, the Supreme Court may itself reach the opinion that no other decision is possible than to declare the prosecution inadmissible, which it may then do of its own motion (see, for instance, its judgments of 12 January 1988, NJ 1988, 814; 29 March 1988, NJ 1988, 813; 12 April 1988, NJ 1988, 970; 25 April 1989, NJ 1989, 705; 6 June 1989, NJ 1990, 92; 13 February 1990, NJ 1990, 633). On the other hand, if the period of inactivity is shorter, the Supreme Court will merely state that the delay is longer than is desirable but that judgment of the case cannot be held not to have taken place within a reasonable time; it will then determine, applying the rule set forth in the preceding sub-paragraph, whether or not special circumstances warrant any different decision (see, for instance, its judgments of 13 January 1981, NJ 1981, 240; 3 March 1981, NJ 1981, 367; 16 February 1982, NJ 1982, 410; 4 June 1985, NJ 1986, 182; 16 September 1985, NJ 1986, 495; 11 February 1986, NJ 1986, 553; 11 February 1986, NJ 1986, 644; 16 February 1988, NJ 1988, 823).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

In a judgment of 14 September 1995 the Karlovo District Court found the applicant guilty of theft and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment, suspended for a period of three years. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final. 8. In a judgment of 21 May 1997 the Karlovo District Court found the applicant guilty of theft and sentenced him to one year's imprisonment. As the conviction concerned an offence committed during the three-year operational period of the applicant's sentence in case no. 14/95, the court also ordered the applicant to serve the suspended sentence of one year's imprisonment. No appeal was lodged and the judgment became final. 9. In a judgment of 16 February 1999 the Plovdiv District Court found the applicant guilty of theft. Combining the applicant's sentence for this offence with his sentence of one year's imprisonment in case no. 88/96, the court sentenced him to a total of three years and two months' imprisonment for both offences. 10. The court also ruled as follows: “On the basis of Article 25 § 2 of the Criminal Code [the court] deducts [from the sentence to be served] the period, during which [the applicant] was detained, calculated from 7 June 1996 to 27 December 1998”. 11. No appeal was lodged by either the applicant or the public prosecutor's office and the judgment became final. 12. On 7 June 1996 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody in connection with case no. 50/97. 13. On an unspecified date towards the end of 1998 the applicant appealed against his continued remand in custody in that case. 14. A report from Plovdiv Prison dated 16 December 1998, which detailed the different periods of the applicant's deprivation of liberty up to that point, was presented to the Plovdiv District Court. The said periods were indicated to have been the following: 15. In a decision of 17 December 1998 in case no. 50/97 the Plovdiv District Court revoked the order for the applicant's continued remand in custody in that case and granted him bail. Release was made conditional on the applicant providing a recognizance and subject to there being no other grounds for his continued deprivation of liberty. 16. The applicant deposited the monetary guarantee on 21 December 1998 and was released on 27 December 1998. 17. The applicant obtained a certificate from Plovdiv Prison dated 7 April 1999, which indicated that between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998 he had accumulated the equivalent of three years, two months and two days of time served, which included days he had worked towards reducing his sentences. The different periods of the applicant's deprivation of liberty were noted to have been the following: 18. In a letter of 29 April 1999 the Plovdiv district public prosecutor's office informed Hisar police station and Plovdiv Prison that the applicant had to be recalled to prison to serve the outstanding part of his sentence in case no. 50/97. The reasoning of the district public prosecutor's office was that the period during which the applicant had been serving his sentence of imprisonment in case no. 14/95 could not count as a remand in custody in case no. 50/97. 19. On 12 May 1999 the applicant was detained under an order issued by the district public prosecutor's office to serve the outstanding part of his sentence in case no. 50/97. 20. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to the Plovdiv regional public prosecutor's office against the decision of the district public prosecutor's office. He argued that there was no outstanding prison term for him to serve as a result of the time he had spent remanded in custody in case no. 50/97 combined with his sentence in case no. 88/96, which had both expressly been deducted by the trial court from the time to be effectively served. 21. In a letter of 25 May 1999, the regional public prosecutor's office dismissed the applicant's appeal, stating, inter alia: “There is a sentence in criminal case no. 14/95 ..., which was not combined with the sentence in criminal case no. 50/97.” 22. The applicant appealed further. 23. In a decision of 4 November 1999 the Supreme Cassation Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the applicant's appeal. In its reasoning, it stated: “Correctly ... the prosecutor from the Plovdiv district public prosecutor's office took into account the period of the remand in custody of the [applicant] in case no. 50/97 ... [as being] only from 7 June 1996 to 1 August 1997, because subsequently he had started to serve a sentence of 'imprisonment'.” 24. In the meantime, on an unspecified date the applicant requested the Plovdiv District Court to interpret, under Article 373 § 1 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974 (“CCP”), its judgment of 16 February 1999 in case no. 50/97. He argued, inter alia, that he had been remanded in custody during the whole period between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998. He further maintained that this period of two years, six months and twenty days plus the sentence of one year's imprisonment in case no. 88/96, which the applicant had already served, meant that he had effectively served the whole sentence of three years and two months' imprisonment in case no. 50/97. The public prosecutor's office meanwhile, apparently relying on a report prepared by Plovdiv Prison that the applicant's remand in custody in case no. 50/97 had been suspended on 1 August 1997, considered, inter alia, that the applicant still had to serve a year of the sentence imposed by the court in case no. 50/97. 25. A hearing was held in the presence of all the parties on 26 July 1999. In a decision of the same day the Plovdiv District Court dismissed the applicant's request for interpretation of the judgment of 16 February 1999 as it considered it to be clear. It found, inter alia, that its judgment quite unequivocally indicated that the whole period of the applicant's remand in custody between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998 should be deducted from his sentence of three years and two months' imprisonment. In this respect it stated the following: “Accordingly, the will of the court is to deduct THE WHOLE OF THE ABOVE STATED PERIOD [emphasis added by the Plovdiv District Court], i.e. the period during which the measure for securing the [applicant's] appearance before the court in the present case was a 'remand in custody', and not [just] a part thereof.” 26. The Plovdiv District Court also found that it was not competent to rule on the lawfulness of the decision of the public prosecutor's office to seek execution of the part of the sentence it claimed was still outstanding. 27. The applicant was released on 4 February 2000 after serving the remaining part of the sentence which the public prosecutor's office had alleged was outstanding in case no. 50/97. 28. On 11 November 1999 the applicant brought an action under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (the “SMRDA”, which was renamed in 2006) against the public prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Justice. 29. He contended that he had been unlawfully deprived of his liberty since 12 May 1999 because he had had no outstanding prison term to serve. He sought compensation for the non-pecuniary damage he had allegedly suffered as a result. 30. In a judgment of 28 January 2002, the Plovdiv Regional Court established, inter alia, the following: “... the [applicant] was remanded in custody in case no. 50/97 from 7 June 1996 to 1 August 1997. From 1 August 1997 to 10 April 1998 [he] served his sentence in case no. 14/95 ... This sentence cannot, by virtue of Articles 23-25 of the Criminal Code, be combined [with the other sentences] and it was served separately. From 10 April 1998 to 27 December 1998 the [applicant] served his sentence in case no. 88/96. This sentence was combined with the sentence in case no. 50/97 and therefore under Article 25 § 3 of the Criminal Code the [trial] court when delivering its judgment in case no. 50/97 should have deducted the whole period of the sentence [which had been] served. It should [also] have deducted the whole period of the remand in custody from 7 June 1996 to 1 August 1997 on the basis of Article 59 § 1 of the Criminal Code. These two periods amount to two years, two months and twelve days. When the [trial] court wrote in its judgment that it was deducting the time during which [the applicant] had been detained, calculated from 7 June 1996 to 27 December 1998, it in practice wrongly included the time during which he had been serving his sentence [in case no. 14/95] – from 1 August 1997 to 10 April 1998. [Accordingly,] from the sentence of three years and two months [the trial court] deducted three years and two months, being the period between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998 and it [thereby] transpired that the [applicant] had no time left to serve. The [trial] court made this mistake in spite [of the fact that] the case file contained information from Plovdiv Prison [detailing] the periods served by the [applicant]. In its decision [of 26 July 1999] dismissing the request to interpret its judgment, the [trial] court stated that its intention had been to deduct the whole period from 7 June 1996 to 27 December 1998, i.e. the period during which the [applicant] was remanded in custody and not [just] a part thereof. This shows that the [trial] court was misguided [in thinking] that [the applicant was remanded in custody in case no. 50/97 throughout] this entire period. Thus, with this judgment, one year of the [applicant's] sentence was pardoned, because only two years and two months should have been deducted. In spite of this, the public prosecutor's office did not appeal against the judgment and it became final ... After [the judgment] became final, it became binding on the public prosecutor's office under Article 372 § 1 of the [CCP] which should have implemented it instead of attempting to correct the [existing] mistake by interpreting the intention of the [trial] court. In the period between 12 May 1999 and 4 February 2000, including from 12 May 1999 to 11 November 1999, the date the present action was brought, the [applicant] unlawfully served a sentence of imprisonment, which if the mistake had not been made he [would] have served lawfully.” 31. In spite of the above conclusion, the Regional Court found that the applicant had failed to prove conclusively that he had suffered any nonpecuniary damage as a result of having been deprived of his liberty between 12 May 1999 and 11 November 1999. It therefore dismissed his action and ordered him to pay the resulting court fees. The applicant appealed against that judgment on an unspecified date. 32. In a judgment of 29 April 2002, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the lower court's findings. The reasons for its decision were, inter alia, the following: “Irrespective of the wrongful deduction of the time during which the [applicant] was serving his sentence ... in case no. 14/95, when sentencing the applicant to three years and two months' imprisonment the [trial] court deducted two years, five months and twenty days. This was the period between 7 June 1996 and 27 December 1998. The remaining [period] was eight months and ten days, which the applicant had to serve in view of the delivered final judgment ... in case no. 50/97 of the Plovdiv District Court.” 33. The applicant filed a cassation appeal on an unspecified date. 34. In a final judgment of 20 October 2003 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant's appeal and upheld the lower courts' findings. In its reasoning, it indicated, inter alia, the following: “In the reasons [for its decision of 26 July 1999, the Plovdiv District Court] stated that the intention of the [trial] court had been to deduct from the so determined combined sentence the period during which the [applicant] was remanded in custody. With this clarification it became clearer what the intention of the [trial] court had been. The Plovdiv public prosecutor's office made a justified assessment that the period stated in the judgment to be deducted, namely from 7 June 1996 to 27 December 1998, included a period of one year when the [applicant] served a sentence of 'deprivation of liberty' under the judgment in case no. 14/95 ..., which sentence was not combined with [the sentence] in case no. 50/97 ..., and therefore was to be served separately. After deducting the period during which the [applicant] had served this first sentence the public prosecutor's office rightly established that not all the sentence in case no. 50/97 ... had been served and the [applicant] was recalled to prison on 12 May 1999 to serve the remaining part of the sentence. There is no indication that he was detained in prison for a period longer than [required] for serving the sentence imposed. Accordingly, the contention that he suffered damage as a result is unfounded. The incorrect indication in the judgment of the period of [remand in custody] to be deducted does not change the stated intention [of the trial court] in respect of the length of the sentence of 'imprisonment'.” 35. The Code of Criminal Procedure (1974) did not contain express provisions establishing a procedure to be followed in cases where there was a dispute as to whether a person had effectively served a prison sentence or not. 36. Article 373 § 1 (1) of the CCP provided that the court which had imposed the sentence would rule on all difficulties or uncertainties relating to the interpretation of its judgment. That did not include, however, issues concerning the execution of sentences and, in particular, the lawfulness of a continuing detention. 37. In general, the authority responsible for supervising the lawfulness of the execution of sentences was the competent public prosecutor (Article 375 § 2 of the CCP, section 118 of the Judiciary Act 1994 and section 4(1) of the Execution of Sentences Act). In particular, the public prosecutor was under a duty to order the release of every imprisoned person whom he or she found to have been unlawfully deprived of his or her liberty (section 119(7)(1) of the Judiciary Act of 1994). An appeal to a higher ranking public prosecutor's office lay against the decisions of a public prosecutor. 38. The Code of Criminal Procedure (1974) was replaced in 2006 by a new code of the same name, while the Judiciary Act 1994 was replaced by a new act of the same name in 2007. 39. Prisoners may work during their time in prison, whereby two days of employment are counted as them having served three days of their sentences of imprisonment (sections 65 and 103 of the Execution of Sentences Act). 40. The relevant parts of section 2 of the SMRDA provide: “The State shall be liable for damage caused to [private persons] by the organs of ... the investigation, the public prosecution, the courts ... for: 1. unlawful detention ..., if [the detention order] has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds; ... 6. execution of an imposed sentence in excess of the set term or amount.” 41. Compensation awarded under the Act comprises all pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage which is the direct and proximate result of the illegal act or omission (section 4). The aggrieved person must lodge an “action ... against the [entity] ... whose illegal orders, acts or omissions have caused the alleged damage” (section 7). Compensation for damage caused from cases coming within sections 1 and 2 of the Act can only be sought under the Act and not under the general rules of tort (section 8 (1)). 42. The liability of the investigating and prosecuting authorities may arise only in the exhaustively listed instances set forth in section 2(2) of the Act and not under the general rules of tort (решение № 1370 от 16.XII.1992 г. по гр.д. № 1181/92 г., IV г.о. and Тълкувателно решение № 3 от 22.04.2005 г. по т. гр. д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК на ВКС). No reported cases have been identified of successful claims being made for damage stemming from acts of the investigating or prosecuting authorities which fall outside the list in section 2. 43. The reported case-law under section 2(1) and (6) of the Act is scant. In two judgments the Supreme Court of Cassation held that State liability arose where a detainee was remanded in custody or imprisoned for a period exceeding the final prison term subsequently imposed by the court of last instance (реш. № 1662 от 21 януари 1994 г. по гр. д. № 306/93 г., IV г. о. на ВС и реш. № 1144 от 20 юни 2003 г. по гр. д. № 904/2002 г., IV г. о. на ВКС).",['5'],"['5-1', '5-4', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1

On 13 September 2004 two men went on trial in the High Court of Justiciary sitting at Glasgow on charges of importing and supplying controlled drugs. The proceedings were filmed and relayed through a closed-circuit television system to a remote viewing room in the court building. On 23 September 2004, it was discovered that police officers and prosecution staff had been watching the proceedings in the remote viewing room with the risk that defence conversations might have been overheard. When this was brought to the attention of the trial judge on 28 September 2004, he took the decision to desert the trial diet simpliciter since he believed that no fair trial could continue before him. This decision had the effect of bringing the prosecution case to an end resulting in the acquittal of the accused. The desertion simpliciter meant that the accused could not be reindicted. 6. The same day, the trial judge heard argument from counsel for BBC Scotland before making an interim order under section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 preventing the publication of any report of the proceedings. That order was to become final on 30 September 2004 unless any interested party applied to the court for its recall (quashing) or variation. On 29 September 2004, BBC Scotland appeared before the trial judge and made representations in respect of the order. The trial judge varied the interim order to the effect that publication of any report of the proceedings was prohibited until the completion of any appeal and any further trial. The varied order was to become final on 1 October 2004 unless there was another application to recall or further vary it. 7. The Crown appealed against the decision of the trial judge to desert the trial diet simpliciter. The appeal was scheduled to be heard by the High Court of Justiciary (sitting as an appeal court in Edinburgh) on 15 February 2005. 8. In advance of the hearing, BBC Scotland sent a number of letters to the Clerk of the High Court of Justiciary, seeking an opportunity to address the court should an application to prevent publication of any report of the appeal proceedings be made. On 5 February 2005, counsel for BBC Scotland was told verbally by court officials that no opportunity would be made available for it to make representations in court. A further fax asking for a hearing was sent by BBC Scotland the same day. No response was received. 9. On the morning of 15 February 2005, the High Court of Justiciary, on the unopposed motion of the Crown, made a section 4(2) order prohibiting the publication of a report of any part of the appeal hearing until completion of the appeal. The applicants, in their observations to this Court, maintain that their representative attended the High Court hearing that morning but was not heard. The order made by the High Court was to become final on 17 February 2005 unless an application was made to recall or vary it. The order was posted on the Scottish Courts Service website and circulated to the Scottish media. 10. On the afternoon of 15 February 2005, BBC Scotland sent another fax to the High Court stating that it wished to be heard on the order as soon as possible. BBC Scotland were then contacted and advised that a hearing would be fixed but not before 18 February 2005. The Government, in their observations to this Court, maintain that BBC Scotland did not challenge that decision. On 18 February, BBC Scotland sent another fax to the High Court advising that a telephone call to their offices would be sufficient to enable them to arrange representation before the High Court within twenty-four hours. The fax also conveyed BBC Scotland's understanding that, if the High Court dismissed the prosecution's appeal, then BBC Scotland would be heard by the court in respect of the section 4(2) order. 11. The Government maintain that BBC Scotland did not contest the decision not to hold a hearing before 18 February 2005 and, because no application had been made to recall or vary the interim order before 17 February 2005, the interim order became final on 17 February 2005. The applicants maintain that their fax of 15 February 2005 was intended to be an application to recall or vary the interim order; as such, the interim order did not become final on 17 February 2005. 12. The prosecution's appeal was determined on 24 March 2005. On the basis of further information provided by the prosecution as to who had been watching the trial proceedings in the remote viewing room, the Appeal Court recalled the order of the trial judge and substituted an order for desertion pro loco et tempore, which allowed for the re-indictment of one of the original accused. On the same date, the Appeal Court deferred its consideration of BBC Scotland's application for the recall of the section 4(2) order made on 15 February 2005. On 21 June 2005, the Appeal Court recalled that order. 13. Section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 provides that where legal proceedings are held in public, in any such proceedings the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose. 14. Section 159 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provides that in England and Wales, where such an order is made, an aggrieved person may appeal such an order to the Court of Appeal. The section does not apply to Scotland. Instead, following the High Court of Justiciary's ruling in Galbraith v. H.M. Advocate 2001 S.L.T. 465, where the question was considered obiter dicta, it appears that the practice of Scottish courts will be to make interim orders for forty-eight hours, to give notice of the interim order to the legal representatives of media organisations and give them the opportunity to address the court on the terms of the interim order. A full copy of any section 4(2) order is intimated to press and media contacts who are listed with the Scottish Courts Service. The names of cases where section 4(2) orders are in place are available from the Scottish Courts Service website. 15. The concept of nobile officium in Scots law is an extraordinary equitable power vested in, inter alia, the High Court of Justiciary. It was described by the High Court in Anderson v. HMA 1974 SLT 239 as: “...a remedy for any extraordinary or unforeseen occurrence in the course of criminal business in any part of the country...In short, the principle is, that wherever the interposition of some authority is necessary to the administration of justice, and there exists no other judicature by whom it can competently be exercised, or which has been in use to exercise it, the Court of Justiciary is empowered and bound to exercise its powers [of nobile officium], on the application of the proper party, for the furtherance of justice” The procedure is used where there is no other remedy provided for by law.

TURKEY,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Remainder inadmissible;Non-pecuniary damage - award;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed,Alvina Gyulumyan;Elisabet Fura;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicants were born in 1948, 1978, 1968, 1976, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 respectively and live in Diyarbakır. 6. On 3 October 1992, at 10:30 a.m., clashes occurred in the district of Kulp in the province of Diyarbakır, between the PKK (the Workers' Party of Kurdistan, an illegal organisation) and the security forces, subsequent to the killing of two gendarmes and grave injury of two other gendarmes in a military vehicle by PKK militants. At that time the applicant, Hakan Narin and his father, Abduvahit Narin, were in the Narin Hotel, which belonged to them. During the clash some other individuals from the town and hotel customers joined them in the basement of the hotel to seek shelter from the clash. There were a total of thirty-five people hiding in the basement of the hotel. 7. According to the applicants' version of events, at around 4 p.m. the security forces raided the hotel and gathered the people on the ground floor. They singled out Adulvahit Narin from the crowd and took him into the hotel director's office. After a while the applicant, Hakan Narin, heard gunshots coming from the office. The security forces then allegedly poured petrol on the floor and set the hotel on fire. 8. On 4 October 1992 two incident reports describing the events in question were prepared and signed by a number of gendarme officers who took part in the clashes. According to this report, on 3 October 1992, at around 10.30 a.m., PKK militants opened fire on a military vehicle on a main street in Kulp. As a result, two gendarmes died and two were severely injured. Hearing the gunfire, security forces arrived on the scene. PKK militants also fired at them and the security forces returned fire. The clashes, which lasted until 5 p.m., caused the destruction of a number of vehicles and some buildings. It was understood that the real aim of the PKK members was to take control of the Kulp Gendarmerie Station and to seize the weapons therein. Some of the PKK militants hid in the Narin Hotel and opened fire on the security forces. When leaving the town they set the hotel and a number of other buildings on fire. When they were informed that there was a burned body at the hotel, a team of security forces arrived at the hotel in the morning of 4 October 1992. They found an unidentifiable burned body, a Kalashnikov rifle and sixty-four empty cartridges there. The security forces noted that all the furniture in the hotel had been burned, there were a number of bullet holes in the walls and gas cannisters found in the kitchen had exploded as a result of the fire and had caused massive damage to the building. A sketch map describing the state of the hotel and location of the body was also drawn up by a gendarme officer. 9. On 4 October 1992, at 3:50 p.m., the Kulp Public Prosecutor arrived at the Narin Hotel with a doctor. They conducted a classical autopsy and an on-site investigation. The on-site investigation report noted that a burned body was lying in one of the ground-floor rooms of the hotel. The report also contained Hakan Narin's testimony that two expert sergeants, whose names he did not know but whom he could identify if shown, took his father to the director's office. He then heard gunshots coming from that direction, and saw the security forces throw grenades into the room. He further stated that M.Y., A.Y., M.A., and the teachers A.A., M.Y., H.S. and F.A., who were in the hotel at the time, also witnessed the incident. The report noted that five discharged bullet cartridges were found twenty or thirty metres from the body. Neither Hakan Narin nor the deceased's wife Perinaz Narin could determine whether the burned body was that of Abdulvahit Narin. 10. The Kulp Public Prosecutor took statements from two gendarmes who were injured in the course of the clashes. They stated that they had come to Kulp from Diyarbakır Regional Gendarmerie Command in order to ensure security. When they arrived in Kulp they were attacked by members of the PKK and wounded as a result of the gunfire. 11. On 6 October 1992 the Kulp Public Prosecutor issued a decision of non-jurisdiction and referred the case to the Chief Public Prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court. 12. On 8 October 1992 the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor's Office issued a decision to join the investigation files concerning the killing of two gendarmes and Abdulvahit Narin, since both had occurred in the course of the events in Kulp. 13. On 25 June 1993 the public prosecutor at the State Security Court took statements from the deceased's two sons and two persons who had witnessed the events. The applicant Hakan Narin repeated the statement he had made to the public prosecutor during the on-site investigation. He further stated the following: “During the events in question, I was with the deceased (Abdulvahit Narin). The hotel was under gun and rocket fire. I locked the doors of the hotel and went down to the basement together with the customers for safety reasons. They (the soldiers) broke down the door and entered the hotel. My father was alive and holding my hand. Two expert sergeants who work in Kulp, namely N.T. and L.B., hit my hand and took my father to the director's room. I heard a sound of gunfire from the director's room. They had already locked down the basement when they took my father to the director's room. When the gunfire ended, they took us to the lounge and told us to take off our jackets. We took off our jackets. They poured petrol on us. However, they did not burn us. They then carried the jackets into the director's room. They poured petrol on my father and burned him. They left three hand grenades in the director's room. These bombs exploded one after the other. They burned everything in the hotel. The expert sergeants whom I have mentioned above caused the death of my father. There were thirty-five customers who witnessed this event. I request that criminal charges be brought against [the expert sergeants]...” 14. Azattin Narin, who is another of the sons of the deceased, stated that he had been in Istanbul at the time of the events. He had also heard that two expert sergeants, N.T. and L.B., had caused the death of his father. Mehmet Yıldırım and Aladdin Yıldırım, who were customers at the Narin Hotel at the time of the events, gave statements in line with Hakan Narin's. They added that the security forces took them to the station after the incident, but released them without taking statements from them. 15. In addition to the above statements, the applicants' representative submitted to the Court statements given by another witness, Nihat Ezer, on 13 August 2001. According to this witness, who sought shelter in the Narin Hotel during the clashes, Abdulvahit Narin was separated from the rest of the group and taken to the director's room in the hotel. The witness then heard gunshots coming from that room. The soldiers threw three hand grenades and the hotel caught fire. The witness was taken to the gendarme station together with other people and released afterwards. 16. On 12 May 1994 and 10 June 1994 the Diyarbakır Public Prosecutor took statements from N.T. and L.B. in relation to the allegations concerning the killing of Abdulvahit Narin. N.T. and L.B. denied the allegations that they had been involved in the killing of Abdulvahit Narin and claimed that they had taken part in the clashes against the PKK in order to ensure security in Kulp. They had seen that the Narin Hotel and a number of other buildings had caught fire and stated that they had gone back to their barracks when the clashes were over. 17. In a letter dated 28 July 1994 the Kulp Public Prosecutor requested the Gendarmerie Command in Kulp to provide information concerning the location of and duties assigned L.B. and N.T. on 3 October 1992. 18. In a report dated 14 November 1994, signed by a gendarme sergeant and two gendarmes, it was stated that the location of and duties assigned to L.B. and N.T. on 3 October 1992 were unknown, since there was no record. 19. It transpires from the documents submitted by the parties that since 1994 no further steps have been taken to identify the perpetrators of the killing of Abdulvahit Narin. 20. On 24 November 1992, one of the sons of Abdulvahit Narin applied to the Kulp Civil Court of First Instance for an assessment report of the damage caused to the hotel in order to lodge actions for compensation. 21. On 28 September 1993 the applicants applied to the Ministry of the Interior (“the Ministry”) for compensation for the loss they had suffered as a result of the death of their relative and the damage done to the hotel. The Ministry rejected the request. 22. On 4 April 1994 the applicants brought an action for compensation in the Diyarbakır Administrative Court against the Ministry, for the damage they had suffered in respect of the death of their relative (“first set of proceedings”). In their application to the court the applicants noted that the perpetrators of the killing of Abdulvahit Narin were unknown. Although the officials claimed that he had been killed and that his hotel had been burned down by members of the PKK during the clashes, the witnesses stated Abdulvahit Narin had been killed by the security forces. Notwithstanding who killed the victim, the State was responsible for the death of the victim and was obliged to compensate for the damage resulting from his death and the destruction of the hotel. 23. On 12 July 1994 the applicants brought a second action against the Ministry, claiming compensation in respect of the material damage caused to the hotel (“second set of proceedings”). 24. By decisions of 17 November and 20 November 1995 the Diyarbakır Administrative Court decided that it had no jurisdiction over the cases. 25. On 6 November 1997 and 4 December 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court set aside the Diyarbakır Administrative Court's decisions of non-jurisdiction and remitted the cases to it for examination. 26. On 18 June 1999 the Diyarbakır Administrative Court partly accepted the applicants' request and awarded them 523,200,000 Turkish liras (TRL, approximately 1,223 euros (EUR) at the material time) in compensation for the pecuniary damage caused to the hotel. 27. On 21 June 2000 the Diyarbakır Administrative Court, relying on the State's strict liability and “the social risk theory”, awarded the applicants a further TRL 738,107,475 (approximately EUR 1,264 at the material time) in compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage they had suffered in respect of the death of their relative. This judgment was upheld by the Supreme Administrative Court on 13 December 2001. 28. On 16 June 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the Diyarbakır Administrative Court concerning the damage caused to the hotel. 29. On 18 January 2002, the administration paid the applicants the sum of TRL 2,091,892,880 (approximately EUR 1,732 at the material time) in compensation for the death of their relative and damage done to the hotel. 30. In March 2002, the applicants applied to the Public Prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court requesting information about the outcome of the criminal investigation into the death of their relative. 31. On 11 March 2002 the Public Prosecutor informed the applicants that the investigation was still pending. Following this response, on 9 April 2002 the applicants lodged their application with the European Court. 32. According to the Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor's report of 28 October 2008, the investigation into the killing of Abdulvahit Narin and the two gendarmes is still pending. 33. Under section 13 of Law no. 2577 on administrative procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation. If the claim is rejected in whole or in part, or if no reply is received within six days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings. 34. Article 125 §§ 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides: “All acts or decision of the authorities are subject to judicial review... The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.” 35. That provision established the State's strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that, in the circumstances of a particular case, the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people's lives or property, without it being necessary to prove a tortuous act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1942 and is at present living in Diyarbakır, Turkey. At the time of the events giving rise to his application, the applicant was living in the Çaylarbaşı (Dahlezeri in Kurdish) hamlet attached to Türeli village in the Lice district of the province of Diyarbakır. The application concerns the alleged unacknowledged detention and subsequent disappearance of the applicant's two sons, Servet and İkram İpek, in the course of an operation conducted by security forces in his village on 18 May 1994. It further pertains to the alleged destruction of his family home and property by the security forces during the same operation. 11. The facts surrounding the disappearance of the applicant's two sons and the alleged destruction of his family home and property are disputed between the parties. 12. The facts as presented by the applicant are set out in Section 1 below. The facts presented by the Government are contained in Section 2. 13. A summary of the documents submitted by the parties is to be found in Part B. The witness evidence taken by the Court's Delegates at hearings conducted in Ankara is summarised in Part C. 14. On 17 May 1994 the applicant and his son İkram İpek were tending their sheep away from the village of Türeli when soldiers approached them and asked them for identification. After being shown identification, the soldiers went on their way. The applicant's other son, Servet İpek, had good relations with soldiers from Lice and had even made tea for them on occasions. 15. On 18 May 1994 at about 10 a.m. the applicant, together with his son İkram İpek, was bringing his sheep back to their hamlet near Türeli village, when a group of about 100 soldiers in uniform raided the village. The soldiers left their vehicles outside the hamlet and entered it on foot. They were armed with G-3 rifles and other weapons. A military helicopter circled above the hamlet. The applicant has since learned that the soldiers were not from Lice, but from around Bolu. The Lice soldiers had told the applicant previously to be wary of the soldiers from Bolu. 16. The soldiers told the applicant and İkram İpek to gather with the other villagers, that is, men, women and boys –the young girls were told to remain in the hamlet – by the local school, which is located outside the hamlet. The houses in the hamlet cannot be seen from the school. One group of soldiers remained by the school; the other group went into the hamlet. 17. The applicant saw flames rising from the village and his hamlet, and the women and children began to weep. The soldiers who were with them threatened them, saying: “If you start crying, we will burn you just like your houses”. All the villagers then fell quiet. 18. Both the applicant's and his brother's houses were completely destroyed by fire. After most of the houses had been destroyed, the soldiers released the villagers. But they did not release the applicant's sons İkram İpek and Servet İpek, or Seyithan, Abdülkerim, Nuri and Sait Yolur. These men went with the soldiers in order to carry the latter's equipment to their vehicles. 19. When the applicant returned to the hamlet, he saw that the houses were in flames. The young girls told him and the other villagers that the soldiers had thrown some white powder into the houses and had set them alight. The fires were so far advanced that there was nothing the applicant could do. 20. Since a few of the houses had not caught fire, the applicant and the other villagers thought they could shelter in them. 21. At about 3.30 p.m., the same soldiers raided the hamlet again. They asked why some of the houses had not been burned. When the applicant and the other villagers replied: “we did not put them out, you could not have lit them properly”, the soldiers said: “we shall burn them now”, and they burned the remaining houses. The applicant has since learned that the villages of Türeli and Makmu Kirami were also burned down that day. 22. The applicant's wife Fatma then asked the soldiers, in Kurdish, about what had happened to her sons İkram İpek and Servet İpek. The soldiers could not understand Kurdish, and asked what she had said. When the applicant explained that she was asking about her sons, the soldiers replied that they were in Lice and that they would be released soon. 23. After this second burning, the soldiers waited in the village, and only left in the direction of Lice in the evening. 24. Since his own house had been burned, the applicant with his wife Fatma, his son Hakim, and Sevgol, the wife of his son İkram İpek, moved to a house which had been evacuated two years previously in the hamlet of Kalenderesi, also attached to Türeli village. All they had left were the clothes they were wearing. Neighbours gave them a few more clothes. They remained there, in abject poverty, for some four months. The applicant has since moved to Diyarbakır. The Government have provided no aid or assistance to the applicant or his family ever since the time when his house was burned. 25. Abdülkerim, Nuri and Sait Yolur, who had been taken into custody together with İkram and Servet İpek, were released the next day. They themselves did not speak to the applicant afterwards but informed him through a third person that they had been held together until 10 p.m. the first night with their eyes bound. At 10 p.m. they were separated from İkram and Servet İpek and they never saw the two brothers again. Seyithan Yolur remained with İkram and Servet İpek. All three have been missing ever since. 26. About 15 days after İkram and Servet İpek were taken into custody, and having heard nothing about their whereabouts, the applicant travelled to Diyarbakır. With the help of a relative, he applied to the office of the Diyarbakır State Security Court (Diyarbakır Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi, hereafter DGM) chief public prosecutor. He also applied to the Lice public prosecutor's office and the Lice gendarmerie command. The applicant was unable to obtain any information about his sons from any of these State authorities. 27. In the meantime, in a letter dated 15 September 1994, Mr İbrahim Erge, a senior colonel at the Chief of Staff in Ankara, informed Mr Şakir Yolur that the security forces had not conducted any operation on 18 May 1994 in the Çağlarbaşı hamlet of Türeli village attached to the Lice district and that his son Seyithan Yolur had not been apprehended. 28. On 27 October 1994 the applicant filed another petition with the DGM chief prosecutor in Diyarbakır, asking him to investigate what had happened to his sons. The applicant was not permitted to meet the prosecutor, but a plain-clothes policeman who was there looked at the records and told the applicant verbally that the individuals in question were not there. 29. The applicant's other son, Hakim İpek, sent two or three petitions to the Governor of the State of Emergency. He received two replies consisting of denials that his brothers had ever been detained. He was so angry that he tore the letters up and disposed of the pieces. 30. On 23 December 1999 the applicant went to the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander's Office at the request of the latter. He was asked where his sons were. The applicant stated that they had been taken away by the State. The gendarmes accused him of lying, insisted that his sons had in fact been taken by the PKK, yelled at him, and asked him why he was complaining about the Turkish State. Under duress the applicant was obliged to apply his thumbprint to documents prepared by the gendarmes, the contents of which were not made known to him. 31. No security operation was conducted in Türeli village or in Dahlezeri hamlet on 18 May 1994. Neither the applicant's sons nor any other persons had been taken into custody. 32. The applicant did file a petition with the DGM chief public prosecutor in Diyarbakır on 27 October 1994, stating that his sons Servet and İkram İpek had been taken into custody and requesting the prosecutor to investigate his sons' fate. The chief public prosecutor asked the security forces whether the applicant's sons had been taken into custody for an offence falling within the jurisdiction of DGMs. The security forces informed the prosecutor that this was not the case and the applicant was informed of this outcome. 33. The applicant made no applications about the alleged disappearance of his sons to the offices of the Lice public prosecutor or to the Lice District Gendarmerie Commander. However, following the communication of the application to the Government, an ex officio investigation into the allegations was conducted by the Lice public prosecutor. However, it was not possible to locate the applicant at the address given by the applicant in his application form as submitted to the Commission. Moreover, the applicant was not known by the people living in the neighbourhood. His name was not registered in the registry of the head (muhtar) of the neighbourhood. 34. The Government further stated that no evidence has been found during the investigation to prove that the alleged offences had been committed by the security forces and that the Lice District Administrative Council (Lice İlçe İdare Kurulu) had rendered a decision not to prosecute members of the security forces. It had not been possible to communicate this decision to the applicant as his address was not known to the authorities and the Lice Governor had therefore ordered the publication of the outcome of the investigation in a newspaper. 35. The Government finally stated that the applicant had been invited to the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander's Office in order to make a statement as part of the administrative investigation in which the Kulp Gendarmerie Commander had been appointed as investigator. 36. On 26 December 1999 the Gendarmerie Commander questioned the applicant in relation to his allegations and the applications he had filed with various authorities, including a certain “European Human Rights Diyarbakır branch”. The applicant repeated his allegations that his two sons, İkram and Servet, along with the Yolur brothers had been taken away and that all the houses in his hamlet had been burned down by soldiers. The applicant further deposed that he had not applied to the “European Human Rights Diyarbakır branch”. Nor had he given any statement to the latter body or signed any document in respect of his allegations. 37. The following information appears from documents pertaining to the investigation carried out following the communication of the application to the respondent Government on 7 March 1995. 38. On 3 March 1995 Mr Sefa Özmen, a deputy to the Diyarbakır Governor, informed Mr Hakim İpek, in response to the allegations contained in his petition of 23 January 1995, that the security forces had not conducted any operation in the region on the dates mentioned in his petition, that his brothers were not on the list of persons wanted by the security forces and that the whereabouts of his brothers were not known to the authorities. 39. On 25 April 1995 the Diyarbakır chief public prosecutor instructed the Diyarbakır police headquarters to summon the applicant to his office so that a statement could be taken from him. The address of the applicant recorded in this letter is the same as the one given in the application form with the exception of the name of the block of flats. According to the application form, the name of the block of flats was 'Varol', but in the prosecutor's letter the name was recorded as 'Baro'. 40. On 2 May 1995 the Diyarbakır police informed the public prosecutor that there were no blocks of flats called Baro in the street indicated by him. This letter went on to say that the applicant was not known by the people living in the neighbourhood and that his name was not registered in the registry of the head (muhtar) of the neighbourhood. 41. On 18 May 1995 the commander of the Tepe gendarmerie station, in whose jurisdiction Türeli village was located, recorded in a report that Abdülrezzak İpek and his family had left the village and had gone to the town of Dörtyol near Hatay to work. 42. On 24 May 1995 the Diyarbakır chief public prosecutor sent a copy of the letter he had received from the International Law and Foreign Relations Directorate of the Ministry of Justice on 20 April 1995 to the Lice chief public prosecutor and asked him to investigate the applicant's allegations that his house had been burned down and that his sons had been taken away by the security forces. 43. On 7 June 1995 the Lice chief public prosecutor sent a letter to the gendarmerie commander of Lice and instructed the latter to confirm whether or not an operation had been conducted in Turalı village on 18 May 1995 and whether Servet and İkram İpek had been detained. He also asked the commander to find out the applicant's address and to summon the applicant to his, i.e. the prosecutor's, office. 44. On 13 June 1995 the Lice prosecutor sent another letter to the Lice gendarmerie commander's office and informed the latter that the name of the village was incorrectly recorded as 'Turalı' which was within the jurisdiction of the town of Hani. The prosecutor repeated his requests in his letter of 7 June 1995 and asked the gendarmerie commander to look for the applicant in the village of 'Türeli'. 45. On 20 June 1995 the Lice gendarmerie commander replied to the prosecutor's requests. The commander stated that the said persons had never been detained by his soldiers and that no operation had been conducted in the vicinity of Türeli village at that time. The commander finally stated that the applicant had moved to the town of Dörtyol in the province of Hatay to work. 46. On 21 June 1995 the Lice prosecutor took a decision of non-jurisdiction and sent the file to the office of the Lice district governor. This action was taken pursuant to the Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants Memurin Muhakematı Kanunu) according to which authorisation must be sought in order to investigate the actions of members of the security forces. 47. On 2 February 1996 the gendarmerie commander of Diyarbakır, in an apparent response to a request from the Lice governor's office, appointed Turgut Alpı, a gendarmerie lieutenant-colonel, to investigate the applicant's allegations. 48. On 28 February 1996 the newly appointed Lieutenant- Colonel Alpı instructed the Lice gendarmerie commander to forward copies of the names and addresses of the military personnel who had been working in the area at the time of the incident. He further requested copies of all operation reports, operation logbooks, custody ledgers and any other relevant documents. 49. Also on 28 February 1996 Lieutenant-Colonel Alpı instructed the Diyarbakır police headquarters to take a statement from one Abdurrezzak İpek in respect of allegations of village destruction and disappearances. According to this letter, Abdurrezzak İpek was born in 1959 and living in Diyarbakır. 50. The Diyarbakır police headquarters forwarded a copy of the statement taken from Abdulrezak İpek on 8 March 1996 and a copy of his identity card to Lieutenant-Colonel Alpı. 51. Abdulrezak İpek stated in his statement that he did not even know where Türeli village was and that his children had not been taken away by soldiers. In fact, he did not have any children with those names. According to the copy of his identity card, this Abdulrezak İpek was born on 1 January 1959. 52. On 12 March 1996 the Lice gendarmerie commander replied to Lieutenant-Colonel Alpı's requests and enclosed copies of two pages of custody ledgers and copies of two pages of operation logbooks in which the day-to-day activities of the Lice gendarmerie were recorded. The Lice commander further stated in his letter that his soldiers had not conducted an operation in Türeli village on 18 May 1994 and that Servet and İkram İpek had not been detained. The letter further states that Major Şahap Yaralı had been Lice gendarmerie commander on 18 May 1994 but he had since been posted to another town in central Anatolia. Sergeant-Major Şükrü Günlükçü had been commander of the Tepe gendarmerie station in whose jurisdiction Türeli village was located. He had since been posted to a town in the west of the country. 53. Copies of the custody ledgers, which were enclosed with this letter, have been submitted to the Court. They do not contain the names of İkram or Servet İpek. A copy of the daily activities logbook kept at the Lice gendarmerie station does not mention any operation planned, or conducted, at the relevant time. 54. On 25 March 1996 Lieutenant-Colonel Alpı concluded his investigation report. He came to the conclusion that no operation had been conducted by security forces in Türeli village on 18 May 1994 and that the security forces had not even gone to that village on that day. LieutenantColonel Alpı further considered that the statement taken from Abdurrezzak İpek in which the latter stated that he was not from Türeli village and that his house had never been burned down or that his children had not been taken away, also proved that no operation had taken place. He recommended that authorisation to prosecute members of the security forces should not be granted as there was no evidence to prove that the alleged events had taken place. This report was forwarded to the Lice governor's office on 1 April 1996. 55. On 16 May 1996 the Lice District Administrative Council, under the presidency of the Lice Governor, decided on the basis of the information submitted by Lieutenant-Colonel Alpı not to grant authorisation for the prosecution of members of the security forces. This decision was appealed against ex officio pursuant to domestic law. 56. On 18 October 1996 the Diyarbakır Regional Administrative Court (Diyarbakır Bölge İdare Mahkemesi), sitting as an appeal court, rejected the appeal and upheld the decision not to grant authorisation for the prosecution of members of the security forces. It had not been possible to communicate this decision to Abdurrezzak İpek since his address was unknown to the authorities. Thus, the Lice Governor ordered the publication of this decision in a newspaper. 57. Finally, the applicant has submitted a letter dated 21 January 2000 and signed by Şakir Yolur, the father of Seyithan Yolur and the uncle of Sait and Nuri Yolur who were allegedly taken from the village by soldiers and detained together with the applicant's sons. 58. Mr Yolur, who also lived in the same village as the applicant, confirmed the applicant's version of events and added that Sait and Nuri had been released but that his son Seyithan had not been released. He has not heard from his son Seyithan since the incident. 59. Mr Yolur made inquiries at various military establishments in the region and sent a telegram to the Chief of Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces in Ankara (Genel Kurmay Başkanlığı) complaining about the disappearances in the course of the impugned events. 60. The Chief of Staff stated in his reply that no operation had taken place and that the persons referred to had not been detained. 61. The facts of the case being in dispute between the parties, the Court conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. In this respect, three delegates of the Court took oral evidence between 18 and 20 November 2002 from eight witnesses. A further three witnesses had been summoned but did not appear for various reasons. The evidence given by the witnesses may be summarised as follows. 62. The witness told the delegates that he had lived in the hamlet of Dahlezeri outside Türeli village between 1969 and May 1994 when the “Government destroyed the hamlet.” About twenty families lived in the hamlet. The inhabitants were all in some way related. The applicant kept livestock and grew crops for his living. 63. The applicant stated that two military raids had taken place on the hamlet on 18 May 1994. The first raid began around noon, at the time of the midday prayer. The soldiers gathered all the inhabitants (about a hundred) in front of the school, including the children. The village muhtar, with whom he enjoyed a good relationship, was not present. The men were separated from the women and children. When questioned by the Delegates, the applicant stated that the soldiers had collected the inhabitants' identity documents. No names were called out. Six persons, including his sons, İkram and Servet, were led away by the soldiers. These persons were chosen at random (“You, you and you.”) and were made to carry the soldiers' rucksacks. The soldiers returned the identity documents to the other inhabitants and then released them. During this time, the applicant could see that the hamlet had been set on fire. When he returned to the hamlet, he found that the houses, including his own house, belongings and livestock, had been burned. 64. The inhabitants started to salvage their property and belongings. However, at 6 p.m., the soldiers returned and ordered everyone to evacuate the village. According to the applicant, an order was given to shoot the inhabitants if they tried to put out the flames. They were made to walk for a long time. During this time he could hear messages coming through on the soldiers' walkie-talkies to halt the operation. They were threatened that they would be killed if they tried again to put the fires out. On being questioned at the hearing, the applicant affirmed that he could understand Turkish. The applicant later mentioned in his evidence that other villages had been burned that day, including Türeli. 65. The applicant confirmed his belief during questioning that the raids were conducted by soldiers. He related that they were dressed as such, carried G-3 or G-1 rifles and used military vehicles and helicopters during the raids. The applicant stated that he had never seen any members of the PKK in the hamlet. While there may have been clashes between the PKK and the security forces away from the area, there had never been any clashes in his neighbourhood. He maintained that there had been no PKK members in the hamlet. When questioned, the applicant stated that PKK members may have come to the hamlet and may have been given food since the inhabitants were afraid of them. According to the applicant, there were no village guards in the hamlet, although the authorities had proposed that inhabitants set up a village-guard system. 66. The applicant further testified that the soldiers who carried out the raids were from Bolu. They were accompanied by soldiers from Lice. Soldiers from Lice had come to the area in the past to carry out checks. The applicant also affirmed that his sons İkram and Servet had never been arrested by the security forces before the operation on 18 May 1994, and he could offer no explanation as to why they had been taken away. His son, İkram, had returned home from Ankara two days before the military operation to enjoy a rest. His other son, Servet, worked as a shepherd. 67. As to his own enquiries concerning the whereabouts of his sons, the applicant stated that he had applied to the authorities in Kulp, Lice, Istanbul and Ankara, as well as to the Human Rights Association in Diyarbakır. He deposed that, following the events of 18 May 1994, he had obtained from a soldier the name of the commander in charge of the operation, a Major Osman Duman. He had never disclosed that information to anyone before. 68. The witness had been married to İkram İpek for six months at the relevant time. She stated that her husband had just returned to the hamlet from Ankara where he had spent three months. On the morning of 18 May 1994 her brother-in-law, Servet İpek, informed the family that the hamlet was full of soldiers. Everyone was forcibly made to assemble at the school outside the hamlet. In the meantime, the houses were set alight. The witness stated that the raid occurred at 11 a.m. and that the burning took place at noon. 69. When the inhabitants were outside the school, the soldiers took their identity cards. Six people, including her husband İkram and her brother-in-law Servet, were picked out, apparently on account of their youth, and told to carry the soldiers' gear to the military vehicles. 70. The remaining inhabitants were allowed to return to their houses at 1 p.m. However, with the exception of a few houses, everything had been burned down, including their family home and belongings. The soldiers returned to the hamlet again at around 6 p.m. with orders to kill the inhabitants. Houses which had only partly been burned or where the flames had been extinguished were again set on fire. The inhabitants were all led away from the hamlet. The witness stated that she could make out from the radio communications between the soldiers that the order to kill them had been revoked. They were released at 7 p.m. but ordered not to stay in the hamlet. The witness went to live with her parents in Diyarbakır. 71. The witness had no doubts that the operation was carried out by Turkish soldiers. She was unable to assess how many soldiers were involved. She testified that there were no members of the PKK living in the hamlet and that she had no recollection of PKK members ever having come to the hamlet for assistance. When questioned by the Delegates, the witness affirmed that neither her husband nor her brother-in-law had ever been in trouble with the authorities. The witness stated that she was never requested by the authorities to give a statement about the above events. 72. The witness is the applicant's son and the brother of İkram and Servet İpek. He stated that the events under investigation had taken place on 18 May 1994 when soldiers arrived in the village. He estimated that five thousand soldiers were involved in what he referred to as the “general operation.” The soldiers approached the hamlet on foot from Pilgrimage Hill where they had left their military vehicles. They rounded up the inhabitants at the local school where they separated the men from the women. Everyone's identity cards were taken. The soldiers picked out six of the villagers including his brothers İkram and Servet İpek and the three Yolur brothers to carry their rucksacks back to the vehicles. The witness affirmed that he saw these individuals being led away on foot towards the military vehicles and getting into the vehicles. The soldiers handed back the identity cards to the remaining villagers who went back to the hamlet only to find that the houses had been set alight. The witness stated that his family's livestock and belongings had been destroyed. According to the witness, these events took place at noon. 73. Some villagers attempted to extinguish the flames. However, the soldiers returned around 4 or 5 p.m. with orders to kill them. The villagers were rounded up and taken away. However, an order came over the military radio not to fire on the villagers. They were allowed to return but were threatened with death if they tried to put out the fires. 74. When questioned by the Delegates the witness stated that there were no PKK members living in the hamlet or in the neighbouring village, and if any members visited they would be denied assistance since the inhabitants were afraid of reprisals from the authorities. Moreover, there were no guards in the hamlet - although the authorities had proposed the setting up of a village-guard system. The witness had no explanation as to why the hamlet had been destroyed and his brothers taken away. He did however refer to an incident in Türeli village about a half an hour away in which a number of soldiers were killed. The witness informed the Delegates that all the villages in the neighbouring region had been burned. 75. The witness stated that he and his father (the applicant) had made many attempts in writing to find out from the authorities about the fate of his missing brothers. They were consistently informed that İkram and Servet were not in detention. The witness stated that, out of anger, he tore up and threw away the replies which he had received from the regional governor. The witness told the Delegates that his father had been told the name of the commander of the operation by a soldier whom he had met in the Kiran neighbourhood. His father had written down the name. 76. The witness stated that he had been born in Dahlezeri hamlet. However, at the beginning of 1994 he was living in Diyarbakır. There were twenty households in the hamlet and all the families were in some way related. He knew both İkram and Servet İpek. The witness had returned to the hamlet two days before the start of the military operation. He related to the Delegates that troops from Bolu and other areas had arrived in the vicinity on 17 May 1994 and that there may have been thousands of them involved in the operation. On the following day, all the villagers were made to assemble in a group in front of the local school while the soldiers, who had arrived in the hamlet on foot, burned down the houses. When questioned by the Delegates, the witness stated that five or six soldiers stood guard around the inhabitants outside the school, and he estimated that there may have been sixty to seventy, maybe even a hundred, soldiers involved in the operation in the hamlet. 77. According to the witness, the school where everyone was grouped was ten metres away from the hamlet. He could see the fires burning in the hamlet. The villagers' identity documents were taken by the soldiers and six of them (himself, Abdülkerim Yolur, Sait Yolur, Seyithan Yolur, İkram İpek and Servet İpek) were requested to carry the soldiers' rucksacks up to their vehicles which had been parked on the hilly area around the village. When questioned, the witnessed stated that the military vehicles were not visible from the school. The witness told the Delegates that the soldiers commented that Seyithan Yolur would be taken to Lice and conscripted into the army since he had evaded his military service. The witness estimated that the six of them left with the soldiers around 9 to 10 a.m. On their way to the military vehicles, he could see from a hill that smoke was rising again from the village. By the time they reached their destination, it was late afternoon. However, rather than being released, they were then taken in an open-top military vehicle to Lice along with fifty or sixty soldiers. He could see smoke rising from the villages along the route to Lice. It was dark when they arrived there. They were made to get out of the vehicle and to lie face down. The witness remarked that many other persons arrived around this time. He estimated that about one hundred and fifty persons were lying down in front of the establishment. Their identity cards were collected. The witness stated that he and two others (his brothers Sait and Abdülkerim Yolur) were taken to a custody room where they spent the night. They were never ill-treated during this time. In the morning their identity documents were returned and they were told to leave. The last time that he saw İkram and Servet İpek was when they were lying down after being taken from the military vehicle. The witness stated that when he arrived back in the hamlet, the houses had been burned. 78. The witness had no explanation as to why he and his two brothers were released whereas the İpek brothers and Seyithan Yolur were kept in custody. When questioned, the witness deposed that the place to which they had all been taken was “a large military place in Lice”. 79. The witness had no doubt that the people who raided the hamlet were soldiers carrying G-3s. He had never heard of any PKK activity in or around the hamlet, and had no explanation as to why the hamlet had been burned; nor had he ever heard of a Major Osman Duman. 80. The witness stated that he was from the same hamlet as the İpek family. All the families living there were related. He had returned to the hamlet on 17 May 1994 from Aydın for a visit. Soldiers on foot raided the village between 11 a.m. and noon on 18 May 1994. He was certain that they were soldiers since they were carrying G-3s. A helicopter flew above the area. The soldiers arrived in the hamlet on foot. The inhabitants were all made to assemble at the school on the edge of the hamlet, men on one side, women on the other. The soldiers took everyone's identity documents. He could see the hamlet being burned. Six of them (himself, Mehmet Nuri Yolur, Sait Yolur, Seyithan Yolur, İkram İpek and Servet İpek) were requested to carry the soldiers' bags up to Türeli village. The soldiers kept their identity documents, but returned the identity documents of the persons who remained behind. They set off around noon with the soldiers for Türeli village, which was burning. They reached the outskirts around 2 p.m. Rather than being released as promised, they were made to await the arrival of military vehicles from Lice to take the soldiers back. The witness stated that Türeli village was burning at the time, although they did no go into the village and they did not see any villagers. The six of them got into one of the vehicles and set off towards sunset for Lice. According to the witness there were about one hundred soldiers in the truck. When they arrived in Lice, at the “Regiment”, they were made to lie on the ground and were divided into two groups of three. The witness was unable to confirm whether, apart from the six, there were other persons lying on the ground. One group comprised İkram and Servet İpek and Seyithan Yolur. The witness stated that this was the last occasion on which he saw them. Their names were read out. He and his brothers, Mehmet Nuri and Sait, were taken inside the “Regiment” and spent the night in a cell-like room as the soldiers' guests since by that stage it was dark. They were well-treated. There were two other persons in the room whom they did not know. When questioned, the witness was unable to provide any precise description of the building where he spent the night. He confirmed that the cell door was locked and guarded. The following morning they were handed their identity documents and released. He returned to the hamlet where he remained for one or two nights, sleeping in the open. When questioned, the witness stated that he had no explanation as to why İkram and Servet İpek and Seyithan Yolur had been detained. He had no knowledge of any PKK activity in the area and had never heard of a Major Durmuş. 81. The witness stated that seventeen or eighteen villages might have been burned on 18 May 1994. 82. The witness stated that he had been serving in Diyarbakır when he was appointed on 2 February 1996 to investigate the applicant's complaints. He found no records at the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters to indicate that İkram and Servet İpek had been taken into custody or that an operation had been conducted on 18 May 1994 by the gendarmes or military units. The commander at Lice was interviewed and he confirmed that neither of these persons had been taken into custody. The investigation was closed on the basis of the absence of documentary evidence that the İpek brothers had been detained. According to the witness there was no need to obtain the operational records of the military, given that the Lice District Gendarmes Commander at the time had responsibility for the whole area. When asked about the possibility that the Bolu brigade may have been in the area at the time of the incident, the witness observed that the Lice District Gendarmes Commander would have been aware of this. The witness reaffirmed that he had established through the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters that no operation had been conducted in or around 18 May 1994. When questioned, the witness stated that he did not find it necessary to ascertain from the Bolu brigade whether it had records of operations which it had conducted in 1994. He repeated that the district gendarmerie commander would have had any such information since he had overall responsibility for the area. It had been established that he did not have any information. 83. The witness told the Delegates that he did not personally visit Dahlezeri hamlet or Türeli village since he knew that the inhabitants had all left. He knew the area, having served there and knew that the villages had been abandoned at some stage. The witness could not confirm whether Dahlezeri hamlet or Türeli village had actually been destroyed by burning. When questioned on this point, the witness observed that the terms of reference of his investigation also extended to the allegation that the hamlet had been burnt down. The Lice District Gendarmerie Headquarters informed him that this matter had been investigated and it was found that the hamlet had not been destroyed as alleged. The witness conceded that the report which was sent to him by the commander of the Lice District Gendarmes Headquarters only mentioned that no military operation had been carried out. The witness further stated that no villages in the area had been destroyed by military units. On the other hand, he had personally witnessed the burning of villages by the PKK. 84. The witness declared that, with the exception of the first name and family name, he had no personal identification details of the applicant Abdürrezzak İpek at the time of his investigation. Thus, when someone of the same name was located and questioned by the Diyarbakır police, there was no reason to believe that the wrong man had been interviewed. No attempts were made to question other members of the applicant's family or inhabitants of the hamlet since they had no addresses for them. Moreover, there had been intense terrorist activity in the area at that time. The witness deposed that Captain Şahap Yaralı had not been questioned since it could not be established that the İpek brothers had been taken into custody and, in addition, Captain Şahap Yaralı had been posted out of the area by the time he undertook his investigation. 85. The witness confirmed that he had been the Lice District Gendarmerie Commander in 1994 and that his responsibilities included overall command of the Tepe gendarme station. His responsibilities had included Türeli village. He deposed that no military operations had been carried out in the area under his jurisdiction on 18 May 1994. Had any such operation been conducted on that day, either by the gendarmes or by the military or jointly, it would have been recorded in the log book of the district gendarmerie headquarters. The witness affirmed that the armed forces, including the Bolu commando brigade, would have notified his command of any operation which was to be undertaken, including on 18 May 1994. Notification of planned military operations was established practice. 86. The witness stated that no purpose would have been served by visiting the Dahlezeri hamlet or Türeli village in the course of his investigation. The area had been the scene of intense terrorist activity and the villagers had been forced to leave by the PKK. The witness observed that there must exist a minute recording that an officer had questioned former inhabitants of the Dahlezeri hamlet. He stressed that the security forces had never engaged in village burning or forcible evacuation of villagers. 87. When questioned, the witness reiterated that the names of all persons who were taken into custody were entered in the custody register. There was no reference in the register to the detention of the İpek brothers. The witness noted that no entries were made in respect of persons who were in the gendarme station under observation, for example for the purposes of simple investigations. 88. The witness, when asked if he had heard of a Major Osman Durmuş, stated that there had been a Major Osman in the region at the time of his service there. He recollected that Major Osman was in the area in an advisory capacity to one of the battalions which was responsible for overseeing the local elections. 89. The witness was the commander of the Tepe gendarme station between October 1993 and July 1994. He was responsible, inter alia, for ensuring the security of Türeli village and its inhabitants. He stated, however, that he had never been to Türeli or Dahlezeri during his term of service at the Tepe gendarme station. He explained that at the relevant time they were unable to get to the remote villages since they did not have a vehicle at their disposal. The witness did observe that the soldiers under his command would have visited Türeli village for the purposes of carrying out investigations. The witness deposed that no military operation had been conducted on 18 May 1994 in the region, either by the soldiers under his command or by the armed forces, including the Bolu commando brigade. If any such operation were to be conducted by forces not under his command, he would have been informed twenty-four hours in advance. 90. According to the witness, there had been intense terrorist activity in the area, which forced many people to leave their villages and to move to safer places, such as Diyarbakır. He tried in vain to convince the villagers not to leave their villages. The villagers told him that they were sick of terrorists coming to their villages and forcibly taking their food provisions or abducting their sons. The witness rejected any suggestion that the authorities could have ordered the villagers to leave their villages or that they could have been responsible for the immigration from the region. 91. When questioned about the allegations that Dahlezeri hamlet had been destroyed and that the applicant's two sons had been taken away by soldiers, the witness averred that he had never received any such information during his term of service. Had he ever been informed of such an incident he would have carried out an investigation into the allegations and would have reported the situation to the district gendarmerie command to which his station was attached. No application was ever filed about missing persons either by Abdurrezak İpek or any other person. The witness further deposed that he had never been questioned by the Turkish authorities in relation to the applicant's allegations before the Court. The witness never heard of a Major Osman Duman serving in the area in question. However, he might have served in another division or at the Lice infantry battalion, which was stationed in an unused school. 92. Article 125 of the Constitution provides: “All acts or decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review ... The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.” 93. The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement of the provision does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of “social risk”. Thus, the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist authors when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property. 94. The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section 1 of Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides: “... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this Law shall be brought against the administration before the administrative courts.” 95. The Criminal Code makes it a criminal offence (a) to deprive an individual unlawfully of his or her liberty (Article 179 generally, Article 181 in respect of civil servants); (b) to subject an individual to torture or ill-treatment (Articles 243 and 245); (c) to commit unintentional homicide (Articles 452 and 459), intentional homicide (Article 448) or murder (Article 450); (d) to oblige an individual through force or threats to commit or not to commit an act (Article 188); (e) to issue threats (Article 191); (d) to carry out an unlawful search of an individual's home (Articles 193 and 194); (f) to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372), or in case human life is endangered aggravated arson (Article 382), (g) to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article 383); or (h) to damage another's property intentionally (Articles 526 et seq.). 96. For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings. 97. If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human lives or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code. Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons' hierarchical superior (sections 93 and 95 of Law no. 353 on the Constitution and Procedure of Military Courts). 98. If the alleged author of a crime is an agent of the State, permission to prosecute must be obtained from local administrative councils (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). An appeal against the local council's decisions lies to the Supreme Administrative Court; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind. 99. Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or a tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts. Pursuant to Article 41 of the Civil Code, an injured person may file a claim for compensation against an alleged perpetrator who has caused damage in an unlawful manner whether wilfully, negligently or imprudently. The civil courts pursuant to Article 46 of the Civil Code may compensate pecuniary loss and non-pecuniary or moral damages awarded under Article 47. 100. Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing. 101. Damage caused by terrorist violence may be compensated out of the Aid and Social Solidarity Fund. 102. Since approximately 1985, serious disturbances have raged in south-east Turkey between the security forces and the members of the PKK (Workers' Party of Kurdistan). This confrontation has, according to the Government, claimed the lives of thousands of civilians and members of the security forces. 103. Two principal decrees relating to the south-eastern provinces of Turkey have been made under the Law on the State of Emergency (Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983). The first, Decree no. 285 (10 July 1987), established a regional governorship of the state of emergency in ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey. Under Article 4 (b) and (d) of the decree, all private and public security forces and the Gendarmes' Public Peace Command are at the disposal of the regional governor. 104. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of State security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey. 105. The public prosecutor is also deprived of jurisdiction with regard to offences alleged against members of the security forces in the state of emergency region. Decree no. 285, Article 4 § 1, provides that all security forces under the command of the regional governor (see paragraph 41 above) shall be subject, in respect of acts performed in the course of their duties, to the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants. Thus, any prosecutor who receives a complaint alleging a criminal act by a member of the security forces must decline jurisdiction and transfer the file to the Administrative Council. These councils are composed of civil servants, chaired by the governor. A decision by the Council not to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court. Once a decision to prosecute has been taken, it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case. 106. The second, Decree no. 430 (16 December 1990), reinforced the powers of the regional governor, for example to order transfers out of the region of public officials and employees, including judges and prosecutors, and provided in Article 8: “No criminal, financial or legal responsibility may be claimed against the state of emergency regional governor or a provincial governor within a state of emergency region in respect of their decisions or acts connected with the exercise of the powers entrusted to them by this Decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to this end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim indemnity from the State for damage suffered by them without justification.”","['13', '2', '3', '5']",[],[],"['14', '18']",[],[],1
33,001-57783,ENG,ITA,CHAMBER,1992,CASE OF GIANCARLO LOMBARDO v. ITALY,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient,C. Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen,"7. Mr Giancarlo Lombardo, a former judge, lived in Rome until his death. The facts established by the Commission pursuant to Article 31 para. 1 (art. 31-1) of the Convention are as follows (see paragraphs 23-35 of its report): ""23. As the pensions of public servants and judges are not indexed in Italy, successive adjustments produced a situation in which the amount of pension paid by the State to retired judges having the same grade and with the same number of years of service but having retired at different dates varied considerably, in a way which the applicant considered to be unjustified. 24. Consequently, at the same time as a number of other retired judges, on 11 November 1980, the applicant appealed to the Italian Court of Audit against a decree of the Ministry of Justice rejecting his application for the amount of his pension to be increased; he argued that the provisions of the legislation on which the disparity of treatment was based were unconstitutional. 25. On 18 November 1980 the secretariat of the Court of Audit asked the Ministry of Justice to forward the applicant’s file, which was done on 5 December 1980. 26. On 31 December 1980 the file was sent to the principal public prosecutor attached to the Court of Audit, so that he could investigate the case and formulate his submissions. These submissions were added to the file on 19 January 1982. 27. On 7 June 1982 the principal public prosecutor, considering that the case raised questions of principle, asked for it to be examined by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit. 28. Subsequently, examination of the appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of an appeal to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit entered by the principal public prosecutor on 5 July 1982 against a decision of the division having jurisdiction over pensions, given in an analogous case. 29. These appeal proceedings proved to be lengthy. At the first hearing, arranged to take place on 6 October 1982, a first objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The combined divisions of the Court of Audit held that the objection was not manifestly ill-founded and, in decision (ordinanza) no. 73 of the same date, referred the matter to the Constitutional Court. 30. The Constitutional Court gave its decision in a judgment filed on 7 March 1984. 31. The case was again submitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit after a request to that effect had been made by the avvocato dello Stato (counsel representing the State) on 7 January 1985. A hearing was arranged for 5 June 1985. At that hearing a second objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The Court of Audit held that the second objection was not manifestly ill-founded and once again referred the matter to the Constitutional Court in decision no. 104 of the same date. 32. The file was sent to the Constitutional Court on 18 September 1985. The Constitutional Court arranged for the objection of unconstitutionality to be examined at a hearing on 21 April 1988. Its judgment was transmitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 23 June 1988. 33. The case was due to be heard by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 12 October 1988 but had to be adjourned by the court until 27 October 1988, following a strike by its staff. On that date the Court of Audit referred the case to the relevant division. Its decision was filed with the registry on 14 November 1988. 34. The relevant decision arranged for this case and the numerous others pending, including the applicant’s, to be heard on 22 February 1989. 35. In a judgment dated 13 March 1989, filed with the registry on 20 March, it partially upheld the applicant’s appeal and ordered the readjustment of his pension, re- evaluation of the sums due and payment of interest on those sums."" 8. On 17 July 1989 the principal public prosecutor communicated that judgment to the Minister of Justice in order for him to arrange for its execution.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

FRANCE,1,No violation of Art. 3;Violation of Art. 13;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Alvina Gyulumyan;Christos Rozakis;Elisabet Fura;Françoise Tulkens;Javier Borrego Borrego;Jean-Paul Costa;John Hedigan;Josep Casadevall;Kristaq Traja;Lech Garlicki;Loukis Loucaides;Luzius Wildhaber;Margarita Tsatsa-Nikolovska;Nicolas Bratza;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Snejana Botoucharova;Volodymyr Butkevych,"9. The applicant was born in 1949 and is currently in Clairvaux Prison. 10. The applicant, who claims to be a revolutionary by profession, was taken into custody on 15 August 1994. He was placed under judicial investigation in connection with a series of terrorist attacks in France and was given a life sentence on 25 December 1997 for the murder of two police officers and an acquaintance on 27 June 1975. 11. He was held in solitary confinement from the moment he was first taken into custody in mid-August 1994 until 17 October 2002, notably in La Santé Prison (Paris). 12. According to his lawyer, this entailed his being held in a 6.84 square metre cell that was run-down and poorly insulated, with an open toilet area. The applicant was prohibited all contact with other prisoners and even prison warders and was only allowed to leave his cell once his fellow inmates had returned to theirs. His sole permitted activity outside his cell was a two-hour daily walk in a triangular area that was 15 metres long and 7.5 metres wide at the base, receding to 1 metre at the vertex. This area was walled in and covered with wire mesh. His only recreational activity was reading the newspapers or watching television on a rented set. The only visits he received were from his lawyers and, once a month, a priest. The prison authorities ignored his requests to be allowed visits from anyone else. Mail intended for the applicant had gone missing, although it had not been officially confiscated, and he had not received a winter jacket that had been brought to the prison for him in October 1999 until 16 February 2000. 13. The Government did not dispute these facts. They said that the cell was lit by natural light, a ceiling light and a reading lamp. None of the members of the applicant’s family had ever applied for permission to visit. Only two requests to visit had been turned down, both from journalists. 14. The documents in the case file show that the applicant has received visits from 58 different lawyers during his time in prison. His current representative, who is also his wife under Islamic law, visited him more than 640 times between 27 June 1997 and 29 April 2002. 15. The parties have produced a series of decisions requiring the applicant to be held in solitary confinement for successive three-month periods. 16. The first was taken when the applicant was first detained (15 August 1994). It consists of a form on which the following boxes were ticked: “Need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and “Undermining of order and discipline in the prison”. There were no observations by the applicant. The same day, a doctor issued a medical certificate stating: “[The applicant’s] health is compatible with solitary confinement. However, he must, if possible, have complete rest for eight days.” 17. A decision dated 3 November 1994 to prolong the applicant’s solitary confinement from 15 November 1994 to 15 February 1995 was approved by the Regional Director’s Office of the Prison Service. The reasons stated were the same, but the applicant made the following observations: “I consider that these solitary-confinement measures, especially the disturbances at night, indicate a desire to harass a political prisoner.” In a medical certificate issued the same day, a doctor “certif[ied] that [the applicant’s] health [was] compatible with his continued solitary confinement”. 18. A decision of 20 January 1995, which was applicable from 15 February to 15 May 1995, cited the same reasons and was approved by the Regional Director’s Office. The applicant refused to sign the notice informing him of the decision. In a medical certificate issued the same day, a doctor “certif[ied] that [the applicant’s] health [was] compatible with his continued solitary confinement for administrative reasons”. 19. A decision dated 25 April 1995, which was approved by the Regional Director’s Office and was applicable from 15 May to 15 August 1995, spoke of the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and a “security measure”. The applicant was transferred that day to Fresnes Prison. 20. A proposal to prolong the measure dated 26 July 1995 cited the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. On 27 July 1995 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating: “Health currently compatible with continued solitary confinement.” 21. On 11 August 1995 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 August 1995. 22. On 10 November 1995 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a medical certificate stating that the applicant’s health was satisfactory and compatible with solitary confinement. A further proposal to prolong the measure dated the same day referred to “the undermining of order or discipline in the prison”. 23. On 20 November 1995 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 November 1995. 24. A proposal of 24 January 1996 for a further extension referred to “the need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. On 25 January 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was satisfactory. 25. On 4 March 1996 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 February 1996. 26. On 19 April 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention in the segregation unit. On 7 May 1996 the measure was extended for a period of three months commencing on 15 May 1996. A proposal dated 17 April 1996 mentioned a “precautionary or security measure required for one or more of the following reasons: need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. 27. It was not until 31 October 1996 that the applicant was notified of the measure applicable for the period from 15 May to 15 August 1996. He made the following observation: “I do not think it right that I should be asked to sign more than five months late.” 28. On 15 July 1996 the applicant was notified of a measure which referred to the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and to “international terrorism”. 29. On 22 October 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention in solitary confinement. 30. A decision dated 31 October 1996, which was applicable from 15 November 1996 to 15 February 1997, referred only to the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. The applicant made the following observations on the notification slip: “I note that Mr ..., the director, has already replied to these observations, even before I have made them, it is stated below: 07.11.1996 before the Sentence Enforcement Board in the prison. Consequently, the remarks I am required to make have become superfluous. Even so, my solitary confinement is a form of torture.” This measure was authorised by the head of the Prison Service at the Ministry of Justice on 14 November 1996, as were those that followed. 31. On 17 January 1997 a doctor from the Paris Regional Health Authority certified that he had examined the applicant and found his health to be compatible with solitary confinement. 32. A proposal made on 20 January 1997 referred to the “need to protect [the applicant] from the rest of the prison population” and the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. The applicant made the following remarks: “I note that I am increasingly subject to this base harassment and am being singled out as a political prisoner. I reject the reasons given for keeping me in solitary confinement.” 33. On 23 April 1997 a doctor from the Paris Regional Health Authority certified that solitary confinement was not contraindicated for the applicant. 34. The following reasons were given for a proposal for a further extension dated 25 April 1997: “Precautionary or security measure for one or more of the following reasons: (i) need to protect you from the rest of the prison population; (ii) need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners.” The applicant made the following comments: “I have not had a check-up, been weighed or had my blood pressure taken, etc. ... I note that the lower section of the questionnaire has already been filled in, thus making a mockery of the observations which I have been asked to make. Please give me a further complete medical check-up.” 35. A decision of 21 July 1997 referred in addition to “the undermining of order and discipline in the prison” and “potential dangerousness linked to acts of terrorism”. The applicant made the following comments: “I have not had a medical certificate following a medical examination and you are using forged documents which you do not even dare to show me. I request an immediate interview with the governor.” 36. A decision of 13 August 1997 again cited the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. 37. On 14 October 1997 a doctor at Fresnes Prison issued a certificate certifying that the applicant’s health was satisfactory. Proposals of 21 October 1997 and 23 January 1998 were in the same terms as the decision of 13 August 1997. On signing the proposal of 21 October, the applicant stated: “I sign under protest against an unjust repressive measure (decision) against a political prisoner held hostage by the French State.” 38. On 23 January 1998 a Fresnes Prison doctor issued a certificate certifying that the applicant’s health was satisfactory. 39. It was followed by a further certificate on 22 April 1998 stating that the applicant was fit enough to remain in solitary confinement and a certificate of 23 July 1998 stating that solitary confinement was not contraindicated. A further certificate drawn up on 21 October 1998 stated that the applicant was in satisfactory health and fit enough to remain in solitary confinement. 40. Proposals made on 22 April, 23 July and 19 October 1998 cited the need for “precautionary and security measures in view of the prisoner’s character and record”. The applicant commented as follows on the proposal of 22 April 1998: “I acknowledge receipt of notice but protest against the renewal of this unjustified measure of vile political repression that has been imposed on me. Please provide me with a copy.” On the proposal of 19 October 1998, he noted: “The signature on this notice by the disloyal deputy director Mr V. further attests to the unfairness of repressive measures imposed by a prison service that acts unlawfully against political inmates such as me.” 41. The measure dated 19 October 1998 referred to “precautionary and security measures in view of the prisoner’s character and record”. 42. On 15 January 1999 a doctor from La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate in which he stated: “The applicant’s health is currently compatible with his continued detention in solitary confinement subject to his receiving psychiatric treatment.” Proposals made on 14 January and 8 April 1999 stated: “The prisoner must remain in administrative solitary confinement on order and security grounds, in view of his character and record and the nature of his court cases.” 43. The Ministry of Justice stated in decisions of 20 January and 20 April 1999: “The character of this prisoner, who is an HSP [high-security prisoner] and objectively dangerous, in particular because of the nature and length of the sentence he faces, justifies his continued solitary confinement on order and security grounds.” 44. On 9 April 1999 the senior doctor at La Santé Prison issued a certificate which read: “The circular of December 1998 on solitary confinement states that the opinion of a doctor will only be sought after a year’s confinement. Last certificate issued on (illegible). I do not, therefore, need to append a certificate regarding prolongation to this note.” 45. On 23 April 1999 another prison doctor certified that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention or continued detention in solitary confinement. 46. A further certificate dated 20 July 1999 confirmed that the applicant’s health was compatible with his continued detention in solitary confinement. 47. A decision of 22 July 1999 cited the following reasons: “You must remain in solitary confinement for a further period of three months on order and security grounds, in view of your character, your classification as an HSP, and the nature of your convictions and of the cases currently pending.” 48. A decision of 25 October 1999, which took effect on 15 November 1999, read as follows: “It is necessary to prolong your solitary confinement for a further period of three months in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given the substantial aid potentially at your disposal.” The applicant made the following observations: “I note that the infamous masquerade by the Zionist militant Elisabeth Guigou, who runs the French Ministry of Justice on behalf of the imperialist forces that are seeking to reduce France to the level of a suzerain of the United States, continues. To heck with Human Rights and with Law itself. ALLOUHA AKBAR.” 49. On 1 February 2000 the authorities relied on “order and security grounds, in view of your character, your classification as an HSP and the offences for which you have been imprisoned”. 50. The decisions of 27 April, 20 July and 20 October 2000 were couched in identical terms to the decision of 25 October 1999, save that the end of the sentence read “given your access to outside help”. 51. On 13 July 2000 the senior doctor at La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate which read: “I, the undersigned, ... declare that [the applicant] is in quite astounding physical and mental condition after six years in solitary confinement. However, it is not proper for a patient’s doctor to be required to issue a certificate that ought to be a matter for expert opinion. It is very difficult for a doctor to sanction solitary confinement on administrative, rather than medical, grounds.” 52. On 3 October 2000 another doctor issued a certificate in the following terms: “I, the undersigned, ... certify that I have today examined [the applicant]. No clinical examination was carried out. However, in view of his current mental condition, I am unable to give a medical opinion on whether he is fit to remain in solitary confinement.” 53. On 5 January and 23 January 2001 the Ministry of Justice ratified decisions by the governors of Fleury-Mérogis and La Santé Prisons, dated 30 December 2000 and 22 January 2001 respectively, to place the applicant in solitary confinement after previous orders had automatically lapsed following his transfer. 54. The following reasons were stated in the decision of 22 January 2001: “Regard has been had to your personality, your classification as an HSP, the length of your sentence (LI [life imprisonment]), the nature of the offences and your involvement in an international terrorist network. All these objective indicators of dangerousness make your continued solitary confinement necessary on security grounds.” 55. On 20 March 2001 a doctor from La Santé Prison certified that she had seen the applicant but had not been able to carry out a physical examination. She added: “However, in view of his current mental state, I am unable to give a medical opinion on whether he is fit to remain in solitary confinement.” On 28 March 2001 the applicant commented as follows: “I have once again filled in this form, having already done so on 19 March ... I denounce ‘the white torture’ of perpetual solitary confinement which, following the ‘serious provocation of 28 December 2000’, has been aggravated by the obstruction of the fanlight, which now only opens to an angle of 30o (7.5 cm), preventing fresh air getting in. This is on top of the ban on my receiving visits or French lessons, in breach of the undertakings. You are committing a crime of ‘lese-humanity’.” 56. On 28 March 2001 a doctor from the Cochin Hospital practising in La Santé Prison issued the following certificate: “I, the undersigned, ... state that the doctors from the medical service at Paris La Santé Prison are not qualified to judge whether the physical and mental condition of the prisoner Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, who is currently being held in La Santé, is compatible with his continued solitary confinement.” 57. On 22 April 2001 it was decided to prolong the solitary confinement “in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given your access to outside help”. The same reasons were cited in a further extension of 18 June 2001, while a decision of September 2001 was worded in almost identical terms. 58. On 23 May 2001 the doctor in charge of the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit (“the OCTU”) wrote to the governor of La Santé Prison in these terms: “I have met Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez ... as I was asked for an opinion on whether there is any contraindication to this patient’s remaining in solitary confinement. Even though Mr Ramirez Sanchez is in reasonable physical and mental condition, strict solitary confinement for more than six years and nine months is ultimately bound to cause psychological harm. It is my duty as a doctor to alert you to these potential consequences so that you may take an informed decision. ...” 59. On 20 June 2001 the doctor who issued the certificate of 20 March 2001 issued a second certificate in similar terms. 60. The following reasons were stated in a decision that was applicable from 22 July 2001: “... in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given your access to outside help.” 61. On 20 September 2001 the doctor in charge of the OCTU issued a medical certificate after examining the applicant “for the purposes of the medical opinion required for continued solitary confinement”. He stated that the applicant presented “a physical and mental condition that was entirely reasonable after seven years in solitary confinement”, adding, however, that this opinion does not constitute an expert opinion, which I am not qualified to give”. 62. The following reasons were given for prolonging the solitary confinement in a decision of 4 October 2001: “It is necessary to prolong your solitary confinement in order to preserve order and security in the prison and to avoid your exerting an influence over your fellow inmates or attempting to escape.” In his observations, the applicant noted in particular: “More than seven years of strict solitary confinement, a ban on receiving visits or French lessons and a steady reduction in the amount of fresh air in the isolation cell from which even the old wooden school desk has been removed all serve to demonstrate the unfairness of the repressive measures that have been taken against a revolutionary political leader who will not be broken.” 63. On 20 December 2001 the measure was renewed for a further three months on the following grounds: “Regard has been had to your character, your classification as an HSP, the length of your sentence (LI), the nature of the offences and your involvement in an international terrorist network. All these objective indicators of dangerousness make your continued solitary confinement necessary on security grounds.” 64. Decisions of 10 January, 25 March and 8 July 2002 read as follows: “It is necessary for you to remain in solitary confinement in order to preserve order and security in the prison and to avoid your exerting an influence over your fellow inmates or attempting to escape. The fact that you have received a life sentence, your classification as a high-security prisoner and the nature of the offences for which you have been prosecuted militate in favour of your remaining in solitary confinement.” 65. On 13 June 2002 an assistant doctor from the OCTU at La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate in the following terms: “I, the undersigned, Doctor ..., an assistant doctor from the OCTU at La Santé Prison in Paris, certify that I have examined Mr Ramirez Sanchez Ilich, who was born on 12/10/49, in connection with a request for him to remain in solitary confinement. From the medical standpoint, the problem posed by prolonged solitary confinement over a number of years is that it may affect the prisoner’s physical and mental health.” 66. On 29 July 2002 the doctor in charge of the OCTU at La Santé Prison provided the Ministry of Health with the following summary of the medical care the applicant was receiving: “This patient, who, as you are aware, is in the segregation unit, receives two mandatory medical visits from a member of the OCTU medical team every week, as required by the French Criminal Code. He is currently in excellent somatic health. I am not qualified to express an opinion on his mental health. In addition, Mr Ramirez Sanchez may on request consult members of the OCTU team independently of the mandatory medical visits to the segregation unit. He has thus been able to consult an ophthalmologist ... and has been prescribed corrective glasses. He has consulted a general practitioner several times independently of mandatory visits to the segregation unit on ... Biological tests are performed regularly. ... The treatment Mr Ramirez Sanchez has been receiving can be equated to comfort treatment: ... It should be noted that Mr Ramirez Sanchez has refused any psychological help from the RMPS [Regional Medical and Psychological Service]. ...” 67. In September 2002 a further decision to prolong the solitary confinement was taken “in order to preserve security and order, which are under serious threat owing to the applicant’s implication in terrorist networks, his dangerousness and the risk of his escaping”. 68. On 17 October 2002 the applicant was transferred to Saint-Maur Prison (département of Indre), where his solitary confinement ended. On 13 May 2003 he lodged a fresh application with the Court, in which he complained of the new conditions in which he was being held and, in particular, of the distance from Paris. 69. In June 2003 a book that had been written by the applicant with the help of a journalist was published under the title L’islam révolutionnaire (“Revolutionary Islam”). 70. On 27 August 2003 the Indre Health Inspector wrote the following letter to the Ministry of Health: “Mr Ramirez Sanchez received a somatic and psychiatric medical examination on his arrival at the prison on 17 October 2002. He has at no stage been placed in solitary confinement in Saint-Maur Prison. As regards his somatic health, Mr Ramirez Sanchez receives the statutory care and may consult the OCTU on request. As to his mental health, he was seen by an RMPS psychiatrist as part of the standard induction procedure. No follow-up was prescribed at the time and the patient has not asked to see a psychiatrist since. He was offered an examination and this took place on 26 August 2003. The RMPS have not recommended any follow-up to that appointment.” 71. On 18 March 2004 the applicant was transferred to Fresnes Prison in the Paris area where he was again placed in solitary confinement. This followed a television programme in which, in the course of a telephone interview with a journalist, the applicant refused among other things to express any remorse for his crimes to the victims on the grounds that there were “no innocent victims”. 72. On 6 August 2004 a doctor at Fresnes Prison issued a medical certificate in the following terms: “I, the undersigned, ... certify that the prolonged period of solitary confinement to which Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, who was born on 12 October 1949, is subject is detrimental to his mental health. Bringing the solitary confinement to an end would go a long way to facilitating the monitoring of a chronic somatic pathology from which the patient has recently started to suffer which requires medical supervision and regular biological tests.” 73. On 20 December 2005 another doctor issued a medical certificate which read: “I, the undersigned, ... regularly see Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a prisoner in the segregation unit. His continued solitary confinement is damaging his health; it has now lasted for several years and it would appear desirable from the medical standpoint for it to cease.” 74. On 24 January 2005 the applicant was transferred to Fleury-Mérogis Prison and on 24 November 2005 to La Santé Prison. In both institutions he was kept in solitary confinement with the measure being periodically renewed, including on 17 February 2005 (see below). 75. On 30 June and 5 October 2005 the senior doctor at the OCTU at Fleury-Mérogis Prison issued two medical certificates in exactly the same terms: “I, the undersigned, ... certify that Mr Ramirez Sanchez Ilich, who was born on 12 October 1949, has been in my care since his arrival at the prison. The problems which Mr Ramirez Sanchez has had with his physical health are now stable. Mr Ramirez Sanchez continues to make the same complaints about the difficulties of being held in full solitary confinement. Since he does not wish to be treated by the Regional Medical and Psychological Service at Fleury-Mérogis Prison and I am not qualified to determine the impact of the conditions in which he is detained on his mental state, a medical and psychological assessment would be desirable. Certificate issued at the request of the prison authorities and delivered by hand for whatever purpose it may serve in law.” 76. On 5 January 2006 the applicant was transferred to Clairvaux Prison, where he is held under the ordinary prison regime. 77. On 14 September 1996 the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Paris Administrative Court, arguing that the decision of 11 July 1996 to place him in solitary confinement should be set aside. 78. In a judgment of 25 November 1998, which was served on the applicant on 26 January 1999, the Paris Administrative Court rejected the application, holding that the impugned decision was an internal administrative measure which the administrative courts had no power to set aside. 79. The applicant lodged an application for an order setting aside, on the grounds of formal invalidity, the decision of 17 February 2005 to keep him in solitary confinement. In a judgment of 15 December 2005, the Paris Administrative Court held as follows. “Although the authorities argue in their defence that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences gave an oral decision on 4 February 2005 in favour of prolonging Mr Ramirez Sanchez’s solitary confinement, there is no evidence in the file to show that the regional director obtained the opinion of the Sentence Enforcement Board before delivering his reasoned report to the Minister of Justice, even though, by virtue of the aforementioned provisions of Article D. 283-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Board is the only body empowered to decide whether solitary confinement should continue beyond a year. It follows that Mr Ramirez Sanchez’s argument that the decision of 17 February 2005 to prolong his solitary confinement was defective and must be set aside is well-founded. As regards the submissions on the issue of compensation. Although the formal invalidity of a solitary-confinement measure constitutes a fault capable of engaging the State’ The investigation shows that Mr Ramirez Sanchez has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of police officers. He has been placed under investigation in connection with various terrorist cases, inter alia, for voluntary homicide and using an explosive device to destroy movable property. The applicant might use communications in Fleury-Mérogis Prison or on the outside to re-establish contact with the members of his terrorist cell or seek to proselytize other prisoners and possibly prepare an escape. That being so, the circumstances of the instant case were such as to justify in law the decision taken to prolong the solitary confinement for a period of three months. The damage alleged by Mr Ramirez Sanchez, which included the loss of contact with other prisoners, cannot, therefore, be considered to have been a consequence of the procedural defect in the decision of 17 February 2005, so that his request for an order requiring the State to compensate him for the damage he claims to have sustained is unfounded. ...” “Save in the circumstances set out in Articles D. 136 to D. 147, prison staff must at all times be able to verify a prisoner’s presence. At night it must be possible to light cells when necessary. Cells should be entered only for good reason or in the event of imminent danger. In all cases, intervention must be by at least two staff members and an officer, if one is on night duty.” “Rounds shall be made after lights out and during the night at set times to be changed daily by the senior custody officer, under the authority of the prison governor.” [The words in italic were added or amended by the decrees of 1996 and 1998: Decree no. 96-287 of 2 April 1996, Article 4, Official Gazette of 5 April 1996, and Decree no. 98-1099 of 8 December 1998, Articles 65 and 190, Official Gazette of 9 December 1998.] “Any prisoner in a communal establishment or unit may be placed in solitary confinement at his or her request or as a precautionary or security measure. Orders for prisoners to be placed in solitary confinement shall be made by the prison governor, who shall inform the regional director and the judge responsible for the execution of sentences without delay. The prison governor shall also report to the Sentence Enforcement Board at the first meeting following the prisoner’s confinement or objection to a request for his or her confinement. The prisoner may, either personally or through counsel, send any observations he or she has on the decision to the judge responsible for the execution of sentences. The medical team shall be given a list of the prisoners in solitary confinement every day. Prisoners in solitary confinement will receive a medical examination in accordance with Article D. 381. If the doctor considers it appropriate in view of the prisoner’s health, he or she shall give an opinion on whether solitary confinement should cease. Solitary confinement may only exceed three months if a new report has been made to the Sentence Enforcement Board and the regional director so decides. Solitary confinement may only exceed one year from the date of the initial decision if the Minister of Justice so decides on the basis of a reasoned report by the regional director after the regional director has obtained the opinions of the Sentence Enforcement Board and the prison doctor. The prison governor shall keep a solitary-confinement register for consultation by the administrative and judicial authorities on supervisory visits and inspections.” [Decree no. 96-287 of 2 April 1996, Article 4, Official Gazette of 5 April 1996, and Decree no. 98-1099 of 8 December 1998, Article 190, Official Gazette of 9 December 1998] “Solitary confinement shall not constitute a disciplinary measure. Prisoners in solitary confinement shall be subject to the ordinary prison regime.” Extracts from the Circular of 8 December 1998 implementing the decree amending the Code of Criminal Procedure “4. Solitary confinement as a precautionary or security measure Orders for solitary confinement as a precautionary or security measure are made by the prison governor at the prisoner’s request or on the governor’s own initiative. Since the governor has sole power to order solitary confinement, he or she will need to take particular care in setting out the reasons. 4.1. The need to state reasons Since the Conseil d’Etat’s Marie judgment of 17 February 1995, the administrative courts have assumed jurisdiction to review the lawfulness of disciplinary decisions ‘giving cause for complaint’. Judicial review has not yet been extended to decisions to place a prisoner in solitary confinement, which continue to be regarded in the most recent decisions as ‘internal administrative measures’ that are not amenable to review. The courts consider on the basis of Article D. 283-2 that ‘solitary confinement does not make conditions of detention worse and is not liable to affect the legal position of the person so held’ (Conseil d’Etat, 28 February 1996, Fauqueux, and Conseil d’Etat, 22 September 1997, Trébutien). 4.2. Nature of the reasons It is not sufficient simply to repeat the succinct ‘as a precautionary or security measure’ formula used in Article D. 283-1. ... Orders for solitary confinement as a precautionary or security measure must be based on genuine grounds and objective concordant evidence of a risk of the prisoner causing or being exposed to serious harm. The reasons must state whether the measure has been taken to avoid the risk of an escape, violence or coercion, concerted action liable to disrupt the prison community, connivance or conspiracy, or to protect the life or physical integrity of individual prisoners or of the person in solitary confinement. 4.3. Invalid reasons An order for solitary confinement cannot be made solely for the following reasons. 4.3.1. Nature of the offence The seriousness of the offence for which the person concerned is being held and the nature of the offence of which he or she is accused cannot by themselves justify solitary confinement. ... II. PROCEDURE IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT CASES ... 1.4. Content of the decision The decision shall be in the form set out on the printed sheet annexed hereto and shall be notified after the hearing. The sheet contains two sections, one for the reasons and the other for the prisoner’s observations. Additional observations on an ordinary sheet of paper and any documents that may assist in explaining the reasons may be attached to the decision. ... 2.2. Copies of documents for the authorities Article D. 283-1, sub-paragraph 2, of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires the prison governor to inform the regional director and the judge responsible for the execution of sentences of his decision without delay. A copy of a decision to place a remand prisoner in solitary confinement must also be sent to the judge in charge of the investigation. 3. Lifting of the measure Solitary confinement is not intended to continue indefinitely, as it must be justified by factual and legal considerations, which may change or cease to apply. In view of the harmful effects of prolonged solitary confinement, the prison governor and regional director must closely monitor the length of the measure. The measure will automatically lapse in the circumstances set out in Chapter 3. Consideration should also be given on the ordinary renewal dates to lifting the measure. The prisoner must be notified of a decision to lift the measure. If the prisoner has asked to be placed in solitary confinement, his or her observations (if any) must be obtained. 4. Prolongation of the measure Unless a decision to prolong the measure is made at the end of three months, it will automatically lapse. ... 4.1. Proposals to prolong the measure The prolongation procedure must be set in motion three weeks before the three-month period expires. Prisoners in solitary confinement must be informed if it is intended to propose prolongation of the measure and, if they so wish, be given an hour in which to prepare their observations, which they may submit at a hearing held for that purpose. They are then notified of the proposal. No prolongation may be proposed without a prior assessment of the prisoner’s situation made with the aid, inter alia, of the record of observation of the prisoner in solitary confinement. If the prison governor considers it necessary to prolong the measure, he or she must compile a file containing: (i) The printed proposal form containing a statement of reasons, which must be up to date when the request is made. The form will contain confirmation that the prisoner has been notified of the proposal, the date of the verbal report to the Sentence Enforcement Board and the date of transmission to the regional director. (ii) The liaison form. (iii) The report on the prisoner’s behaviour in solitary confinement based, in particular, on the record of observation. Any report by the medical team or opinion by the doctor will be appended to the proposal file. 4.2. The regional director’s investigation The file should be sent to the Regional Director’s Office at least fifteen days before the three-month period expires. The Regional Director’s Office will examine the file and, if necessary, request additional documents or information. It should make sure it has a fully up-to-date statement of reasons for the proposal to prolong the measure. The regional director must decide whether or not to prolong the solitary confinement and send the decision to the prison for notification to the prisoner before the expiry of the three-month period in all cases. The decision shall be reasoned. If it is decided not to prolong the measure, it will immediately lapse and the prisoner will be returned to the ordinary regime. The prisoner will be given a copy of the decision to prolong the measure on being notified of it. The same rules shall apply to the preservation of evidence and the forwarding of copies to the authorities as for the initial decision. The same procedure shall be followed if prolongation appears necessary at the end of a further three-month period. Regional directors shall consider the reasons for a further extension with particular care. In particular, they must examine whether other types of measure have been considered and satisfy themselves that no such measure would be feasible. When a decision to prolong solitary confinement has already been taken by a regional director, the measure may be lifted during the statutory periods only by a decision of the same authority, unless it automatically lapses under Chapter 3. In such cases, the prison governor will forward to the regional director a reasoned proposal to lift the measure accompanied, if applicable, by a supporting report. The prison governor will also send the regional director without delay any medical certificates the doctor may have issued together with his opinion on whether any action is called for. 5. Prolongation after a year Solitary confinement should be prolonged after a year only in exceptional cases. The Minister of Justice has sole decision-making power, in accordance with Article D. 283-1, sub-paragraph 6. 5.1. Proposals to prolong solitary confinement The prison governor must send the proposal to prolong solitary confinement to the regional director before the end of the tenth month to allow the Regional Director’s Office and the central authority time to examine it thoroughly. A doctor’s opinion must be sought if it is proposed to prolong solitary confinement beyond a year. If the doctor gives an opinion, it must be set out in writing and forwarded with the proposal. If the doctor does not give an opinion, he or she should initial at least the form containing the proposal. The prison governor will submit the proposal to the Sentence Enforcement Board for an opinion, which the latter will indicate on the proposal form. The prison governor should advise the prisoner of his or her intention to propose prolonging the solitary confinement beyond a year. If the prisoner so wishes, he or she may be given at least an hour in which to prepare observations to be made at a hearing at the end of the allotted time. The prisoner is then notified of the proposal. The prison governor must append to the proposal a summary report on the prisoner’s behaviour since the initial decision was made. Lastly, the liaison record (III.3) shall be forwarded with the proposal so that the authority that will take the decision has full details of the chronology of the measure. 5.2. The regional director’s report The regional director should draw up a report on the basis of the prison governor’s proposal and give a reasoned opinion on whether the measure should be prolonged beyond a year. Before doing so, the regional director may lift the measure if he or she considers that it is no longer warranted or substitute another measure within his or her powers. He or she may also recommend other measures, such as a transfer. The file containing the proposal to prolong solitary confinement must be sent to the head office of the Prison Service at least one month before the preceding measure expires. The central authority must be given time to examine the file and to seek alternatives. 5.3. The decision of the Minister of Justice The central authority will send the Minister of Justice’s decision (which will normally be taken by the director of the Prison Service under delegated authority) to the Regional Director’s Office at least one week before the preceding period of solitary confinement expires so that the prison can be informed in time. The prisoner should be provided with a copy of the decision and an original should be placed in the file. A verbal report on the final decision should be made to the Sentence Enforcement Board. The head office of the Prison Service will retain the power to decide on further quarterly extensions beyond a year. The matter will be referred back to the central authority in accordance with the procedure described in this paragraph at least one month before the new period of solitary confinement is due to end. Apart from the cases of automatic lapse set out in Chapter 3, power to lift the measure after a year is also vested in the central authority. ... IV. THE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT REGIME 1. European and national recommendations Following its visit to France of 6 to 18 October 1996, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment recommended that ‘a balance [be struck] between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement type regime’, in view of the harmful consequences that that regime could have on the prisoner. It proposed organising the segregation unit in a way that would give prisoners continued access to better exercise areas and to activities, including outdoor activities. These recommendations tie in with the findings of the working groups that have been set up by or at the request of the Prison Service. 2. Implementation of the ordinary prison regime In accordance with Article D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime. 1o Prisoners must be permitted to make full use of their rights of defence, which are protected by instruments of constitutional or international rank, in accordance with the procedure set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the distinction it makes between convicted and remand prisoners. The prohibition on communication referred to in Article 145-4 cannot apply to communication with lawyers. 2o The right to relations with members of one’s family and others are exercised through prison visits. Subject to the arrangements for individual access to the visiting room, there shall be no restrictions on prison visits unless a court has ordered solitary confinement. There must be no restrictions on the right of prisoners in solitary confinement to send or receive correspondence. However, stricter monitoring of correspondence may be justified by court-imposed imperatives, the prisoner’s classification as a high-security risk in accordance with Article D. 276-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, or a recommendation for the prisoner to be placed on suicide watch. Similarly, prisoners’ rights to make telephone calls in penal establishments in accordance with Article D. 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not suspended by solitary confinement. 3o There is no general restriction on the right of prisoners in solitary confinement to access to news, subject to the normal supervision prisoners receive throughout their term in prison. Prisoners in solitary confinement retain the right to buy newspapers of their choice, or to use a radio or television subject to the usual conditions. If the library operates a direct-access system, it must arrange special opening hours for prisoners in solitary confinement or keep a separate stock for the segregation unit. 4o Religious observance. Religious observance in the segregation unit shall take place in accordance with the rules set out in Articles D. 437 to D. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Since prisoners in solitary confinement are unable to attend the services habitually open to all prisoners, they may be authorised to attend special services arranged in agreement with the chaplain. 5o Health. The health of prisoners in solitary confinement is dependent on their being detained in conditions that allow them a healthy lifestyle: (i) Cells must receive natural light through a window which also affords adequate ventilation, as required by Article D. 350 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. (ii) The exercise yard must provide access to the open air. Consideration must be given to allocating specific times for prisoners in solitary confinement to exercise in an open yard. Exercise periods should be for the same length as for ordinary-regime prisoners. (iii) Sporting activities should be made available in the segregation unit, for example by the provision of an exercise bike, gym mat or table-tennis table. 2.6. Activities in the segregation unit Although access to communal activities provided for ordinary-regime prisoners is suspended during solitary confinement, prisoners in solitary confinement remain under the ordinary regime and special arrangements should be made within the segregation unit for most activities to continue, allowing prisoners to assemble in small groups at times. Thus, whenever possible, the prison governor must permit prisoners in solitary confinement to assemble in groups of two or three for exercise or activities. A room, which may be multipurpose (sport, reading) should be set aside for this purpose. It is for the prison governor to assess how and when such groups may be organised and to tailor the measure to individuals in the light of the reason for the prisoner’s placement in solitary confinement, the aim pursued and the character and conduct of the prisoner or prisoners concerned. Individual educational programmes or distance teaching offered by teachers or instructors should not be discouraged, as they ensure that activities are also directed towards training. ... 4. Monitoring of and dialogue with prisoners in solitary confinement 4.1. Monitoring A record of observation must be compiled for all prisoners in solitary confinement; it will be supplemented by any relevant comments by duty staff or the persons in charge of the unit on the prisoner’s behaviour in solitary confinement. The record of observation acts as an early warning system if it appears that solitary confinement is having harmful effects on the prisoner. Staff should consult it regularly and in any event if it is intended to propose prolonging the measure. A summary of the record of observation will be sent to the regional director and the central authority with the proposal to prolong the measure or in the event of an internal appeal by the prisoner against the original decision or a decision to prolong the measure. All prisons shall be responsible for creating a record of observation meeting the stated objective or, if one already exists, improving it. 4.2. Dialogue In order to avoid excessive social isolation, it is essential to maintain contact and encourage exchanges between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement. Not only does this reduce the degree of isolation, especially for prisoners who do not receive visits, it also assists in monitoring the prisoner’s character. For the same reasons, senior prison officers and socio-educational staff should seek to meet prisoners in solitary confinement at least as regularly as they do ordinary prisoners.” 82. 3. Case-law of the Conseil d’Etat In a judgment of 30 July 2003, the Conseil d’Etat departed from its previous case-law when it held: “The aforementioned provisions and the evidence before the tribunal of fact show that it is in the very nature of solitary confinement to deprive persons subjected to it of access to the sporting, cultural, teaching and training activities and paid work that are available to other prisoners collectively. Such a measure may be imposed for a period of up to three months and may be prolonged. In these circumstances, even though Article D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that solitary confinement is not a disciplinary measure, as the prisoners concerned are subject to the ordinary prison regime, a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement against his or her wishes will, in view of the effects it has on the conditions of detention, be amenable to judicial review. Accordingly, the Minister of Justice’s submission that the Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in declaring admissible an application by Mr X for judicial review of a decision by the governor of Bois d’Arcy Prison to place him in solitary confinement is unfounded. The Administrative Court of Appeal did not err in law when it held that a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement was one of the decisions for which the first section of the Act of 11 July 1979 requires reasons to be stated. In finding that insufficient reasons had been stated in the impugned decision, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal reached a decision in its unfettered discretion which, in the absence of any distortion of the facts, cannot be challenged in this Court. It follows from the foregoing that the Minister of Justice is not entitled to make an order setting aside the impugned judgment. It is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to make an order requiring the State to pay Mr X the sum of 2,300 euros he claimed under Article L. 761-1 of the Administrative Courts Code.” 83. Extracts from the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and the responses of the government of the French Republic (unofficial translation) Report on the visit of 6 to 18 October 1996 “158. The CPT pays particular attention to prisoners held under conditions akin to solitary confinement. It reiterates that the principle of proportionality requires a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary-confinement regime, which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In any event, it should be as short as possible. 159. The delegation visited the segregation units in ... and in the remand prisons of Paris-La Santé ... It met a number of prisoners who had been held in solitary confinement for long, and in some instances very long, periods. ... Furthermore, the solitary-confinement cells in Paris-La Santé Prison could be described as reasonable (cf. paragraphs 100 and 101). As regards the prison regime, which according to the Code of Criminal Procedure is an ordinary regime, the delegation found that the activities remained limited (reading, television, and in some instances in-cell educational or training activities). ... There continued to be little human contact and this took the form of any visits from close relatives or other authorised persons (such as religious representatives) and some daily contact with warders. As regards outdoor exercise, the prison authorities said that a one to three hour walk was authorised every day, although conditions were less than satisfactory. 160. The CPT pointed out in its report on its first visit that particular attention had to be paid to the mental and physical condition of prisoners in solitary confinement. In paragraph 380 of their interim report, the French authorities indicated that prisoners in solitary confinement were examined twice a week by doctors and that a doctor was called out whenever the condition of a prisoner in solitary confinement demanded. Doctors were required to inform the prison governor in writing if they considered the prisoner’s physical or mental health to be at risk. In that connection, the French authorities informed the delegation that a draft decree (which is due to come into force on 1 December 1996) would establish new rules for gaining access to a doctor and assessing a prisoner’s condition. 161. As to the other safeguards, it seemed to the delegation from an examination of the relevant files that the procedure for prolonging solitary confinement was rather summary. The manner of its implementation also appears to vary from one region to another. ... At Paris-La Santé Prison, the delegation heard allegations by prisoners in solitary confinement that this was no longer the case. These were credible allegations, since, unlike in Marseille, the delegation found no trace of annotations or headings indicating that prisoners had been informed of the proposal to prolong their solitary confinement. The delegation found virtually no evidence in the files it examined of reports being sent to the commission responsible for the execution of sentences or of the commission issuing opinions as required by the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, the only medical certificates relating to the renewal procedure seen by the delegation were stereotyped and extremely brief. 162. In the light of the foregoing, the CPT recommends that the French authorities: (i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact; (ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report; (iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is prolonged are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds). The CPT would also like to know whether the decree announced by the French authorities has come into force and to receive a copy if it has.” Responses of the government of the French Republic to the 1996 report Observations (interim report) “(i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact (paragraph 162) The rules governing solitary confinement are being revised. Articles D. 283-1 and D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the circular of 12 July 1981, which are currently in force, need supplementing in order to improve the procedure and to limit the duration of the measure. Draft Article D. 283-1 accordingly places particular emphasis on the need for the medical supervision of prisoners in the segregation unit. It also makes the director of the Prison Service responsible for deciding whether to prolong solitary confinement that has exceeded a year. The entry into force of this Article, which will be included in a vast decree amending more than 300 Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has been delayed, as the decree is part of a governmental programme of State reform. It is intended that a draft circular will be issued when the decree comes into force. It will emphasise that prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime and will give instructions for continued dialogue between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement, in particular through the organisation of regular meetings. The provision of individual teaching or training programmes will also be recommended. (ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report (paragraph 162) A draft circular is being prepared. (iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is renewed are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds) (paragraph 162) A draft circular is being prepared.” Follow-up report “(i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact (paragraph 162) The draft decree referred to in the interim report, which brings the regulatory section of the Code of Criminal Procedure into line with a number of statutes that are already in force, is in the process of promulgation. It will amend, inter alia, Article D. 283-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by making the director of the Prison Service responsible for deciding whether to prolong solitary confinement that has exceeded a year. It will redirect the focus of medical supervision to its exclusive role of providing prisoner health care. Pursuant to this provision, a draft circular has been drawn up confirming that prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime, which entails, inter alia: (a) full compliance with prisoners’ ordinary rights to relations with their family, representatives and others; (b) continued dialogue between staff and the prisoner in solitary confinement through regular meetings; (c) the organisation, to the extent possible, of special activities in the segregation unit and of individual teaching and training programmes. This draft was prepared after wide consultation of decentralised services. An information and exchange procedure on the issue has thus already been set in motion and will continue with the distribution of the circular, which could be available immediately after publication of the aforementioned decree. (ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report (paragraph 162) The draft circular establishes a mechanism for controlling the length of solitary-confinement measures: before a decision to prolong the measure beyond three months can be taken, the regional director must examine an observation report from the prison governor based, in particular, on his knowledge of the prisoner concerned and the information provided by the various prison departments on the basis of the personal record of observation. Any event with suspensive effect that either entails release or is for a period exceeding fifteen days will result in the lapse of the solitary-confinement measure and the prisoner’s return to ordinary detention. (iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is renewed are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds) (paragraph 162) The draft circular introduces an improved system for the provision of reasons and written notification of decisions to place a prisoner in solitary confinement. The prison governor will not, however, be required to disclose information to a prisoner that may put people or the prison at risk; this has been accepted by the CPT.” report on the visit from 14 to 26 may 2000 “111. In its reports of both 1991 and 1996 the CPT stressed that the principle of proportionality required that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement type regime, which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In any event, it should be as short as possible. Following its visits, the CPT advised of its concerns regarding various aspects of solitary confinement in France (cf. paragraphs 140 et seq., and 158-63 of the reports). Subsequently, in a circular dated 14 December 1998, the Minister of Justice issued instructions concerning, inter alia, the grounds on which prisoners could be placed in solitary confinement, the procedure to be followed and the regime for prisoners in solitary confinement. These instructions address some of the concerns expressed by the CPT in its reports on previous visits. Nevertheless, during its visits the CPT delegation found serious shortcomings in the manner in which the earlier recommendations of the CPT and the ministerial instructions had been implemented in practice. The CPT has serious reservations about the situation of a number of prisoners in solitary confinement for administrative reasons that the delegation met during its visit. Its reservations concern both the length of the confinement (which in some instances had been for years on end) and the highly restrictive regime to which such prisoners are subject (total lack of structured or communal activities). 112. The physical conditions of detention of prisoners placed in solitary confinement for administrative reasons were globally acceptable. However, the cells accommodating such prisoners at the Paris-La Santé Prison had only limited access to natural light. In addition, in the four institutions visited, the exercise yards – which were often also used by prisoners in solitary confinement for disciplinary reasons – were uninviting. 113. The ministerial instructions state: ‘The essential features of the ordinary prison regime must, so far as possible and subject to practical constraints, be retained in the segregation unit’ (point 4.1). They further state, inter alia: ‘there shall be no restrictions on prison visits’ (point 4.2.2) and ‘prisoners in solitary confinement remain under the ordinary regime and special arrangements should be made within the segregation unit for most activities to continue, allowing prisoners to assemble in small groups at times’, that ‘it is for the prison governor to assess how and when such groups may be organised’ and ‘individual educational programmes or distance teaching offered by teachers or instructors should not be discouraged’ (point 4.2.6). The instructions further require increased surveillance of prisoners and specify: ‘in order to avoid excessive social isolation, it is essential to maintain contact and encourage exchanges between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement’ (point 4.4.2). From the information obtained by the delegation, it would seem that, with the odd exception (for instance as regards contact with the outside world), the vast majority of the aforementioned requirements have not been complied with. For example, the only establishment which allowed prisoners in solitary confinement for administrative reasons to associate was Lyon-Saint Paul Prison and even there association was restricted (to exercise outdoors and in the fitness room). The CPT recommends that the authorities take measures without delay to give full effect to the Minister of Justice’s instructions of 14 December 1998 concerning solitary confinement for administrative reasons – under paragraphs 4.2.6, 4.2.7 and 4.4.2 in particular. 114. The CPT also has reservations about the effectiveness of the procedural safeguards on solitary confinement for administrative reasons. The files that have been examined show that it is sometimes used as an alternative to solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure (for instance, in one case, the measure was imposed for: ‘serious damage to property belonging to the prison that put prison security at risk’) or to prolong such a measure and that the reasons stated for putting a prisoner in solitary confinement were often stereotyped (‘to maintain order in the prison’ or ‘risk of escape’). In one case the prisoner had been held in solitary confinement since 1997 ‘because of the nature of the offences of which he had been convicted’. In summary, it would appear that the ministerial instructions, namely ‘Orders for solitary confinement as a precautionary or security measure must be based on genuine grounds and objective concordant evidence of a risk of the prisoner causing or being exposed to serious harm’, are not always fully complied with (cf. point 1.4.2). The CPT recommends that the French authorities carry out a case-by-case review of compliance with the instructions issued in 1998 with regard to solitary confinement for administrative reasons. 115. Lastly, the CPT understands that the issue of the nature and extent of available remedies has not yet been resolved (cf. paragraph 146 of the report on the 1991 visit). In practice this means that prisoners in solitary confinement currently have no real means of challenging decisions to place them in solitary confinement or to renew such a measure before an independent authority. The CPT recommends the reinforcement of the safeguards provided for prisoners in solitary confinement in order to ensure they have an effective remedy before an independent authority, preferably a judge. Indeed, that is the spirit of the various proposals that are currently pending before the French authorities (for instance, the Canivet report and the report of the Senate investigation).” Response of the government of the French Republic “(i) take measures without delay to give full effect to the Minister of Justice’s instructions of 14 December 1998 concerning solitary confinement for administrative reasons – under paragraphs 4.2.6, 4.2.7 and 4.4.2 in particular (paragraph 113) (ii) carry out a case-by-case review of compliance with the instructions issued in 1998 with regard to solitary confinement for administrative reasons (paragraph 114) Power to take decisions on solitary confinement is vested in the Minister of Justice if the confinement has exceeded one year. There are currently 77 prisoners who have been in solitary confinement for more than a year. Of these, 23 are in prisons for convicted prisoners and 54 in prisons for remand prisoners. The majority of these prisoners were placed in solitary confinement at their own request, either on account of the offence for which they were imprisoned, or of their occupation before they were imprisoned. Improvements are being made to the segregation units to make them compliant with the circular of 14 December 1998. The prisons to be built as part of the ‘4000 programme’ will be equipped with segregation units that allow prisoners to enjoy all the advantages set out in the aforementioned circular. Furthermore, in accordance with the circular of 14 December 1998 on solitary confinement, it is the regional director of the Prison Service or the central authority who is responsible for reviewing the reasons given by the prison governor for placing a prisoner in solitary confinement. In addition, the prison inspectorate verifies compliance with these obligations when carrying out prison visits. (iii) reinforce the safeguards provided for prisoners in solitary confinement to ensure they have an effective remedy before an independent authority, preferably a judge (paragraph 115) Solitary confinement is one of the issues being considered in connection with the proposed legislation on prisons.” 84. Extracts from the Guidelines on human rights and the fight against terrorism, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 11 July 2002 “III. Lawfulness of anti-terrorist measures 1. All measures taken by States to combat terrorism must be lawful. 2. When a measure restricts human rights, restrictions must be defined as precisely as possible and be necessary and proportionate to the aim pursued. IV. Absolute prohibition of torture The use of torture or of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is absolutely prohibited, in all circumstances, and in particular during the arrest, questioning and detention of a person suspected of or convicted of terrorist activities, irrespective of the nature of the acts that the person is suspected of or for which he/she was convicted. ... XI. Detention 1. A person deprived of his/her liberty for terrorist activities must in all circumstances be treated with due respect for human dignity. 2. The imperatives of the fight against terrorism may nevertheless require that a person deprived of his/her liberty for terrorist activities be submitted to more severe restrictions than those applied to other prisoners, in particular with regard to: (i) the regulations concerning communications and surveillance of correspondence, including that between counsel and his/her client; (ii) placing persons deprived of their liberty for terrorist activities in specially secured quarters; (iii) the separation of such persons within a prison or among different prisons, on condition that the measure taken is proportionate to the aim to be achieved.” 85. 1.

Extracts from the report by Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, on the effective respect for human rights in France following his visit from 5 to 21 September 2005 (published on 15 February 2006) “123. ... At the same time, another administrative procedure, which comes fully under the responsibility of the prison administration, is totally lacking in transparency and calls for rapid action on the part of the legislature. This is the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement. 124. When one visits prisons, and more specifically the disciplinary blocks, one can usually see the solitary confinement blocks close by. Every prison has them. Under the law, any prisoner may be placed in solitary confinement either at his/her own request or as a precautionary or security measure. In some cases, this regime is used to remove prisoners who are troublesome, under suspicion or ringleaders from the other inmates without their having committed a disciplinary offence. 125. According to the legislation currently in force, solitary confinement is not a disciplinary measure. Prisoners in solitary confinement must be subject to the ordinary prison regime. However, they must not have contact with other prisoners, except by express decision of the prison director, to take part in one-off activities with other solitary confinement prisoners. The movements of solitary confinement prisoners within the prison are organised in such a way that they do not meet anyone on their way. In a few establishments, solitary confinement prisoners may engage in a gainful occupation by doing work in their cells. Usually, however, they do not have access to any gainful activity and are entirely dependent on any funds which may be sent to them from outside. All solitary confinement prisoners may, however, receive visits and exchange correspondence in the normal way. 126. There is also a stricter solitary confinement regime for prisoners regarded as particularly dangerous ‘because of [their] involvement in organised crime or in a terrorist movement or [their] legal and criminal background’. It is for the prison director to determine which solitary confinement prisoners fall within this category. They are subject to particular security measures. Some are regularly transferred from one prison to another, roughly every six months. They remain constantly in solitary confinement and never mix with other prisoners. 127. Solitary confinement is usually ordered by the prison director. It may also be ordered by an investigating judge in the course of an investigation. Here I should like to dwell on the administrative procedure for which the prison director is responsible, because I feel that it raises a number of issues likely to undermine respect for the fundamental rights of persons placed in solitary confinement. 128. It emerged from most of my discussions with prisoners, lawyers, representatives of the prison administration and voluntary organisations that the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement depends entirely on an administrative decision by the prison director. There are no legislative provisions or regulations governing this procedure which guarantee the rights of those subject to it, particularly by ensuring that they are given a hearing and the assistance of a lawyer. 129. In principle, there is general legislation which should govern this situation. This is Article 24 of the Law of 12 April 2000 on the rights of citizens in their dealings with the public administration. Under this provision, representatives of government bodies who intend to take an administrative decision against an individual citizen must in principle notify the person concerned in writing with sufficient advance notice, specifying the reasons for the procedure. The person in question must have the opportunity to submit written observations or, if he/she so wishes, oral observations and has the right to be assisted by a lawyer or a representative (approved or not). He/she may also have access to his/her file. 130. Clearly, the decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement would normally be covered by this. However, we were told that this legislation has remained inoperative where solitary confinement is concerned. At present, therefore, the prison director retains sole discretion where solitary confinement is concerned. 131. According to what we heard in the course of our discussions, at present the prisoners concerned are usually informed immediately before the hearing of the intention to place them in solitary confinement. They usually only have an hour in which to prepare their observations before being given a hearing, without any legal assistance, by the prison director. I believe that, as things stand, this procedure must be described as being contrary to the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). Furthermore, the purely administrative and non-adversarial nature of this procedure greatly increase the risk of abuses of prisoners’ rights. I therefore feel that there is currently a real need to introduce legislation or regulations bringing this procedure into line with European standards. 132. Furthermore, it is particularly disturbing to see that solitary confinement may be ordered for an indefinite period, despite its frequently harmful effects on the mental state of the persons subjected to it. The initial period of solitary confinement ordered by the prison director may not exceed three months. It may be extended beyond that period only after a report to the Sentence Enforcement Board and following a decision by the regional director of prisons. In exceptional cases, solitary confinement may be extended beyond one year following an initial decision by the Minister for Justice. In such cases, the prison director compiles a file including, among other things, the opinion of the prison doctor and of the Sentence Enforcement Board. The minister is responsible for subsequent extensions, for three months at a time, in accordance with the same procedure. 133. As may be seen, this procedure is entirely administrative. At present, there is no judicial involvement whatsoever. Yet it is a particularly serious measure, because, although it is not recognised as punishment, the solitary confinement regime imposes significant material restrictions on prisoners’ rights, not to mention its psychological impact. During the visit, I had the opportunity to talk with persons placed in solitary confinement. Some complained about the harshness of their living conditions. According to them, being unable to communicate with anyone for long periods, sometimes well in excess of a year, is hard to bear. Prisoners placed in solitary confinement have no effective administrative remedy at their disposal, and most of those I spoke to regard solitary confinement as a disguised disciplinary punishment. In the course of the visit I met people who had been in total solitary confinement for several years. 134. It is difficult not to agree with them when you see some of the restrictions placed on solitary confinement prisoners. In view of the fact that one of the requirements of the solitary confinement regime is that the prisoners concerned should have no contact with other prisoners, it is very difficult to allow them to exercise the rights vested in all prisoners not subject to a disciplinary punishment, which should clearly be the case for those in solitary confinement. For example, to allow them to use the library or a sports hall, care must be taken to ensure that no one else enters these premises at the same time. As we know, owing to prison overcrowding, it is already quite difficult to ensure access for ordinary prisoners to these services. Most of those I spoke to therefore complained that it was impossible for them to exercise the rights to which they should normally be entitled. The same applies to the possibility of engaging in a gainful occupation. In theory, prisoners in solitary confinement are entitled to that, but in practice they may only do so inside their own cell, which is highly problematical in view of the scarcity of work opportunities in general. 135. Lastly, the exercise areas available to this category of prisoners are usually the same as those used by the prisoners in the disciplinary block. We visited one such area at Fleury-Mérogis short-stay prison. It is located on the roof of one of the prison buildings, closed in by concrete walls on all sides and covered by wire netting. It is so small that it is more a room in the open air than anything else. 136. I should like to stress that we are talking here about people who are not subject to a disciplinary measure. Furthermore, the fact that a person is left deprived of the rights secured to every prisoner is purely the result of an administrative decision against which it is difficult to appeal. I therefore call on the French authorities to take rapid action to bring solitary confinement into line with European standards, in particular those upheld by the CPT. I think there is a need for legislative provisions or regulations to govern the solitary-confinement procedure. The adversarial system already introduced for disciplinary punishments should apply to the solitary-confinement procedure. Lastly, I think it would be in keeping with the spirit of the principle of legal certainty if a judicial body were henceforth able to participate in the procedure, for example the judge responsible for sentence enforcement. 137. Furthermore, without waiting for legislative reform, the authorities should act to ensure that prisoners in solitary confinement are able to participate in organised activities, particularly as regards work, culture and sports. Their walks and outdoor sports activities should be organised as soon as possible in appropriate places intended for the prison population as a whole, and not for prisoners being held in disciplinary cells. Excluding prisoners from these activities amounts to a disguised punishment. Such changes are bound to lighten the already quite heavy atmosphere which I found in the places of detention visited. ...”",['13'],[],[],['3'],[],[],1

TURKEY,4,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Art. 6-1 (composition of the State security court);Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1 (other complaints);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient,,"4. The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Germany. 5. The applicant was a civil engineer and a partner in a company. He was also acting as an automobile commissioner in his spare time. 6. In the course of an operation carried out against the activities of an illegal organisation, namely the Islami Hareket Örgütü (the Islamic Movement Organisation), the applicant was arrested and taken into custody together with Mr A.A. while they were leaving the applicant’s house on 28 November 1995. It appears from the arrest protocol that the police officers were following Mr A.A. who was suspected of being a member of that organisation. 7. On the same day, the applicant’s house was searched. According to the search and seizure protocol drafted by the police officers and signed by the applicant and his wife, the police did not find anything illegal or incriminating. 8. Between 28 November and 11 December 1995, the applicant was interrogated and confronted with a number of suspects. The applicant claims that he was beaten and given electric shocks during this time. 9. On 11 December 1995 the applicant was examined by a doctor at the Bursa Forensic Medical Department who did not find any signs of illtreatment on the applicant’s body. The report mentioned that the applicant complained of a bruise on his left eye and of having been given electric shocks. 10. On the same day, the applicant was brought before the prosecutor when he denied the accusations against him and claimed to have given his statements in custody under duress. He was then brought before a judge at the Istanbul State Security Court who ordered his detention on remand. 11. On 27 December 1995 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, along with two other suspects, accusing him of providing the Islamic Movement Organisation with financial support by forging licences and plates for stolen cars and, subsequently, selling them. The prosecutor requested that the applicant be convicted and sentenced for membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 § 2 of the Criminal Code. 12. On an unspecified date the criminal proceedings against the applicant and two other accused commenced before the Istanbul State Security Court. 13. During the proceedings the applicant refuted the accusations against him. In particular, he challenged the authenticity of the documents in the case file claiming that some of them had been replaced. In support of his argument, he claimed, inter alia, that the search and seizure protocol was torn and that therefore the police had drafted a new one and made him sign under his wife’s name. In his final observations on the merits, the applicant also stated that he had been forced to sign his statements in police custody. 14. On 9 September 1996 the applicant was released pending trial. 15. On 13 February 1998 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, under Article 169 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. In its decision, the court noted, inter alia, that there was no evidence that the applicant had taken part in any armed or unarmed activity of the organisation in order to be considered a member of that organisation. However, the court was not convinced that the applicant did not know that, through his constant financial relationship with Mr A.A., he had been helping the organisation. 16. On 22 April 1998 the applicant appealed against this judgment. In his appellate petition, the applicant submitted, in particular, that the police documents relied upon by the prosecution did not reflect the truth. In this regard, he stated that the documents drafted by the police in Bursa were torn and replaced by the police in Istanbul. The applicant further claimed that he was coerced into signing the documents drafted by the police. Finally he pointed out that the police had not found a single book concerning political Islam in his house. 17. On 15 April 1999 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court in so far as it concerned the applicant and quashed the remainder of the judgment. 18. The Government informed the Court that on 9 February 2001 the Istanbul State Security Court decided to defer the sentence of the applicant pursuant to Law no. 4616 on Conditional Release, Deferral of Procedure and Punishments. 19. The relevant domestic law and practice in force at the material time are outlined in the following judgments: Özel v. Turkey (no. 42739/98, §§ 20-21, 7 November 2002) and Gençel v.

TURKEY,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Nona Tsotsoria;Vladimiro Zagrebelsky,"5. The applicants were born in 1923, 1948 and 1952 respectively and live in Istanbul. 6. The first applicant is the mother and the remaining two applicants are the sister and brother of Ms Nilgün Hasefe, who was employed by Sabancı Holdings in Istanbul. On 9 January 1996 a number of armed persons raided the Holdings' premises and killed Nilgün Hasefe and two others. 7. On 11 November 1996 the applicants wrote to the Ministry of the Interior (“the Ministry”) and claimed compensation in accordance with Article 125 of the Constitution on the ground of the State's failure to protect Nilgün Hasefe's right to life. The Ministry rejected the claim on 9 December 1996. 8. On 14 February 1997 the applicants filed a compensation claim against the Ministry before the Istanbul Administrative Court (hereafter “the Istanbul court”). 9. On 14 October 1999 the Istanbul court partly allowed their claims for compensation and ordered the Ministry to pay certain sums of compensation to the applicants in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 10. On 9 March 2000 the applicants asked the Ministry to pay them the amounts of compensation awarded by the Istanbul court. 11. The Ministry appealed against the decision on 22 March 2000 and asked for an interim injunction suspending the execution of the Istanbul court's decision. In his written submissions the prosecutor at the Supreme Administrative Court agreed with the Ministry and requested that an interim injunction be granted and that the decision of the Istanbul court be quashed. The prosecutor's written submissions were not forwarded to the applicants. 12. On 18 May 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court granted the injunction sought by the Ministry and on 6 March 2002 it quashed the Istanbul court's decision of 14 October 1999. 13. The case was remitted to the Istanbul court, which decided on 31 January 2003 to reach the same conclusion as it had in its decision of 14 October 1999. It ordered the Ministry to pay the same amounts of compensation to the applicants as those awarded in its previous decision. The Ministry appealed. The applicants also appealed and argued that the amounts of compensation ordered by the Istanbul court were no longer satisfactory owing to the low rates of interest. 14. On 14 April 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court's General Council of the Administrative Chambers (Danıştay İdari Dava Daireleri Genel Kurulu) dismissed the Ministry's appeal and accepted the applicants' claims for higher rates of interest in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 15. A request by the Ministry for rectification of the Istanbul court's decision of 31 January 2003 was rejected on 16 March 2006. 16. On 31 October 2006 the Istanbul court adopted a decision in line with the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court's General Council of the Administrative Chambers in so far as it concerned the rates of interest for non-pecuniary damage, and awarded compensation to the applicants. On 2 March 2007 the Ministry appealed against the decision. According to the information provided by the Government, the appeal proceedings are still pending. 17. On 10 December 2007 the Ministry paid the applicants the amounts of compensation awarded by the Istanbul court in its decision of 14 October 1999 and the interest awarded in the same court's decision of 31 October 2006. The total sum paid to the three applicants was 63,080 new Turkish liras (TRY – approximately 37,000 euros (EUR) at the time). 18. Article 13 of the Code of Administrative Procedure provides that anyone who has suffered damage as a result of an act committed by the administrative authorities may claim compensation from the authorities within one year of the alleged act. The victim must first apply to the relevant administrative entity and claim compensation for the damage before he or she can lodge a compensation claim in the administrative courts. If this claim is dismissed in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings. 19. Article 28 of the Code of Administrative Procedure provides: “(1) The authorities shall be obliged to adopt a decision without delay or to take action in accordance with the decisions on the merits or a request for a stay of execution issued by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts or the courts dealing with tax disputes. Under no circumstances may the time taken to act exceed thirty days following service of the decision on the authorities. ... (3) Where the authorities do not adopt a decision or do not act in accordance with a decision by the Supreme Administrative Court, the ordinary or regional administrative courts or the tax courts, a claim for compensation for pecuniary or non-pecuniary damage may be brought before the Supreme Administrative Court and the relevant courts against the authorities. (4) In the event of deliberate failure on the part of civil servants to enforce judicial decisions within the thirty days [following the decision], compensation proceedings may be brought both against the authorities and against the civil servant who refuses to enforce the decision in question.”",['6'],[],[],[],[],[],1

POLAND,3,Violation of Art. 10;Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - award,David Thór Björgvinsson;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"6. The applicant, Mr Jerzy Wizerkaniuk, is a Polish national who was born in 1952 and lives in Kościan. At the material time he was a chief editor and a co-owner of the local newspaper “Gazeta Kościańska”, published in Kościan. 7. On 24 February 2003 two journalists working for the applicant’s newspaper interviewed a local M.P., Mr T. M. The interview, arranged during a chance meeting between one of the journalists and the M.P. several days earlier, at a session of the Kościan Municipal Council, took place in the M.P.’s office in Kościan and lasted about two hours. All questions and answers were tape-recorded. It related to the M.P.’s public and business activities. After the meeting the M.P. requested that the text of the interview be submitted for his authorisation (autoryzacja) before its publication, as provided for by Section 14 of the 1984 Press Act (Prawo Prasowe) (see paragraph 29 below). 8. The verbatim transcript of the interview, subsequently prepared by the two journalists, ran to forty standard pages. The applicant requested P.S., the editing journalist of the newspaper, to prepare an edited version of the interview, fit for the publication purposes. That version ran to three standard pages. The latter version was subsequently presented to the interviewee, approximately a month after the conversation. He read it and informed an employee of his office, Mr K. P., that he would not give his consent to the publication of the text. He was of the view that the text did not correspond to the conversation he had had with the two journalists and that many important statements he had made were not included. He asked Mr K.P. to inform the applicant of his refusal. Shortly afterwards, the applicant called the M.P. who reiterated his refusal. 9. In an undated letter to the applicant, served on him on 5 May 2003, the M.P. stated: “It is true that in February I talked to two representatives of “Gazeta Kościańska”. During that conversation, which was in any event very informal, I replied to a number of questions. However, the text submitted for my authorisation only after a month, failed to include many of my important statements and to reflect the character and contents of my statements, [a state of affairs] which I cannot accept.” 10. On 29 April 2003 the newspaper published a short text asking the readers whether they would be interested in having an interview with Mr T.M., the local M.P., published. 11. On 7 May 2003 parts of the verbatim records of the interview, edited by P.S. and accompanied by photos made when the interview was conducted, were published by “Gazeta Kościańska”. The text carried a lead informing the reader that the M.P. had refused to grant his authorisation for the publication of the interview and that the newspaper was publishing parts of the interview as recorded on the tape, including in its original grammatical form. 12. On 19 May 2003 the M.P. informed the Kościan District Prosecutor that the applicant had committed a criminal offence by publishing parts of the interview without his authorisation and against his will. 13. On the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on a charge of publishing an interview with the M.P. in spite of the latter’s refusal to authorise its publication. During the investigation the M.P. submitted that he had talked to the two journalists from the applicant’s newspaper. They had had a casual conversation rather than a formal interview. A month later he had been given the text to be published which, in his view, failed to reflect many of his important assertions. Moreover, he was of the view that the text failed to convey both the character and the substance of his statements. 14. By a judgment of 30 April 2004 the Poznań District Court found the applicant guilty as charged. The court established the facts of the case as summarised above (see paragraphs 7-11 above). It further found that the applicant had published the interview despite the M.P.’s refusal to authorise its publication. This in itself amounted to a criminal offence punishable under section 14 read together with section 49 of the 1984 Press Act (see paragraph 29 below). The court observed that it was possible for the interviewed person to renounce his or her right to grant authorisation for the text to be published, but such a declaration had to be unequivocal. 15. The court noted the submission made by P.S., who was heard as a witness. According to P.S., the newspaper had not published the three-page summary which had initially been submitted for the M.P.’s approval. It had published parts of the interview quoted verbatim. The court found his statement credible. The court further noted that M.P.’s photographs taken during the interview had also been published together with the interview. The applicant had failed to indicate which photographs he intended to publish and to show them to M.P. before the publication. 16. The court further observed that the applicant had failed to comply with his obligation, under the Press Act, to obtain the authorisation of the interviewed person. It was of the view that the fact that the interview had been published without the required authorisation breached the interviewee’s personal rights. The applicant had acted with intent to break the law, but he had been motivated by his wish to fulfil his journalistic duties by making the interview available to the public. Having regard to the latter factor, the court concluded that the offence concerned could not be regarded as serious. Consequently, and having regard also to the fact that it was not open to any doubt that the applicant was a law-abiding citizen and that his conduct had always been irreproachable, the court conditionally discontinued the proceedings, obliged the applicant to pay 1,000 zlotys (PLN) to a charity and ordered him to bear the costs of the proceedings. 17. By a judgment of the Poznań Regional Court of 6 October 2004, served on the applicant on 15 November 2004, the first-instance judgment was upheld. The court noted, inter alia, that the photographs taken during the interview constituted its inherent part. The applicant, by publishing them without the interviewee’s consent, had breached his personal rights within the meaning of Article 23 of the Civil Code. 18. The applicant subsequently lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, challenging the compatibility with the Constitution of section 14 in conjunction with section 49 of the Press Act 1984, in so far as they provided for a fine or for restriction of liberty to be imposed on a journalist or publisher for failing to ask an interviewee for his or her authorisation. He relied on Article 54, guaranteeing the right to freedom of expression, and Article 31 of the Constitution, providing for the principle of proportionality in respect of restrictions on constitutional rights. 19. In the ensuing constitutional proceedings the Constitutional Court sought the opinions of the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich), the Prosecutor General (Prokurator Generalny) and the Speaker of the Parliament (Marszałek Sejmu). In their opinions submitted to that court they concluded that section 49, read together with section 14 of the Press Act, was incompatible with the constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression. They were of the view, in particular, that the restriction on the exercise of that right by imposition of a criminal penalty was incompatible with Article 31 of the Constitution, which enshrined the principle of proportionality in respect of restrictions imposed on the exercise of civil rights and freedoms (see paragraph 27 below). They further referred to the existing civil law instruments available for the purposes of effective protection of personal rights (see paragraphs 30-32 below). 20. The Constitutional Court gave a judgment on the merits of his constitutional complaint on 29 September 2008. It held that the contested provisions of the Press Act were compatible with Article 54 of the Constitution read together with its Article 31. 21. The court noted that it was proposed in a public debate to do away with the obligation to seek and obtain the authorisation provided for by the Press Act. However, the opinions pointing to the potential danger of such a legislative measure could not be overlooked. The Constitutional Court was of the view that abrogating the authorisation requirement would, on the one hand, expose persons interviewed by the press to the risk of having their personal rights breached by having their words distorted and, on the other, be dangerous for the exercise of the freedom of expression. The essence of the authorisation was not only to ensure that statements made by interviewees were rendered literally, but also to protect the integrality of such statements. This, in turn, ensured that the intentions of the speaker were faithfully conveyed. Therefore, the applicant’s argument that the authorisation requirement gave the interviewee an opportunity to block the publication of a statement indefinitely was incorrect. 22. The judgment further read: “Freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and one of the basic conditions for its progress and for each individual’s self-fulfilment. It is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that offend, shock or disturb. The press has a duty to impart – in a manner consistent with its obligations and responsibilities – information and ideas on all matters of public interest. This duty is closely intertwined with the right of the public to receive information. (...) Statements made public by the media could, as they have a great power of persuasion, lead to the infringement of the personal rights of the individuals concerned. In certain cases the post factum remedies available under law are insufficient to provide effective redress for such infringements, and in some cases the damage could indeed be irreparable. However, a publicly made statement not only could be an instrument of an infringement, but could also be unlawfully distorted. This was why the legislature decided to grant additional protection to statements made in the context of interviews by creating the authorisation requirement. Assuming that this requirement amounted to a restriction on freedom of expression as it obliged journalists to obtain authorisation from the author of literally quoted statements, its necessity in a democratic society has to be examined. [The] freedom of expression is not ius infinitum and could therefore be limited. However, it is necessary that restrictions on its exercise are compatible with the principle of proportionality set out in Article 31 of the Constitution. This provision allows for restrictions imposed on individual rights only when they have statutory legal basis and are necessary in a democratic state in the interests of national security or public safety, for the protection of environment, health or morals, for the protection of rights of others. These restrictions cannot not impair the essence of rights and freedoms. (...) Article 47 of the Constitution provides for everyone’s right to the legal protection of one’s private and family life, of one’s honour and good reputation, and for the right to decide about one’s personal life. No restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of these rights (...). On the contrary, the freedom of expression can be restricted. The obligation to obtain the interviewee’s consent amounted to a restriction. However, such restriction cannot be seen as impairing the essence of the freedom of expression, because it concerns only statements quoted verbatim in press publications. It does not restrict or limit journalists’ right to inform the public of the content of such a statement by summarising it. When a journalist chooses to summarise or otherwise convey the content of a statement made by the interviewee, he or she is not obliged to seek the interviewee’s authorisation or to inform them of the intended publication. Nor, therefore, does it restrict the right of the public to obtain information. [...] that requirement is also necessary in a democratic society to protect the personal rights of journalists’ sources. Hence, not only it is not in breach of any constitutional right but, on the contrary, it had to be regarded as a guarantee of the effective exercise of constitutional rights. Furthermore, this requirement is justified not only by the necessity to protect individual rights [...] but it derives its legal foundation from other elements which, taken together, formed the constitutional notion of the public interest. As the authorisation serves to establish with full clarity the authorship of a given statement made public, it contributes to the clarity and transparency of public debate. It makes it possible for the reader to be certain that the speaker identifies himself with the statement’s content and would not try to change it or to distance himself from it. It is therefore in the reader’s interest to maintain it. Without this requirement, readers could not be sure whether statements purportedly made in the context of interviews are really authentic. In the Constitutional Court’s opinion the authorisation requirement was therefore a means of guaranteeing the reader’s right to obtain reliable, credible, truthful, honest, clear, not misleading and responsible information. This right has not been expressly guaranteed by the Constitution, but it was anchored in it. [...]” 23. In so far as the criminal sanction for failure to obtain the authorisation was concerned, the Constitutional Court observed that it aimed at ensuring that the citizen’s right to reliable information was respected. Authorisation was the simplest way to ensure the veracity of the message, whereas statements published without authorisation could be distorted, which was clearly undesirable. 24. The Constitutional Court referred to the legal provisions penalising defamation. It was of the view that while the offence of defamation was directed against an individual’s reputation, in the same way the offence penalised by section 14 read together with section 49 of the Press Act was aimed at obtaining compliance with the obligation to quote and report statements made by interviewees in a fair and accurate manner, in order to protect their personal rights. The penal sanction provided for by these provisions thus respected the principle of proportionality. 25. A dissenting opinion of Justice Rzepliński was attached to that judgment. He had regard, firstly, to considerations which could be said to have constituted the ratio legis of the Press Act when it had been adopted in 1984. He noted that the 1952 Constitution, in force at that time, guaranteed neither the right to freedom of expression nor the right to respect for family and private life in any form comparable to the current constitutional regulations. At that time all media had been subject to preventive censorship and it was ultimately the State which decided what could be published or broadcast. The opinion further read, inter alia: “The provisions of the Press Act regarding the authorisation requirement were only, at that time, an additional safeguard against the press publishing any information given to journalists by the communist party or State agents if such information was capable of jeopardising the interests of then political power. [Given that constitutional background, it is only natural that] the Press Act did not provide for any distinction in respect of the authorisation requirement between the persons exercising public functions and all other persons. Thus, that Act provided for identical protection, by way of the criminal law, of persons holding public offices who were, for that reason, obliged to provide information about their acts to journalists, playing the role of “watchdogs” of the public powers on behalf of public opinion, and all other, “private”, persons. (...) Moreover, the Press Act failed to indicate any time-limit within which a journalist could reasonably expect that authorisation would be granted or refused. (...) While it is true that during the last years of the ancien régime, in 1998/89, State censorship became less strict, the origin of the examined provisions of the Press Act and the place they had in the legal order at that time cannot be ignored.” 26. Justice Rzepliński further disagreed with the Constitutional Court in so far as it had held that the restrictions imposed by the impugned provisions satisfied the test of proportionality, enshrined in Article 31 of the Constitution. In this context, he stated that the freedom of speech standards developed by the European Court of Human Rights in its judgments could not be overlooked. The dissenting opinion further read: “The impugned provisions [seen in this light] amounted to an unnecessary and excessive interference with the freedom of the press in the interest of the personal rights of persons providing information to the press. These provisions were not necessary for that purpose at the time they were adopted and are still less necessary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law. Authorisation to publish information quoted verbatim is unknown to the legal systems of other States of the European Union. (...) The authorisation requirement amounts to censorship which makes it impossible for the reader to know the original statement made by the interviewee. It may dissuade journalist who is wishing to obtain an interview for their newspaper with a politician important in a national or local context from asking uncomfortable, searching questions. (...) In a democratic state a politician, a public person, has no right to manipulate his or her statements post factum. If he or she resorts to such manipulation, the public opinion is entitled to know this because it is an important element relevant for public image of a politician if he or she tampers with his or her public statements. The requirement of authorisation makes it impossible for the public to acquire such knowledge. Citizens expect politicians to have the courage to make wise decisions in difficult situations. If a politician is unsure of the choice of words to be used when speaking in a public situation it might be a signal to the public that he or she is unable to cope with stressful circumstances. It is something that public opinion is entitled to know. (...) I do not share the view expressed by the Constitutional Court in the present case that a journalist, when refused authorisation to publish a verbatim quotation, can resort to paraphrasing the statements concerned; that the Press Act therefore does not in any way restrict the journalist’s right to convey the interviewee’s thoughts and the right to inform the public thereof (...). I am of the view that public opinion always has a right to be informed of the interviewee’s statements quoted verbatim always where a journalist deems it necessary to convey information which is interesting for readers. I am also of the opinion that that descriptive technique is manipulative and makes it possible for both a journalist and an interviewee to shirk responsibility for the words they use. Furthermore, the fact that the impugned provisions of the Press Act make it possible to use such “techniques” and “evasions” demonstrates that they do not meet the standards required of a fair-minded legislator. (...) There is no right in the Constitution or in a democratic society to “true” or “right” information. A journalist is not obliged to provide such information; if only because he or she does not exercise public powers. His or her professional duty is to seek and disseminate information, views and judgments. Only persons receiving information, readers, listeners, TV watchers or internet users are to decide whether information is true or not. (...) The authorisation requirement is not, as such, wrong. A journalist, when talking to experts, may have, at the editing stage, some doubts whether he or she has properly understood what they said, even where the interview was recorded. In practice, in such situations journalists themselves request the persons interviewed to read the text and to correct or supplement it. A journalist is well aware that errors he committed in gathering specialist information could jeopardise his position on the market. What then is a sword of a criminal sanction needed for? (...) The mere fact that section 49 of the Press Act has practically never been applied recently by the courts (...) does not mean that it does not play in the Polish legal system a negative role, with a chilling effect on public debate. No one challenges the constitutionality of the provisions of civil law applied by the courts in the context of disagreements arising out of press publications.” 27. Article 54 of the Constitution provides: “1. Freedom to express opinions, and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone. 2. Preventive censorship of means of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited.” Article 31 of the Constitution reads: “Freedom of the person shall receive legal protection. Everyone shall respect the freedoms and rights of others. No one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law. Any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order, or to protect the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms and rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights.” 28. Article 61 of the Constitution provides that a citizen shall have the right to obtain information on the activities of organs of public authority as well as those of persons discharging public functions. 29. Section 14 of the Press Act 1984 reads: “1. Publication or dissemination in another manner of information that has been preserved by way of phonic or visual recording requires the consent of the persons providing the information. 2. It is obligatory for a journalist to submit the text of a statement cited verbatim, if it has not been published previously, for authorisation by the person providing the information.” Section 49 of the Press Act provides: “Anybody who infringes the provisions of Articles 3, 11 paragraph 2, Articles 14, 15 paragraph 2 and Article 27 – shall be subject to a fine or the penalty of limitation of liberty.” Under section 31 of that Act an editor-in-chief of a newspaper is obliged to publish a disclaimer to rectify false information, or a matteroffact reply to an article, if the requesting person considers that that article has breached his or her personal rights. Various provisions of the Press Act adopted in 1984 were subsequently amended by Parliament (Sejm) on twelve occasions. Neither section 14 nor 49 have been amended. 30. Article 23 of the Civil Code contains a non-exhaustive list of the rights known as “personal rights” (dobra osobiste). This provision states: “The personal rights of an individual, such as, in particular, health, liberty, reputation (cześć), freedom of conscience, name or pseudonym, image, secrecy of correspondence, inviolability of the home, scientific or artistic work, [as well as] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions.” 31. Article 24 of the Civil Code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights. According to that provision, a person facing the danger of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity, unless it is not unlawful. Where an infringement has taken place, the person affected may, inter alia, request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form, or claim just satisfaction from him/her. If an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss, the person concerned may seek damages. 32. Under Article 448 of the Civil Code, a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation. That provision, in its relevant part, reads: “The court may grant an adequate sum as pecuniary compensation for non-material damage (krzywda) suffered to anyone whose personal rights have been infringed. Alternatively, the person concerned, regardless of seeking any other relief that may be necessary for removing the consequences of the infringement sustained, may ask the court to award an adequate sum for the benefit of a specific public interest ...” 33. Under Article 66 §§ 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code of 1997, criminal proceedings may be conditionally discontinued if the seriousness of the offence, punishable by a prison sentence of less than three years, is not significant, the circumstances in which it was committed have been established beyond reasonable doubt, the perpetrator does not have a criminal record and his personal circumstances and qualities suggest that he will abide by the law during the probation period. 34. Under Article 68 §§ 2 and 3 of the Code, when deciding to discontinue the proceedings for the period of probation, lasting from one to two years from the date on which the judgment becomes final, the court can impose certain obligations on the accused: to pay appropriate compensation to the victim of the offence, to apologise to him/her, or to carry out certain work in the public interest. 35. Under Article 67 § 1 of the Code, the court can fix a probation period of between one and two years, running from the date on which the judgment became final. Criminal proceedings may be resumed if during the probation period the offender disregards the obligations imposed by the court, acts in flagrant breach of public order, or, in particular, commits a new criminal offence.",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1973 and lived before his arrest in the town of Khudzhand, Tajikistan. He is currently residing in Moscow. 6. In 2005 the applicant lost his job at a telephone exchange in Khudzhand and started earning his living by printing various texts for people on his computer, including theses and extracts from the Koran. 7. In 2005 several persons were arrested in Khudzhand on suspicion of membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir (“HT”), a transnational Islamic organisation, banned in Russia, Germany and some Central Asian republics. Subsequently, the applicant learnt that some of the arrestees had testified before the prosecuting authorities that he was a member of HT and had printed various materials for it from the Internet. The applicant denies being a member of HT. 8. On 16 February 2006 the prosecutor's office of the Sogdiyskiy Region of Tajikistan (“the Sogdiyskiy prosecutor's office”) instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of membership of an extremist organisation (Article 307 § 2 of the Tajikistani Criminal Code (“TCC”)). In particular, the applicant was suspected of having actively worked with HT by printing out leaflets and religious literature for that organisation with a view to their dissemination. The case was assigned the number 9615. 9. On 19 February 2006 the Sogdiyskiy prosecutor's office ordered the applicant's placement in custody. Shortly thereafter the applicant was arrested and placed in the basement of the Ministry of National Security (MNS). According to the applicant, he was held there for about three months. He was systematically beaten up and was tortured at least six times with electricity. He was held in premises with nothing to rest on, was refused access to the toilet for lengthy periods of time and received no food. 10. On 6 May 2006 the prosecutor's office of the BobodzhonGafurovskiy District (“the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy prosecutor's office”) opened a further criminal case against the applicant in connection with his alleged activities within HT. In particular, the applicant was suspected of: having secretly studied extremist literature provided by other members of HT; having worked for the organisation as an IT specialist; having printed out the organisation's leaflets and other literature and secretly distributed it among non-members of the organisation; having paid membership fees to the organisation and trained another member to work with the PC. On the same day the applicant was charged with membership of a criminal organisation banned owing to its extremist activities (Articles 187 § 2 and 307.2-3), incitement to religious and other hatred (Article 189 § 3) and public appeals to overthrow the constitutional order and to engage in extremist activities (Articles 307 and 307.1). The criminal case was joined with case no. 9615 and given the number 9431. 11. According to the applicant, in May 2006 he and other detainees were taken to a construction site for a recreation zone for officers of the MNS, where they were ordered to dig, working in a bending position. When they tried to straighten up, the guards beat them severely. 12. On 24 May 2006, fearing further beatings, the applicant escaped. 13. According to the applicant, his relatives told him that after his escape law enforcement officials had tortured his co-accused to find out where he had gone and whether they had helped him to make good his escape. 14. On 25 May 2006 the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy prosecutor's office instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant for escaping from custody. The decision stated that on 24 May 2006, “while in custody at a summer cottage [дачный участок] belonging to the MNS”, the applicant had fled to an unknown destination. 15. On an unspecified date the criminal case against the applicant in connection with his alleged activities within HT was transferred for examination to the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy District Court of the Sogdiyskiy Region 16. By a decision of 6 June 2006 the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy District Court put the applicant's name on a wanted list and suspended the examination of the criminal case against him pending his arrest. 17. On 9 June 2006 the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy prosecutor's office charged the applicant with escape from custody. 18. It appears that the applicant was hiding in Tajikistan until December 2006, when he moved to Kyrgyzstan. On an unspecified date in May 2007 the applicant arrived in Russia. 19. On 5 August 2008 the applicant was arrested in Moscow as a person wanted by the Tajikistani authorities. 20. On 6 August 2008 the Nagatinskiy deputy prosecutor questioned the applicant about the circumstances of his arrival in Russia. According to the applicant's written explanation [объяснение] of the same date, in 2006 the Tajikistani authorities had opened a criminal case against him on suspicion of membership of an extremist organisation. For about three months in 2006 he had been held in custody. During that period he had been taken on a daily basis to work at a construction site, from where he had escaped. In 2007 the applicant had come to Russia to avoid criminal prosecution and to earn a living. He had not applied for Russian citizenship, refugee status or political asylum. The transcript bore the applicant's signature. In the applicant's submission, the explanation was compiled by the Russian authorities on the basis of material from his criminal case produced by the Tajikistani law enforcement authorities. 21. On 11 September 2008 the Tajikistani Prosecutor General's Office (“the TPGO“) sent to the Russian Prosecutor General's Office a request for the applicant's extradition to Tajikistan in connection with the charges concerning his membership of HT. The letter stated that the applicant would be tried only on the charges for which his extradition was being sought, and that he would not be extradited to a third country without the consent of the Russian authorities. 22. On 5 December 2008 the TPGO sent their Russian counterpart an additional request for the applicant's extradition on the charge of escaping from custody. 23. By a letter of 19 December 2008 the applicant's lawyer informed the Russian Prosecutor General's Office that the applicant intended to challenge before the courts the refusal to grant him refugee status (see below) and requested them to take that fact into account when examining the extradition issue. 24. On 30 December 2008 the deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation ordered the applicant's extradition to Tajikistan. The decision, in its relevant parts, read as follows: “... [Mr] Gaforov is charged with having actively participated in 2002-2006 in the activities of a criminal organisation “Hizb-ut-Tahrir al-Islam”, aimed at the violent seizure of state power and the overthrow of the constitutional order and banned on the territory of Tajikistan by a court decision ... ... The [applicant's] actions are punishable under Russian criminal law and correspond to Article 210 of the Russian Criminal Code (membership of a criminal organisation); Article 278 (acts aimed at violent overthrowing of the constitutional order); Article 280 (public appeals in the media to engage in extremist activities); Article 282 § 2 (c) (incitement to hatred and degrading treatment via the mass media, carried out by an organised group); Article 282 § 2 (membership of an extremist organisation); Article 282 § 2 (membership of an organisation banned by a court decision because of its extremist activities); Article 205 § 1 (financing terrorism). The above-mentioned offences carry penalties of over one year's imprisonment. The time-limits for [the applicant's] prosecution under Russian and Tajikistani legislation have not expired. ... [The applicant] is charged with having absconded from custody ... on 24 May 2006 ... The [applicant's] actions are punishable under Article 313 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code (escape from custody of a person detained on remand) and carry a penalty of over one year's imprisonment. The time-limits for [the applicant's] criminal prosecution under Russian and Tajikistani legislation have not expired.” 25. Lastly, the decision stated that, according to the Federal Migration Service (“the FMS”), the applicant had not obtained Russian citizenship, and concluded that there were no other grounds for not extraditing him to Tajikistan. 26. On 21 January 2009 the applicant appealed against the decision of 30 December 2008, alleging that, if extradited, he would be subjected to torture in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. He averred, in particular, that he had described in detail the treatment to which he had been subjected while in custody in Tajikistan and that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office had disregarded those submissions and the relevant materials from international NGOs showing that the Tajikistani law enforcement authorities systematically tortured detainees. The applicant also submitted that the Tajikistani authorities were not able to provide effective guarantees against the risk of ill-treatment and unfair criminal proceedings. Lastly, he stated that the decision to extradite him had been taken despite the fact that his asylum application was pending. 27. By a letter of 10 February 2009 the TPGO guaranteed to their Russian counterpart that, if extradited, the applicant would not be persecuted on political, ethnic, linguistic, racial or religious grounds and that he would not be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The letter also noted that on 11 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Tajikistan had declared HT a terrorist organisation and had banned its activities on the territory of Tajikistan. 28. At a hearing on 16 February 2009 the Moscow City Court (“the City Court”) examined the applicant's complaint about the decision to extradite him to Tajikistan. 29. According to the hearing transcript, the applicant submitted to the court that after his arrest in 2006 in Tajikistan he had been severely beaten and on six occasions tortured with electricity with a view to extracting a confession that he was a member of HT. He had been held in the MNS basement for about three months. During his detention there he had been systematically beaten and insulted and had been allowed access to the toilet only twice a day. While still in detention, he had been taken to a construction site for an MNS recreation zone. There he and other detainees had worked laying the foundation for a sports centre; they had also been ordered to mow grass. The applicant and other detainees had been systematically subjected to beatings. Unable to stand the beatings and the lack of food, the applicant had escaped. The applicant further stressed that he feared returning to Tajikistan because after his escape several MNS officials had threatened his family. They had allegedly told his family members that if the applicant was caught, they would not leave him alive. An MNS officer who had beaten the applicant and who had been on duty on the day of his escape had allegedly told the applicant's sister that if he went to jail because of the applicant, he would kill the applicant's whole family, once released. 30. At the hearing the applicant's lawyer also stated that his client's detention was unlawful because the authorities had failed to extend it properly, in breach of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCrP”) and the decisions of the Constitutional Court. 31. Having heard the applicant and his lawyer and granted their request to include in the case file reports from various NGOs and international organisations on the situation in Tajikistan in relation to torture, the City Court adjourned the examination of the complaint pending the outcome of the asylum proceedings. 32. By a faxed letter of 25 February 2009 the City Court informed the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (“the MID”) about the applicant's case and his allegations of the risk of torture were he to be extradited to Tajikistan. The City Court asked the MID to present their position and to assist the court in obtaining information from the Tajikistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the issues raised by the applicant. 33. By a letter of the same date the City Court asked the Tajikistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit its position and any relevant information on the applicant's allegations concerning the risk of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment should he be extradited to Tajikistan, and to verify those allegations via the relevant State authorities. 34. On 13 March 2009 the MID replied to the City Court that Tajikistan had become party to almost all the international instruments on the protection of human rights and that it had thereby confirmed its intention to build a democratic and secular state based on respect for the rule of law. A post of ombudsman had been created. The MID did not have any information to indicate that “the applicant's civil rights would be violated if he was extradited”. It does not appear that the Tajikistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the City Court's request. 35. On 20 April 2009 the City Court examined the applicant's complaint about the decision of 30 December 2008. The applicant and his lawyer attended the hearing 36. According to the hearing transcript, the applicant reiterated before the court his submissions concerning his alleged torture while in custody in Tajikistan. He submitted that the fact of his previous torture and the threats to his family members proved that he ran a risk of being subjected to such treatment again, should the extradition decision be upheld. The applicant's lawyer asked the court to release the applicant, stressing that he had been detained for a long period of time and that his detention had not been extended despite clear instructions from the Constitutional Court in that respect. 37. The City Court dismissed the applicant's complaint. The decision, in so far as relevant, read as follows: “ [Mr] Gaforov is charged with having, in the period from August 2002 to February 2006 in the Sogdiyskiy Region of the Republic of Tajikistan, been an active member of the criminal organisation “Hizb ut-Tahrir al-Islami”, founded with the aim of violent seizure of power and overthrowing the constitutional order, which [organisation] had been banned by a court from the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan because of its extremist activities; [the applicant] is also charged with having financed the above organisation. During the relevant time period, being a member of that organised group and using the mass media, [the applicant] disseminated materials containing public appeals for the violent overthrow of the existing state regime to take control of the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan and seize power there. [The applicant] recruited citizens to the extremist organisation with a view to disrupting the constitutional order of the Republic of Tajikistan; made public appeals to engage in extremist activities; disseminated leaflets and other printed materials aimed at incitement to ethnic, racial, ..., religious hatred, degrading treatment, propaganda proclaiming the superiority of certain citizens based on their religious ... convictions, and the founding of an Islamic state “Caliphate” on the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan. The [applicant's] actions are punishable under Russian criminal law and correspond to Article 210 § 2 [of the Russian Criminal Code] (participation in a criminal organisation); Article 278 (acts aimed at violent overthrow of the constitutional order); Article 280 § 2 (public appeals via the mass media to engage in extremist activities); Article 282 § 2 (c) (incitement to hatred and degrading treatment committed by an organised group through the mass media); Article 282-1 § 2 (membership of an extremist organisation); Article 282-2 § 2 (membership of an organisation banned by a final court decision because of its extremist activities); and Article 205-1 § 1 (financing terrorism). The above-mentioned offences carry penalties of over one year's imprisonment. The time-limits for [the applicant's] prosecution under Russian and Tajikistani law have not expired. ... Moreover ... [the applicant] is charged with having absconded from custody ... on 24 May 2006 ... The above-mentioned actions of [the applicant] are punishable under Article 313 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code (escape from custody of a person detained on remand) and carry a penalty of over one year's imprisonment. The time-limits for [the applicant's] criminal prosecution under Russian and Tajikistani law have not expired ... The decision of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation of 30 December 2008 is lawful and well-founded. From the information submitted by the Russian FMS [Federal Migration Service] and its Moscow branch it follows that [the applicant] had not obtained Russian citizenship or applied for it in accordance with the law At the court hearing [the applicant] explained that he had not applied for Russian citizenship; he had been arrested in Russia as a person whose name had been put on an international wanted list...; [he] had not applied for refugee status before his arrest because he thought that he would not be granted it as a wanted person; he was not a refugee, he had not been and was not being persecuted in the territory of the Republic of Tajikistan on political or any other grounds, except for his criminal prosecution; he had left his place of residence voluntarily, having fled from custody – [a fact] which proves that [the applicant] was deliberately hiding in the territory of the Russian Federation from the Tajikistani law enforcement bodies. Thus, there are no grounds stipulated in international agreements or the legislation of the Russian Federation to prevent [the applicant's] extradition ... ... The court has examined and dismissed [the applicant's] arguments, supported by his lawyer ... with reference to the opinion [заключение] of 13 March 2009 by specialist Ms Ryabinina and materials confirming, in their opinion, that he should not be extradited to Tajikistan on account of his possible persecution there. However, having applied to the FMS after his arrest pursuant to an international warrant, [the applicant] himself had explained that he feared extradition to Tajikistan because of the possibility of his conviction leading to a long term of imprisonment. Hence, the court considers that there is no well-founded fear of [the applicant] becoming a victim of persecution in Tajikistan under Article 1 § 1-1 of the Refugees Act. Consequently, he does not satisfy the criteria to be granted refugee status because only a person who is not a Russian national and who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to avail himself of the protection of that country as a result of such events, can be recognised as a refugee. Furthermore, the receiving country furnished an assurance that [the applicant] would be prosecuted only for the crimes with which he had been charged. Moreover, the Republic of Tajikistan is party to almost all international legal instruments on human rights, and has thereby reaffirmed its intention to build a secular democratic state based on the rule of law; a post of Ombudsman had been created there. The issue of whether [the applicant] is guilty of the crimes in respect of which [the Tajikistani authorities] have requested his extradition can only be assessed by a court in the requesting country examining the merits of the criminal case against him. Hence, [the applicant's] and his lawyer's arguments that he is not guilty and that the charges against him are fabricated are not subject to this court's examination.” 38. The City Court decision was silent on the issue of the applicant's detention. 39. On 21 April 2009 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (“the Supreme Court”), submitting that the City Court had failed to take into account his arguments, supported by materials from various NGOs, that he would be subjected to torture in the event of extradition. He also averred that the City Court had disregarded that at the time of its examination of the case appeal proceedings against the FMS decision to refuse him refugee status had been pending. 40. On 8 June 2009 the applicant lodged an additional appeal statement with the Supreme Court submitting that the City Court had failed to assess Ms Ryabinina's opinion and materials from various NGOs attesting to the existence of systematic problems with torture in Tajikistan and had limited its assessment to the MID letter stating merely that “there was no indication that [the applicant's] civil rights would be violated in the event of his extradition”. He stressed that the City Court had confused the risk of torture with the risk of criminal prosecution, although the applicant's position in that respect was unequivocal: he feared his extradition to Tajikistan because he had already been subjected to torture there and he had fled to Russia for that reason. The City Court's conclusion that he had voluntarily left Tajikistan was at odds with the fact that the applicant had fled from custody. Lastly, the City Court had exceeded its jurisdiction in finding that the applicant did not satisfy the criteria to be granted refugee status, as it was for the civil courts to rule on that matter. 41. On 8 June 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (“the Supreme Court”) examined the applicant's appeal against the City Court decision. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearing, but the applicant did not attend. At the hearing the applicant's lawyer filed a written request for release with the Supreme Court. He submitted that his detention in the absence of a judicial decision had exceeded the two-month limit set in Article 109 of the CCrP. In that connection he referred to Article 466 of the CCrP, the Constitutional Court's decisions nos. 101-0 and 333-O-P (see below) and the fact that the latest court decision to place him in custody had been taken on 16 September 2008. He also complained that the Babushkinskiy District Court and the Moscow City Court had refused to examine his complaints about his detention. 42. By a decision of the same date the Supreme Court dismissed the complaint, reproducing verbatim the text of the decision of 20 April 2009. The Supreme Court decision was silent on the matter of the applicant's detention. 43. On 23 October 2008 the applicant filed an application for asylum with the Moscow Department of the Federal Migration Service (“the Moscow FMS”), stating that he could not return to Tajikistan, where he had been subjected to ill-treatment. In particular, he submitted that in February 2006 he had been arrested by law enforcement officials who had tortured him with electricity and severely beaten him. Two days later he had been transferred to the MNS, where he had been kept in a damp basement together with eight other persons. He had not been fed and had been allowed access to the toilet only twice a day. The applicant and other detainees were systematically beaten up with a view to extracting confessions about their involvement with HT, to which they had finally had to confess because of the beatings. The MNS officers had forced the applicant and his fellow detainees to work on their construction site and had beaten them if they did not work properly. In May 2006, while at a construction site, he had escaped because he could no longer endure the violence. 44. In an interview with an official of the Moscow FMS on 28 November 2008, the applicant reiterated and confirmed his earlier submissions 45. On 15 December 2008 the Moscow FMS refused to grant the applicant asylum, finding that the reason for his request was his fear of being sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment if extradited. It further noted that when questioned by FMS officials, the applicant submitted that he had been unlawfully arrested by the Tajikistani law enforcement officials and that he had fled from custody because he had been severely ill-treated. The FMS concluded that the grounds referred to by the applicant did not constitute well-founded fear of being persecuted in his home country. 46. On 13 January 2009 the applicant appealed to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow (“the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court”) against the decision of 15 December 2008, submitting that the Tajik authorities were persecuting him on religious grounds in connection with his alleged membership of HT, a banned religious organisation. Referring to Article 3 of the Convention, he stressed that the migration authority had disregarded his consistent and convincing submissions in respect of the ill-treatment to which he had been subjected. Knowing that the Code of Civil Procedure made no provision for a detainee's transportation to court hearings concerning their civil claims, the applicant did not request the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court to secure his presence. 47. On 7 April 2009 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court examined the applicant's complaint in the presence of his lawyer and dismissed it. The applicant was not brought to the hearing. The court found that in examining the applicant's application the Moscow FMS had obtained from the Russian Prosecutor General's Office and their Tajikistani counterpart materials concerning his criminal prosecution in Tajikistan. Those State bodies had not confirmed that the Tajikistani authorities were persecuting Tajikistani nationals because of their religious beliefs, or torturing them or treating them inhumanely in connection with criminal proceedings against them. Although the applicant had arrived in Russia in May 2007, he had applied for asylum only after his arrest with a view to extradition. In sum, the applicant had failed to adduce convincing reasons showing that he had well-founded fears of being persecuted in Tajikistan on political, racial, religious, national or ethnic grounds or because of his membership of a particular social group, and had only applied to the migration authorities because of his criminal prosecution. 48. On 20 April 2009 the applicant appealed against the decision of 7 April 2009, submitting that the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court had disregarded his detailed and consistent submissions concerning the illtreatment to which he had been subjected while in custody in Tajikistan and his persecution on religious grounds. He also averred that the district court had disregarded a number of reports of UN bodies and NGOs attesting to the widespread practice of ill-treatment of detainees by law enforcement authorities in Tajikistan. 49. On 25 June 2009 the Moscow City Court set aside the decision of 7 April 2009 and remitted the case at first instance for fresh examination. 50. On 10 September 2009 the Zamoskvoretstkiy District Court upheld the migration authority's refusal to grant the applicant asylum, reproducing almost verbatim the reasoning of its decision of 7 April 2009. The court also noted that as the applicant only feared criminal prosecution and thus did not qualify for asylum it would not attach any weight to his submissions concerning the risk of ill-treatment in Tajikistan in the event of extradition and the general human rights situation in that country. 51. The applicant appealed against the decision. Referring to reports of various NGOs, he stressed that the problem of ill-treatment of detainees persisted in Tajikistan and that he feared his extradition not only because of the general situation in the country but also because of his own experience of ill-treatment at the hands of the Tajikistani State officials, who were persecuting him on religious grounds. However, the District Court had refused to take that information into account and limited its assessment to the information provided by the Russian State authorities. 52. On 26 January 2010 officers of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (“the UNHCR”) interviewed the applicant in the remand facility in connection with his application for international protection. 53. On 28 January 2010 the City Court upheld the decision of 10 September 2009 in the presence of the applicant's lawyer. The City Court decision, in its relevant part, stated: “On 28 November 2008 [Mr] Gaforov, a national of the Republic of Tajikistan, held in IZ-77/4 in Moscow, applied for refugee status. In his questionnaire [анкета] and report form [опросный лист] [the applicant] stated that there was a real risk of his persecution by law enforcement officials who had arrested him in 2006 in Khudzhand and charged him with being a member of HT. Moreover, [the applicant] stated that he feared criminal prosecution and had been subjected to ill-treatment while in detention [in Tajikistan]. In arriving at its conclusions the [Moscow FMS] examined information submitted by the Russian Prosecutor General's Office and concerning [the applicant's] prosecution by the Tajikistani prosecutor's office on various charges under Articles of the Tajikistani Criminal Code. There is no indication of [the applicant's] persecution on religious grounds in the Bobodzhon-Gafurovskiy prosecutor's office's decision of 6 May 2006 to charge the applicant [with his activities within HT]. From the impugned decision [of the Moscow FMS] it transpires that in arriving at its conclusions the authority took into account information from the [Russian] Prosecutor General's Office and their Tajikistani counterpart. In examining [the applicant's] complaint, the [District] court correctly established that the applicant had not referred to any humanitarian reasons to be granted temporary asylum in the Russian Federation, such as precise details of his personal persecution by the Tajikistani authorities, [or stated] that in the event of his return there existed a real risk to his personal safety from the [Tajikistani] authorities. He had not justified his application for temporary asylum by his state of health or the need for medical assistance. He also failed to submit any evidence that there were obstacles to his returning to Tajikistan.” 54. On 8 February 2010 the applicant applied to the Moscow FMS for temporary asylum. The outcome of those proceedings is unclear. 55. On 10 March 2010 the UNHCR office informed the applicant's lawyer that it had examined her client's application for international protection. The examination established that the applicant was “outside his country of nationality due to well-founded fear of being persecuted by the authorities of his country for reasons of imputed political opinions”, that he was “unable to return to the Republic of Tajikistan” and thus “eligible for international protection under the UNHCR mandate”. 56. On 7 August 2008 the Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant's placement in custody pending extradition, with reference to Articles 97, 99, 101 and 108 of the Russian CCrP and Article 61 of the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (“the Minsk Convention” – see the Relevant Domestic Law below). The court stated, in particular, that the applicant was charged under the Tajikistani Criminal Code with a crime carrying a sentence of imprisonment, that he had fled from custody, did not have a permanent place of residence or registration in Russia and might, consequently, again abscond to avoid prosecution. It further stated that the need to place the applicant in custody was also justified by his eventual extradition to Tajikistan, and that the related proceedings had been instituted following the Tajik authorities' petition under Article 61 of the Minsk Convention. The decision did not specify the term of the applicant's detention and stated that it was open to appeal before the Moscow City Court within three days after its delivery. There is no indication that the applicant challenged the decision on appeal. 57. On 16 September 2008, the Simonovskiy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant's placement in custody pending extradition, referring to Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP and Article 60 of the Minsk Convention. The court stated that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office was verifying the materials in respect of the applicant's extradition and that no grounds preventing it had been established. On 7 August 2008 the Nagatinskiy District Court had ordered the applicant's placement in custody pending receipt of the formal request for his extradition under Article 61 of the Minsk Convention. By the time of the examination of the case by the Simonovskiy District Court, that request had been received. The applicant was charged with having escaped from custody which, under the Tajikistani Criminal Code, was punishable with over two years' imprisonment. Furthermore, the applicant had absconded, he did not have a permanent place of residence or a permanent job in Russia and his name was on the international list of wanted persons. Hence, the applicant's requests for application of a non-custodial preventive measure were unfounded and he was to be remanded in custody. The decision did not set a time-limit for the applicant's detention and stated that it was open to appeal before the Moscow City Court within three days after its delivery. There is no indication that the applicant challenged the decision on appeal. 58. On 21 January 2009 the applicant complained to the Babushkinsky District Court of Moscow that his detention in the absence of a judicial decision had exceeded the two-month term set in Article 109 of the CCrP. He referred to Article 466 of the CCrP, Constitutional Court decisions nos. 101-0 and 333-O-P (see the section on Relevant Domestic Law below) and the fact that the latest court decision to place him in custody had been taken on 16 September 2008. He requested his immediate release. 59. On 27 January 2009 the Babushkinskiy District Court disallowed the applicant's complaint, finding that he had failed to comply with the formal requirements for lodging a civil claim, laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure. The applicant was invited to rectify the shortcomings and informed of his right to appeal against the decision. 60. On 14 September 2009 the applicant complained about his detention to the Nagatinskiy District Court. In particular, he averred that the latest detention order authorising his placement in custody was dated 16 September 2008 and that neither that decision nor the previous one dated 7 August 2008 specified the term of his detention. In any event, since 16 September 2008 the Nagatinskiy prosecutor's office had not requested the courts to extend his detention pursuant to Article 109, so it had become unlawful after the expiry of the two initially authorised two-month terms; that is to say that out of the thirteen months the applicant had spent in custody, nine months of that detention had been unlawful. Furthermore, the Babushkinskiy District Court had refused to examine the applicant's complaint about detention and the City Court had likewise disregarded his request for release submitted at the hearing of 20 April 2009. Relying on Articles 5 §§1 and 4 of the Convention, the Court's case-law, Articles 109 and 110 of the CCrP and the practice of the Constitutional Court, the applicant insisted that his detention had been unlawful, that he had not been provided with an effective remedy to complain about it and that the applicable legislation did not meet the requisite standards of quality of the law. Lastly, he argued that the extradition check against him had been finalised on 30 December 2008 and that after that date no action was taken with a view to extraditing him. 61. On 21 September 2009 the Nagatinskiy District Court refused to examine the applicant's complaint. It held firstly that the applicant had failed to appeal against the decision of 7 August 2008 within the required time-limits. As to the alleged inaction of the prosecutor's office, it was open to the applicant to complain about it under Article 125 of the CCrP to the Simonovskiy District Court, which had territorial jurisdiction over the matter. 62. On 21 October 2009 the applicant appealed against that decision to the Moscow City Court. 63. On the same date the applicant complained to the Simonovskiy District Court, reiterating his submissions made in the complaint of 14 September 2009. 64. By a letter of 29 October 2009 the Simonovskiy District Court returned the applicant's complaint of 21 October 2009, stating that in the Russian Federation criminal proceedings were conducted in accordance with the provisions of the CCrP and that the applicant had failed to refer to any provisions of the CCrP in his submissions. 65. On 8 December 2009 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor General's Office about his detention, averring that he had been held in custody for sixteen months and that twelve months of that detention had been unlawful because the prosecutor's office had failed to request the courts to extend it. He also stressed that the decision to extradite him had become final in June 2009, after which date no action had been taken with a view to extraditing him. 66. On 21 December 2009 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 21 September 2009. It held, in particular, that it was open to the applicant to complain about his detention to a court having territorial jurisdiction or to an appeal court. 67. On 30 December 2009 the Prosecutor General's Office replied to the applicant that his detention had been authorised first by the Nagatinskiy and then by the Simonovskiy District Court, pursuant to Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP. According to Article 109 of the CCrP, the maximum term of detention of persons charged with particularly serious crimes was up to eighteen months. The Prosecutor General's Office had decided on the applicant's extradition on 30 December 2008, that is within the required time-limit. The applicant's ensuing detention was prompted by his appeals to the courts against the extradition order and by the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. As to the Supreme Court Ruling of 29 October 2009 (see below), it was applicable only to persons in respect of whom the Russian authorities were carrying out an extradition check, and not to those in respect of whom the Prosecutor General's Office had already issued an extradition order. In the applicant's case the Prosecutor General's Office had decided on 30 December 2008 to extradite him and that decision was to be enforced. 68. On 22 January 2010 the Ombudsman to the President of the Russian Federation (“the ombudsman”) wrote to the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation stating, in particular, that the European Court of Human Rights had recently found a breach of Article 5 of the Convention on account of the unsatisfying quality of the law in several cases involving persons detained pending extradition. Yet the practice continued, in breach of the applicable Russian legislation, of keeping in custody foreign nationals whose detention on remand had not been extended. The ombudsman opined that the problem lay in the domestic authorities' inconsistent practice in applying the relevant legislation, and had persisted even after the Constitutional Court's Ruling no. 101-O and the Supreme Court's Ruling no. 22 (see Relevant Domestic Law below). The ombudsman referred to the Yuldashev, Isakov, Khaydarov and Sultanov cases, which were pending before the Court, in which the term of the applicants' detention pending extradition had exceeded the eighteen-month maximum term laid down in Article 109 of the CCrP. 69. The ombudsman further stressed that on 5 February 2010 the eighteen-month maximum detention term was about to expire for the applicant in the present case and that the domestic courts had twice authorised his remand in custody without setting any time-limit for his detention. He also stated that the Government were justifying the detention on remand of the applicants in the above-mentioned cases by the fact that the Strasbourg Court had indicated to them under Rule 39 to suspend their extradition. However, nothing in the Strasbourg Court's Rules provided for the respondent State's obligation to hold detainees whose extradition was suspended in custody in breach of the Russian legislation. Lastly, the ombudsman asked the Prosecutor General to carefully examine the situation of the persons mentioned in his letter, in particular with regard to the extension of their detention for an unlimited period of time, and to further improvement of the legislation and its correct application in order to prevent possible violations of the Convention. 70. By a letter of 8 February 2010 the Deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation replied to the ombudsman. The letter, in so far as relevant, read as follows: “... ...the decisions to extradite the applicants in the cases mentioned [in your letter] were taken within the time-limits established by Article 109 of the CCrP, the lawfulness of those decisions was verified by the courts and those decisions are bound to be executed. To release the above-mentioned persons from custody would entail breach by the Russian Federation of its international obligations concerning extradition. The possibility to apply the provisions of the CCrP in respect of the time-limits for the detention of persons held in custody pending extradition was first mentioned in Constitutional Court Ruling no. 101-O ... In its Ruling... no. 158-O the Constitutional Court stated that in its previous Ruling no. 101-O it had not, and could not have, established what particular provisions of the CCrP were to regulate the procedures and time-limits for the detention of persons in custody pending extradition ... as it had no jurisdiction in the matter ... The Supreme Court, in its replies of 9 August and 6 October 2008 to the Prosecutor General's requests for clarification, explained that in deciding on procedures and time-limits for the detention of persons detained pending extradition, the authorities were to apply the provisions of the CCrP. However, this issue had never been examined by the Plenary of the Supreme Court and the practice of the domestic authorities in this respect had not been studied or summarised. Until 29 October 2009 there was no uniform judicial practice on this category of cases in different regions of the Russian Federation. Some judges requested that the time-limits for detention be extended, others refused to extend those time-limits, considering it unnecessary. On 26 November 2009, following the Supreme Court's Ruling no. 22 ..., the Prosecutor General's office sent out to prosecutors in all regions of the Russian Federation an information letter explaining the order on extending the time-limits for the detention of persons in respect of whom the extradition check was pending and the decision to extradite was not yet final... Further time-limits for the detention of a person pending extradition are regulated by Article 467 of the CCrP. The lengthy detention of Mr Yuldashev, Mr Isakov, Mr Khaydarov, Mr Sultanov and [the applicant] Mr A.Gaforov ... is at the present moment a consequence of the European Court's application of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court pending the examination of their cases [by the Strasbourg Court].” 71. On 23 April 2010 the Babushkinskiy district prosecutor ordered the applicant's release from custody, finding that the time-limits for his detention under Article 109 of the CCrP had expired and that there was no reason to extend his detention. 72. On the same date the Babushkinskiy District Court dismissed the prosecutor's request to confine the applicant to the detention centre for foreign nationals [центр содержания иностранных граждан ГУВД по г. Москве]. The court held that only persons charged with administrative offences could be held in the above-mentioned centre and that, in any event, the maximum time-limits for the applicant's detention had expired pursuant to Articles 107-109 of the CCrP. 73. It appears that the applicant was released shortly thereafter. 74. Chapter 13 of the CCrP governs the application of preventive measures. Preventive measures may be applied to a suspect or a person charged with an offence where it is probable that the person in question might abscond, continue to engage in criminal activities, threaten witnesses or hinder the investigation (Article 97). When deciding on the necessity to apply a preventive measure, it is necessary to take into account the gravity of the charges and the various personal details of the person concerned (Article 99). Placement in custody is a preventive measure applied on the basis of a court decision to a person suspected of or charged with a crime punishable with at least two years' imprisonment where it is impossible to apply a more lenient preventive measure (Article 108 § 1). A request for placement in custody should be lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 108 § 3). The request should be examined by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level (Article 108 § 4). A judge's decision on placement in custody may be challenged before an appeal court within three days (Article 108 § 11). The period of detention pending investigation of a crime cannot exceed two months (Article 109 § 1) but may be extended up to six months by a judge of a district court or a military court of a corresponding level, further to a request lodged by a prosecutor (or an investigator or inquirer with a prosecutor's prior approval) (Article 109 § 2). Further extensions up to twelve months may be granted at the request of an investigator, with the approval of a prosecutor of the Russian Federation, only if the person is charged with a serious or particularly serious criminal offence or offences (Article 109 § 3). 75. Chapter 16 of the CCrP lays down the procedure by which acts or decisions of a court or public official in criminal proceedings may be challenged. Acts or omissions of a police officer in charge of the inquiry, an investigator, a prosecutor or a court may be challenged by “parties to criminal proceedings” or by “other persons in so far as the acts and decisions [in question] touch upon those persons' interests” (Article 123). Those acts or omissions may be challenged before a prosecutor (Article 124). Decisions taken by police or prosecution investigators or prosecutors not to initiate criminal proceedings, or to discontinue them, or any other decision or inaction capable of impinging upon the rights of “parties to criminal proceedings” or of “hindering an individual's access to court” may be subject to judicial review (Article 125). 76. Under Article 466 § 1, upon receipt of a request for extradition not accompanied by an arrest warrant issued by a foreign court, the Prosecutor General or his or her deputy is to decide on the preventive measure in respect of the person whose extradition is sought “in accordance with the established procedure”. If a foreign court's decision to place a person in custody is appended to the extradition request, a prosecutor is entitled to place that person under house arrest or remand him or her in custody without the Russian courts validating his decision (Article 466 § 2). 77. The Custody Act (Law no. 103-FZ of 15 July 1995) lays down the procedure and conditions for the detention of persons arrested under the CCrP on suspicion of criminal offences; it also applies to persons suspected or accused of criminal offences who are remanded in custody (Article 1). Persons suspected or accused of criminal offences have a right to lodge complaints with a court or another authority concerning the lawfulness and reasonableness of their detention (Article 17(7)). 78. The Constitutional Court examined the compatibility of Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP with the Russian Constitution and reiterated its constant case-law that excessive or arbitrary detention, unlimited in time and without appropriate review, was incompatible with Article 22 of the Constitution and Article 14 § 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in all cases, including extradition proceedings. 79. In the Constitutional Court's view, the guarantees of the right to liberty and personal integrity set out in Article 22 and Chapter 2 of the Constitution, as well as the legal norms of Chapter 13 of the CCrP on preventive measures, were fully applicable to detention with a view to extradition. Accordingly, Article 466 of the CCrP did not allow the authorities to apply a custodial measure without complying with the procedure established in the CCrP, or in excess of the time-limits fixed therein. 80. The Prosecutor General asked the Constitutional Court for an official clarification of its decision no. 101-O of 4 April 2006 (see above), for the purpose, in particular, of elucidating the procedure for extending a person's detention with a view to extradition. 81. The Constitutional Court dismissed the request on the ground that it was not competent to indicate specific provisions of the criminal law governing the procedure and time-limits for holding a person in custody with a view to extradition. That was a matter for the courts of general jurisdiction. 82. In this decision the Constitutional Court reiterated that Article 466 of the CCrP did not imply that detention of a person on the basis of an extradition request did not have to comply with the terms and time-limits provided for in the legislation on criminal procedure. 83. By a decision (решение) of 14 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation granted the Prosecutor General's request and classified a number of international and regional organisations as terrorist organisations, including HT (also known as the Party of Islamist Liberation), and prohibited their activities on Russian soil. It held that HT aimed to overthrow non-Islamist governments and to establish “Islamist governance on an international scale by reviving a Worldwide Islamist Caliphate”, in the first place in the regions with predominantly Muslim populations, including Russia and other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 84. By a Directive Decision No.1 adopted by the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 10 February 2009, (“Directive Decision of 10 February 2009”) the Plenary Session issued several instructions to the courts on the application of Article 125 of the CCrP. The Plenary reiterated that any party to criminal proceedings or other person whose rights and freedoms were affected by actions or the inaction of the investigating or prosecuting authorities in criminal proceedings could invoke Article 125 of the CCrP to challenge a refusal to institute criminal proceedings or a decision to terminate them. The Plenary stated that whilst the bulk of decisions amenable to judicial review under Article 125 also included decisions to institute criminal proceedings, refusals to admit a defence counsel or to grant victim status, a person could not rely on Article 125 to challenge a court's decision to apply bail or house arrest or to remand a person in custody. It was further stressed that in declaring a specific action or inaction of a law enforcement authority unlawful or unjustified, a judge was not entitled to annul the impugned decision or to oblige the official responsible to annul it but could only request him or her to rectify the indicated shortcomings. Should the authority concerned fail to comply with the court's instructions, an interested party could complain to a court about the authority's inaction and the latter body could issue a special decision [частное определение], drawing the authority's attention to the situation. Lastly, the decision stated that a prosecutor's decision to place a person under house arrest or to remand him or her in custody with a view to extradition could be appealed against to a court under Article 125 of the CCrP. 85. In a Directive Decision No. 22, adopted by the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on 29 October 2009 (“Directive Decision of 29 October 2009”), it was stated that, pursuant to Article 466 § 1 of the CCrP, only a court could order placement in custody of a person in respect of whom an extradition check was pending and the authorities of the country requesting extradition had not submitted a court decision to place him or her in custody. The judicial authorisation of placement in custody in that situation was to be carried out in accordance with Article 108 of the CCrP and following a prosecutor's petition to place that person in custody. In deciding to remand a person in custody a court was to examine if there existed factual and legal grounds for applying the preventive measure. If the extradition request was accompanied by a detention order of a foreign court, a prosecutor was entitled to remand the person in custody without a Russian court's authorisation (Article 466 § 2 of the CCrP) for a period not exceeding two months, and the prosecutor's decision could be challenged in the courts under Article 125 of the CCrP. In extending a person's detention with a view to extradition a court was to apply Article 109 of the CCrP. 86. Recommendation No. R (98) 13 of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers to Member States on the right of rejected asylum seekers to an effective remedy against decisions on expulsion in the context of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights reads as follows: “The Committee of Ministers... Without prejudice to the exercise of any right of rejected asylum seekers to appeal against a negative decision on their asylum request, as recommended, among others, in Council of Europe Recommendation No. R (81) 16 of the Committee of Ministers, Recommends that governments of member states, while applying their own procedural rules, ensure that the following guarantees are complied with in their legislation or practice: 1. An effective remedy before a national authority should be provided for any asylum seeker whose request for refugee status is rejected and who is subject to expulsion to a country about which that person presents an arguable claim that he or she would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 2. In applying paragraph 1 of this recommendation, a remedy before a national authority is considered effective when: ... 2.2. that authority has competence both to decide on the existence of the conditions provided for by Article 3 of the Convention and to grant appropriate relief; ... 2.4. the execution of the expulsion order is suspended until a decision under 2.2 is taken.” 87. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights issued a Recommendation (CommDH(2001)19) on 19 September 2001 concerning the rights of aliens wishing to enter a Council of Europe Member State and the enforcement of expulsion orders, part of which reads as follows: “11. It is essential that the right of judicial remedy within the meaning of Article 13 of the ECHR be not only guaranteed in law but also granted in practice when a person alleges that the competent authorities have contravened or are likely to contravene a right guaranteed by the ECHR. The right of effective remedy must be guaranteed to anyone wishing to challenge a refoulement or expulsion order. It must be capable of suspending enforcement of an expulsion order, at least where contravention of Articles 2 or 3 of the ECHR is alleged.” 88. For other relevant documents, see the Court's judgment in the case of Gebremedhin [Gaberamadhien] v. France, no. 25389/05, §§ 36-38, ECHR 2007 V. 89. When performing actions requested under the Minsk Convention, to which Russia and Tajikistan are parties, a requested official body applies its country's domestic laws (Article 8 § 1). 90. Upon receipt of a request for extradition, the requested country should immediately take measures to search for and arrest the person whose extradition is sought, except in cases where no extradition is possible (Article 60). 91. The person whose extradition is sought may be arrested before receipt of a request for extradition if there is a related petition. The petition must contain a reference to a detention order and indicate that a request for extradition will follow (Article 61 § 1). If the person is arrested or placed in detention before receipt of the extradition request, the requesting country must be informed immediately (Article 61 § 3). 92. A person detained pending extradition pursuant to Article 61 § 1 of the Minsk Convention must be released if the requesting country fails to submit an official request for extradition with all requisite supporting documents within forty days from the date of placement in custody (Article 62 § 1). 93. The “Conclusions and Recommendations: Tajikistan”, issued by the UN Committee against Torture on 7 December 2006 (CAT/C/TJK/CO/1), pointed out the following areas of concern regarding the human rights situation in the country: “The definition of torture provided in domestic law ... is not fully in conformity with the definition in article 1 of the Convention, particularly regarding purposes of torture and its applicability to all public officials and others acting in an official capacity. ... There are numerous allegations concerning the widespread routine use of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement and investigative personnel, particularly to extract confessions to be used in criminal proceedings. Further, there is an absence of preventive measures to ensure effective protection of all members of society from torture and ill-treatment. ... The Committee is also concerned at: (a) The lack of a legal obligation to register detainees immediately upon loss of liberty, including before their formal arrest and arraignment on charges, the absence of adequate records regarding the arrest and detention of persons, and the lack of regular independent medical examinations; (b) Numerous and continuing reports of hampered access to legal counsel, independent medical expertise and contacts with relatives in the period immediately following arrest, due to current legislation and actual practice allowing a delay before registration of an arrest and conditioning access on the permission or request of officials; (c) Reports that unlawful restrictions of access to lawyers, doctors and family by State agents are not investigated or perpetrators duly punished; (d) The lack of fundamental guarantees to ensure judicial supervision of detentions, as the Procuracy is also empowered to exercise such oversight; (e) The extensive resort to pretrial detention that may last up to 15 months; and (f) The high number of deaths in custody. ... There are continuing and reliable allegations concerning the frequent use of interrogation methods that are prohibited by the Convention by both law enforcement officials and investigative bodies. ... There are reports that there is no systematic review of all places of detention, by national or international monitors, and that regular and unannounced access to such places is not permitted.” 94. The report by Amnesty International entitled “The State of The World's Human Rights”, released in 2007, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “... There were continuing reports of unlawful arrests and widespread and routine torture or other ill-treatment by law enforcement officers, several of whom were sentenced to prison terms. ... Sadullo Marufov, a member of the Islamic Renaissance Party (IRP), died in police custody in May after he was detained for questioning by law enforcement officers in Isfara. Initially the officers claimed that he had committed suicide by jumping from a third floor window. The IRP claimed that an autopsy report indicated that he had been beaten and ill-treated, and alleged that he had been pushed from the window. The general prosecutor's office subsequently announced that following an investigation three officers had been detained.” 95. In its “World Report 2008 – Tajikistan” of 31 January 2008 the Human Rights Watch stated as follows: “Tajikistan's human rights situation continues to be characterized by lack of access to justice, due process violations, incommunicado detention, and ill-treatment in custody. The government interferes with opposition political parties. Government harassment of non-traditional religious groups and Muslim groups that are independent of state-controlled religious bodies has intensified. ... Torture and Ill-treatment in Custody Human rights organizations and lawyers continue to receive reports of arbitrary arrests, violations of detention procedures and fair trial standards, and credible, serious allegations of ill-treatment and torture in detention. Defense lawyers themselves are subject to threats and harassment if they insist on effective assistance of counsel. Tajikistan has not amended its law on torture to comply fully with the UN Committee Against Torture's recommendations to the country in December 2006. Law enforcement officials can be charged with ""abuse of professional competency"" (criminal code article 314), but not with torture. National legislation does not prohibit torture evidence from being admitted at trial. Impunity for ill-treatment in detention continues to be widespread. There were, however, at least two cases in 2007 in which law enforcement officers were prosecuted for ill-treatment. In April police lieutenant Nurullo Abdulloev was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment by a court in Kulyab for the unlawful detention and ill-treatment of two detainees. In another case in April, two police officers were each sentenced to two years' imprisonment for beating and torturing with electrical shock a 15-year-old boy in the capital, Dushanbe. All three men were convicted under article 314. ... Actions in the Name of Countering Terrorism and Extremism In 2007 law enforcement bodies continued to arrest individuals simply because they were accused of possessing leaflets of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a banned Islamic organization, and at least three alleged Hizb ut-Tahrir members were sentenced to more than 10 years' imprisonment each for ""incitement of ethnic and religious hatred"" and ""membership in extremist organizations."" In the first case of a child being imprisoned for membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir, Muminbek Mamedov, a 17-year-old boy, was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment. In January the Supreme Court banned another 10 organizations, including the Islamic Movement of Turkestan, as ""extremist."" In August a small Islamist group, Mavlavi, was banned on the grounds that it holds ""unsanctioned gatherings."" Uzbek and Tajik citizens continue to be arrested for alleged membership in the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. In these highly political cases involving terrorism charges, the suspects are frequently denied procedural protection and the right to a fair trial, and routinely suffer from inhumane treatment in detention. ... Visiting Tajikistan in April, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour called on the government to ensure better access to justice and to allow local and international monitors, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, to visit detention places. Asma Jahangir, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, visited Tajikistan in February, concluding that religious communities and individuals faced ""challenges,"" and underscoring the importance of the government's ensuring that ""especially vulnerable individuals"" be protected ""from harassment by non-State actors in the name of religion."" In March the UN Human Rights Committee issued two decisions on applications alleging abuses by Tajik authorities. It found that in both Ashurov v. Tajikistan, and Karimov and Nursatov v. Tajikistan the victims had been subjected to torture and unfair trial. The decisions urge Tajik authorities to ensure effective remedy to the applicants, including compensation, and in the Ashurov case to immediately release the victim. At this writing the government has not implemented the decisions.” 96. In its monthly report of November 2008 the Bureau on Human Rights and the Rule of Law, an NGO established in Tajikistan, provided the following information on the situation regarding torture in detention in that country: “In Tajikistan only 2% of victims of torture are able to prove that fact and have the perpetrators punished... This conclusion is based on the findings of the research of practice of ill-treatment by law enforcement officials at arrest and during the preliminary investigation carried out by the League of lawyers and the public foundation “Panorama”. Having interviewed the victims, the researchers came to the following conclusions. The detainees stated that they had been subjected to the following methods of illtreatment: psychological pressure – 24%; being hit, kicked and beaten with truncheon on different parts of the body – 32,5%; threats of physical violence – 12,5%. 32% of victims stated that they had been simultaneously subjected to various forms of torture, in particular, torture with electricity, threats and beatings. 57% of victims of torture and ill-treatment suffered from psychological disorder, one third of the interviewed had bodily injuries. 3% of victims of torture or illtreatment had grave bodily injuries. There were also fatal cases [among those examined by the researchers]. There were suspiciously many cases of suicides committed in custody. The research showed that the perpetrators were mostly unpunished. The main reason for this was that the majority of victims of torture were not complaining to law enforcement bodies. Only 24% [of the interviewed] submitted such complaints. The main reasons for failure to complain were fear of reprisals (44,5%), lack of trust towards the law enforcement officials (29%), lack of knowledge of the relevant procedures (6,7%)....” 97. The World Report chapter on Tajikistan by Human Rights Watch released in January 2009, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “Actions in the Name of Countering Terrorism and Extremism Following a recommendation by the prosecutor general, the Supreme Court of Tajikistan designated Hizb ut-Tahrir, a group that supports the reestablishment of the Caliphate, or Islamic state, by peaceful means, an ""extremist"" organization. The government continued to arrest alleged Hizb ut-Tahrir members and convict them either of sedition or incitement to racial, ethnic, or religious hatred, often simply for possessing the organization's leaflets. ... Torture and Deaths in Custody Tajikistan's definition of torture does not comply fully with the UN Committee Against Torture's recommendations to the country in December 2006. In a positive move, in March 2008 the Criminal Procedure Code was amended to make evidence obtained under torture inadmissible in court proceedings. Experts agree that in most cases there is impunity for rampant torture in Tajikistan. In one of the few cases that reached the courts, two policemen in Khatlon province were convicted in August 2008 for ill-treating minors; one of the two received a fouryear prison sentence, and the other a suspended sentence. NGOs and local media reported at least three deaths in custody in 2008, including the death from cancer of the ex-deputy chair of the Party of Islamic Revival Shamsiddin Shamsiddinov. The party alleged his arrest in 2003 was politically motivated and claimed that his life could have been saved had he been allowed to undergo surgery. In an April 1, 2008 decision (Rakhmatov et al. v. Tajikistan) the UN Human Rights Committee found that Tajikistan violated the rights, including freedom from torture, of five applicants, two of them minors when they were arrested. Tajikistan failed to cooperate with the committee's consideration of the complaint. Similar violations were established in an October 30, 2008 decision (Khuseynov and Butaev v. Tajikistan)”. 98. In January 2010 the Human Rights Watch released its World Report 2010, where the chapter on Tajikistan, in so far as relevant, states: “Torture is routinely used by law enforcement officials, and the Tajik government continues to deny human rights groups access to places of detention. ... Torture Torture is practiced by law enforcement officers and within the penitentiary system in a culture of near-impunity. It is often used to extract confessions from defendants, who during initial detention are often denied access to family and legal counsel. To date the Tajik government has refused all requests from human rights groups to visit detention sites, interrogation rooms and prisons. Tajikistan's definition of torture does not fully comply with recommendations made to the country by the United Nations Committee against Torture in November 2006. In a small sign of a progress, local and international human rights groups recently completed a campaign to document instances of torture in Tajikistan, as part of a twoyear project funded by the European Union. That project, which was run in Tajikistan by the Bureau on Human Rights and the Rule of Law, determined that over the past two years there had been more than 90 cases of torture. Freedom of Religion ... There continued to be reports of the Tajik authorities prosecuting alleged members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an international Islamic organization that is banned in several countries in the region, and sentencing them to long prison terms on questionable evidence.” 99. The 2009 US Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices, released on 11 March 2010, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “The government's human rights record remained poor, and corruption continued to hamper democratic and social reform. The following human rights problems were reported: ... torture and abuse of detainees and other persons by security forces; impunity of security forces; denial of right to fair trial; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; prohibition of international monitor access to prisons; ... The law prohibits [cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment], but some security officials used beatings or other forms of coercion to extract confessions during interrogations, although the practice was not systematic. Officials did not grant sufficient access to information to allow human rights organizations to investigate claims of torture. In Sughd region, four suspects arrested in a murder case claimed investigators tortured them seeking to extract confessions. One suspect claimed an investigator threatened to 'ruin' his daughter if he did not confess to a crime. The same individual stated he lost toenails as a result of torture while in custody. The courts dismissed the individual's claim of torture, and he was convicted of murder and other crimes and sentenced to 30 years in prison. Several individuals held in Dushanbe city jails also claimed they were beaten while in custody. Articles in the criminal code do not specifically define torture, and the country's law enforcement agencies have not developed effective methods to investigate allegations of torture. According to a report during the year by Human Rights Watch, 'Experts agreed that in most cases there is impunity for rampant torture in Tajikistan'. In an April 2008 court decision (Rakhmatov et al. v. Tajikistan) the UN Human Rights Committee found that the government violated the human rights, including freedom from torture, of three adults and two minors. The committee also noted that the government failed to cooperate with the committee and that similar allegations were substantiated in an October 2008 court decision (Khuseynov and Butaev v. Tajikistan). Denial of access to detention centres impeded efforts to determine if any improvements had occurred since then. ... The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) continued to deny access to prisons or detention facilities to representatives of the international community and civil society seeking to investigate claims of harsh treatment or conditions. Some foreign diplomatic missions and NGOs were given access to implement assistance programs or carry out consular functions, but their representatives were limited to administrative or medical sections, and MOJ personnel accompanied them. The government did not sign an agreement with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to allow free and unhindered access to prisons and detention centres, and the ICRC's international monitoring staff has not returned to the country since 2007. Detainees and inmates described harsh and life-threatening prison conditions, including extreme overcrowding and unsanitary conditions. Disease and hunger were serious problems, but outside observers were unable to assess accurately the extent of the problems because authorities did not allow access to prisons. Organizations such as the UN Human Rights Council reported that infection rates of tuberculosis and HIV were significant and that the quality of medical treatment was poor. ... The government placed few checks on the power of prosecutors and police to make arrests. The criminal justice system operated under the criminal procedure code based on a 1961 Soviet law. Individuals reported that some prosecutors and courts pressed questionable criminal charges and that some officials influenced judges inappropriately to get convictions. In December the government approved a new criminal procedure code to replace the existing code in April 2010. ... Victims of police abuse may submit a formal complaint in writing to the officer's superior or the Office of the Ombudsman. Most victims chose to remain silent rather than risking retaliation by the authorities. ... By law prosecutors are empowered to issue arrest warrants, and there is no requirement for judicial approval of an order for pre-trial detention. Police may detain a suspect without a warrant in certain circumstances, but a prosecutor must be notified within 24 hours of arrest. After a warrant is issued, the police may hold a suspect 72 hours before arraignment. Defence advocates alleged that prosecutors often held suspects for longer periods and only registered the initial arrest when the suspect was ready to confess. Pre-trial detention may last as long as 15 months in exceptional circumstances. ... Prosecutors oversee pre-trial investigation and have the right to initiate criminal proceedings. Individuals have the right to an attorney upon arrest and the government must appoint lawyers for those who cannot otherwise afford one. In practice the government provided few attorneys for public defence, and these attorneys were generally ineffective. There is no bail system, although criminal detainees may be released conditionally and restricted to their place of residence pending trial. The typical length of pre-trial detention was two to three months. According to the law, family members are allowed access to prisoners only after indictment; officials occasionally denied attorneys and family members access to detainees. Authorities held detainees charged in crimes related to national security incommunicado for long periods without formally charging them. In January, after relatives of former citizen Muhammadi Salimzoda sought his whereabouts for five months, the SCNS admitted that Salimzoda had been in state custody the entire period. Salimzoda was sentenced to 29 years' imprisonment for espionage and attempting to overthrow the government, but he claimed security personnel obtained his confession to the crimes under physical and psychological duress. The government generally provided a rationale for arrests, although some detainees claimed that authorities falsified charges or inflated minor problems to make politically motivated arrests. Some police and judicial officials regularly accepted bribes in exchange for lenient sentencing or release. ... Authorities claimed that there were no political prisoners and that they did not make any politically motivated arrests. Opposition parties and local observers claimed the government selectively prosecuted political opponents. There was no reliable estimate of the number of political prisoners, but former opposition leaders claimed there were several hundred such prisoners held in the country, including former fighters of the UTO. In February Rustam Fayziev, deputy chairman of the unregistered Party of Progress, died in prison after four years of confinement for insulting and defaming President Rahmon in a 2005 unsent, unpublished letter. The government claimed his death was the result of natural causes. Muhammadruzi Iskandarov, head of the Democratic Party of Tajikistan and former chairman of Tojikgaz, the country's state-run gas monopoly, remained in prison following his unlawful extradition from Russia and 2005 conviction for corruption. Former interior minister Yakub Salimov remained in prison serving a 15-year sentence for crimes against the state and high treason following his 2005 closed trial.” 100. The chapter “Tajikistan” in the Amnesty International report “The State of the World's Human Rights”, released in May 2010, states, in so far as relevant: “The Government continued to exert tight control over the exercise of religion. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment by law enforcement officers continued. ... Torture and ill-treatment Report of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement officials continued, in particular, to extract confessions during the first 72 hours, the maximum period suspects could be held without charge. On 27 June, Khurshed Bobokalonov, a specialist in the Tajikistani Oncology Centre, dies after being arrested by the police. He had been walking along the street when the police stopped him and accused him of being drunk. He protested, and some 15 policemen bundled him into a police car. The Ministry of the Interior claimed that he died of a heart attack on the way to the police station. His mother reported injuries on her son's face and body, and on 22 July the Minister of the Interior announced an investigation into possible “death through negligence”. There was no public information about the progress of the investigation by the end of the year.”","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4']",[],[],[],[],1

HUNGARY,4,Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Deprivation of property),András Sajó;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Nebojša Vučinić;Peer Lorenzen,"5. The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Szolnok. 6. The applicant, a civil servant for more than thirty years, had been in the service of the Hungarian Tax Authority. On 31 March 2011 she was dismissed, with effect from 1 June 2011. Her dismissal was part of a wave of similar measures throughout the entire civil service. 7. On dismissal, the applicant was statutorily entitled to two months’ salary for April and May 2011, during which time she was exempted from working. In addition, she was to receive severance pay amounting to twelve months’ salary in application of section 19(2) of Act no. XXIII of 1992 on the Status of Civil Servants (see paragraph 8 below). These benefits were subsequently taxed at 98% in their part exceeding 3,500,000 Hungarian forints (HUF). The exceeding part was HUF 3,903,529, the tax amounting to HUF 3,825,458. This represented an overall tax burden of approximately 60% on the entirety of the severance, as opposed to the general personal income tax rate of 16% in the relevant period. The tax amount in question was never disbursed to the applicant, but was withheld by the employer and directly transferred to the tax authority on 8 June 2011. 8. Section 19 of Act no. XXIII of 1992 on the Status of Civil Servants provides as follows: “(1) A civil servant ... shall be entitled to severance if his service relationship is terminated by ordinary dismissal ... . (2) The amount of severance shall be, if the civil servant’s service has been at least: ... g) 20 years: eight months’ salary ... The amount of severance shall be increased by four months’ salary if the service relationship is terminated within the five-year period prior to the civil servant’s qualification for old-age pension [section 19/A § 1(a)] or anticipated old-age pension.” 9. On 22 July 2010 Parliament adopted Act no. XC of 2010 on the Adoption and Modification of Certain Economic and Financial Laws (“the Act”). The Act, which was published in the Official Gazette on 13 August 2010, introduced inter alia a new tax on certain payments to employees in the public sector whose employment was terminated. Consequently, severance pay and other payments related to the termination of employment exceeding HUF 2 million became subject to a 98% tax. However, income tax and social security contributions already paid could be deducted from the tax. Notwithstanding the limit of HUF 2 million, the statutory provisions on the sum of severance pay – in some cases amounting to twelve months’ remuneration – were not modified. The bill preceding the Act justified the tax with reference to public morals and the unfavourable budgetary situation of the country. 10. The Act entered into force on 1 October 2010; however, the tax was to be applied to the relevant revenues as from 1 January 2010. Simultaneously, the Constitution was also amended, establishing retroactive tax liability in respect of the given tax year concerning “any remuneration against good morals” paid in the public sector. 11. The Act was challenged before the Constitutional Court within the framework of an abstract ex post facto control. This court found the relevant provisions unconstitutional in decision no. 184/2010. (X.28.)AB on 26 October 2010. According to the Constitutional Court, revenues earned solely on the basis of relevant statutory provisions (that is, the overwhelming majority of the revenues concerned by the disputed legislation) could not be regarded as being against good morals, and therefore not even the constitutional amendment justified a retroactive 98% tax. The Constitutional Court pointed out that it reviewed the rate or amount of taxes only exceptionally; however, it held that a pecuniary burden was unconstitutional if it was of a confiscatory nature or its extent was clearly exaggerated, i.e. was disproportionate and unjustified. Considering also the “fifty-percent rule” (Halbteilungsgrundsatz) set out by the German Federal Constitutional Court – according to which the overall tax load on assets must be limited to 50-60% of the yield on those assets – the court found that the 98% tax was excessive and punitive, yet it equally applied to severance pay earned in a fully untainted manner. The tax was levied on or deducted from the revenues concerned even if their morally doubtful origin could not be established. The Constitutional Court annulled the relevant provisions retroactively, that is, from the day of the Act’s entry into force. It relied on the above arguments, rather than on considerations about the protection of property, to which its scrutiny did not extend in the case. 12. The Constitutional Court’s decision contained in particular the following considerations: “5.2. ... [The Act] applies to ... payments originating in unconditional statutory entitlements and defined by objective criteria, that is, to those ... received from any source specified in the Act and exceeding the [relevant] amount .... The Act does not apply only to budgetary institutions but to other, State-owned employers as well. The use of private resources depends on the citizens’ relatively free choices and autonomous decisions. However, decisions concerning public funds are different. [The impugned legislation] relates to public funds, and determines – at least indirectly – the use of public resources. 5.3. ... Depending on the circumstances, [the] 98% tax may apply to payments which derive from the obligatory application of cogent legal provisions. ... In these cases, the special tax does not function as a regulatory instrument, given its inescapable factual basis. Nor does it aim to prevent abusive payments; its purpose is rather to levy almost the entire income [in question] for the central budget. ... The volume of public duties is considered unconstitutional if they have a confiscatory nature or amount to an evidently excessive rate of the kind which can be regarded as disproportionate and unjustified. ... The material case concerns a substantial punitive tax which also applies to payments which are received, by virtue of law and within the limits of the proper exercise of rights, upon the termination of employment in the public sector. The Act would be applied also in cases where no infringement of law can be established in connection with the payments concerning the termination of a legal relation. It would deprive the taxable persons of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. ... To increase budgetary revenues and secure a general and proportionate distribution of public burden is only the secondary and eventual purpose of the legislator when introducing such a tax. The direct purpose of the legislator in this case is to set a certain barrier on incomes by using the means of tax law. However, imposing a tax or other similar duty is no constitutional means to achieve such purpose. Several constitutional instruments are at the disposal of the legislator to accomplish its objective. It may reduce or even abolish some State allowances falling under the scope of the Act for the future, or transform the allocation system so that in the future it should not be possible to acquire further entitlements to allowances above a certain limit. Nonetheless, the discretion of the legislator only prevails in the framework of international and European community law.” 13. Upon a new bill introduced on the same day as the date of the Constitutional Court’s decision, on 16 November 2010 Parliament re-enacted the 98 % tax with certain modifications, according to which this tax applied from 1 January 2005; however, for the majority of those affected (excluding some senior officials) it only applied to revenues above HUF 3.5 million. The new legislation was published in the Official Gazette of 16 November and entered into force on 30 December 2010. 14. At the same time, Parliament again amended the Constitution, allowing retroactive taxation going back five years. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court’s powers were limited: the amended articles of the Constitution contained a restriction on the Constitutional Court’s right to review legislation on budgetary and tax issues. This restriction – which has also been maintained in the new Basic Law in force from 1 January 2012 – allows for constitutional review only in respect of violations of the right to life and human dignity, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the rights related to Hungarian citizenship. 15. Upon a petition for an abstract ex post facto control, on 6 May 2011 the Constitutional Court annulled – notwithstanding its limited powers – the five-year retroactive application of the 98% tax in decision no. 37/2011(V.10.)AB, relying on the right to human dignity. However, the reasoning of the decision underlined that only the taxation of revenues gathered before the 2010 tax year constituted a violation of the right to human dignity. The Constitutional Court did not find unconstitutional as such the Act’s presumption that the relevant revenues infringed good morals; however, it ruled that this presumption should be susceptible to a legal challenge. In view of its limited jurisdiction, it did not consider the substantive aspects of the tax. 16. The Constitutional Court’s decision contained in particular the following considerations: “1. ... The Constitutional Court has held that the retroactive effect of the Act does not only apply to incomes earned contra bonos mores, but also to incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. Payments of statutory amounts [which have not been abolished] cannot be regarded as being contra bonos mores. As regards the prospective provisions of the Act, the Constitutional Court has pointed out that the tax in issue is also applicable to payments received legally and within the limits of proper exercise of rights upon termination of employment in the public sector, and that it deprives the persons concerned of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. However, in this case the legislator interpreted the “special rate” as an entire withdrawal of the income, by which it overstepped its constitutional mandate and breached the amended constitutional rule of distributing public burden. 2. In pursuit of decision [no. 184/2010 (X.28.)AB], Parliament amended the rules on the Constitutional Court’s competence as well as the provision of the Basic Law determining the distribution of public burden, and re-enacted the special tax. ... 2.2. ... [The new legislation] contains no reference to the notion “contra bonos mores”, and allows for retroactive law-making with regard to the fifth tax year in arrears as well as for [any] imposition falling short of [the total] deprivation of income. ... 4.1.1. ... The legal relations falling under the scope of the special tax are typically regulated by the so-called “legal status” Acts [i.e. the Acts concerning the legal status of civil servants]. [In this context, the] salary is specified by the so-called “pay scale”, which is independent from the parties and obligatory for them. [Moreover,] the personal scope of the special tax also includes employers and employees, mainly those who belong under the Labour Code, who can significantly influence the amount of the allowance received upon the termination of employment. ... In this respect, the special tax is a tax whose purpose is not to generate [State] revenue. It is, in this connection, a regulatory instrument. ... Certain taxes may serve not only the purpose of increasing State revenue, but also function as regulatory instruments. Secondarily, but not insignificantly, [this] taxation can be also seen as part of the State’s economic policy. In this regard the legislature is afforded an exceptionally broad constitutional margin of discretion. ... 4.1.4. ... The special tax is not a general income tax applicable to all types of income, but rather a particular tax levied on non-repetitive, non-regular payments which relate to certain factual circumstances (i.e. the termination of a legal relation) and which exceed a certain limit. ... Such a tax with ex nunc effect cannot be considered to violate the right to protection of human dignity or to constitute an improper interference by the State with individual autonomy. Taking into account its base, the incomes not belonging in that base and their amounts, the special tax cannot be considered as completely dispossessing the tax subjects. ... The individual’s acquisition of the income subject to the special tax is restricted by a public-law limitation originating in that tax ... 4.2.4. ... In case of misuse of public resources, the limitation on payments might even have retroactive effect, [under] section 70/I (2) of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has already emphasised in its decision [no. 184/2010 (X.28.)AB] that a retroactive special tax may be imposed on unfairly high payments, on certain types of severance pay or on compensation for significant periods of unused vacation time accumulated over years; the Act aiming at preventing abuses and endorsing the society’s sense of justice is not unconstitutional in itself, but must remain within the framework of the amended Constitution. 4.2.5. However, to impose tax on incomes [lawfully] acquired during the tax year ... cannot be considered as the implementation of the new paragraph (2) of section 70/I of the Constitution, but rather interference by a public authority with individual autonomy going to such lengths that cannot have constitutional justification, and therefore violates the taxpayers’ human dignity. ... The special tax does not provide for a fair and just assessment of individual circumstances; its retroactive rules apply to everyone [with two exceptions mentioned above] without differentiation. Nor does it take into account objective circumstances concerning a wide range of taxpayers, such as the economic crisis or emergency situations, which may disadvantageously influence the individuals’ circumstances. ...” 17. On 9 May 2011 Parliament again re-enacted the retroactive application of the 98% tax. The amendment to Act no. XC of 2010 was published in the Official Gazette on 13 May and entered into force on 14 May 2011. It provided that only relevant revenues earned after 1 January 2010 should be subject to the tax. The amended legislation did not contain any remedy available to those affected. 18. The Act, as in force as of 14 May 2011, provides (in sections 8-12/B) that the special tax rules are applicable to incomes received on 1 January 2010 or after. Incomes shall be subject to a 98% special tax where the private individual has worked at an economic operator or an organisation operating from public money, the payment is effected on account of the termination of the private individual’s work relationship, and the amount of the income exceeds HUF 3.5 (in certain cases 2) million. Incomes received between 1 January 2010 and 29 December 2010 were declared by private individuals by means of self-assessment, in tax returns submitted by 25 February or 10 May 2011 (depending on the taxpayer group). The tax was payable by the same dates. Members of Parliament, vice mayors and Members of the European Parliament declared their income earned in 2010 and subject to the special tax in a different manner, in a separate tax return submitted by 31 July 2011. They paid the special tax by the same date. Persons subjected to the payment of special tax declared their taxable incomes earned between 1 January 2011 and 13 May 2011 by way of tax returns submitted by 25 February or 20 May 2012 (depending on the taxpayer group), and paid the tax by the same dates. In all other cases, the special tax is deducted by the payment issuer as withholding tax, and the deduction is indicated in the private individual’s tax return for the given revenue year. Any charges paid by or deducted from the private individual including, in particular, personal income tax or individual contributions shall be regarded as tax advances paid on the special tax. 19. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides as follows: “1. The Union recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age, and in the case of loss of employment, in accordance with the rules laid down by Community law and national laws and practices.” The European Court of Justice held in Case C-499/08 Andersen v Region Syddanmark, [2010] ECR I-09343 as follows: “29. The aim pursued by the severance allowance of protecting workers with many years of service in an undertaking and helping them to find new employment falls within the category of legitimate employment policy and labour market objectives provided for in Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/78.” European Commission Recommendation of 30 April 2009 on remuneration policies in the financial services sector (2009/384/EC) provides as follows: “1. Excessive risk-taking in the financial services industry and in particular in banks and investment firms has contributed to the failure of financial undertakings and to systemic problems in the Member States and globally.... 5. Creating appropriate incentives within the remuneration system itself should reduce the burden on risk management and increase the likelihood that these systems become effective. Therefore, there is a need to establish principles on sound remuneration policies.” In the case Michel Bourgès-Maunoury, Marie-Louise Heintz v Direction des services fiscaux d’Eure-et-Loir concerning the compatibility with European Union primary law of a national provision on the procedure for calculating a wealth tax, Advocate General Cruz Villalón reiterated that the principle that rules governing tax law and the exercise of fiscal power must not have confiscatory effects is a “well-known and widely-recognised idea” (Case C558/10, Michel BourgèsMaunoury, Marie-Louise Heintz v. Direction des services fiscaux d’Eure-et-Loir 12 Dec 2011, OJ C-46, 12, Opinion of AG Villalón). 20. In a judgment of 22 June 1995, the Federal Constitutional Court held that, according to Article 14 of the Basic Law, the use of property served the purpose of private gain and the public good. In that sense, property tax, combined with other taxes, might take no more than 50% of the income from property (Halbteilungsgrundsatz). The overall tax burden should moreover not run counter to the principle of equality demanding the division of burden depending on the contributing capacity (BVerfG, 2 BvL 37/91, 22.6.1995). In its subsequent decision of 18 January 2006 (BVerfG, 2 BvR 2194/99, 18.01.2006), the Federal Constitutional Court found that even though tax load fell within the ambit of Article 14 of the Basic Law, that is, the protection of property, the overall burden through business and personal income tax, in the particular circumstances, did not infringe the complainant’s right to property. In the instant case the overall tax burden in business and personal income tax combined amounted to 57.58%. The Federal Constitutional Court noted in this regard that it was permissible to charge high income with higher tax burden, as long as the taxable person, after deduction of the relevant tax, disposed of a remaining income representing his private performance. 21. In decision no. 2007-555 DC (16 August 2007; Act pertaining to work, employment and purchasing power), the Conseil constitutionnel held as follows: “24o The requirement deriving from Article 13 of the declaration of 1789 would not be complied with if taxation were to be of a confiscatory nature or subjected a certain category of taxpayers to an excessive burden in comparison with their ability to pay taxes. The principle of the capping of the proportion of a tax household’s income allocated to paying direct taxes, far from infringing the principle of equality before public burden sharing, is intended to avoid a patent infringement of this same principle;” 22. The Federal Supreme Court held that a taxation scheme that is confiscatory in its effects and not limited in time would infringe the essence of the right to property (Decisions of the Federal Supreme Court, BGE 106 Ia 342, 349; BGE 128 II 112, 126). To date, the Federal Supreme Court has not found that any taxation scheme was confiscatory. Decision no. BGE 128 II 112, 126 contains the following passage: “10 bb) ... In taxation matters, however, it [the guarantee of property, as set out in Article 26 of the Federal Constitution] does not go beyond the prohibition of confiscatory taxation. Therefore, a tax to be levied may not damage the very essence of private property. It is the task of the legislative branch to preserve the substance of the taxpayer’s assets and to allow him the chance to create new ones. In fact, a tax rate expressed in percentages is not the only decisive criterion in order to determine whether a taxation scheme has a confiscatory effect. It is necessary to examine the burden of the imposition for a rather long period and by not taking into account extraordinary circumstances. In order to accomplish this, all specific facts must be taken into consideration: the length and the gravity of the interference as well as the accumulation with other taxes or charges and the possibility to shift the tax to another person ...”. Decision of the Federal Supreme Court no. 2P.139/2004 contains the following passage: “4.2 The Federal Supreme Court has held that it is not compatible with Article 26 of the Federal Constitution if an annuity for life, inherited by bequest, of initially CHF 2200 per month is – regardless of the ability to pay other taxes of the person in receipt of the pension –taxed at 55 % in total, in terms of inheritance and income taxes as well as other expenses, which (taking into account of the tax sum due for over CHF 200,000) were necessary for their financing (Decision P.1704/1984, published in: ASA 56 p. 439 et seq.). In that specific case the specific circumstances were relevant because the heir could not secure her own existence after paying the taxes for the annuity for life.” 23. In United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315 (1946) the Supreme Court dealt with the following problem: According to the provisions of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, after 15 November 1943 no salary or compensation was to be paid to certain individuals, who were then government employees, out of any moneys then or thereafter appropriated, except for services as jurors or members of armed forces unless they were prior to that date again appointed to jobs by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. In the background of the statute challenged lay the House of Representatives’ feeling that in the late 1930s many ‘subversives’ were occupying influential positions in the Government and elsewhere and that their influence must not remained unchallenged. In 1943 the respondents, Lovett, Watson and Dodd, were and had been for several years working for the Government. The Government agencies which had lawfully employed them were fully satisfied with the quality of their work and wished to keep them employed in their jobs. The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the provision challenged was not merely to cut off the petitioners’ compensation through regular disbursing channels, but permanently to bar them from government service and it was designed to force the employing agencies to discharge respondents and to bar their being hired by any other governmental agency. The Supreme Court reiterated that the Constitution barred such legislative acts by providing that “no Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed”. It found that the relevant provision was designed to apply to particular individuals and operated as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion from a chosen vocation. It ruled that this permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government was punishment of those individuals without a judicial trial and thus carried the usual characteristics of bills of attainder. The Supreme Court found that “legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are ‘bills of attainder’ prohibited by the Constitution”. The subject matter of the case Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960) was as follows: The petitioners (Armstrong and al.) furnished various materials to Rice for use in construction of boats. Upon Rice’s default, the Government exercised its option as to ten of the boat hulls still under construction and removed these properties to out-of-state naval shipyards for use in the completion of the boats. When the transfer occurred, the petitioners had not been paid for their materials and they were not paid afterwards, either. The petitioners therefore contended that they had liens. The Supreme Court held “that there was a taking of these liens for which just compensation is due under the Fifth Amendment. It is true that not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a ‘taking’ in the constitutional sense. This case and many others reveal the difficulty of trying to draw the line between what destructions of property by lawful governmental actions are compensable ‘takings’ and what destructions are ‘consequential’ and therefore not compensable... The Fifth Amendment’s guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. A fair interpretation of this constitutional protection entitles these lienholders to just compensation here.” In Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998) the Supreme Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act 1992 amounted to an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property. It held that the economic impact of the Act was substantial as to the petitioner, in that it required Eastern Enterprises to contribute large sums of money to a pension fund for employees employed in the 1950s and 1960s solely because those payments could not be allocated to other coal companies that were currently operating in the coal industry. The retroactive effect of the Act imposed a substantial economic injury on Eastern Enterprises that could not have been anticipated. Moreover, the challenged statute interfered with Eastern Enterprises’ expectations in that in 1987 the company sold off its remaining holdings in coal operations and completely quitted this industry. The statute’s requirement for Eastern Enterprises to undertake the obligation at issue clearly interfered with the expectations of Eastern when it sold off its interest in coal operations. Lastly, the nature of the government action was unusual because it retroactively applied a substantial economic burden on Eastern Enterprises. For the Supreme Court, the character of the government action was substantial and invasive. The balance of the factors resulted in the finding of an unconstitutional taking requiring just compensation.",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Benevento. 5. On 5 May 1987 Mr F. asked the Benevento District Court to order the applicant to pay him 73,934,495 Italian lire (38,183.98 euros (EUR)) for professional services. On 11 May 1987 the President of the Benevento District Court granted the application. The order was served on the applicant on 20 May 1987. 6. On 8 June 1987 the applicant challenged the order in the Benevento District Court. Preparation of the case for trial began on 24 September 1987. Of the twenty-nine hearings listed between 26 November 1987 and 16 October 1998 seven were adjourned by the court of its own motion, ten were devoted to organising expert evidence and supplementary findings and two were adjourned at the parties' request. 7. On 16 April 1999 the case was referred to the sezioni stralcio. Of the four hearings listed between 22 September 1999 and 8 February 2002 one was adjourned because the parties had not appeared and one was adjourned by the court of its own motion. 8. On 10 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Rome Court of Appeal under Law no. 89 of 24 March 2001, known as the “Pinto” Act, complaining of the excessive length of the above-described proceedings. The applicant asked the court to rule that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and to order the Italian Government to pay compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage sustained. The applicant claimed, inter alia, EUR 14,460.94 in pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. 9. In a decision of 21 June 2002, the text of which was deposited with the registry on 2 October 2002, the Court of Appeal found that a reasonable time had been exceeded. It dismissed the claim for pecuniary damages on the ground that the applicant had not provided any proof, awarded him EUR 2,000 on an equitable basis in compensation for non-pecuniary damage, EUR 700 for costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings before the European Court of Human Rights and EUR 900 for the costs and expenses incurred in the Pinto proceedings. 10. That decision was served on the authorities on 23 January 2003 and became binding on 24 March 2003. The applicant served the authorities with notice to comply on 15 October 2003. On 29 October 2003 the applicant lodged an application for seizure with the Rome judge responsible for enforcement proceedings and a hearing was to be held on 28 March 2004. 11. In a letter of 21 January 2003 the applicant informed the Court of the outcome of the domestic proceedings and asked it to resume its examination of his application. 12. The applicant did not indicate that he had appealed to the Court of Cassation.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
42,001-57923,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,1995,CASE OF McMICHAEL v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Violation of Art. 6-1 (second applicant);Violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 14+6-1;No violation of Art. 14+8;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Lack of jurisdiction (injunction to State),C. Russo;John Freeland,"6. The first applicant, Antony McMichael, and the second applicant, Margaret McMichael, live in Glasgow. They were born in 1938 and 1954 respectively and were married on 24 April 1990. 7. On 29 November 1987 the second applicant gave birth to a son, A. The first applicant, who was then known as Antony Dench, and the second applicant, were living together, although at that time each had their own home. At the time the second applicant expressly denied that the first applicant was A.’s father. The child’s father was not identified on the birth certificate. 8. The second applicant had a history of severe and recurrent mental illness, diagnosed as manic depressive psychosis. She had first been ill in or about 1973 and had thereafter been compulsorily admitted to psychiatric hospitals on a number of occasions. While she and A. were still in hospital after the birth, Dr R., the consultant psychiatrist who had treated her since 1985, found that she was suffering from a recurrence of her mental illness. He considered that if she were to go home with A., the child would be at risk. As a result, on 11 December 1987 the social work department of Strathclyde Regional Council (""the Council"") - this being the local government body having statutory responsibilities relating to the welfare of children in Glasgow and the surrounding area - applied for and were granted an order known as a ""place-of-safety order"", in accordance with section 37 (2) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 (""the 1968 Act"") (see paragraph 50 below for an explanation as to such orders). The effect of this order was to authorise the Council to keep A. in the hospital for a period not exceeding seven days. The second applicant was informed and advised to seek legal advice. 9. The Reporter to the Children’s Panel for Strathclyde Region, being of the view that A. might be in need of compulsory measures of care, arranged for a ""children’s hearing"" to be convened, in accordance with section 37 (4) of the 1968 Act (as to the functions of the Reporter and the nature of children’s hearings, see paragraphs 46, 47, 50 and 51 below). The ground of referral of the case to the children’s hearing was that ""a lack of parental care [was] likely to cause [A.] unnecessary suffering or seriously to impair his health or development"", this being one of the statutory grounds provided for under section 32 of the 1968 Act (see paragraph 48 below). In support of the ground of referral, the following statement of facts was given: ""(1) ... (2) That the parent suffers from a major psychiatric illness. (3) That the parent refuses to take medication to stabilise her condition when not an in-patient at psychiatric hospital. (4) That the parent has required to be admitted to psychiatric hospital on emergency basis ... on 5 June 1986, 5 December 1986 and 31 December 1986. (5) That due to her psychiatric condition the parent is unlikely to be able to care adequately for the child."" 10. At the children’s hearing on 17 December 1987 the chairman explained to the second applicant the reasons stated by the Reporter for the referral of the case. She indicated that she did not accept the ground of referral and, in particular, disputed paragraphs 2, 3 and 5 of the statement of facts. The children’s hearing accordingly instructed the Reporter to apply to the Sheriff Court (the local court) for a finding as to whether the ground of referral was established, in accordance with section 42 of the 1968 Act (see paragraph 54 below). The children’s hearing also issued a warrant under section 37 (4) of the 1968 Act for A.’s continued detention in a place of safety until 6 January 1988 (see paragraph 50 below). A subsequent warrant was granted by a further children’s hearing on 5 January 1988. 11. On 23 December 1987 A. was discharged from hospital and taken to foster parents at Greenock, twenty-four miles from Glasgow. He has remained with them since then. On the same day the second applicant discharged herself from hospital. Arrangements were made for her to be taken three times a week for access visits to A. at the foster home, under the supervision of the social work department. The first applicant, who also has a history of mental illness, was not included at this stage in the access arrangements. The principal reason for this was that the second applicant continued to deny that he was A.’s father and he did not himself make any claim to be the father. Other reasons were his aggressive and threatening attitude and his refusal to give information about his background. 12. The second applicant complained about the placement in Greenock and inadequacy of access arrangements. At first she accepted the exclusion of the first applicant, but she and the first applicant subsequently complained about that also. She failed to appear for four of the access visits between 31 December 1987 and 18 January 1988. 13. On 21 January 1988 the Reporter’s application for a finding on the ground of referral was heard in the Glasgow Sheriff Court. The second applicant was present and represented by a solicitor. The first applicant also attended. The Reporter led oral evidence from medical, nursery and social work witnesses, including Dr R. The first and second applicants both gave evidence. There was no documentary evidence before the court other than the ground of referral and statement of facts (referred to above in paragraph 9). At the conclusion of the hearing the Sheriff found the ground of referral established. He remitted the case to the Reporter for him to arrange a children’s hearing to dispose of the case. The second applicant did not appeal to the Court of Session (the supreme civil court in Scotland). On an application by the Reporter and after hearing submissions on behalf of the Reporter and the second applicant, the Sheriff also granted a warrant for A.’s continued detention in a place of safety for a further period not exceeding twenty-one days. 14. On 27 January 1988, the social work department held a meeting known as a ""child care review"", to consider the case. Both applicants were present. The consultant psychiatrist, Dr R., advised that the second applicant was seriously mentally ill but was unwilling to accept treatment. It was decided that access should be terminated, though this decision would be reviewed if the second applicant’s mental state improved. The first applicant had also requested access at the meeting, claiming for the first time that he was A.’s father. Access was refused since the second applicant continued to maintain that he was not the father. The social work department also took into account his aggressive and threatening attitude and his continuing refusal to provide information about himself. 15. On 4 February 1988 a children’s hearing was held to consider the need for compulsory measures of care for A. The second applicant attended, with the first applicant as her representative. The hearing had a number of documents before it, including a report of 28 January 1988 on the child compiled by the social work department, reviewing the history of the case and proposing that A. continue to reside in the foster home. In accordance with the relevant procedural rules (as contained in the Children’s Hearings (Scotland) Rules 1986 - ""the 1986 Rules""; see paragraph 57 below), these documents were not produced to the applicants, but the chairman informed them of their substance. The children’s hearing decided that A. did need compulsory measures of care. They therefore made a supervision requirement under section 44 (1) (a) of the 1968 Act, placing A. under the supervision of the Council subject to the condition that he reside with the foster parents in Greenock (as to supervision requirements, see paragraphs 58 to 60 below). The decision was based, inter alia, on the mental health of both applicants, their aggressive and hostile behaviour and the second applicant’s refusal to seek psychiatric help and treatment. This decision did not make any provision as to access. In such circumstances the presumption is that parents will be given reasonable access, subject to section 20 (1) of the 1968 Act which empowers a local authority to deny access where necessary for the child’s welfare. 16. On 6 February 1988 the second applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, initially as a voluntary patient and, as from 10 February, on an involuntary basis. She returned home in June 1988. 17. The second applicant (while in psychiatric hospital) appealed to the Sheriff Court against the decision of the children’s hearing. All the documents that had been before the children’s hearing were lodged with the Sheriff Court. It would appear that, in accordance with the normal procedure (as to which, see paragraph 61 below), they were not made available to the second applicant. She attended the appeal hearing on 29 February 1988, accompanied by two nurses. She was obviously under heavy sedation and was unrepresented. Following discussion, the Sheriff enquired whether she would prefer to ask for a review by a children’s hearing of the supervision requirement, rather than pursue her appeal. The second applicant agreed. The appeal was accordingly held to have been abandoned. 18. A review was held by the social work department on 27 April 1988. Both applicants attended, the second applicant having been allowed home on leave from the psychiatric hospital. In view of the second applicant’s improved mental state, it was decided to grant her supervised access to A. By this time, the second applicant had agreed that the first applicant was A.’s father. On 18 February 1988 his name had been added to the birth certificate. This did not, however, give him parental rights (as to which, see paragraph 43 below). At the review, the Council decided not to grant him access until he gave them information about his background, which he had so far refused to do. Visits by the second applicant to A. at the foster home, under the supervision of a social worker, began on 26 May 1988 and continued until September 1988. 19. On 24 August 1988, solicitors acting for the first applicant applied to the Scottish Legal Aid Board for legal aid for an action against the Council in the Court of Session to obtain custody of A. or, failing that, access to him. The Board refused legal aid on the basis that it was unreasonable that he should receive legal aid in the particular circumstances and that it had not been shown that there was a probable cause of action. Counsel then advised the first applicant that the proposed action was incompetent and that it would be appropriate to pursue the question of access by seeking a children’s hearing to review the supervision requirement. 20. On 20 September 1988 the social work department held a further child care review. Neither applicant attended but the second applicant was represented by a clergyman. The department had previously held meetings with the first applicant to obtain background information about him and, with his consent, made inquiries with his doctor and the police. It was decided to allow both applicants access of three supervised visits per week at a special centre and to give assistance to them in learning parenting skills. The position was to be reassessed after three months. Access at the centre began on 4 October 1988. 21. On 13 October 1988 the children’s hearing held a review of the supervision requirement. The second applicant was present and the first applicant attended as her representative. The hearing had before it a report by the social work department dated 20 September 1988, updating information on A. The report also contained a statement that the second applicant was refusing to take the medication prescribed for her, an account of the proposed arrangements for access and a recommendation that the supervision requirement should continue pending assessment of the proposed access for the next three months. In accordance with the relevant procedural rules (see paragraph 57 below), this report was not disclosed to the applicants, though the chairman informed them of its substance. The applicants had submitted a statement maintaining that in their view the ground of referral was not justified, as they had never had an opportunity to show that they could care for A. The children’s hearing decided to continue the supervision requirement and to approve the access proposals. The hearing considered that only time would show if A.’s return to the care of the applicants was a viable prospect and that the second applicant’s mental health should be closely monitored. The second applicant did not appeal to the Sheriff Court. 22. Between 4 October and 19 December 1988, the applicants made approximately twenty-three access visits to A. The social workers did not consider the visits to be a success. In reports dated 22 November 1988 by a health visitor and 23 November by a medical officer, it was stated that the applicants frequently argued before A. and displayed aggression to the staff, with the result that they were excluded from two child care centres. They appeared to be unable to accept or follow advice on child care. 23. On 19 December 1988 a child care review was held, at which the applicants were present. The meeting noted that no obvious progress had been made in the applicants’ ability to care for A. It was decided to terminate access visits in view of concern about the long-term effects on A. if access were to continue without any real prospect of his returning to the care of his natural parents. It was also decided to investigate the option of freeing A. for adoption. The applicants appealed internally to the District Manager of Social Services, who confirmed the decision by letter of 28 December 1988 in which he recommended them to obtain legal advice. 24. Following a request by the second applicant, a children’s hearing carried out a review of the supervision requirement on 20 June 1989. The second applicant was present with the first applicant as her representative. The Reporter provided the hearing with a further report by the social work department, updating the information on A. It described the problems experienced during the access period, and reported that A. was happy and developing well in his foster home and that prospective adopters were being sought. Also presented to the hearing were the documents that had been before previous hearings. The applicants asked for access to be re-established. The hearing considered that there might be a conflict of interest between the second applicant and A. They therefore adjourned the hearing to allow for the appointment of a ""safeguarder"", that is an independent person to represent the interests of the child (as to which, see paragraph 53 below). 25. The safeguarder, once appointed, interviewed the applicants, the social workers, the foster parents and the police. His report of 18 August 1989 stated, amongst other things, that A. was being adequately cared for by the foster parents and that it was desirable that the second applicant should obtain a doctor’s opinion on her present psychiatric condition. 26. The adjourned children’s hearing reconvened on 5 September 1989. The applicants were present, the second applicant being represented by a solicitor. In accordance with the relevant procedural rules (see paragraph 57 below), the safeguarder’s report and the other documents before the hearing were not disclosed to the applicants, but the chairman informed them of the substance. Also before the hearing were written submissions by the applicants stating their ability to care for A. and the unfairness of judging them on the basis of three months’ intensive access. The safeguarder attended the hearing and confirmed his view that A.’s best interests would be served by his remaining in care. The hearing concluded that the supervision requirement should continue and that there was nothing in what they had heard to convince them that they should grant access. They did not take up a suggestion by the second applicant’s solicitor to grant a further adjournment in order to obtain an independent psychiatric report on the second applicant. 27. The second applicant appealed to the Sheriff Court on the grounds that: (a) the applicants had not been informed of the substance of the documents produced at the hearing; (b) the refusal of access was based on inadequate information, in particular the lack of up-to-date information as to the second applicant’s mental health; and (c) the refusal to adjourn the hearing for the purpose of obtaining a psychiatric report on the second applicant’s current mental health was manifestly unreasonable. In the event ground (a) was withdrawn. At the appeal hearing on 4 October 1989 the Sheriff decided that it would have been appropriate to obtain a psychiatric report. He therefore allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the children’s hearing. 28. In the meantime, a psychiatric report, dated 29 September 1989, had been produced at the request of the second applicant’s solicitors. This report stated that the second applicant suffered from a recurrent mental illness, which was however in remission and which, if it recurred, would respond satisfactorily to treatment as in the past. The psychiatrist considered that access should be re-established and that A. could eventually be returned to the applicants. 29. A children’s hearing was held on 12 December 1989 to reconsider the case, as directed by the Sheriff (see paragraph 27 above). The hearing was adjourned at the request of the solicitor representing the second applicant, in order to allow the psychiatrist to submit a fuller report. 30. A children’s hearing was held on 9 January 1990, but neither applicant attended or was represented. The hearing was told that the second applicant had been declared insane and admitted to a psychiatric hospital. A further hearing was held on 18 January 1990. Neither applicant attended or was represented. The hearing concluded that the second applicant was not well enough to have access to A. and that they could not see any future for A. with her. A condition was added to the supervision requirement that there be no access by the second applicant. The second applicant did not appeal to the Sheriff Court. 31. On 1 February 1990 the Council lodged with the Sheriff Court a petition to free A. for adoption. 32. The applicants were married on 24 April 1990. The first applicant thereby obtained parental rights in respect of A. (as to which, see paragraphs 42 and 43 below). 33. The petition was heard between 18 June 1990 and 27 July 1990. The applicants, as parents, refused to give their consent to adoption. They were present at the hearing. The first applicant conducted his own case, whereas the second applicant was represented by a solicitor. The documentary evidence before the court had been disclosed to the applicants. Witnesses were heard. The applicants had the opportunity to cross-examine all witnesses led by the Council, as well as to lead their own evidence. 34. The Sheriff delivered his judgment on 14 October 1990, the second applicant having in the meantime been re-admitted to hospital on 12 August. He decided that the applicants were withholding their consent unreasonably and that, accordingly, their consent should be dispensed with. He therefore granted the order freeing A. for adoption. His judgment contained a detailed description of the second applicant’s history of mental illness and of the problems that had occurred during access visits. His findings included the following: ""Mrs McMichael is incapable of having permanent care of the child [A.] because of the severity and unpredictability of her illness. When she is actively ill it would be unsafe for the child to be in her care. ... The natural parents have no understanding of what is meant by loving and caring for a child and have demonstrated an inability either to learn such skills, or to want to learn them. It is in the interests of the child’s welfare that he be freed for adoption. The natural parents are both emotionally and intellectually incapable of giving the child a secure and stable environment. If he were in their care he would be liable to suffer emotional deprivation and, because of their inability physically to care for him, could be in situations of danger."" The Sheriff concluded: ""In my view, there is no escaping from the conclusion that both these parents are withholding their agreement unreasonably. They are withholding their agreement because they are not parents who have begun to demonstrate their capacity to have custody. Mrs McMichael suffers from a grave mental illness which may at any time, unless appropriate medical treatment is taken, incapacitate her from looking after, not only a child, but herself. Even when her illness is not to the degree at which hospitalisation is required, she has been demonstrated as incapable of the most elementary physical and emotional capacities in parenting. The one capacity she does have, I accept, is the desire to be a parent, to have the child, but the accomplishment of that ambition is, I fear, demonstrated to be beyond her. The incapacity of the father to behave normally as a parent to the child is established by the evidence of Mrs [K. (the health visitor)] and Mrs [M. (from the social work department)], whose testimonies support the findings in fact I have made relating to access visits ..."" 35. In December 1990 the applicants appealed to the Court of Session against the Sheriff’s decision. 36. The applicants were granted legal aid. Counsel and solicitors’ advice was that an appeal had no prospects of success at all and should be abandoned. The applicants did not accept this advice and continued with the appeal, without legal assistance. 37. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Session on 1 November 1991. The court held that the Sheriff was justified in concluding that, because of the mental health of the second applicant and the first and second applicants’ lack of understanding how to care properly for a child, it would have been contrary to the best interests of A. to return him to the applicants’ custody. 38. In the meantime, on 18 July 1991, a children’s hearing had decided that the supervision requirement should continue. A similar decision was made subsequently by another children’s hearing on 9 June 1992. 39. At a children’s hearing held on 4 May 1993 it was announced that the foster parents with whom A. had been living since 23 December 1987 intended to adopt him. The children’s hearing decided that the supervision requirement should continue, with a condition that A. should reside with the foster parents. 40. On 25 May 1993 the application by the foster parents to adopt A. was granted by the Sheriff. The effect of the adoption order was to vest in the adoptive parents all parental rights and duties relating to A. 41. On 21 September 1993 a children’s hearing decided that the supervision requirement should be terminated, as A. had been adopted and all reports on his welfare were favourable. 42. Under Scots law the nature of the rights enjoyed by parents in relation to their children is governed by the common law. In respect of girls under 12 and boys under 14, parents enjoy, inter alia, (a) the right of tutory, which can be described as the right to administer the child’s property and to act legally on behalf of the child; (b) the right of custody, which can be described as the right of the parent to have the child living with him or her, or otherwise to negotiate the child’s residence and to control the child’s day-to-day upbringing; (c) the right to access. 43. The position as to the persons who may exercise parental rights is regulated by the Law Reform (Parent and Child) (Scotland) Act 1986 (""the 1986 Act""). In general the 1986 Act abolished the legal distinctions between children born in and out of wedlock. However, in relation to parental rights a distinction persists, as appears from section 2 (1) which provides: ""(a) a child’s mother shall have parental rights whether or not she is or has been married to the child’s father; (b) a child’s father shall have parental rights only if he is married to the child’s mother or was married to her at the time of the child’s conception or subsequently."" Section 2 (1) is in turn subject to section 3, which enables any person claiming an interest to make an application to court for an order relating to parental rights (subsection (1)). The court, which is bound to regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration, may not make such an order unless satisfied that to do so would be in the interests of the child (subsection (2)). The natural father of a child born out of wedlock (who is not automatically entitled under section 2 (1)) may obtain parental rights (including tutory, custody or access) under this procedure by applying to either the Court of Session or the local Sheriff Court. Where the mother consents, the matter will be dealt with expeditiously. 44. The arrangements in Scotland for dealing with children who may need compulsory measures of care are set out in Part III of the 1968 Act, as supplemented by subordinate legislation and, in particular, the 1986 Rules governing conduct of children’s hearings. 45. Under section 20 of the 1968 Act the local authority (in the present case, Strathclyde Regional Council) has a general responsibility for promoting social welfare in its area. More specifically, it has the duty to inquire into and tell the Reporter of cases of children who may need compulsory measures of care, to provide reports on children for children’s hearings and to implement supervision requirements imposed by children’s hearings. 46. The Reporter is appointed under section 36 of the 1968 Act by the local authority. Though employed by the local authority, he is expected to exercise his judgment independently and is separate from the local authority’s social work department. He may not be removed from office without the consent of the Secretary of State. His duties include deciding whether a case should be referred to a children’s hearing and arranging such hearings when they are necessary. 47. Children’s hearings decide whether a child requires compulsory measures of care and, if so, which measures are appropriate. Pursuant to section 34 of the 1968 Act, a children’s hearing consists of a chairman and two other members drawn from the children’s panel. The Secretary of State appoints a children’s panel for each local authority area. The members hold office for such period as the Secretary of State specifies; they may be removed by him at any time, but only with the consent of the most senior judge in Scotland, the Lord President of the Court of Session (section 33 of and Schedule 3 to the 1968 Act, and section 7 (1) of the Tribunals and Enquiries Act 1992). In practice members are initially appointed for a period of two years and are then usually reappointed for a further period, normally of five years. They would be removed only in wholly exceptional circumstances. Under domestic law a children’s hearing is regarded as a tribunal. It comes under the statutory system applicable to tribunals in Scotland (paragraph 61 of Schedule 1 to the Tribunals and Inquiries Act 1992). Its members are considered to enjoy judicial immunity from proceedings for wrongful detention and defamation, in the same way as judges of the lower courts. 48. The children’s hearing may only consider the case of a child where it has been referred to them by the Reporter and where certain ""grounds of referral"" are established, either by agreement with the child and his parent or by a decision of the Sheriff Court. The grounds, as set out in section 32 of the 1968 Act, include the following: ""(c) lack of parental care is likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or seriously to impair his health or development."" Thus, in the absence of agreement, a decision by a judge on the grounds of referral, after hearing appropriate evidence, is essential before the children’s hearing can consider the case. 49. The Sheriff, that is any judge of the local Sheriff Court, has the following main roles in the process: (a) to grant a warrant for continued detention of a child in a place of safety, pending a hearing, in certain circumstances; (b) to adjudicate on whether the grounds of referral to the children’s hearing are established, where the child or his parent does not accept them; (c) to hear appeals against decisions of children’s hearings. 50. As an urgent measure to protect a child before he or she can be brought before a children’s hearing, a person may be authorised by a judge to take a child to ""a place of safety"", as defined in the 1968 Act, in cases where there is believed to be lack of parental care (sections 37 (2) and 94 (1) of the 1968 Act). Such detention may not in any case last more than seven days. The Reporter must be notified immediately. If he then considers that compulsory care may be needed, he must arrange a children’s hearing to consider the case (section 37 (4)). If the children’s hearing cannot dispose of the case, they may issue a warrant, renewable once, requiring detention for up to twenty-one days (section 37 (4) and (5)). Thereafter the Reporter may ask the Sheriff for a warrant for further detention for a period of up to twenty-one days (section 37 (5A)). The child and his or her parents have a right to be heard before any such warrant is issued by a children’s hearing or a Sheriff. 51. The Reporter is under a duty to notify the parents of a child of a children’s hearing giving at least seven days’ notice. He also must provide before the first hearing a statement of the grounds of referral. He must also request from the local authority a report on the child and his or her social background, and the local authority must supply it (section 39 (4) of the 1968 Act). 52. A parent has the right to attend at all stages of a children’s hearing. ""Parent"" excludes the father of a child born out of wedlock but includes a person who has been granted parental rights under section 3 of the 1986 Act (sections 4 (1) and 30 (2) of the 1968 Act). A parent may be represented by any person of his or her choice (Rule 11 of the 1986 Rules). 53. Where the chairman of the children’s hearing considers that there is a conflict of interest between child and parent, he has the power to appoint a person known as a safeguarder to represent the child (section 34A of the 1968 Act). 54. At the first children’s hearing it must be ascertained if the grounds of referral are accepted by the child or his or her parent. If both child and parent accept, the hearing may proceed. If not, the hearing must direct the Reporter to apply to the Sheriff Court for a decision as to whether the grounds are established. Such application must be made within seven days and heard within twenty-eight days of its being lodged. The parents may appear as parties and be represented. The hearing is conducted in chambers, that is in private, in the interest of the child. Following the hearing, the Sheriff may either discharge the referral or, where he is satisfied that the grounds are established, remit the case to the Reporter. The Reporter will then make arrangements for a further children’s hearing for consideration and determination of the case (section 42 (6) of the 1968 Act). 55. At this stage, after discussing the case with the child, the parent or parents, any safeguarder and any representative attending the hearing, the children’s hearing must consider what arrangements would be in the best interests of the child (section 43 of the 1968 Act). They may, amongst other things, (1) decide that no further action is required and discharge the referral; (2) adjourn the case pending further investigations; (3) if they consider that the child is in need of compulsory measures of care, make a supervision requirement (as to which, see paragraph 58 below). 56. Before the conclusion of the hearing the chairman must inform the child, parent or parents, safeguarder (if any) and representatives (if attending the hearing) of the decision of the children’s hearing, the reasons for the decision, the right of the child or parent to appeal to the Sheriff against the decision and the right of the child and parent to receive a statement in writing of the reasons for the decision. Such a written statement must then be given if requested. Any parent, child or safeguarder who did not attend must be notified in writing of the decision, the right to receive a statement of reasons and the right to appeal (Rules 19 (4) and 20 of the 1986 Rules). 57. Children’s hearings are required to consider any relevant information made available to them (Rule 19 (2) (a) of the 1986 Rules). Apart from the statement of grounds of referral, this information (which would include any report, document or information submitted by the Reporter) is not usually supplied to the child or his parents. However, the chairman is required at the hearing to inform the child and his parents of the substance of such reports, documents or information if it appears to him that this is material to the manner in which the case should be disposed of and that its disclosure would not be detrimental to the interests of the child (Rule 19 (3) of the 1986 Rules). 58. Supervision requirements are the orders of the children’s hearing imposing compulsory measures of care. One kind of requirement that may be ordered is to submit to supervision in accordance with such conditions as the children’s hearing may impose, which may include a condition that the child reside in a particular place other than a residential establishment - for example, with foster parents (section 44 (1) (a) and (b) of the 1968 Act). A supervision requirement makes the local authority responsible for the care of the child in accordance with the requirement and gives them the necessary powers to exercise this responsibility. It does not, however, formally vest in them any parental rights of custody and does not take away parental rights. Those rights are subject to the supervisory requirements and, so far as inconsistent with those requirements, they cannot be exercised. Thus, the right of custody cannot be exercised where a supervision requirement has required a child to live in foster care. The Court of Session has indicated in the case of Aitken v. Aitken ([1978] Session Cases 297) that while such a supervision requirement subsists it would be possible for them to award a person custody of the child, but this award would have effect subject to the supervision requirement and the person could not exercise actual custody while the supervision requirement subsisted. As regards access, the children’s hearing is entitled to attach conditions as to access when making or continuing a supervision requirement (see Kennedy v. A. [1986] Scots Law Times 358). In the absence of any express condition, the parents will be given reasonable access. However, a local authority has the competence to terminate access where that is appropriate in pursuance of their duty under section 20 of the 1968 Act (see paragraph 45 above). The Court of Session has made it clear, in the case of Dewar v. Strathclyde Regional Council ([1984] Session Cases 102), that the courts will not adjudicate on questions of access between the parents and the local authority. If a parent is dissatisfied with the decision of a local authority as to access, it is appropriate for him or her to apply to a children’s hearing to regulate the matter by attaching a condition as to access to the supervision requirement. An appeal to the courts will then lie against the decision of the children’s hearing. 59. A parent has the right to request a review of a supervision requirement every six months after the last review (section 48 (4) of the 1968 Act) and can use this right to obtain a ruling on access. 60. The 1968 Act prescribes that a child should not continue to be subject to a supervision requirement for any longer than is necessary for his or her interest. The requirement must be reviewed by a children’s hearing - (a) at any time if the local authority consider that it should cease to have effect or be varied; (b) within one year, otherwise it will cease automatically to have effect; (c) at the request of the child or his or her parent, after the expiry of these periods - (i) three months from imposition of the requirement; (ii) three months from any variation of the requirement of review; (iii) six months from any other review (section 48 (4) of the 1968 Act). The Reporter must make the necessary arrangements for such revision hearings. On review the children’s hearing may terminate, continue or vary the requirement (sections 47 (1) and 48 of the 1968 Act). (h) Appeal against a decision of a children’s hearing 61. Within three weeks of a decision of a children’s hearing a child or parent or both may appeal against it to the Sheriff (section 49 (1) of the 1968 Act). This applies to all decisions. The Reporter has the duty to ensure that all reports and statements available to the children’s hearing along with reports of the proceedings of the children’s hearings and their reasons for their decisions are lodged with the clerk to the Sheriff Court. These documents are not made available to the parents as a matter of practice. The appeal is heard in chambers, in the interest of the child. The Sheriff must first hear the appellant or his representative and any safeguarder appointed. Where an irregularity in the conduct of the case is alleged, unless the facts are admitted by the Reporter, the Sheriff must hear evidence tendered by or on behalf of the appellant and the Reporter as to the irregularity. The Sheriff will then proceed to question, if he thinks fit, the Reporter and the authors or compilers of any reports and statements before him. He can call for further reports and statements where he thinks that this may help him. The child and parents and safeguarder are normally entitled to be present throughout. 62. The Sheriff will allow the appeal if he finds that there was a flaw in the procedure adopted by the children’s hearing, or that the children’s hearing did not give proper consideration to some factor in the case. Where he decides the appeal has failed, he confirms the decision of the children’s hearing. Where he allows the appeal, he may act as follows: (a) where the appeal is against a warrant for detention, he may recall the warrant; (b) in any other case, he has the choice of remitting the case to the children’s hearing for reconsideration or else of discharging the child from any further proceedings arising from those grounds of referral (section 49 (5) of the 1968 Act). 63. Pending an appeal, the child or his parents may make an application to a children’s hearing for suspension of the supervision requirement in question. The Reporter must then arrange for a hearing, which may grant or refuse the application (section 49 (8) of the 1968 Act). 64. The legislation governing adoption procedure is the Adoption (Scotland) Act 1978 (""the 1978 Act""). 65. Under the 1978 Act an order declaring the child free for adoption may be made by the Court of Session or Sheriff Court. The procedure of freeing for adoption makes it possible for the child to live with the prospective adopters in the period prior to adoption without the risk of his or her being reclaimed by the natural parents. Before making the order the court must be satisfied as regards each parent or guardian of the child that either (a) he or she freely, and with full understanding of what is involved, agrees generally and unconditionally to the making of an adoption order; or (b) his or her agreement to making the adoption order should be dispensed with on a number of specified grounds, which include the ground that the parent or guardian is withholding agreement unreasonably (section 16 (2) of the 1978 Act). For the purposes of the 1978 Act the natural father of a child born out of wedlock would not be a ""parent"" or ""guardian"" except where he has subsequently married the mother or has a parental-rights order in his favour. The effect of an order freeing the child for adoption is to vest parental rights and duties in the adoption agency (that is, a local authority or an approved adoption society) and to extinguish existing parental rights. After freeing for adoption, the child will normally live for a time with the prospective adopters and then they will seek an adoption order. 66. An order of the Sheriff Court freeing a child for adoption is subject to appeal to the Court of Session. On such an appeal the Court of Session can decide on the whole merits of the action. The Court of Session will normally proceed on the basis of the Sheriff’s findings of fact but is not obliged to do so. It may, where appropriate, take evidence itself or remit the case to the Sheriff with instructions as to how he should proceed.","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],"['14', '6', '8']",['6-1'],[],1

44,001-58372,ENG,TUR,GRANDCHAMBER,1999,CASE OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY PARTY (ÖZDEP) v. TURKEY,1,Preliminary objection dismissed (Article 34 - Victim);Violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of association);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed (Article 41 - Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction),Luzius Wildhaber;Paul Mahoney,"8. The Freedom and Democracy Party (ÖZDEP) was founded on 19 October 1992. Its constitution was lodged with the Ministry of the Interior the same day. Its programme included the following passages. “... Following the war of ‘Liberation’ waged jointly by Kurds, Turks and other national minorities, the Sultanate was abolished in Turkey and the Republic proclaimed. The sole aim of the Republic has been to establish national sovereignty. Efforts to unite Turkey with Europe have come to nothing. Turkey has not succeeded in lifting itself out of mediocrity. From the earliest days of the Republic, certain parties have had a monopoly on power along with the collaboration of civil and military bureaucrats. In order to preserve that monopoly, the policy of those in power has been to refuse to recognise the existence of the Kurdish people and to ignore its most legitimate rights. The dominant ‘Turkish’ philosophy has been maintained up to the present day, overriding the most natural rights and claims of the Kurdish people, by means of militaristic and chauvinistic propaganda and a policy of exile and destruction. State policy, based on a capitalist system designed to oppress minorities – particularly Kurdish minorities, but even Turkish ones – has been pursued in the name of modernisation and westernisation. Owing to this policy, which colours the political, economic and social aspects of Turkey’s territorial integrity, there is no possibility of this monopoly of State power being brought to an end. That power runs counter to the interests of the vast majority of the population. It uses force to impose the present situation on the people in order to preserve its economic interests. Thus, it blocks the way to any democratic process aimed at protecting the interests of Turkish and Kurdish workers. The Freedom and Democracy Party proposes to create a system ruled by peace and fraternity in which our peoples will be entitled to self-determination. The Freedom and Democracy Party uses political, democratic and ideological means to combat all fascist, fundamentalist, chauvinistic and racist movements or organisations hindering solidarity, unity and brotherhood between peoples. Both in domestic and foreign policy, the aim of the Freedom and Democracy Party is to protect the interests of our peoples and those of all workers. ÖZDEP is the guarantor of the cultural, occupational, economic and political values of the various national or religious minorities and of every socio-professional category. It seeks recognition of the right to form a political party. Our Party will guarantee the religious and national minorities the right to worship as they please, to practise their religion freely, to freedom of thought and to respect for their customs, cultures and languages. Every individual will be entitled to use the media, especially radio and television. ÖZDEP has proposals on how to determine and define the prerequisites for establishing a social order encompassing the Turkish and Kurdish peoples. ÖZDEP regards our peoples as the sole owners of the country’s wealth, natural wealth and mineral resources. ÖZDEP supports the just and legitimate struggle of the peoples for independence and freedom. It stands by them in this struggle. Our Party proposes the creation of a democratic assembly of representatives of the people elected by universal suffrage. This assembly will represent the interests of the Turkish people, the Kurdish people and any other minority. This popular and democratic assembly will have the same powers as the current legislature and will be the guarantor of our peoples’ national sovereignty. The media will be the moving force for the consolidation of fraternity and friendship between peoples. They will encourage a better approach to different cultures and languages and will guarantee the national identity of each sector of the population. They will be responsible for ensuring that the political, economic, social and cultural rights of the peoples are recognised. There will be no government interference in religious affairs, which will be placed in the hands of the relevant institutions. In order to preserve the right to self-determination of oppressed peoples, our Party will outlaw any form of cultural, military, political or economic aggression. The Freedom and Democracy Party is campaigning for the voluntary unification of the Kurdish and Turkish peoples, who participated in the foundation of the country. The Freedom and Democracy Party considers that there can be democracy only if the Kurdish problem is solved. This problem concerns every Turk and Kurd who supports freedom and democracy. The Freedom and Democracy Party favours a peaceful and democratic solution to the Kurdish problem, subject to the strict application of international instruments such as the Helsinki Final Act, the European Convention on Human Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Freedom and Democracy Party will fully respect the Kurdish people’s right to self-determination so that a democratic solution based on the self-determination and equality of peoples can be found. Currently, our legislation and the manner in which the legal system operates are inherently undemocratic, contrary to fundamental human rights and freedoms and based on class interests. They deny the Kurdish people an identity and forbid any form of workers’ organisation or association. They are racist and retrograde. An order will be established permitting the Turkish and Kurdish peoples and the minorities to develop and enjoy their particular cultures freely. Each people will be entitled to education in its mother tongue, that being an essential prerequisite for the development of a people and a nation. Everyone will have the right to basic education in his mother tongue. The education system from primary school to university will be based on education in one’s mother tongue. A person’s mother tongue shall be given precedence in court proceedings ...” 9. On 29 January 1993, Principal State Counsel at the Court of Cassation (“Principal State Counsel”) applied to the Turkish Constitutional Court to have ÖZDEP dissolved on the grounds that it had infringed the principles of the Constitution and the Law on the regulation of political parties. He considered that the content and aims set out in the party’s programme sought to undermine the territorial integrity and secular nature of the State and the unity of the nation. 10. On 25 February 1993 the President of the Constitutional Court sent Principal State Counsel’s application to the Chairman of ÖZDEP inviting him to lodge his preliminary observations in defence. 11. On 29 March 1993 ÖZDEP’s lawyers filed preliminary written observations and requested a hearing. They argued, inter alia, that the Law on the regulation of political parties contained provisions that were contrary to the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. They also maintained that dissolving the party would infringe the provisions of international instruments such as the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris for a New Europe. They submitted that it was unacceptable to force a political party, on pain of being dissolved, to promote an ideology which conformed to the Turkish Constitution. 12. On 30 April 1993, while the Constitutional Court proceedings were still pending, a meeting of the founding members of ÖZDEP resolved to dissolve the party. 13. On 11 May 1993 Principal State Counsel lodged his submissions on the merits of the case with the Constitutional Court. Since ÖZDEP had gone into voluntary dissolution, it did not file any submissions on the merits. 14. On 14 July 1993 the Constitutional Court made an order dissolving ÖZDEP, notably on the ground that its programme was apt to undermine the territorial integrity of the State and the unity of the nation and violated both the Constitution and sections 78(a) and 81(a) and (b) of the Law on the regulation of political parties. The judgment was served on Principal State Counsel, the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister’s Office. The Constitutional Court’s judgment was published in the Official Gazette on 14 February 1994. The Constitutional Court held, firstly, that, pursuant to section 108 of the Law on the regulation of political parties, ÖZDEP’s resolution to go into voluntary dissolution did not prevent that court from ruling on the merits of the case as it had been made after the commencement of the proceedings before it. As to the merits, the Constitutional Court began by reiterating the constitutional principles that all persons living on Turkish territory, whatever their ethnic origin, formed a whole united by their common culture. The sum of the persons who made up the Republic of Turkey was called the “Turkish nation”. The different ethnic groups making up the “Turkish nation” were not divided into a majority and minorities. The court reiterated that, under the Constitution, no political or legal distinction based on ethnic or racial origin could be made between citizens: all Turkish nationals, without distinction, could avail themselves of all civil, political and economic rights. With particular reference to Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin, the Constitutional Court held that in every region of Turkey such persons enjoyed the same rights as other Turkish citizens. That did not mean that the Constitution denied the existence of a Kurdish identity, since citizens of Kurdish origin were not forbidden to express their Kurdish identity. The Kurdish language could be used on all private premises, in workplaces, in the press and in works of art and literature. The Constitutional Court reiterated the principle that everyone was bound to observe the provisions of the Constitution even if they did not agree with them. The Constitution did not preclude the celebration of difference but forbade propaganda based on racial difference and aimed at destroying the constitutional order. It pointed out that by virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne having a separate language or ethnic origin was not by itself enough for a group to qualify as a minority. With regard to the content of ÖZDEP’s programme, the Constitutional Court observed that it was based on the assumption that there was a separate Kurdish people in Turkey with its own culture and language. The Kurds were portrayed in the programme as an oppressed people whose democratic rights were being completely ignored. According to the Constitutional Court, ÖZDEP called for a right to self-determination for the Kurds and supported their right to wage a “war of independence”. Its stance was similar to that of terrorist organisations and constituted in itself an incitement to insurrection. In relation to the principle of secularism, the Constitutional Court noted that ÖZDEP’s programme contained a proposal for the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department of the government on the ground that religious affairs should be under the control of the religious institutions themselves. After reiterating what was meant by the principle of secularism, the court said that advocating the abolition of the government Religious Affairs Department amounted to undermining the principle of secularism. It concluded that that aspect of ÖZDEP’s programme was contrary to section 89 of the Law on the regulation of political parties. The Constitutional Court pointed to the fact that the Charter of Paris for a New Europe condemned racism, ethnic hatred and terrorism and that the Helsinki Final Act guaranteed the inviolability of national frontiers and territorial integrity. It concluded that ÖZDEP’s activities were subject, inter alia, to the restrictions referred to in paragraph 2 of Article 11 and to Article 17 of the Convention. 15. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows: “The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State based on the rule of law, respectful of human rights in a spirit of social peace, national solidarity and justice, adhering to the nationalism of Atatürk and resting on the fundamental principles set out in the Preamble.” “The State of Turkey constitutes with its territory and nation, an indivisible whole. The official language is Turkish.” “Sovereignty resides unconditionally and unreservedly in the nation. ... Sovereign power shall not under any circumstances be transferred to an individual, a group or a social class ...” “All individuals shall be equal before the law without any distinction based on language, race, colour, sex, political opinion, philosophical belief, religion, membership of a religious sect or other similar grounds.” “None of the rights and freedoms referred to in the Constitution shall be exercised with a view to undermining the territorial integrity of the State and the unity of the nation, jeopardising the existence of the Turkish State or Republic, abolishing fundamental rights and freedoms, placing the control of the State in the hands of a single individual or group, ensuring the domination of one social class over other social classes, introducing discrimination on the grounds of language, race, religion or membership of a religious sect, or establishing by any other means a political system based on any of the above concepts and opinions.” “Everyone linked to the Turkish State by nationality shall be Turkish.” “Citizens shall have the right to form political parties and to join them or withdraw from them in accordance with the lawful procedure laid down for the purpose ... Political parties shall be an indispensable part of the democratic political system. Political parties may be formed without prior permission and shall carry on their activities in accordance with the Constitution and the law. The constitutions and programmes of political parties shall not be inconsistent with the absolute integrity of State territory and of the nation, human rights, national sovereignty or the principles of a democratic secular Republic. No political party shall be formed which aims to advocate or establish the domination of one social class or group, or any form of dictatorship ...” “Political parties shall not engage in activities other than those referred to in their constitutions and programmes, nor shall they disregard the restrictions laid down by Article 14 of the Constitution, on pain of permanent dissolution. ... The decisions and internal running of political parties shall not be contrary to democratic principles. ... Immediately a political party is formed, Principal State Counsel shall verify as a matter of priority that its constitution and programme and the legal position of its founding members are consistent with the Constitution and the laws of the land. He shall also monitor its activities. Political parties may be dissolved by the Constitutional Court, on application by Principal State Counsel. Founding members and managers, at whatever level, of political parties which have been permanently dissolved may not become founding members, managers or financial controllers of any new political party, nor shall a new party be formed if a majority of its members previously belonged to a party which has been dissolved ...” 16. The relevant provisions of Law no. 2820 on the regulation of political parties read as follows: “Political parties (a) shall not aim or strive to or incite third parties to change: the republican form of the Turkish State; the ... provisions concerning the absolute integrity of the Turkish State’s territory, the absolute unity of its nation, its official language, its flag or its national anthem; ... the principle that sovereignty resides unconditionally and unreservedly in the Turkish nation; ... the provision that sovereign power cannot be transferred to an individual, a group or a social class ...; jeopardise the existence of the Turkish State and Republic, abolish fundamental rights and freedoms, introduce discrimination on grounds of language, race, colour, religion or membership of a religious sect, or establish, by any means, a system of government based on any such notion or concept. ... (c) shall not aim to defend or establish the domination of one social class over the other social classes or the domination of a community or the setting up of any form of dictatorship; they shall not carry on activities in pursuit of such aims ...” “Political parties shall not aim to change the principle of the unitary State on which the Turkish Republic is founded, nor carry on activities in pursuit of such an aim.” “Political parties shall not (a) assert that there exist within the territory of the Turkish Republic any national minorities based on differences relating to national or religious culture, membership of a religious sect, race or language; or (b) aim to destroy national unity by proposing, on the pretext of protecting, promoting or disseminating a non-Turkish language or culture, to create minorities on the territory of the Turkish Republic or to engage in similar activities ...” “Political parties shall not have an aim that runs counter to Article 136 of the Constitution, which provides that the Religious Affairs Department, which is bound to carry out the duties assigned to it in conformity with the principle of secularism ..., shall be accountable to central Government.” “The constitution, programme and activities of political parties shall not contravene the Constitution or this Law.” “Where a political party has been definitively dissolved, its founding members, its chairman, the members of its executive committee and central office, the members of its disciplinary and administrative organs at all levels and the members of political groups in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey shall, if still members when the party was dissolved, be disqualified from acting as founders, managers or financial controllers of any other political party. Any members whose actions were responsible for the political party’s being dissolved shall be disqualified for ten years from joining a political party or standing for election to Parliament. No political party shall be formed with a majority of members from a political party that has been dissolved.” “No political party shall be formed with the name ‘communist’, ‘anarchist’, ‘fascist’, ‘theocratic’ or ‘national socialist’, the name of a religion, language, race, sect or region, or a name including any of the above words or similar ones.” “The Constitutional Court shall dissolve a political party where (a) the party’s programme or constitution ... is contrary to the provisions of Chapter 4 of this Law; or (b) its membership, central office or executive committee ... take a decision, issue a circular or make a statement ... contrary to the provisions of Chapter 4 of this Law or the Chairman, Vice-Chairman or General Secretary makes any written or oral statement contrary to those provisions ...” Chapter 4 of the Law, referred to in section 101, includes in particular sections 90(1) and 96(3), which are reproduced above. “All the assets of political parties dissolved by order of the Constitutional Court shall be transferred to the Treasury.” “A resolution by the competent body of a political party dissolving that party after an application for its dissolution has been lodged shall not prevent the proceedings before the Constitutional Court continuing or deprive any dissolution order that is made of its legal effects.”",['11'],['11-1'],[],[],[],[],1

In the night of 16 to 17 June 2004 the applicant’s husband called his brother, Mr Magomed Medov, on his mobile phone and said that his car had broken down. He tried to say where he was, but the phone was cut off. 10. In the evening of 17 June 2004 the Medovs were informed that their son, Mr Adam Medov, was being detained at the Sunzhenskiy District Department of the Interior (the Sunzhenskiy ROVD). At about 8 p.m. several of Mr Adam Medov’s relatives, including his father and two brothers, arrived at the village of Ordzhonikidzevskaya (also called Sleptsovskaya) – the administrative centre of the Sunzhenskiy district – and went to the ROVD building. 11. There the policemen told them that on 17 June 2004 the traffic police stopped two vehicles, a green Volga 31-10 and a Zhiguli VAZ 21099, for an inspection near the Kavkaz-1 crossing between Ingushetia and Chechnya. The policemen heard noise coming from the boot of the Zhiguli car. They opened it and found a man tied up (according to the policemen this was Mr Adam Medov) who cried “I am an Ingush! They are trying to take me out of here!”. The Volga car then started to move towards Chechnya, but was stopped by the policemen. In its boot they found another man tied up. 12. The policemen arrested the persons who were in both cars and took them and the two bound men to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD at about 7 p.m. 13. According to the policemen, Mr Adam Medov was questioned and explained that on 15 June 2004 he had been apprehended near the Sunzha restaurant in Sleptsovskaya along with a man to whom he had been giving a lift in his car, and whose name he did not know. He said he had been apprehended by eight men, four of them of Russian origin and four of them of Chechen origin, and subsequently taken to the Federal Security Service (FSB) headquarters in Magas, the capital of Ingushetia. There he had been beaten and tortured. At some point on 16 June 2004 he had been forced to call his family to convince them not to start searching for him. 14. By the evening of 17 June 2004 numerous relatives of Mr Adam Medov had gathered in front of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. The policemen asked his relatives to bring food and agreed to take it to him. Later they offered to allow two of Mr Adam Medov’s brothers, Mr Magomed Medov and Mr Usman Medov, to visit him inside the building. While the two men were standing on the ground floor of the police station, they heard someone shouting “No visits! They should leave!” Magomed Medov and Usman Medov were then escorted to the exit of the ROVD building. 15. At about 11.30 p.m. on 17 June 2004 the policemen came outside to where the relatives of Mr Adam Medov were waiting and told them that he and another detainee had been driven to Chechnya. Mr K-v, an officer of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD, had accompanied the cars to the Kavkaz-1 roadblock. This was the last news the relatives had of Mr Adam Medov. 16. On 22 July 2004, in reply to the Court’s request of 16 July 2004 for factual information relating to the detention and whereabouts of Mr Adam Medov, the Government first submitted that the Ministry of the Interior was not aware of his alleged abduction or his whereabouts. He had not been detained in the Sunzhenskiy ROVD between 15 and 21 June 2004. His relatives had not applied to the department of the interior with a complaint about Mr Adam Medov’s abduction. Furthermore, according to the information submitted by the Prosecutor General’s Office, on 22 July 2004 the Prosecutor’s Office of Ingushetia had opened a criminal case under Article 126 (2) of the Criminal Code – abduction committed by a group. 17. On 20 August 2004 the Government submitted the following information received from the Prosecutor General’s Office: “In the evening of 17 June 2004 police officers stopped two cars at the “Volga-20” stationary road checkpoint, located on federal route “Kavkaz”, near the administrative border of the Chechen Republic. The six men sitting in the two cars refused to produce their documents. In this connection they were brought to the Sunzhenskiy [ROVD], where four of the above-mentioned six men introduced themselves as officers of the Department of the [FSB] in the Chechen Republic and produced their documents. The highest ranking officer of the group, Mr Beletskiy V.V., gave the following explanation of what had happened. He said that on 15 June 2004 in Ingushetia they had apprehended two men, Medov A.A. and [K.], who were wanted on suspicion of having committed grave crimes, and that they were taking them to the Chechen Republic. Mr Beletskiy produced documents that showed the lawfulness and validity of Mr Medov’s and [K.’s] arrest and detention. After that the above-mentioned officers ... and the two detained persons left for the Chechen Republic. According to information provided by the Prosecutor’s Office of the Chechen Republic, officers of the law-enforcement bodies of the Chechen Republic had not apprehended Mr Medov and there was no information that the latter had been brought to the territory of the Chechen Republic. According to the Department of the FSB in the Chechen Republic, Mr Beletskiy V.V. was not on the staff of that Department. Moreover, the Department did not have any information regarding Mr Medov’s apprehension and whereabouts. On 22 July 2004 the Public Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Ingushetia initiated a criminal case in respect of an offence defined by Article 126 § 2 (a) (abduction by a group of persons after preliminary collusion) in connection with Mr Medov’s and [K.’s] disappearance. At present Mr Medov’s and [K.’s] location is not established. Mrs Medova’s allegations that her husband is being detained at the Khankala military base have not proved to be true”. 18. Immediately after 17 June 2004 the members of Mr Adam Medov’s family started to search for him. On numerous occasions, both in person and in writing, they applied to prosecutors at various levels, the Ministry of the Interior, the FSB, administrative authorities and public figures. The applicant and other family members received conflicting information about the circumstances of Mr Adam Medov’s apprehension and detention, and hardly any about his whereabouts after 17 June 2004. 19. On 18 June 2004, upon a request by Mr Adam Medov’s relatives, the chairman of the Ingush Bar Association “XXI Vek” asked the Ingush Department of the FSB and the Sunzhenskiy ROVD if Mr Adam Medov had been detained on 17 June 2004, and if so, where he was. On the same day the Sunzhenskiy ROVD replied that Mr Adam Medov had not been detained by them. 20. However, on 21 June 2004 the deputy prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District informed the Medovs that “on 15.05.2004 Medov A.K. was detained by officers of the FSB Department for Chechnya under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Beletskiy V.V.” On 22 June 2004 the same prosecutor informed the applicant’s family that on 16 June 2004 he had “requested the military prosecutor of the United Group Alignment (UGA) to submit relevant information”. 21. On 24 June 2004 the acting prosecutor of Ingushetia replied to a member of Ingushetia’s Popular Assembly, Mr Ozdoyev, that an investigation was ongoing into the Medovs’ complaint about the detention and ill-treatment of Mr Adam Medov by FSB officers on 15 June 2004. 22. On 26 June 2004 the deputy prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District again confirmed to the applicant’s family that “on 15.06.2004 Medov was detained by officers of the FSB Department for Chechnya under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Beletskiy V.V. On 18 June 2004 [M.], the military prosecutor of the UGA, was requested to submit information relating to the grounds of the arrest.” 23. On 1 July 2004 the acting prosecutor of Ingushetia replied to Mr Ozdoyev that, since Mr Medov had been detained by FSB officers from Chechnya, all complaints submitted by his family had been forwarded for investigation to the military prosecutor of the UGA. 24. On 7 July 2004 the Chief of the FSB Department for Chechnya wrote to the applicant and stated that Mr Medov had not been arrested or detained by its officers and that they had no information about his whereabouts. 25. On 9 July 2004 Mr Adam Medov’s relatives sent fifteen letters to the Prosecutor of Ingushetia, the Minister of the Interior of Ingushetia and the NGO Memorial, in which they described the known circumstances of Mr Medov’s apprehension and requested that an investigation into the abduction be carried out and his whereabouts be established. 26. On 9 July 2004 the Chairman of Memorial, Mr Orlov, and a member of the Human Rights Commission with the President of Russia, Mrs Gannushkina, met in Ingushetia with Mr M-v, the prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District. The applicant submitted a transcript of the discussion signed by Mr Orlov. According to that document, on 17 June 2004 Mr M-v had been informed that at about 7 p.m. a group of armed persons had been stopped at the Kavkaz-1 roadblock while trying to take two persons to Chechnya. The armed persons had produced documents to show they were FSB officers from Chechnya and insisted that they were acting lawfully. The prosecutor had demanded that they be taken to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD and personally went to the roadblock, but by that time they had agreed to go and had driven to the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. At the ROVD the detained persons had produced identity documents issued by the FSB Department for Chechnya bearing the names Lieutenant-Colonel Beletskiy V.V., Detective Shurov A.G., Corporal Parfenov D.A. and Sergeant Minbulatov I.Yu. They had also produced documents authorising them to arrest Mr Adam Medov and K., who had been found by the policemen in the boots of the cars. Mr M-v had called the local FSB office, which confirmed that the arrest had been legal. The prosecutor had had to order the release of the detained persons, who had departed for Chechnya through a back door, taking the two men with them. 27. In July-August 2004 the applicant and Mr Adam Medov’s mother wrote several letters to the Prosecutor General, the Prosecutor of the Chechen Republic, the FSB Department for Chechnya, and the Prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District, referring to the information obtained in July and asking for information about Mr Adam Medov’s whereabouts and news of the investigation. 28. On 19 July 2004 the Russian Human Rights Commissioner wrote to the General Prosecutor and the Director of the FSB in respect of Mr Adam Medov’s arrest and detention. 29. On 25 July 2004 the deputy chief of the FSB Department for Chechnya replied to the applicant. He denied that Mr Adam Medov had been arrested or detained by the Department’s officers and stated that they had no information on his whereabouts. The letter further stated that Lieutenant-Colonel Beletskiy V.V., Detective Shurov A.G., Corporal Parfenov D.A. and Sergeant Minbulatov I.Yu. were not members of the Department’s staff. 30. On 17 August 2004 the General Prosecutor’s Office replied to the Russian Human Rights Commissioner, stating that a criminal investigation into the abduction was pending, and that at the moment no law-enforcement authority possessed information about Mr Adam Medov’s arrest and detention or whereabouts. The letter also stated that on 17 June 2004 the six armed men and their two prisoners had been released from the Sunzhenskiy ROVD upon orders of the then acting Minister of the Interior of Ingushetia, Mr Kostoyev, who had been killed on 21 June 2004. 31. On 9 September 2004 the FSB replied to the Human Rights Commissioner and stated that the service had no information about Mr Medov’s arrest and detention or whereabouts, and that the four named servicemen were not members of the FSB Department for Chechnya. 32. On 15 September 2004 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor General about the inactivity of the investigator in charge of the case concerning her husband’s abduction. 33. On 25 November 2004 the applicant applied in person to the investigator in charge of the case with a request to conduct certain investigative measures, including questioning of the officers who had been on duty at the roadblock on 17 June 2004 and the officer who had escorted her husband and the persons who had detained him to the border between Ingushetia and Chechnya. According to the applicant, during her visit in person the investigator had refused to accept the application or include it in the case file. She had then sent it by registered mail. 34. On 29 December 2004 the applicant complained to the Sunzhenskiy District Court of the Republic of Ingushetia about the investigator’s refusal to accept the application of 25 November 2004 and to take the requested investigative measures. 35. On 25 January 2005 the Sunzhenskiy District Court examined the complaint. At the hearing the investigator submitted that the applicant had applied to be provided with information on the progress of the investigation once and had received a written reply. He had not received any other applications from her. He contended that the investigative measures requested by the applicant had been taken; however, he could not inform her of the results until the preliminary investigation was completed. The court dismissed the applicant’s complaint and held, inter alia: “In accordance with [the Code of Criminal Procedure] the victim may be familiarised with the materials of the criminal case file upon the completion of the preliminary investigation. Accordingly, [the investigator’s] refusal to familiarise the victim with the materials of the case file was lawful.” 36. The decision could be appealed against within ten days. 37. On 14 February 2005 the applicant submitted an appeal together with an application to restore the time-limit for appeal as the decision had been served on her only on 4 February 2005. 38. On 10 March 2005 the Sunzhenskiy District Court refused the application to restore the time-limit for appeal on the ground that the applicant had been present at the hearing of 25 January 2005, where the decision had been read out. 39. On an unspecified date the decisions of 25 January and 10 March 2005 were quashed by the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ingushetia and the case remitted to the Sunzhenskiy District Court for a fresh examination. According to the Government, upon the fresh examination the Sunzhenskiy District Court dismissed the complaint. The decision was not appealed against. 40. On 15 June 2005, following an application lodged by the applicant, the Karabulakskiy District Court of the Republic of Ingushetia declared Mr Adam Medov a missing person. 41. The Government submitted the following information concerning the progress of the investigation. 42. On 22 July 2004 criminal investigation no. 04600045 was instituted into the abduction of Mr Adam Medov. 43. On 29 July 2004 the investigator questioned as a witness Mr I., deputy prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District. Mr I. submitted that on 17 June 2004 he had been on duty at the District Prosecutor’s Office. At around 9 p.m. he was informed by the head of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD that unknown persons who had tried to take Mr Medov and K. through the checkpoint had been brought to the ROVD. They had presented themselves as FSB officers. Mr I. had immediately informed Mr B., another deputy prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District. Mr B. had told him that the persons brought to the ROVD had with them all necessary documents. Mr I. was questioned again on 20 October 2004. 44. On 29 July, 2 August and 5 October 2004 the investigator also questioned relatives of Mr Adam Medov. 45. On 30 July 2004 the applicant was granted the status of a victim in the criminal proceedings. She was questioned on 5 August 2004. 46. On 5 August 2004 the investigator questioned A., the head of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. On 7 August 2004 he questioned E., an officer of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. On 9 August 2004 the investigator questioned Bad. and Kh., the heads of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD, and on 16 August 2004 he questioned A., an officer of the Sunzhenskiy ROVD. 47. On 17 August 2004 the investigator questioned as witnesses two police officers of the special police unit of the Ministry of the Interior of Ingushetia. 48. On 13 September 2004 the investigator questioned six officers of the traffic police of Ingushetia. 49. On the same date the prosecutor of military unit no. 04062 questioned the head of the Sunzhenskiy District Department of the FSB and on 18 October 2004 his deputy. 50. On 22 December 2004 the preliminary investigation was suspended on the ground that the person to be charged with the offence had not been identified. 51. On 1 April 2005 the deputy prosecutor of the Sunzhenskiy District quashed the decision to suspend the investigation. 52. On 5 April 2005 the investigation was resumed. 53. On 5 May 2005 the preliminary investigation was suspended again on the ground that the person to be charged with the offence had not been identified. 54. On 31 May 2005 the first deputy prosecutor of the Republic of Ingushetia quashed the decision to suspend the investigation and transmitted the case to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Sunzhenskiy District for additional investigation. 55. On 1 June 2005 the investigator questioned as witnesses two neighbours of Mr Adam Medov. 56. On 1 July 2005 the investigator suspended the preliminary investigation again on the ground that the persons to be charged with the offence had not been identified. 57. On 3 October 2005 the first deputy prosecutor of the Republic of Ingushetia quashed the decision to suspend the investigation. 58. According to the Government, in the course of the investigation requests for information were sent to the Prosecutor’s Office of the Chechen Republic, prosecutor’s offices and investigating authorities of other Caucasian regions, the military prosecutor of UGA, the FSB Department for Northern Caucasia, the Ministry of the Interior of Ingushetia, medical institutions, a mobile network operator, airline and railway ticket offices, civil registrars, and passport and visa services. The investigating authorities also checked the registers of unidentified dead bodies and temporary detention facilities. According to the information received, the persons who presented themselves as FSB officers during the documents check had never served in the FSB and the documents presented had never been issued to them by the State authorities. Neither the Ministry of the Interior nor the FSB had conducted any operations in order to arrest Mr Medov and K. The Prosecutor’s Office of the UGA had neither instituted proceedings against Mr Medov and K. nor arrested them. 59. On 15 April 2007 the investigation was suspended on the ground that the persons to be charged with the offence had not been identified. The applicant was notified accordingly. 60. On 20 November 2007 the investigation was resumed. The applicant was notified of the resumption. 61. Despite specific requests made by the Court on several occasions, the Government did not submit any documents from the file in criminal case no. 04600045. Relying on the information obtained from the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Government stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Russian Code of Criminal Procedure, since the file contained information of a military nature and personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings. At the same time, the Government suggested that a Court delegation could have access to the file at the place where the preliminary investigation was being conducted, with the exception of the documents disclosing military information and the personal details of the witnesses, and without the right to make copies of the case file and transmit it to others. 62. On 10 March 2005 the applicant submitted a letter to the Court, in which she alleged that in January – March 2005 persons who claimed to belong to the FSB had offered her money via a relative of hers for the withdrawal of her application. She had also been personally contacted by a man claiming to be an officer of the FSB who had threatened her and offered money for the withdrawal of her application before the Court. 63. After the application had been communicated to the Government, the applicant maintained the complaint concerning the events that had allegedly taken place in January – March 2005. She made no new allegations. 64. The Government submitted that State agents had not hindered the applicant’s right to petition the Court. Furthermore, the applicant had not applied to law-enforcement agencies in connection with the alleged threats and offers of money for the withdrawal of her application. 65. Article 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for judicial review of decisions by investigators and prosecutors that might infringe the constitutional rights of participants in proceedings or prevent access to a court. 66. Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure stipulates that evidence from the preliminary investigation may not be disclosed. Part 3 of the same Article provides that information from the investigation file may be divulged with the permission of a prosecutor or investigator, but only in so far as it does not infringe the rights and lawful interests of the participants in the criminal proceedings and does not prejudice the investigation. It is prohibited to divulge information about the private life of participants in criminal proceedings without their permission","['13', '2', '38', '5']","['2-1', '5-1']",[],"['13', '3', '34']",[],[],1

AUSTRIA,3,No violation of Art. 6-1 as regards independency and impartiality;Violation of Art. 6-1 as regards lack of a public hearing,Nicolas Bratza,"7. The applicant is a farmer living in Piesendorf, Salzburg. 8. On 12 June 1991 the applicant applied to the Salzburg District Agricultural Authority (Agrarbezirksbehörde, the ""District Authority"") for declarations (1) that the share in an agricultural association (Agrargemeinschaft) represented by a certain parcel of land (""the share"") belonged to him, and (2) that grazing rights in that parcel (""the grazing rights"") also belonged to him. On 24 June 1991 the District Authority found that the applicant had not made out his claims, and it declared that the share and the grazing rights belonged to a third person. The applicant appealed to the Regional Land Reform Board (Landesagrarsenat, the ""Regional Board""). 9. The Regional Board dismissed the applicant's appeal on 8 May 1992. After an oral hearing, it found, so far as relevant, that the share had passed with a transfer of the land to a third party in 1949 (as rectified in 1952). The question of the grazing rights had to be determined by reference to the ownership of the land on 29 April 1868, as that was the last time they were officially mentioned. In the absence of any express alienation of the grazing rights since then, the grazing rights passed with the land - that is, the applicant did not own them. 10. The Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) declined to deal with the applicant's constitutional complaint on 14 October 1992. It remitted the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). 11. On 14 March 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint rejecting at the same time, in accordance with section 39(2) no. 6 of the Administrative Court Act (Verwaltungsgerichtshofgesetz), the applicant’s request for an oral hearing. The judgment was served on the applicant’s representative on 31 March 1995. 12. A summary of the rules concerning the composition and procedure before the regional land reform boards, and hearings before the Administrative Court may be found in the Stallinger and Kuso v. Austria judgment (23 April 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II, pp. 674-675, §§ 23-27).",['6'],['6-1'],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1964 in Dashkesan, Azerbaijan, and currently lives in Russia. 6. The applicant was a unit commander in the Azerbaijani Army. On 7 October 1994 he was arrested in Ganja, Azerbaijan, due to his alleged participation in the coup d'Etat organised by S. Huseynov. 7. On 31 July 1996 the Supreme Court, sitting as a court of first instance for especially serious crimes, convicted the applicant for high treason, use of armed forces against the citizens and constitutional government authorities, creation of illegal armed units, and illegal possession of weapons. He was sentenced to thirteen years' imprisonment and confiscation of property. This judgment was final and not subject to appeal under the rules of criminal procedure applicable at that time. 8. Upon Azerbaijan's admission to the Council of Europe, the applicant's name was included in the lists of the “alleged political prisoners in Azerbaijan” submitted to the experts of the Secretary General. 9. Pursuant to a presidential pardon decree of 18 October 2002, the applicant's sentence was reduced by half. 10. Pursuant to another presidential pardon decree of 28 August 2003, the applicant was released from serving the remainder of his sentence. As the applicant was no longer imprisoned, no final opinion was adopted by the experts of the Secretary General on whether he could be considered as a political prisoner. 11. In 2000 a new Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCrP”) and new Criminal Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan were adopted. Before the new CCrP's entry into force on 1 September 2000, on 14 July 2000 Parliament passed a transitional law allowing the lodging of an appeal under the new CCrP against the final judgments delivered in accordance with the old criminal procedure rules (“the Transitional Law”). 12. On 11 August 2004 the applicant, using the opportunity granted to him by the Transitional Law, filed a cassation appeal against the judgment of 31 July 1996 with the Supreme Court. On 17 August 2004 the Supreme Court refused to accept the appeal due to the applicant's failure to enclose a copy of the challenged judgment. 13. On 4 October 2004 the applicant again filed the cassation appeal, which was registered by the Supreme Court on 6 October 2004. In his appeal he noted that, although he had been pardoned and released from imprisonment, his conviction for high treason remained intact. He argued that his trial by the first-instance court had been unfair. He also argued that, under the new Criminal Code the actions for which he had been convicted could not be qualified as “high treason”. He asked the court to quash the judgment of 31 July 1996. 14. According to the Government, on 15 October 2004 the Supreme Court “informed the applicant that the appeal hearings concerning his case would be held on 7 December 2004”. According to the applicant, he did not receive any such summons and, in general, did not receive any information concerning his case for several months. 15. On 27 January 2005 the applicant wrote a letter to the Supreme Court inquiring about the status of the proceedings. He also requested to add an issue concerning the confiscation of property to his appeal. In reply, by a letter dated 15 February 2005, the Head of the Registry of the Supreme Court informed the applicant that the court had not received from him any documents in this respect. 16. On 5 April 2005 the applicant was sent a copy of the Supreme Court decision concerning his case, dated 7 December 2004. The applicant was informed that on 7 December 2004 the Supreme Court had examined his cassation complaint in the presence of a public prosecutor but in the absence of the applicant. The judgment was silent as to the reasons for holding the hearing in the applicant's absence. During the hearing, the prosecutor asked the court to dismiss the appeal. The court found that the applicant's guilt had been duly established during the trial in the first-instance court and that his actions had been properly qualified under the criminal law. Accordingly, the court dismissed the applicant's appeal as being unsubstantiated. 17. In accordance with the Law of 14 July 2000 on the Adoption and Entry into Force of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan (“the Transitional Law”), judgments and other final decisions delivered by first instance courts under the old CCrP before the entry into force of the new CCrP, may be reconsidered by an appellate court or the Supreme Court in accordance with the relevant provisions of the new CCrP. 18. In accordance with Article 415.0.3 of the new CCrP, the Supreme Court may leave the cassation appeal unexamined if the person lodging the appeal fails to attach to his appeal a copy of the disputed judgment or decision. 19. A cassation appeal lodged with the Supreme Court is transmitted to one of the judges of the relevant chamber of the Supreme Court for preliminary examination (Article 418.1 of the CCrP). Within three days of receiving the appeal, the judge carrying out the preliminary examination of the appeal must, inter alia, inform the public prosecutor, the convicted (or acquitted) person and other parties to the case or interested parties about the time and place of examination of the merits of the appeal (Articles 418.2 and 418.2.7 of the CCrP). 20. When examining the merits of the appeal, the Supreme Court deals only with the points of law and verifies whether rules of criminal law and criminal procedure had been applied correctly (Article 419.1 of the CCrP). The examination on the merits is carried out by a chamber composed of three judges. The persons having a right to lodge an appeal and the public prosecutor representing the prosecution before the Supreme Court have the right to be present at the court hearing (Article 419.2 of the CCrP). 21. The Supreme Court hearing is opened by the president of the chamber who announces which court decision will be examined and on what grounds, the composition of the chamber examining the case, and which of the parties to the criminal proceedings are present at the hearing. The absence of the person who has lodged the appeal, if he has been duly informed about the hearing, does not prevent the Supreme Court from deciding to proceed with the hearing in his or her absence (Article 419.4 of the CCrP).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1917 and lives in the town of Ternopil. 5. In 1989 her husband and son, Mr B.P. and Mr B.I., became members of the Cooperative Society for Construction and Repair “Kooperator” (the “Society”). On 22 May 1990 the Ternopil Town Executive Committee (the “Committee”) transferred two plots of land in Ternopil to the Society for the construction of three houses. By decision of 14 November 1990, the Committee transferred a part of that land to the applicant's husband and son for the erection of a two-flat house. On 27 November 1990 the general assembly of the Society adopted a decision similar to the Committee's decision of 14 November 1990. On an unspecified date the Committee transferred the land, with which Mr B.P. and Mr B.I. had been provided, back to the Society. 6. On 2 December 1991 the general assembly of the Society, headed by Mr B.I., decided to terminate the Society's activity. It further decided to transfer the Society's property to its members. In particular, Mr B.P. was granted the left side of a house and Mr B.I. was granted its right side. As it was later established by the domestic courts, in 1991 there was only the foundation of the future house. In December 1991 the Society closed its bank account. The Society's state registration was annulled in September 1995. 7. The house was erected by autumn 1994. 8. Between 1995 and 1997 Mr B.P. unsuccessfully lodged with the Ternopil Town Council (the “Council”) a number of applications, requesting the Council to grant him a right to use the plot of land on which the left part of the house had been constructed. 9. On 17 February 1997 Mr B.P. died. The applicant inherited all his possessions. 10. On 8 April 1997 the Council granted Mr B.I. a right to use the plot of land on which the right side of the house had been built. 11. In June 1997 the applicant lodged with the Ternopil Town Court an administrative law complaint against the Council for failure to consider the request to grant her a right to use the plot of land on which the left part of the house had been constructed. On 9 July 1997 the court found in favour of the applicant and ordered the Council to consider the merits of the applicant's request at its next session. 12. On 23 July 1997 the Council granted Mr M. a right to use the plot of land, on which the left side of the house had been built, for construction purposes. 13. In 1996 Mr M. lodged with the Ternopil Regional Prosecutor's Office a criminal law complaint against Mr B.I., accusing the latter of fraud. Mr M. alleged that Mr B.I. had unlawfully attempted to take possession of the left part of the house, which Mr M. had bought from him according to a sales contract of 18 March 1993. On 9 July 1996 the prosecutors initiated criminal proceedings against Mr B.I. 14. In 1997 Mr B.I. lodged with the Ternopil Regional Security Service Department a criminal law complaint, accusing Mr M. of fraud. Mr B.I. alleged that Mr M. had falsified the official documents in respect of the left part of the house in order to become its owner. On 13 March 1997 the department initiated criminal proceedings against Mr M. 15. On 25 May 1997 both criminal cases were joined. On 15 July 1997 the Ternopil Town Police Department terminated the criminal proceedings on the ground of absence of corpus delicti in the actions of Mr B.I. and Mr M. The police established that Mr M. had not been a member of the Society in 1991. It also found that there were two different copies of the decision of the general assembly of the Society of 2 December 1991, one of which confirmed the membership of Mr M. and contained his name instead of the name of Mr B.P., the latter being mentioned in the other copy of that decision. The police held that the existence of two different versions was of no importance, as none of the copies had been duly certified by a notary. It further stated that, according to the expert examination of the sales contract of 18 March 1993, the contract had been forged by way of combination of two printed texts. The police also found that the contract had no binding force, as it had not been certified by a notary or by the Society. 16. In July 1997 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Ternopil Town Court against the Council, seeking the annulment of the latter's decision of 23 July 1997 to grant Mr M. a right to use the plot of land, on which the left side of the house had been built. She further requested the court to oblige the Council to grant her a right to use the plot of land under the left side of the house for an indefinite period of time. The applicant was represented in the proceedings by her son, Mr B. I. Mr M. joined the proceedings as a third party. 17. In the course of the proceedings, the applicant submitted that her late husband had been the owner of the left part of the house, which had been constructed on the plot of land at issue, as he had been granted that part of the house pursuant to the decision of the Society of 2 December 1991. After her husband's death she inherited his property, including the left part of the house. The construction works were carried out at her and her late husband's expense. She further argued that, although her son had initially agreed to sell the part of the house to Mr M., the latter had refused to pay the price, upon which they had agreed. Thus, the left part of the house was not sold to Mr M. 18. Mr M., in his turn, argued that in 1993 he had bought from Mr B.I. the foundation of the left part of the house and some construction materials, which formally belonged to Mr B. P. Mr M. further argued that they had agreed that Mr B. I. would complete the construction works. The latter having failed to do so, Mr M. built the left part of the house at his own cost. Between 1993 and 1994, Mr M. paid Mr B. I. around USD 10,000 by instalments. Following this, Mr M. refused to pay Mr B. I. higher amounts, as he had completed the construction works himself. Mr M. submitted copies of two documents dated 20 January 1995, according to which Mr B. I. had received from Mr M. 1,550,000,000 karbovanets (the former transitional currency of Ukraine before September 1996) for the left part of the house and that the latter had built that part of the house and reimbursed the money, which Mr B. I. had paid for the construction materials. Mr M. alleged that Mr B. I. had signed these documents as the head of the Society. 19. The applicant, in reply, contended that the documents, submitted by Mr M. in support of his claim that he had constructed the house and that he had purchased it, including the contract of 1993, had been forged. Referring to the general interpretation of the relevant domestic law given by the Plenum of the Supreme Court of Ukraine, she further argued that, even assuming that Mr M. had participated in the construction of the left part of the house, he could not claim ownership rights in its respect. 20. The Council submitted that its decision of 23 July 1997 was lawful, as Mr M. had provided it with the documents which had proved that he had constructed the left part of the house. 21. On 27 August 1997 the Ternopil Town Court found for the applicant and quashed the Council's decision of 23 July 1997. It further ordered the Council to grant the applicant the right to use the land at issue for an indefinite period of time. The court held that Mr M. had not qualified to be granted that right, as he had not been a member of the Society and there was no information in the notary's register that the Society had transferred the plot of land in question to him. 22. The Council appealed in cassation. 23. On 29 September 1997 the Ternopil Regional Court informed the Supreme Court of Ukraine about the Council's request for the case to be transferred to another court. The Council alleged that the applicant's son was a member of the family of one of the judges of the Ternopil Regional Court. On 7 October 1997 the Supreme Court ordered that the appeal in cassation against the first instance court's decision was to be heard by the Khmelnytsk Regional Court, instead of the Ternopil Regional Court. The applicant was not informed either about the Council's request or about the decision of the Supreme Court to reassign the case. 24. On 20 November 1997 the Khmelnytsk Regional Court upheld the decision of 27 August 1997. 25. On 10 April 1998 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Khmelnytsk Region lodged a protest with the Presidium of the Khmelnytsk Regional Court, seeking initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the applicant's case. On 27 April 1998 the Presidium allowed the protest, quashed the decisions of 27 August and 20 November 1997, and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the Ternopil Town Court. It also noted that there had been no building at the time when the Society had decided to transfer its part to Mr B. P. Moreover, the parties failed to submit documentary evidence in support of their claims for ownership rights. 26. On 22 June 1998 the Supreme Court ordered the Ternopil Town Court to transfer the case to the Khmelnytsk Regional Court, the latter being responsible for selecting a first instance court to reconsider the case. According to the Government, the Ternopil Town Court did not comply with the instructions of the Supreme Court and did not transfer the case. 27. On 3 July 1998 the Ternopil Town Court found for the applicant. On 25 August 1998 the Ternopil Regional Court upheld the decision of the first instance court. The courts of both instances held that there was enough evidence that Mr B.P. had been a member of the Society. This fact had been established by the Ternopil Town Court in its judgment of 9 July 1997, which had not been appealed against and had become final, and the applicant could not be held responsible for the absence of other documents proving the membership of her deceased husband. The courts also held that the decision of the general assembly of the Society of 2 December 1991 had, in fact, provided for the transfer of certain objects situated on the plot of land at issue, i.e. the foundation and some construction materials, erroneously referring to them as a building. With regard to the sales contract of 1993, the courts stated that Mr B.I. had not been entitled to sell the left part of the house, irrespective of whether he had acted in his capacity as the head of the Society or as a private person. They also referred to the findings of the police of 15 July 1997 that the contract had been falsified. Similarly, they found that the documents submitted by Mr M., in particular a copy of the decision of the general assembly of the Society of 2 December 1991, stating that he had been one of its members and had been granted the left part of the building, and the receipts in respect of the construction expenses were not valid. In any event, a contribution to the construction expenses could not be a valid ground for an ownership claim. 28. By letter of 12 October 1998, the Deputy President of the Supreme Court requested the Ternopil Town Court to send the case file to the Supreme Court for supervisory review. By the same letter, he informed the Ternopil Town Court and Mr M. that the execution of the judgment of 3 July 1998 was suspended. 29. On 22 December 1998 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court lodged a protest with the Chamber in Civil Cases of that court, seeking the initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the applicant's case. On 24 March 1999 the panel of three judges of the Supreme Court allowed the protest, quashed the decisions of 3 July and 25 August 1998, and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It held that there was no evidence that the left part of the house was owned by either the Society or Mr B.P. Moreover, there was no information as to the latter's membership of that Society, and the lower courts had not verified whether the house had been erected by him in compliance with relevant regulations. The panel further stated that the first instance court had failed to take into consideration the written testimonies of the persons, who had participated in the construction of the house. It stressed that its findings should be taken into account in the new consideration of the case. 30. On 25 August 1999 the Ternopil Town Court found for the applicant. The court for the most part reiterated the findings contained in the decision of 3 July 1998. It also held that the Society had been the owner of every construction object on the land at issue before it transferred the title to these objects to its members, including Mr B.P. On 28 September 1999 the Ternopil Regional Court upheld the decision of 25 August 1999. 31. On 6 June 2000 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court lodged a protest with the Chamber in Civil Cases of that court, seeking again the initiation of supervisory review proceedings in the applicant's case. On 5 July 2000 the panel of three judges of the Supreme Court allowed the protest, quashed the decisions of 25 August and 28 September 1999, and remitted the case for a fresh consideration. It held that the lower courts had failed to take into account the instructions contained in its decision of 24 March 1999. The panel reiterated that the first instance court had failed either to verify whether the Society had been the owner of the objects in question; whether the Society had been in fact liquidated and, if so, when it had been liquidated; whether the Society had been granted a construction permit; or to establish who had actually constructed the part of the house at issue. The panel found that the Society had not had authority to transfer the land to third parties and its members had not had rights to build houses on that land. It finally held that Mr M. had in fact obtained the plot of land at issue as well as all the documentation in respect of the left part of the house, which remained in his actual possession. 32. On 9 October 2000 the Supreme Court, following the request of Mr M., invited the Khmelnytsk Regional Court to assign the case to one of the first instance courts in the Khmelnytsk region. On 1 November 2000 the regional court transferred the case to the Chemerovetsk Town Court. 33. In November 2000 Mr M. lodged a counter claim, seeking recognition of his ownership rights in respect of the left part of the house. 34. On 19 January 2001 the Chemerovetsk Town Court ruled in favour of Mr M. and rejected the applicant's claims. It held that Mr M. had lawfully bought the foundation of the left part of the building and had completed the construction himself, which was supported by the evidence examined in the proceedings. In particular, the court stated that the contract of 1993 was valid, as it had been seized by the police from the flat of Mr M. in 1997, and the two documents of 20 January 1995 were, according to the expert's conclusions, also valid. The court further noted that the written testimonies, certified by a notary, of 16 witnesses, who had carried out construction works, and Mr D., who had been heard by the court as a witness, confirmed that Mr M. had built the left part of the house at his own cost. The court also relied on the letter of 28 February 1996, submitted by Mr M., in which the Ternopil Regional Prosecutor's Office stated that, according to the conclusions of its inquiry into the matter, the left part of the house was built by Mr M. The court also found that the latter was in actual possession of that part of the house, as he had been paying all the communal charges in its respect. The court refused to admit as evidence copies of the bills of costs in respect of construction materials, submitted by the applicant, on the ground that it was not possible to establish whether these construction materials had been used to build the left part of the house. 35. On 16 February 2001 the applicant requested the Supreme Court to transfer the case to another court on the grounds that it would be difficult for her to participate in the hearings before the Chemerovetsk Town Court with regard to her age and state of health, on one hand, and the distance between her place of residence and the place of the hearing, on the other. On 25 February 2001 the Supreme Court rejected her request as unsubstantiated. 36. On 1 March 2001 the Khmelnytsk Regional Court upheld the decision of 19 January 2001. It also considered that Mr B.P. had not been a member of the Society, as there were no documents proving his membership and he had resided in another location. 37. In the course of the proceedings before the Chemerovetsk Town Court and the Khmelnytsk Regional Court, the applicant requested the courts to summon the witnesses, on whose written statements Mr M. had relied to show that he had constructed the left part of the building. She argued that these testimonies were false and that some of these witnesses could confirm her submissions that certain construction works had been carried out at her and her late husband's expense. The courts did not reply to her request. 38. In September 2001 the applicant lodged an appeal in cassation against the decisions of 19 January and 1 March 2001 under the new transitional cassation procedure. She complained of the lower courts' incorrect assessment of the evidence. The applicant also argued that the courts had refused to summon the witnesses on whose written testimonies they had relied in their decisions. She maintained that neither she nor her representative had had an opportunity to question these witnesses. 39. On 22 August 2002 the Chamber in Civil Cases of the Supreme Court considered the merits of the applicant's appeal in cassation and rejected it. The Supreme Court held that Mr M. had lawfully purchased a part of the foundation of the building and had valid grounds to use the plot of land on which the left part of the building had been constructed. The court also held that the written statements of the witnesses, confirming that Mr M. had completed the construction, had been lawfully admitted as evidence in the case. 40. In 2002 the applicant and Mr B. I. instituted another set of proceedings in the Ternopil Town Court against Mr M., two other members of the family of Mr M., and the Ternopil Town Council, seeking the annulment of the ownership certificate of Mr M. in respect of the house. The applicant and Mr B. I. also sought the annulment of certain other official documents, in which it was mentioned that Mr M. had built a part of the house. 41. On 12 November 2002 the court found against the applicant and Mr B. I. On 4 February 2003 and 26 May 2004, respectively, the Ternopil Regional Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld the decision of the first instance court. 42. According to the applicant, the courts, which considered her second claim, based their decisions on the findings of the Chemerovetsk Town Court, the Khmelnytsk Regional Court and the Supreme Court of Ukraine made in the course of the first set of civil proceedings (see paragraphs 34, 36 and 39 above). 43. Under Article 133 § 1 of the Code, the President of the Supreme Court of Ukraine and his or her deputies, as well as the presidents of the regional courts were entitled to transfer a case from one court to another, upon request of the parties, other participants in the proceedings, the prosecutor, or on their own motion. Article 133 § 2 envisaged that the court, which was dealing with the case, could transfer it to another court, (a) if the former court found that it would be more expedient to examine the case in the court which enjoyed jurisdiction over the place of the principal events of the case, or in the court other than the one chosen by the plaintiff; (b) if the former court allowed the well-founded request of the defendant, whose place of residence had been previously unknown, to hear the case in the court which enjoyed jurisdiction over the place of the defendant's actual residence. No formal decision was adopted concerning the transfer of the case. 44. According to Article 135 of the Code, the case, which was transferred from one court to another pursuant to Article 133, should be accepted by the recipient court. No disputes between the courts over their jurisdiction were allowed. 45. Pursuant to Articles 327, court decisions, rulings and resolutions might have been reviewed in supervisory review proceedings. 46. Under Article 337 the court that considers a case in supervisory review proceedings had power: to leave a judgment, ruling, resolution without changes, and refuse a protest; to quash, in full or in part, a judgment, ruling, resolution and to remit a case for a fresh consideration to court of first or cassation instance; to quash, in full or in part, a judgment, ruling, resolution and to discontinue proceedings or leave a case without consideration; to uphold one of the judgments, rulings, resolutions in a case; 47. Article 341 provided that instructions of the court which had reviewed a case were binding on the court which later re-examined it. These instructions were binding within the limits envisaged by Article 319 of the Code. According to paragraph 2 of the latter provision, court of cassation had no competence to establish facts which had not been established or disproved by a contested judgment, to decide in advance on question of reliability of a particular piece of evidence, prevalence of certain evidence, and on questions as to which norm of substantive law was to be applied or which decision was to be made in the course of new consideration of the case. 48. According to Article 353 of the new Code, the parties to the proceedings are entitled to lodge with the Supreme Court of Ukraine an appeal against the court decisions, which were subject to review in cassation, in view of the exceptional circumstances. 49. Under Article 354, the court decisions in civil matters may be reviewed in view of exceptional circumstances if they are appealed against on the ground that an international judicial authority, whose jurisdiction was recognised by Ukraine, found that a decision in a civil case violated the international commitments of Ukraine. 50. Articles 356 and 357 provide that the appeal on the above ground shall be examined by the panel of at least two-thirds of judges of the Chamber in Civil Cases of the Supreme Court under the rules applicable to cassation proceedings. 51. Pursuant to Article 334, the panel has power to reject an appeal; to quash, in full or in part, the decision at issue and to remit the case for a fresh consideration to the court of first instance, the court of appeal or cassation; to quash the decision of the court of appeal or cassation and to uphold the decision which was wrongly quashed; to quash the decisions in the case and to discontinue the proceedings; to change the decision or to adopt a new decision on the merits of the case. The decision of the panel is final. 52. The relevant parts of the Law read as follows: “This Law regulates relations emanating from: the State's obligation to enforce judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in cases against Ukraine; the necessity to eliminate reasons of violation by Ukraine of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and protocols thereto; the need to implement European human rights standards into legal and administrative practice of Ukraine; and the necessity to create conditions to reduce the number of applications before the European Court of Human Rights against Ukraine.” “1. For the purposes of this Law the following terms shall be used in the following meaning: ... the Convention – the 1950 Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Protocols thereto agreed to be binding by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine; the Court – the European Court of Human Rights; ... Creditor – a) an applicant before the European Court of Human Rights in a case against Ukraine in whose favour the Court rendered its judgment or in whose case the parties have reached a friendly settlement, or his representative, or his successor... Enforcement of a judgment – a) payment of compensation to the Creditor; b) adoption of individual measures; c) adoption of general measures; ...” “1. Individual measures shall be adopted in addition to the payment of compensation and are aimed at restoring the infringed rights of the Creditor. 2. Individual measures include: a) restoring as far as possible the legal status which the Creditor had before the Convention was violated (restitutio in integrum); ...” 2. The previous legal status of the Creditor shall be restored, inter alia, by means of: a) reconsideration of the case by a court, including reopening of the proceedings in that case; b) reconsideration of the case by an administrative body.” “1. The Office of the Government's Agent shall within three days from receipt of the Court's notification that the judgment has become final: a) send the Creditor a notification explaining his right to initiate proceedings on the review of his case and/or to reopen the proceedings according to the law in force...”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM",1,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 8 in respect of removal of child at birth;Violation of Art. 8 in respect of procedures concerning care and freeing for adoption orders,Gaukur Jörundsson;Jean-Paul Costa;Nicolas Bratza,"9. P., born in 1958, is a citizen of the United States of America; C., the husband of P., was born in 1962 and is a United Kingdom citizen; S., their daughter was born in 1998 and is a United Kingdom and American citizen. They are all resident in the United Kingdom. 10. In January 1976 P., then living in the United States of America, gave birth to a son A. shortly before her eighteenth birthday. In 1980 P. married her first husband and had a second son B. in February 1985. In 1992 she and her husband separated. Both parents contested custody of B. 11. Between December 1990 and January 1994 B. was referred to his general practitioner for some forty-seven complaints. 12. In March/April 1993 B. was taken for examination to hospital on numerous occasions for complaints of diarrhoea and fever, and on each occasion he was found to be in a normal condition. When on 18 April 1994 B. was admitted to hospital, a laboratory stools test indicated the presence of phenolphthalein (a laxative). The doctor was satisfied that P. had been responsible for laxative poisoning and reported the matter. 13. On the same date the Californian authorities took B. into protective custody, alleging that P. was harming her son, then aged 9, by administering laxatives to him inappropriately. He was suspected of being a victim of induced-illness abuse, the syndrome known variously as Munchhausen syndrome by proxy (“MSBP”), fabricated or induced illness, illness-induction syndrome or paediatric falsified condition. MSBP is a label sometimes used to describe a form of psychiatric illness, mainly found in women, who seek attention by inducing illness in their children or inventing accounts of illness in their children, and by repeatedly presenting their children to the medical authorities for investigation and treatment. 14. On 23 August 1994 a Californian court ordered that B. live with his father. Following this placement, B. did not suffer from any acute or abnormal diarrhoea. At a hearing in September 1995, the court approved supervised contact between P. and her son B. once a month for two to four hours for the following three years. P. was informed that, if she wished increased contact, it could be envisaged in a supervised, therapeutic context. 15. P. was charged with cruelty towards B. and endangering B.'s health, a felony offence under section 273A(a) of the Californian Penal Code. A report prepared by Dr Schreier stated that P. suffered from MSBP and that she had victimised B. over several years, causing him severe diarrhoea, possibly vomiting, weight loss and multiple non-trivial procedures and hospitalisations. On 4 October 1995, after a five-week trial before a jury in the Superior Court of California, she was convicted of a misdemeanour under section 273A(b), a lesser offence, and acquitted of the felony. On 17 November 1995 she was sentenced to three years' probation and three months in custody, subsequently suspended. She was also ordered to enter and complete a “psychological and psychiatric treatment programme”. 16. During the divorce proceedings, P. was required to have therapy as a condition for getting custody of B. and saw a therapist from 1992 until the end of 1993. From late 1992 she was prescribed an antidepressant by a psychiatrist whom she saw regularly to review the medication. She also consulted with psychiatrists during the criminal trial. From about April to December 1995, she saw a psychologist twice a month for therapy. 17. On 2 May 1996 the Californian family court reduced contact to one supervised occasion per month. It was ordered that any additional contact visits would have to occur in a therapeutic setting with a doctor present. Her appeal against this was dismissed. 18. During 1996 P. met her present husband, C., a qualified social worker who was studying for a doctorate in philosophy and researching into cases of women wrongly accused of MSBP. 19. In November 1996, in breach of the probation order, P. came to visit C. in the United Kingdom. P. and C. were married in September 1997 in the United Kingdom. P. discovered shortly afterwards that she was pregnant. 20. Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council (“the local authority”) became aware of the pregnancy after P. had taken steps with a view to obtaining an annulment of her previous marriage and her ex-husband had informed the district attorney in California who in turn made contact with the authorities in the United Kingdom, giving information about P.'s conviction for harming her son B. The local authority was informed of the pregnancy by P.'s doctor and commenced an investigation. 21. Social workers were in contact with P. and C. from January 1998. A letter was sent to arrange a meeting. Prior to the proposed meeting, there were several exchanges on the telephone. C. considered that the social services should provide more detailed information before a meeting took place and made a list of requirements regarding access to files and copies of documents. Tension arose when the social worker requested that P. give her date of birth in order to confirm that she was the person concerned in the information from the United States. P. initially refused to give this information. The proposed meeting was cancelled. 22. On 21 January 1998 the applicants' solicitors wrote to the social services requesting that they provide information to both themselves and P. directly, concerning, inter alia, the reason for the proposed meeting, details of any information in their possession, forms for applying for access to social-work files, specific details of child protection concerns in the case and a list of every person with whom P. had been discussed. 23. On 28 January 1998 a meeting took place attended by P. and C., social workers and the police. 24. There was further correspondence between the local authority and the applicants' solicitors concerning the appointment of an expert to assess the risk to the unborn child, pursuant to section 47 of the Children Act 1989 (“the section 47 assessment”). By letter dated 17 February 1998, the local authority's solicitors noted that the applicants were not happy with the proposed expert, Dr Bentovim, and requested further details of any objections. They pointed out that the person suggested by the applicants was not an expert in MSBP and requested details of the other proposed experts. 25. On 18 February 1998 the local authority made contact with Dr Eminson, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist who had been proposed by the applicants, with a view to her undertaking an assessment. 26. By letter dated 13 March 1998, the local authority's solicitor referred to a letter of 11 March 1998 by the applicants' solicitors. It was pointed out that, as there were no care proceedings in train, there was no obligation on the local authority to agree a letter of instruction for the expert with the applicants. At that stage, all that was required was P.'s agreement to see the expert. The view was expressed that it was for the local authority to decide what documents to submit to the expert, although they would have no objection to the applicants' providing extra documentation. Although they wished to work in cooperation with P., they could not allow her to dictate the course and conduct of the section 47 assessment. 27. On 2 March 1998 a case conference was held by the local authority attended, inter alia, by social workers, P.'s general practitioner, a health visitor, a midwife, P. and C., P.'s solicitor and the paternal grandmother of the unborn child. The minutes of the meeting state that the reason for the conference was that P. had a conviction which led to concern that her child might be at risk of induced illness/injury after it was born. It was noted that P. disputed details of the background to her conviction, claiming, inter alia, that there was evidence of her son B. having had diarrhoea as she alleged. C. was noted as accepting that the existence of a conviction could give rise for concern but not that it automatically meant his wife suffered from MSBP, alleging that there was no direct evidence of any harm having been inflicted by her. Due to the concern that P. suffered from MSBP, it was decided to place the child on the Child Protection Register at birth and to undertake a full risk assessment. 28. On about 16 March 1998 Dr Eminson agreed to act as expert in the assessment to take place. 29. On 18 March 1998 the applicants' solicitors wrote to the local authority, pointing out that their request for an agreed letter of instruction and the list of documents given to the expert was based on good practice and procedure and that, although there were no care proceedings, they had assumed the same principles would be applied. They stated that P. could not be expected to go into a meeting blind to the specific points the doctor had been asked to address and that they needed a list of documents in order to assess whether they wished to provide the expert with anything further. 30. By reply of the same date, the local authority's solicitor stated that a section 47 assessment procedure was at the entire discretion of the local authority and that different principles applied than in care proceedings. However, they were prepared to disclose the list of documents sent to Dr Eminson and set out the questions which they would ask her to address. 31. On 25 March 1998, in discussions between the applicants' solicitors and the local authority, it was indicated that the applicants were no longer happy with Dr Eminson. 32. On 1 April 1998 the local authority held a case conference to review the situation. It was found that the parents had not cooperated with the local authority assessment, or that their cooperation was superficial. A combination of excuses and evasiveness had made it impossible to hold more than one meeting. There still appeared to be a complete denial about events in the United States. The local authority's solicitor had spoken with the district attorney involved in the case in California and reported a number of allegations, including the concern that P. suffered from MSBP as shown by her own medical history, that C. had impersonated a therapist in trying to convince P.'s probation officer that she was complying with an order and that P. had harassed Dr Shreier and the district attorney by telephone calls. It was noted that P. and C. were unwilling to see the expert proposed by the local authority. It was decided to take out an emergency protection order at the child's birth as there was “reason to believe that the baby would be at risk of significant harm if left in the care of his/her parents; there has been no genuine cooperation from the parents and it would be impossible for the Social Services... to manage the risk without legal jurisdiction which includes removal in the first instance. An application for interim care proceedings would require notice and [there were] reasons to believe that the parents would evade the authorities”. The address of the foster placement was to be kept secret to avoid harassment or an attempt to remove the child. The parents were to be told about the intention to take legal action in general terms. 33. On 7 April 1998 the applicants' solicitors confirmed that P. and C. would see Dr Eminson. They attended an appointment on 28 April 1998. 34. On 8 April 1998 Dr Schreier wrote to the local authority, expressing grave concern and recommending the removal of the baby at birth and strict supervision of contact as there was a high level of risk of harm from P. 35. On 30 April 1998 the local authority was approached by C.'s mother, asking whether the child could be placed with her. The local authority decided to raise the matter with Dr Eminson as part of her assessment. 36. Notes dated 6 May 1998 of a discussion between the assistant director (social services) and Dr Eminson included the doctor's view that the basis upon which to work with the parents was extremely limited given the absence of acceptance/agreement about concerns over the unborn baby or the past history in America. She had found that the parents were not prepared to discuss the real issues with her, that C. was mainly interested in the battle with the authorities and that the couple showed little concern for or awareness of the key issue, that of the safety of the unborn baby. Although a definitive conclusion was difficult, the risk factors were not in her view sufficiently worrying to justify not telling the parents about the proposed application for an emergency protection order at birth. While the possibility of further assessment with the couple and newborn baby at a residential facility was not ruled out, this was not possible at that time due to the limited degree of cooperation and commitment of the parents. 37. By 30 April 1998 it was becoming likely that, due to the lie of the baby, P. would have to have a Caesarean section instead of the planned delivery at home. The midwife reported that the consultant Dr Maresh wanted P. to be admitted on 6 May 1998 for an elective Caesarean, but that P. had refused and gone home. The midwife was noted in the social-work records as having become very angry with P. and C. for resisting medical advice and, later, for having claimed that they had been lucky to get a live baby. 38. On 7 May 1998, at 4.42 a.m., S. was born by Caesarean surgery. C. had brought P. to the hospital when her waters broke at home. 39. The local authority applied for an emergency protection order at about 10.30 a.m. They contacted the hospital concerning the possibility of staff supervising the baby at the hospital. After discussions, it was confirmed to the local authority by the hospital management that, even with security measures, they could not guarantee the baby's safety. The Government stated that the hospital was concerned by the difficult behaviour of a friend of P.'s who demanded to be present during the operation and had to be threatened with removal by security guards, and the aggressive attitude of P.'s friends and family towards staff after the birth. The applicants have stated that there is no evidence for these allegations in the records. Notes in the hospital records indicated that at 3.30 p.m. Dr Maresh had stated that he would prefer the visit of the social workers to be deferred, as the news might upset P. and cause a rise in blood pressure. 40. At about 4 p.m. it was decided to serve the emergency protection order on the applicants with a view to removing S. to foster care. According to the Government, C.'s mother refused to allow S. to be removed and C.'s father threatened to follow the social workers and the baby. Safe departure from the hospital was only achieved with the assistance of the hospital staff. The applicants stated that there was no evidence for this in the records, although they accepted that the family were very upset when S. was removed, and C.'s mother pleaded with the social workers not to let S. go to strangers. 41. A contact visit was arranged on 8 May 1998, attended by C. and his parents. While social services had considered taking S. back to the hospital for visits while P. was an inpatient, it was felt that it was not in the interests of S. as a newborn baby to be transported on a trip of some twenty-five to thirty miles. 42. P. remained in the delivery unit due to concerns about her blood pressure. It was noted by her consultant that she was very clearly distraught about events. She was prescribed drugs to suppress lactation and anti-hypertensive medication. She was discharged on 10 May 1998. 43. The local authority meanwhile applied to the court for a care order under the Children Act 1989. 44. P. and C. were allowed supervised contact with S., initially three times a week. The first visit occurred on 11 May 1998. P. and C. applied for more access and were supported by the guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent S. Contact increased to four times a week from 15 June 1998. S. also had contact with her maternal and paternal grandparents. 45. P. and C. developed an excellent relationship with their baby daughter S. The notes made by the supervising officials were positive and complimentary. The paternal grandparents were also observed to have a caring and attentive relationship with her. 46. On 13 May 1998 the local authority suspended the assessment of the paternal grandparents which had commenced after their approach to the local authority on 30 April 1998. This was to await the directions of the court, as advised by their counsel. The grandparents were advised of this on 14 May 1998. 47. On 14 May 1998 the case was transferred from the county court to the High Court on grounds of complexity. 48. Dr Eminson issued her report on 29 June 1998, stating that in order to assess the risk to S. it would be necessary to obtain, inter alia, a psychiatric assessment of P. and her capacity to change and a comprehensive social work assessment of each family member, including the grandparents, as regards their capacity to care for and protect S. 49. On 31 July 1998 the timetable for the proceedings was set by a circuit judge and the hearing date fixed for February 1999. It was directed that the assessment of the grandparents should be undertaken by an expert but that the local authority should provide the factual background. 50. In a report dated 21 September 1998, a social worker recorded the factual investigation into the paternal grandparents. 51. In his report dated 28 September 1998 for the guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent S., Dr Davis, a consultant paediatrician, found, inter alia, a clear and chronic pattern including unexplained symptoms suggesting that P. suffered from a severe illness; a definitive episode of poisoning; non-appearance of symptoms when the child was supervised by others and resolution of the health problems in the child after separation from the mother; extensive inaccuracies and inconsistencies by P. when repeating her history to different doctors; and exceptionally frequent medical attendance by mother and children. His opinion was that B., and to lesser extent A., had been victims of child abuse on the fabricated illness spectrum. The tendency to fabricate appeared to be ongoing (references were made to P.'s conduct during her pregnancy with S.: she had, for example, complained of ulcer symptoms but no ulcer was found, and she had referred to a stomach tumour which was presumably a besore [A condition caused by the swallowing of hair and the biting of hair and nails] removed in 1994). His view, strongly expressed, was that the risks to S. of rehabilitation with P. outweighed the advantages. 52. On 17 and 18 November 1998, the local authority informed P. and C. of their intention to apply for a freeing for adoption order under the Adoption Act 1976. 53. On 26 November 1998 Dr Maresh, P.'s obstetrics consultant, gave a statement indicating that it was clear to him that P. was aware that there was a strong possibility that her baby would be taken away from her at birth and that this made it difficult for her to stay at the hospital. He noted that during her pregnancy the number of assessments that P. was undergoing had sometimes interfered with the making of ante-natal appointments. 54. On 10 December 1998 Dr Bentovim issued his psychiatric report. (i) It was noted that, during his meetings with P., she had been superficially cooperative. She had considered that the test which found a laxative in B.'s stools could have been a false positive. She accepted that B. had been hospitalised too often and that she had allowed emotional harm to come to him. Her explanation was that she had been a victim of the divorce process and suffered considerable financial stress. The only statement by P. in which she appeared to take responsibility for exaggerating B.'s illness was when she said that she had exaggerated the number of loose stools that he had had. There was a sense of evasiveness and minimisation, even a degree of trivialisation of what was discussed. It was difficult to tell whether some events referred to by P. were a constructed reality or had really happened. (ii) As regards C., his research attempted to show that health practitioners sometimes developed a perspective where they created the notion that the parent was inducing illness in a child, thus demonstrating the misuse and fallibility of medical authority. C. had stated that there was nothing to suggest that P. would harm S. He was prepared to look after S. alone if necessary. Together, P. and C. had stated that they would undertake any therapeutic work with a view to obtaining care of S. without, however, acknowledging that there was a problem as far as P. was concerned. (iii) As regards the paternal grandparents, they tended to agree with the parents' analysis of the situation and found it hard to face up to the fact that P.'s actions had given rise to major concerns about her potential to harm. There were positive factors in their favour (such as their commitment and desire to protect S.). However, the main problem if S. were placed with them would be their age when S. reached her adolescent phase of development. (iv) The report found that P. had a personality disorder, including a factitious disorder, as disclosed by her gross exaggeration of having had ovarian cancer and statements about miscarriages as well as the fabrication and exaggeration of B.'s symptoms. While P. had indicated a willingness to accept therapeutic work, which would have to be prolonged and required considerable motivation to change, she had not accepted how extensive such change needed to be. As regarded a possible referral to the Cassell Hospital, it was noted that this would require considerable commitment on the part of both parents. Although the couple had indicated a willingness to enter such a therapeutic setting, P.'s level of motivation was limited. It might, however, be advantageous for P. to be admitted to a special clinic for a further detailed assessment of whether a referral to Cassell Hospital would be appropriate. (v) The report concluded that C. was not himself a direct risk to S. but was so indirectly. He embraced his wife's views and had a limited understanding of the local authority's concerns. Similarly, the grandparents would be protective of S. if she were placed in their care but, as they would be in their 70s when S. was 14 years old, they would have increasing difficulties in meeting her growing emotional needs. It was therefore difficult to consider them as possible long- or short-term carers because S. needed to be in a secure long-term placement by her first birthday. As regards contact, the fact that the fabrication of symptoms was not life-threatening meant that contact would need less rigorous supervision than in the case of more life-threatening abuse. 55. On 16 December 1998 the local authority made an application to free S. for adoption. 56. The local authority care plan dated 13 January 1999 stated that placement of S. with both parents would pose a serious risk to her. As the circumstances in which C. intended to offer to care for S. on his own were unclear, the concerns about her protection remained. Regarding the paternal grandparents, it was noted that they had not shared the concerns in respect of the risk to S. if she were placed with her parents, and that Dr Bentovim did not support placement with them, particularly because of their age. The local authority's view was that the care plan for S. should be permanent, secured by adoption, and that she needed to be placed with an adoptive family as soon as possible. 57. At a hearing, which began on 2 February 1999 and ended on 1 March 1999, the High Court heard the local authority's application for a care order in respect of S. The local authority informed the judge that there were nine families available and wanting to adopt S. P. and C. were parties, as were S.'s paternal grandparents, while S. was represented by a professional guardian ad litem, solicitors and both senior and junior counsel. 58. On 4 February 1999 C. applied for leave to withdraw from the proceedings, on the ground that he saw no prospect of success in obtaining custody of S. and that the stress of the proceedings was likely to lead to a breakdown in his health. On 5 February 1999 the judge granted him leave to withdraw. C.'s parents also withdrew from the proceedings. 59. On the same date P.'s legal representatives (leading counsel and solicitors) withdrew from the case, informing the judge that her legal aid had been withdrawn. It was later stated by the judge that they had withdrawn because P. was asking them to conduct the case unreasonably. In fact, her legal aid had not withdrawn, as the judge made clear in his judgment. The legal-aid certificate could not be formally discharged until P. had been given the opportunity to show why that should not happen. 60. P. asked for an adjournment until 9 February 1999, which was granted. On that date P. asked for a further adjournment in order to apply for the reinstatement of her legal-aid certificate. 61. The judge refused the adjournment. As a result of this decision, P. conducted her own case, assisted by a “McKenzie friend”, Mrs H. The applicant stated that she found conducting her own case immensely difficult. At one stage, she told the judge that she simply could not continue because she was so distressed. That was after cross-examining her own husband C., which she found very painful. However, the judge said that she should carry on. The solicitor for the guardian ad litem and a social worker visited P. that evening to persuade her to carry on. 62. In his judgment, the judge explained his refusal of an adjournment: “In the first place I was satisfied that the mother had a very clear grasp of the voluminous documentation, at least as good and if not better a grasp than the lawyers in the case. Secondly, it was clear to me from the documents that the mother, who is an intelligent woman, was fully able to put her case in a clear and coherent way, an assessment that has been amply borne out by the hearing itself. Thirdly, I was confident that the Bar, in the form of leading and junior counsel for the local authority and the guardian ad litem, would not only treat the mother fairly but in the tradition of the Bar would assist her in the presentation of any points she wished to advance, in so far as it would be professionally proper for them to do so. Once again that assessment has been fully justified by the conduct of counsel during the hearing. As examples, the local authority both facilitated and paid for the attendance of Dr Toseland, consultant toxicologist, to attend as part of the mother's case. Junior counsel for the local authority ... struggled manfully to ensure that the mother had a complete set of the ever growing documentation. There were other examples. Fourthly, the outcome of the case seemed to me to hinge or be likely to hinge substantially on the mother's cross-examination, an area of the case in which the ability of lawyers to protect her was limited. Finally, and most importantly, I was concerned about the prejudice to [S.] of what would have had to have been a very lengthy adjournment. Section 1(2) of the Children Act expresses the general principle that delay in resolving a child's future is prejudicial to that child's welfare. In this particular case intensive preparation for the hearing had been going on effectively since [S.'s] birth in May 1998 and up until the outset of the hearing before me the mother had had the benefit of advice from her lawyers, latterly of course from leading counsel. An adjournment would have involved a very substantial delay in resolving [S.'s] future. The hearing was estimated to last, and did indeed, last something in the order of twenty working days. A fresh legal team, assuming legal aid was restored, would have needed a substantial amount of time to master the voluminous documentation and to take instructions. Twenty days of court time simply cannot be conjured out of thin air. Furthermore the evidence of Dr ... Bentovim, the consultant child psychiatrist jointly instructed to advise me, amongst other things, on [S.'s] placement, was that a decision on her long-term future needed to be both made and if possible implemented before her first birthday. The consequence of the events I have described was that the mother has been obliged to conduct her case in person with the assistance of a McKenzie friend, Mrs [H.]. In their closing submissions Mr David Harris QC and Miss Roddy for the guardian ad litem paid tribute to the manner in which the mother had conducted her case. They described her as fighting bravely, resourcefully and skilfully for the return of her daughter. I would like to echo that tribute. I would also like to express my gratitude to the mother's McKenzie friend ... who was clearly a considerable support to the mother throughout the case. If the mother had been represented by counsel her case would, I think, have been conducted differently, but I am entirely satisfied that the result would have been the same. As so often happens the mother was given a latitude which would not be given to a litigant who was legally represented. For example, I allowed her to call a witness, Professor Robinson, who had not provided a statement prior to the hearing. I was also prepared for her to call a consultant psychologist who had given evidence in the American proceedings, Dr [P.], who in the event was unable to attend. I also allowed the mother to cross-examine witnesses twice ... I have throughout the hearing endeavoured to ensure that the mother was treated fairly. .... I am the first to acknowledge that the courtroom is not a friendly environment and ... that those who are not used to it find it difficult. However much experience the mother may have had of the legal system in the United States of America, I accept ... that she is not a lawyer. Further, the hearing has had in [S.'s] interests to delve into matters which were highly distressing to the parents and which are normally intensely private and would have remained private. It is my judgment that the mother's case has been fully heard and that the hearing has been fair ... I reject any suggestion that had the mother been legally represented the result would have been different.” 63. On 8 March 1999 the judge made a care order. In reaching his decision, he did not consider himself bound by the American conviction and reached his own findings of fact on the available material, which included a substantial volume of documents from the United States and expert reports. He concluded beyond reasonable doubt that B.'s diarrhoea had been caused by laxative abuse on the part of P. on one occasion and, on a balance of probabilities, that abuse was the most likely cause of B.'s diarrhoea on two further occasions. He went on: “I am therefore in no doubt and so find that [B.] did suffer harm in the care of his mother. In my judgment that harm was not limited to his physical health. I accept the argument of the local authority that he also suffered serious psychological harm. ...” 64. While the judge accepted that P. had not put S. at risk during her pregnancy and that the parents' treatment of S. during contact sessions had been exemplary, he found that P. suffered from a personality disorder, and that such people were very difficult to treat and did not change easily. He considered that P. was in a state of deep denial about what had happened to her son B. and the potential risk that she posed to her daughter S. He referred to the expert evidence “that to receive help P. would need to accept that she remains a potentially dangerous person to S.” and “that is impossible even to start where the mother is in denial to the extent that this mother plainly is”. He noted that Dr Bentovim had found a small acknowledgment about her role in B.'s illness, but that P. had challenged the accuracy of his report on this point and embarked on a high-risk strategy of launching an outright attack on the American evidence. “At the end of a very careful and thorough cross-examination by the guardian ad litem, Dr Bentovim agreed ... that given the depth and longevity of the mother's state of denial, and given that the father had embraced it fully, the time scale for any therapeutic work with the mother designed to bring her to a state of understanding of and ability to address the risk posed to S. was way outside the time scale during which S. could be kept waiting for a permanent placement. Dr Bentovim's conclusion, reached I think with some regret, was that in the circumstances there could be no question of reunification of S. with her mother.” 65. The judge found that C. was incapable of altering his emotional perception of P. or of accepting that she was responsible for harming her son B., although with a different woman as a partner he would have been able to bring up and care for a child. The direction of the case could have been altered if C. had acknowledged that there was a serious risk to be guarded against. C. was dominated by the mother and unable to put S.'s interests and the need to protect her first. The judge concluded that S.'s moral or physical health would be endangered by leaving her with her parents. 66. On 15 March 1999 the same High Court judge heard the application to free S. for adoption. The transcript of his previous judgment was not yet available. The final order of 15 March 1999 listed P., C. and S. as respondents. According to the applicants, C. was present throughout and was specifically asked in court if he consented to a freeing for adoption order being made, and C. indicated that he was not. 67. At the commencement of the hearing, P. informed the court that without legal representation she was significantly disadvantaged and was being deprived of a proper opportunity to advance her case. Both P. and C. had valid legal-aid certificates. The judge declined to defer the proceedings, finding that P. was capable of representing her interests and that she would have been put on notice by her lawyers at an earlier stage that the freeing for adoption application would follow the care order. Although he noted that there might appear to be “an element of railroading”, on balancing the parents' interests against the need for S. to have her future decided at the earliest possible opportunity, he considered that S.'s interests prevailed. On the issue of the freeing for adoption application, the judge concluded that the parents were withholding their consent to adoption unreasonably as they should have accepted, in the light of the previous proceedings, that there was no realistic prospect of the rehabilitation of S. to their care. He therefore issued an order freeing S. for adoption. That permanently severed legal ties between S. and her parents. As regards contact, he stated: “I'm assured by [the local authority] that there will be conventional letter-box contact. But it will in due course (if an adoption order is made) be essentially a matter for the adoptive parents as to precisely what contact [S.] has with her natural family.” 68. The judge refused P. leave to appeal against the order. Her renewed application before the Court of Appeal was refused after a hearing on 5 July 1999, where she and C. appeared in person. Although the Court of Appeal noted that C. was not a party to the appeal, it referred to the fact that C. had addressed the court at some length on the issues. It noted that that the trial was of exceptional complexity, with enormous documentation, much expert evidence and lasting twenty days. It found, however, that the judge had carefully and thoroughly weighed all the issues of fact and that he had been meticulous throughout in ensuring fairness. No error of law or any failure of procedural fairness had been demonstrated. 69. The last contact visit by P. and C. with S. was on 21 July 1999. 70. On 2 September 1999 S. was placed for adoption with a family. On 13 October 1999 the local authority informed P. and C. that S. had been placed with adopters. 71. S. was adopted by an order made on 27 March 2000. P. and C. were informed on 27 April 2000. 72. The adoption order made no provision for future direct contact between S. and her parents. Any such contact was now at the discretion of the adoptive parents. By letter dated 6 July 2000, the local authority informed P. and C. that they could have limited indirect contact with S., namely, through Christmas and birthday cards, and presents. By letter dated 17 November 2000, the local authority informed them that contact was reduced at the request of the adopters to a letter from the parents once a year. 73. Section 47 of the Children Act 1989 provides: “(1) Where a local authority ... (b) have reasonable cause to suspect that a child who lives, or is found, in their area is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm, the authority shall make, or cause to be made, such enquiries as they consider necessary to enable them to decide whether they should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.” 74. Whenever a court determines any matter in relation to the upbringing of a child, it must have regard to the provisions of the Children Act 1989, section 1, which requires that the court's paramount consideration must be the welfare of the child. The court is empowered to make care orders or supervision orders where it is satisfied that (a) the child concerned is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm; (b) the harm, or likelihood of harm, is attributable to the care given to the child, or likely to be given to him/her if the order were not made; and (c) that care is not what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him/her (section 31). 75. Where an application is made for a care order, the local authority which is to take over the care of a child must set out the plan by which it intends to meet the welfare needs of the child (including details of contact) – the “care plan”. Government guidance at the time emphasised: “Where a child is in the care of a local authority, the Children Act 1989 places a duty on them to make all reasonable efforts to rehabilitate the child with his or her family whenever possible unless it is clear that the child can no longer live with his family or that the authority has sufficient evidence to suggest that further attempts at rehabilitation are unlikely to succeed.” (LAC(98)20 Appendix 4) 76. The courts' approach was similar: “The principle has to be that the local authority works to support, and eventually to reunite, the family, unless the risks are so high that the child's welfare requires alternative family care” (Lady Justice Hale in Re C and B (Children) (Care Order: Future Harm) [2000] 1 Family Law Reports 611) 77. Adoption is the primary avenue in the United Kingdom by which permanent alternative care is provided for children who cannot be brought up within their own family. An adoption order, which is effectively irrevocable, gives parental responsibility to the adopters and extinguishes the pre-existing parental responsibility. 78. By virtue of section 16, an adoption order may not be made unless the child is free for adoption, or both parents have consented or their consent had been dispensed with on specified grounds. 79. Before a local authority can apply for an application to free a child for adoption, the plan for adoption must be placed before an adoption panel. In the absence of parental consent, a local authority may apply for a freeing for adoption order where the child is in the care of the local authority. The test to be applied by the courts in determining whether or not to dispense with parental consent includes the ground that the parent is withholding agreement unreasonably (section 16(2)(b)). A recent judicial approach to that test suggested that the judge should consider whether, having regard to the evidence and applying the current values of society, the advantages of adoption for the welfare of the child appeared sufficiently strong to justify overriding the views and interests of the objecting parent (Re C (A Minor) (Adoption: Parental Agreement: Contact) [1993] 2 Family Law Reports 260).","['6', '8']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
50,001-61521,ENG,BGR,CHAMBER,2003,CASE OF M.C. v. BULGARIA,1,Violation of Art. 3 and 8;No separate issue under Art. 13;Not necessary to examine Art. 14;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"9. The applicant is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1980. 10. She alleged that she had been raped by two men on 31 July and 1 August 1995, when she was 14 years and 10 months old. The ensuing investigation came to the conclusion that there was insufficient proof of the applicant having been compelled to have sex. 11. On 31 July 1995 the applicant and a friend of hers had been waiting to enter a disco bar in the town of K., when three men, P. (21 years old at the time), A. (20 years old at the time) and V.A. (age not specified), arrived in a car owned by P. The applicant knew P. and A. She had met P. in the same disco bar and had danced with him once. A. was the older brother of a classmate of hers. 12. A. invited the applicant to go with him and his friends to a disco bar in a small town 17 km away. According to the applicant, she agreed on condition that she would be back home before 11 p.m. 13. In the bar, one or two of the group had drinks. The applicant saw some friends, with whom she had a short chat. According to the applicant, she repeatedly told the others it was time to leave, as it was getting late. 14. At some time late in the evening, the group left and headed back to K. On the way, they were briefly stopped and checked by traffic police. 15. A. then suggested stopping for a swim at a nearby reservoir. According to the applicant, they went there despite her objections. She submitted that she had not suspected the men's intentions. 16. At the reservoir, the applicant remained in the car, in the front passenger seat, saying that she was not interested in swimming. The three men headed towards the water. Soon afterwards, P. came back and sat in the front seat next to the applicant. 17. In her statements to the investigating authorities, the applicant submitted that P. had then pressed his body against hers, proposed that they “become friends” and started kissing her. The applicant had refused his advances and had asked him to leave. P. had persisted in kissing her while she had tried to push him back. He had then moved the car seat back to a horizontal position, grabbed her hands and pressed them against her back. The applicant had been scared and at the same time embarrassed by the fact that she had put herself in such a situation. She had not had the strength to resist violently or scream. Her efforts to push P. back had been unsuccessful, as he had been far stronger. P. had undressed her partially and had forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. 18. In her testimony, the applicant stated: “It was my first time and it hurt a lot. I felt sick and I wanted to throw up. I started crying.” 19. According to P.'s statements, he had had sex with the applicant in the car with her full consent. He had started kissing her, she had responded, and he had tried unsuccessfully to unbutton her jeans or loosen her belt, whereupon she had done so herself and had taken off her pants. 20. After P. had finished, he left the car and walked towards A. and V.A. In his submissions to the police, A. said that P. had told them that he had “shagged” the applicant. Shortly afterwards, the three men returned to the car and the group drove off. 21. In her submissions to the investigator, the applicant stated that she had later come to suspect that the three men had planned to have sex with her and had invented the pretext of swimming to drive to a deserted area. In particular, she did not remember A. and V.A. being wet when they had come back to the car, although they had insisted on going to the reservoir for a swim. 22. The applicant later testified that after the first rape she had been very disturbed and had cried most of the time. According to the version of events given by P. and A. when later questioned, the applicant had been in an excellent mood, had started caressing A., which had irritated P., and had asked to go to a bar or a restaurant. The group had gone to a restaurant, where the applicant had briefly talked with a Ms T., the singer performing there. Ms T. had been sitting at a table there with one Mr M. 23. Ms T., the singer, stated that on 1 August 1995 she had been in the restaurant with Mr M. Shortly after midnight the applicant, whom she knew vaguely, had approached her and asked whether her group would be performing in the next few days. Ms T. recalled having seen at that moment a man waiting at the door. Having heard the answer to her question, the applicant had left. Ms T. stated that the applicant had appeared cheerful and that there had been nothing unusual in her behaviour. 24. Mr M. was also questioned by the police. He stated that he knew the applicant very well and that he did not remember having seen her that night. 25. The applicant disputed the statements of P., A., V.A. and Ms T., maintaining that there had been no visit to a restaurant and that she did not know Ms T. The applicant and her mother later accused Ms T. of perjury (see paragraphs 66-68 below). 26. Instead of returning to K., at around 3 a.m. the group went to a neighbouring town, where V.A.'s relatives had a house. A., V.A. and the applicant got out of the car. P., who was the owner of the car, drove off. 27. The three men and a baker, Mr S., called by them as a witness, later maintained that in the meantime there had been a short stop at Mr S.'s bakery. Mr S. allegedly had the key to the house. Mr S., when interrogated, stated that at about 2 a.m. he had given the key to V.A. and had seen the applicant waiting in the car, apparently in a good mood. Loud music had been coming from the car. The applicant disputed that there had been any visit to a baker's shop and accused the baker of perjury. P., A. and V.A. submitted in their statements that they had decided to go to the house as the applicant had told them that she had quarrelled with her mother and did not want to go back home. 28. The applicant stated to the police that she had felt helpless and in need of protection. As A. was the brother of a classmate of hers, she had expected such protection from him and had followed him and V.A. into a room on the ground floor of the house. 29. There was one bed in the room and the applicant sat on it. The two men smoked and talked for a while. V.A. then left the room. 30. The applicant maintained that at that point A. had sat next to her, pushed her down onto the bed, undressed her and forced her to have sex with him. The applicant had not had the strength to resist violently. She had only begged the man to stop. She later related in her statement: “I started crying and asked him to stop ... He started caressing my breasts and sucking my neck ... At some point he took my jeans and my pants off with his feet. Then he spread my legs apart with his legs and forced his way into me ... [After he finished] I started crying and I continued crying until some time in the morning, when I fell asleep ... [V.A.] woke me up telling me that [A.] had gone to find a car to drive me back to K. I sat on the bed and started crying.” 31. A.'s position before the police was that he had had sex with the applicant with her full consent. 32. On the following morning at around 7 a.m., the applicant's mother found her daughter in the house of V.A.'s relatives. The applicant's mother stated that, having learned from neighbours that her daughter had been seen the previous evening with A., she had been on her way to A.'s house when she had met V.A. in the street. V.A. had allegedly tried to mislead the applicant's mother in an effort to gain time and warn A. However, she had insisted. 33. The applicant and her mother maintained in their submissions during the investigation that the applicant had told her mother right away that she had been raped. A. had also been there. He had told the applicant's mother that “a truck driver” had had sex with her daughter the previous night. 34. According to A.'s version of events, the applicant and her mother had quarrelled, the applicant allegedly refusing to go with her and telling her to go away. A neighbour, apparently named as a witness by A. or V.A., stated that he had heard the quarrel and, in particular, the refusal of the applicant to leave with her mother and her saying that nothing had happened to her. The applicant accused the witness of perjury. 35. The applicant and her mother went directly to the local hospital, where they were directed to see a forensic medical examiner. The applicant was examined at about 4 p.m. 36. The medical examiner found that the hymen had been freshly torn. He also noted grazing on the applicant's neck, measuring 35 mm by 4 mm, and four small oval-shaped bruises. As noted in the medical certificate, the applicant had reported only one rape, stating that it had occurred between 10.30 and 11 p.m. the previous day at the reservoir. 37. The applicant submitted that during the next few days she had refused to talk to her mother about the incident. She had given no details and had not mentioned the second rape at all. She explained that she lived in a conservative small-town environment where virginity was considered to be an asset for marriage. She felt ashamed of the fact that she had “failed to protect her virginity” and of “what people would say about it”. 38. On the first evening after the events, on 1 August 1995, P. visited the applicant's family. The applicant and her mother stated that that evening P. had begged for forgiveness and had claimed that he would marry the applicant when she came of age. The applicant's mother had considered that accepting the offer would be reasonable in the circumstances. This had influenced the initial behaviour of the applicant, who had accepted her mother's idea of minimising the damage. 39. On one of the following evenings, the applicant went out with P. and some of his friends. 40. P. and V.A., the latter claiming that he had been with P. during the visit to the applicant's house on the evening of 1 August 1995, stated that the applicant's mother had told them that “all pleasure must be paid for” and had tried to extort money from them. 41. P.'s grandmother also made a statement to the police. She asserted that on an unspecified date the applicant's mother had visited her, trying to extort money. 42. With regard to that visit and other relevant events, Mrs D., a neighbour and friend of the applicant's mother, stated that the applicant's mother had been very upset about the events and had agreed to her daughter going out with P. as he had maintained that he loved the applicant. The applicant's mother had nevertheless decided to talk to P.'s parents. On an unspecified date Mrs D. and another neighbour had approached the house of P.'s family, but his grandmother had told them to go away, stating that the applicant had slept not only with P. but also with A. At that moment A. had arrived. Mrs D. had asked him whether it was true that he had slept with the applicant. He had confirmed that it was true, adding that he had the money and power to do as he pleased. Until then, the applicant's mother had not known about the second rape. 43. The applicant submitted that a visit by A.'s father on 8 August 1995 had caused her to break down. She had then confided to her mother about the second rape. On 10 August 1995 the applicant's father returned home, after being absent for several days. The family discussed the matter and decided to file a complaint. The applicant's mother did so on 11 August 1995. 44. On 11 August 1995 the applicant made a written statement about the events of 31 July and 1 August. On the same day P. and A. were arrested and made written statements. They claimed that the applicant had had sexual intercourse with them of her own free will. The two men were released. Written statements were also made by V.A. and a person who lived next to the house where the second alleged rape had taken place. On 25 August 1995 a police officer drew up a report and forwarded the file to the competent prosecutor. 45. On 14 November 1995 the district prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into the alleged rape and referred the case to an investigator. No charges were brought. 46. No action was taken on the case between November 1995 and November 1996. 47. On 24 August 1995 P. and A. filed complaints with the district prosecutor's office, stating that the applicant and her mother had been harassing them by making false public accusations. 48. On the basis of these complaints, on 28 August 1995, the district prosecutor ordered a police inquiry. In September and October 1995 several persons were heard and made written statements. 49. On 25 October 1995 a police officer drew up a report apparently accrediting the allegations of P. and A. and disbelieving the version of the facts as submitted by the applicant and her mother. 50. On 27 October 1995 the file was transmitted to the district prosecutor's office with jurisdiction to decide whether or not to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant and her mother. It appears that the matter was left hanging and no decision was taken. 51. Between 2 November and 9 December 1996 the investigator questioned the applicant, her mother and other witnesses. P. and A. were heard as witnesses. 52. The applicant gave a detailed account of the facts, repeating that P. had overcome her resistance by pressing her against the car seat and twisting her hands, and that thereafter she had been in a state of shock and unable to resist A. 53. In his evidence, P. claimed that the applicant had actively responded to his advances. He also asserted that the applicant had spoken with Mr M. at the restaurant they had allegedly gone to after having sex. 54. Both A. and P. stated, inter alia, that shortly after having sex with P. at the reservoir, the applicant had started caressing A. in the car. 55. On 18 December 1996 the investigator completed his work on the case. He drew up a report stating that there was no evidence that P. and A. had used threats or violence, and proposed that the prosecutor close the case. 56. On 7 January 1997 the district prosecutor ordered an additional investigation. The order stated that the initial investigation had not been objective, thorough or complete. 57. On 16 January 1997 the investigator to whom the case had been referred appointed a psychiatrist and a psychologist to answer several questions. The experts were asked, inter alia, whether it was likely that the applicant would have spoken calmly with Ms T., the singer at the restaurant, and then listened to music in the car, if she had just been raped and whether it was likely that several days after the alleged rape the applicant would have gone out with the person who had raped her. 58. The experts considered that, owing to her naivety and inexperience, the applicant had apparently not considered the possibility that she might be sexually assaulted. There was no indication that she had been threatened or hurt, or that she had been in a state of shock during the events, as she had demonstrated a clear recollection of them. The experts considered that during the events she must have been suddenly overwhelmed by an internal conflict between a natural sexual interest and a sense that the act was reprehensible, which had “reduced her ability to resist and defend herself”. They further found that the applicant was psychologically sound and that she had understood the meaning of the events. In view of her age at the time, however, she “could not assert a stable set of convictions”. 59. The experts also found that, if there had indeed been a meeting between Ms T. and the applicant after the events at the reservoir – and this was disputed – it was still possible that the applicant could have had a short exchange with Ms T. after being raped. As to the applicant going out with P. several days after the events, this could be easily explained by her family's desire to lend a socially acceptable meaning to the incident. 60. On 28 February 1997 the investigator concluded his work on the case and drew up a report, again proposing that the case should be closed. He considered that the experts' opinion did not affect his earlier finding that there was no evidence demonstrating the use of force or threats. 61. On 17 March 1997 the district prosecutor ordered the closure of the criminal investigation. He found, inter alia, that the use of force or threats had not been established beyond reasonable doubt. In particular, no resistance on the applicant's part or attempts to seek help from others had been established. 62. The applicant lodged consecutive appeals with the regional prosecutor's office and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office. The appeals were dismissed in decisions of 13 May and 24 June 1997 respectively. 63. The prosecutors relied, inter alia, on the statements of the alleged perpetrators and V.A. that the applicant had not shown any signs of distress after having sex with P. at the reservoir, and the evidence of the three men and Ms T. that the latter had met the applicant and had spoken with her that night. As regards the applicant's objections that those statements should be rejected as being untrue, the decision of 13 May 1997 stated that “prosecutors' decisions cannot be based on suppositions, and witnesses' statements cannot be rejected only on the basis of doubts, without other evidence ...”. 64. The decision of 13 May 1997 also stated: “It is true that, as can be seen from the report of the forensic psychiatric experts, the young age of the applicant and her lack of experience in life meant that she was unable to assert a stable set of convictions, namely to demonstrate firmly her unwillingness to engage in sexual contact. There can be no criminal act under Article 152 §§ 1 (2) and 3 of the Criminal Code, however, unless the applicant was coerced into having sexual intercourse by means of physical force or threats. This presupposes resistance, but there is no evidence of resistance in this particular case. P. and A. could be held criminally responsible only if they understood that they were having sexual intercourse without the applicant's consent and if they used force or made threats precisely with the aim of having sexual intercourse against the applicant's will. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant demonstrated unwillingness to have sexual intercourse and that P. and A. used threats or force.” It was further noted that the applicant had explained that the bruises on her neck had been caused by sucking. 65. The decision of 24 June 1997 reiterated those findings, while noting that the statements of Ms T., the singer at the restaurant, were not decisive. It also stated: “What is decisive in the present case is that it has not been established beyond reasonable doubt that physical or psychological force was used against the applicant and that sexual intercourse took place against her will and despite her resistance. There are no traces of physical force such as bruises, torn clothing, etc. ... It is true that it is unusual for a girl who is under age and a virgin to have sexual intercourse twice within a short space of time with two different people, but this fact alone is not sufficient to establish that a criminal act took place, in the absence of other evidence and in view of the impossibility of collecting further evidence.” 66. In June or July 1997 the applicant and her mother requested the institution of criminal proceedings against Ms T. and other witnesses, including V.A., alleging that they had committed perjury in that their statements in connection with the investigation into the rape of the applicant had been false. 67. On 14 July 1997 the same prosecutor from the district prosecutor's office who had ordered the closure of the rape investigation refused the request, stating that it was unfounded and even abusive, as all the facts had been clarified in previous proceedings. 68. An ensuing appeal by the applicant was dismissed on 6 February 1998 by the regional prosecutor's office. 69. In June 2001 the applicant submitted a written opinion by two Bulgarian experts, Dr Svetlozar Vasilev, a psychiatrist, and Mr Valeri Ivanov, a psychologist, who had been asked by the applicant's lawyer to comment on the case. 70. The experts stated, with reference to scientific publications in several countries, that two patterns of response by rape victims to their attacker were known: violent physical resistance and “frozen fright” (also known as “traumatic psychological infantilism syndrome”). The latter was explained by the fact that any experience-based model of behaviour was inadequate when the victim was faced with the inevitability of rape. As a result the victim, terrorised, often adopted a passive-response model of submission, characteristic of childhood, or sought a psychological dissociation from the event, as if it were not happening to her. 71. The experts stated that all the scientific publications they had studied indicated that the “frozen-fright pattern” prevailed. Further, they had conducted their own research for the purposes of their written opinion in the present case. They had analysed all the cases of young women aged 14 to 20 who had contacted two specialised treatment programmes for victims of violence in Bulgaria during the period from 1996 to 2001, declaring that they had been raped. Cases that were too different from that of the applicant had been excluded. As a result, twenty-five cases had been identified, in twenty-four of which the victim had not resisted violently, but had reacted with passive submission. 72. By Article 151 § 1 of the Criminal Code, sexual intercourse with a person under 14 years of age is a punishable offence (statutory rape). Consent is not a valid defence in such cases. 73. Consent is likewise irrelevant where the victim is more than 14 years old, but did not “understand the essence and meaning of the occurrence” (Article 151 § 2 of the Code). That provision has been applied in cases where the victim did not grasp the meaning of the events owing to a mental disorder (see judgment no. 568 of 18 August 1973, case no. 540/73, Supreme Court-I). 74. Article 152 § 1 of the Criminal Code defines rape as: “sexual intercourse with a woman (1) incapable of defending herself, where she did not consent; (2) who was compelled by the use of force or threats; (3) who was brought to a state of helplessness by the perpetrator.” 75. Although lack of consent is mentioned explicitly only in the first sub-paragraph, the Supreme Court has held that it is an element inherent in the whole provision (see judgment no. 568, cited above). 76. According to judicial practice, the three sub-paragraphs of Article 152 § 1 can only be applied alternatively, each of them referring to a separate factual situation. The Supreme Court has held that general references to two or all of the sub-paragraphs are not acceptable (see judgment no. 247 of 24 April 1974, case no. 201/74, Supreme Court-I; judgment no. 59 of 19 May 1992, case no. 288/90, Supreme Court-I; and many others). 77. Therefore, an accused person may be found guilty of rape only if it has been established that he had sexual intercourse with a woman in circumstances covered by one of the three sub-paragraphs. 78. The first and third sub-paragraphs concern particular factual situations where the victim was in a state of helplessness at the time of sexual intercourse. The third sub-paragraph refers to cases where the perpetrator put the victim in a state of helplessness before raping her, whereas the first sub-paragraph refers to cases where he took advantage of the victim's existing state of helplessness. 79. The courts have stated that a victim is in a state of helplessness (“incapable of defending herself” or “brought to a state of helplessness”) only in circumstances where she has no capacity to resist physically owing to disability, old age or illness (see judgment no. 484 of 29 July 1983, case no. 490/83, and judgment no. 568, cited above) or because of the use of alcohol, medicines or drugs (see judgment no. 126 of 11 April 1977, case no. 69/77, Supreme Court-II). 80. The second sub-paragraph is the provision applicable in all other cases of alleged rape. Thus, where no special circumstances such as the state of helplessness of the victim are reported, an investigation into an alleged rape will concentrate on establishing whether or not the victim was coerced into having sexual intercourse by the use of force or threats. 81. It is an established view in the case-law and legal theory that rape under the second sub-paragraph of Article 152 § 1 of the Criminal Code is a “twostep” offence – that is to say, the perpetrator first starts employing force or threats and then penetrates the victim. 82. The parties in the present case offered their views on the meaning of the words “use of force and threats” and their interpretation in practice (see paragraphs 113, 122 and 123 below). 83. The Supreme Court has stated that lack of consent is to be deduced from the fact that a situation covered by one of the three sub-paragraphs of Article 152 § 1 has been established, either from the victim's state of helplessness or from the fact that physical or psychological force has been used (see judgment no. 568, cited above). 84. In one case, the Supreme Court stated that “force” was not only to be understood as direct violence, but could also consist of placing the victim in a situation such that she could see no other solution than to submit against her will (see judgment no. 520 of 19 July 1973, case no. 414/73). In that particular case, the perpetrator, after demonstrating his desire for close relations with the victim by his behaviour over a period of two or three days (following her and trying to hold her and kiss her), entered her room, locked the door and asked her to undress. She refused, whereupon he tried to spread her legs apart. Realising that she had no other choice, the victim opened the window and jumped, sustaining serious injury. The perpetrator was convicted of attempted rape resulting in serious injury. 85. Legal commentators have not commented in detail on situations where coercion through force or threats may be considered to have been established, apparently taking the view that this was a matter for judicial interpretation (Al. Stoynov, Наказателно право, Особена част, 1997; A. Girginov, Наказателно право, Особена част, 2002). One commentator has stated that the essential characteristic of rape is the victim's lack of consent and that the three sub-paragraphs of Article 152 § 1 of the Criminal Code embody different situations of lack of consent. He further notes that in previous centuries the utmost resistance by the victim was required and that that view is now outdated. Without reference to caselaw, he considers that what is now required is nothing more than the resistance necessary to eliminate any doubt as to the victim's lack of consent (N. Antov, Проблеми на изнасилването, 2003). 86. Under Article 152 § 1 of the Criminal Code, rape committed by a man against a woman is punishable by two to eight years' imprisonment. At the material time, Article 157 § 1 of the Code provided for one to five years' imprisonment in cases of forced sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex. In 2002 the punishment prescribed under the latter provision was brought into line with that applicable in cases of rape under Article 152 § 1, and is now two to eight years' imprisonment. 87. At the material time, the age of consent in respect of sexual intercourse with a person of the same sex was 16 years (Article 157 § 2 of the Code). In 2002 it was lowered to 14 years. 88. In the legal systems of a number of European States, rape and sexual assault are “gender-neutral” offences, whereas in other countries rape may only be committed by a man against a woman. 89. The minimum age of consent for sexual activity in most States is 14, 15 or 16 years. In some countries, there is a different age of consent for sexual acts without penetration and for sexual acts with penetration, or different penalties depending on the age of the victim. The approaches vary significantly from one country to another. 90. Article 375 §§ 1 and 2 of the Belgian Criminal Code (referred to by Interights), as amended in 1989, read: “Any act of sexual penetration, of whatever nature and by whatever means, committed on a person who does not consent to it shall constitute the crime of rape. In particular, there is no consent where the act is forced by means of violence, coercion or ruse or was made possible by the victim's disability or physical or mental deficiency.” 91. Article 241 § 1 of the Czech Criminal Code (Law no. 140/1961, as amended) provides: “A person who coerces another into an act of sexual penetration or a similar sexual act through violence or the threat of imminent violence or by taking advantage of the person's helplessness shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of two to eight years.” 92. Sections 216(1) and 217 of the Danish Penal Code (referred to by the intervener) provide: “Any person who coerces [another into having] sexual intercourse by violence or under threat of violence shall be guilty of rape and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eight years. The placing of a person in such a position that the person is unable to resist shall be equivalent to violence ...” “Any person who by means of unlawful coercion (according to section 260 of this Act) other than violence or the threat of violence procures sexual intercourse for himself, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years.” 93. Chapter 20, sections 1 and 3, of the Finnish Penal Code (as amended in 1998) provides: “Section 1: Rape (1) A person who coerces another into having sexual intercourse by the use or threat of violence shall be sentenced for rape to imprisonment for at least one year and at most six years. (2) A person shall also be guilty of rape if he/she takes advantage of the incapacity of another to defend himself/herself and has sexual intercourse with him/her, after rendering him/her unconscious or causing him/her to be in a state of incapacity owing to fear or another similar reason ... Section 3: Coercion into having sexual intercourse (1) If the rape, in view of the low level of violence or threat and the other particulars of the offence, is deemed to have been committed under mitigating circumstances, the offender shall be sentenced for coercion into having sexual intercourse to imprisonment for at most three years. (2) A person who coerces another into having sexual intercourse by a threat other than that referred to in section 1(1) shall be guilty of coercion into having sexual intercourse.” 94. Articles 222-22, 222-23 and 227-25 of the French Criminal Code provide: “Sexual aggression is any sexual assault committed by violence, coercion, threats or surprise.” “Any act of sexual penetration, whatever its nature, committed against another person by violence, coercion, threats or surprise, shall be considered rape. Rape shall be punishable by fifteen years' imprisonment.” “A sexual offence committed without violence, coercion, threats or surprise by an adult on the person of a minor under 15 years of age shall be punished by five years' imprisonment and a fine of 75,000 euros.” 95. The following information about French case-law on rape may be gathered from the authoritative publication Juris-Classeur (2002): (i) The words “violence, coercion, threats or surprise” are given a broad meaning in practice. For example, in one case it was stated that the fact that the victim was begging the perpetrator to stop, without further resistance, where she had previously agreed to enter his car and to be kissed by him, was sufficient to establish that there was rape (judgment of the Court of Cassation, Criminal Division (“Cass. crim.”), 10 July 1973, Bulletin Criminel (“Bull. crim.”) no. 322; Revue de Science Criminelle, 1974, p. 594, observations of Levasseur; see also, for an opposing view, Crim., 11 October 1978, Dalloz 1979. IR, 120). The victim's refusal may be inferred from the circumstances, such as paralysing shock, as a result of which the victim could not protest or escape (Cass. crim., 13 March 1984, Bull. crim. no. 107). (ii) There is “surprise” where the victim cannot freely consent because, for example, she is physically or mentally disabled (Cass. crim., 8 June 1984, Bull. crim. no. 226), in a particular psychological state, involving depression, fragility, or simply distress (Cass. crim., 12 November 1997, Juris-Data no. 2000-005087; Paris Court of Appeal, 30 March 2000, Juris-Data no. 2000-117239), or where the perpetrator used trickery to deceive the victim as to the real situation (Cass. crim., 14 April 1995, Juris-Data no. 1995-002034). (iii) The courts have considered that there is always “surprise”, and therefore rape, where the victim is of such a low age as not to understand the concept of sexuality and the nature of the acts being imposed (Cass. crim., 11 June 1992, Bull. crim. no. 228; Limoges Court of Appeal, 5 April 1995, Juris-Data no. 1995-042693; Paris Court of Appeal, 14 November 2000, Juris-Data no. 2000-134658). In some other cases, however, it has been stated that in principle the age of the victim cannot as such, without additional elements, establish the existence of “surprise” (Cass. crim., 1 March 1995, Bull. crim. no. 92). 96. The relevant part of Article 177 (Sexual coercion; Rape) of the German Criminal Code reads: “1. Anyone who coerces another person (1) by force, (2) by the threat of immediate danger to life or limb, or (3) by exploiting a situation in which the victim is defenceless and at the mercy of the actions of the perpetrator into submitting to sexual acts performed by the perpetrator or by a third person or into performing such acts on the perpetrator or on the third person, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one year.” 97. Article 197 § 1 of the Hungarian Criminal Code (Law no. 4 of 1978) provides: “A person who by violent action or a direct threat to life or limb forces a person to have sexual intercourse, or uses a person's incapacity to defend himself/herself or to express his/her will to have sexual intercourse shall be guilty of a serious offence punishable by imprisonment for two to eight years.” 98. In Ireland, section 2(1) of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 and section 9 of the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act 1990 (referred to by the intervener) provide: “A man commits rape if (a) he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of intercourse does not consent and (b) at the time he knows she does not consent or is reckless as to whether or not she is consenting.” “It is hereby declared that in relation to an offence that consists of or includes the doing of an act to a person without the consent of the person, any failure or omission by that person to offer resistance to the act does not of itself constitute consent to that act.” 99. Article 180 § 1 of the Slovenian Criminal Code reads: “Anyone who compels a person of the same or the opposite sex to submit to sexual intercourse by force or the threat of imminent attack on life and limb shall be sentenced to imprisonment from one to ten years.” 100. In the United Kingdom, section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (referred to by the intervener) provides: “[A] man commits rape if (a) he has unlawful sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of intercourse does not consent to it; and (b) at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or is reckless as to whether she consents to it.” 101. The Committee of Ministers recommends that member States adopt and implement, in the manner most appropriate to each country's national circumstances, a series of measures to combat violence against women. Paragraph 35 of the appendix to the recommendation states that, in the field of criminal law, member States should, inter alia: “– penalise any sexual act committed against non-consenting persons, even if they do not show signs of resistance; ... – penalise any abuse of the position of a perpetrator, and in particular of an adult visà-vis a child.” 102. In Prosecutor v. Anto Furundžija (case no. IT-95-17/1-T, judgment of 10 December 1998), in the context of the question whether or not forced oral sexual penetration may be characterised as rape under international law, the Trial Chamber made the following relevant remarks about rape under international criminal law: “The Trial Chamber notes the unchallenged submission ... that rape is a forcible act: this means that the act is 'accomplished by force or threats of force against the victim or a third person, such threats being express or implied and must place the victim in reasonable fear that he, she or a third person will be subjected to violence, detention, duress or psychological oppression'. ... ... all jurisdictions surveyed by the Trial Chamber require an element of force, coercion, threat, or acting without the consent of the victim: force is given a broad interpretation and includes rendering the victim helpless.” 103. The Trial Chamber defined rape as: “sexual penetration ... by coercion or force or threat of force against the victim or a third person.” 104. Noting that the terms “coercion”, “force”, or “threat of force” from the Furundžija definition were not intended to be interpreted narrowly, the Trial Chamber in another case (Prosecutor v. Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković, case no. IT-96-23, judgment of 22 February 2001) observed: “In stating that the relevant act of sexual penetration will constitute rape only if accompanied by coercion or force or threat of force against the victim or a third person, the Furundžija definition does not refer to other factors which would render an act of sexual penetration non-consensual or non-voluntary on the part of the victim, which ... as discussed below, is in the opinion of this Trial Chamber the accurate scope of this aspect of the definition in international law. ... the basic underlying principle common to [the national legal systems surveyed is] that sexual penetration will constitute rape if it is not truly voluntary or consensual on the part of the victim ... [F]orce, threat of force or coercion ... are certainly the relevant considerations in many legal systems but the full range of [the relevant] provisions ... suggest that the true common denominator which unifies the various systems may be a wider or more basic principle of penalising violations of sexual autonomy. ” 105. In Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković, a Muslim girl in an occupied area was taken by armed soldiers to a building which served as military headquarters. After being raped by two soldiers there, she was brought to a room where she herself initiated sexual contact with the accused Mr Kunarac, the commanding officer. The Trial Chamber noted that the victim had been told by soldiers that she should satisfy their commander sexually or risk her life. The victim therefore “did not freely consent to any sexual intercourse with Kunarac [as she] was in captivity and in fear for her life”. The Trial Chamber also rejected Kunarac's defence that he was not aware of the fact that the victim had only initiated sexual intercourse with him because she feared for her life. The Chamber found that, even if Kunarac had not heard the threats made by other soldiers, he could not have been “confused” by the behaviour of the victim, given the general context of the existing war-time situation and the specifically delicate situation of the Muslim girls in the region. 106. In the context of the above facts, the Trial Chamber made the following observations on the elements of rape under international law: “The basic principle which is truly common to [the reviewed] legal systems is that serious violations of sexual autonomy are to be penalised. Sexual autonomy is violated wherever the person subjected to the act has not freely agreed to it or is otherwise not a voluntary participant. In practice, the absence of genuine and freely given consent or voluntary participation may be evidenced by the presence of the various factors specified in other jurisdictions – such as force, threats of force, or taking advantage of a person who is unable to resist. A clear demonstration that such factors negate true consent is found in those jurisdictions where absence of consent is an element of rape and consent is explicitly defined not to exist where factors such as use of force, the unconsciousness or inability to resist of the victim, or misrepresentation by the perpetrator [are present]. ... coercion, force, or threat of force [are] not to be interpreted narrowly ... coercion in particular would encompass most conduct which negates consent ... In light of the above considerations, the Trial Chamber understands that the actus reus of the crime of rape in international law is constituted by ... sexual penetration ... where [it] occurs without the consent of the victim. Consent for this purpose must be consent given voluntarily, as a result of the victim's free will, assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances. The mens rea is the intention to effect this sexual penetration, and the knowledge that it occurs without the consent of the victim.” 107. In the same case, on an appeal by the perpetrators based on the argument, inter alia, that there was no rape without force or threat of force and the victim's “continuous” or “genuine” resistance, the Appeals Chamber, in its judgment of 12 June 2002, stated: “The Appellants' bald assertion that nothing short of continuous resistance provides adequate notice to the perpetrator that his attentions are unwanted is wrong on the law and absurd on the facts. Secondly, with regard to the role of force in the definition of rape, the Appeals Chamber notes that the Trial Chamber appeared to depart from the Tribunal's prior definitions of rape. However, in explaining its focus on the absence of consent as the conditio sine qua non of rape, the Trial Chamber did not disavow the Tribunal's earlier jurisprudence, but instead sought to explain the relationship between force and consent. Force or threat of force provides clear evidence of non-consent, but force is not an element per se of rape. In particular, the Trial Chamber wished to explain that there are “factors [other than force] which would render an act of sexual penetration non-consensual or non-voluntary on the part of the victim”. A narrow focus on force or threat of force could permit perpetrators to evade liability for sexual activity to which the other party had not consented by taking advantage of coercive circumstances without relying on physical force ... For the most part, the Appellants in this case were convicted of raping women held in de facto military headquarters, detention centres and apartments maintained as soldiers' residences. As the most egregious aspect of the conditions, the victims were considered the legitimate sexual prey of their captors. Typically, the women were raped by more than one perpetrator and with a regularity that is nearly inconceivable. (Those who initially sought help or resisted were treated to an extra level of brutality). Such detentions amount to circumstances that were so coercive as to negate any possibility of consent.” 108. In its General Recommendation 19 of 29 January 1992 on violence against women, the Committee made the following recommendation in paragraph 24: “(a) States parties should take appropriate and effective measures to overcome all forms of gender-based violence, whether by public or private act; (b) States parties should ensure that laws against ... abuse, rape, sexual assault and other gender-based violence give adequate protection to all women, and respect their integrity and dignity. ...”",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

IRELAND,2,Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 8 and 12;No violation of Art. 14+8;Violation of Art. 8 regarding the legal situation of the third applicant under Irish law;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,C. Russo;Gaukur Jörundsson;J.A. Carrillo Salcedo,"10. The first applicant is Roy H.W. Johnston, who was born in 1930 and is a scientific research and development manager. He resides at Rathmines, Dublin, with the second applicant, Janice Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1938; she is a school-teacher by profession and used to work as director of a play-group in Dublin, but has been unemployed since 1985. The third applicant is their daughter, Nessa Doreen Williams-Johnston, who was born in 1978. 11. The first applicant married a Miss M in 1952 in a Church of Ireland ceremony. Three children were born of this marriage, in 1956, 1959 and 1965. In 1965, it became clear to both parties that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and they decided to live separately at different levels in the family house. Several years later both of them, with the other’s knowledge and consent, formed relationships and began to live with third parties. By mutual agreement, the two couples resided in self-contained flats in the house until 1976, when Roy Johnston’s wife moved elsewhere. In 1978, the second applicant, with whom Roy Johnston had been living since 1971, gave birth to Nessa. He consented to his name being included in the Register of Births as the father (see paragraph 26 below). 12. Under the Constitution of Ireland (see paragraphs 16-17 below), the first applicant is unable to obtain, in Ireland, a dissolution of his marriage to enable him to marry the second applicant. He has taken the following steps to regularise his relationship with her and with his wife and to make proper provision for his dependents. (a) With his wife’s consent, he has consulted solicitors in Dublin and in London as to the possibility of obtaining a dissolution of the marriage outside Ireland. His London solicitors advised that, in the absence of residence within the jurisdiction of the English courts, he would not be able to do so in England, and the matter has therefore not been pursued (see also paragraphs 19-21 below). (b) On 19 September 1982, he concluded a formal separation agreement with his wife, recording an agreement implemented some years earlier. She received a lump-sum of IR£8,800 and provision was made for maintenance of the remaining dependent child of the marriage. The parties also mutually renounced their succession rights over each other’s estates. (c) He has made a will leaving his house to the second applicant for life with remainder over to his four children as tenants in common, one half of the residue of his estate to the second applicant, and the other half to his four children in equal shares. (d) He has supported the third applicant throughout her life and has acted in all respects as a caring father. (e) He contributed towards the maintenance of his wife until the conclusion of the aforementioned separation agreement and has supported the three children of his marriage during their dependency. (f) The second applicant has been nominated as beneficiary under the pension scheme attached to his employment. (g) He has taken out health insurance in the names of the second and third applicants, as members of his family. 13. The second applicant, who is largely dependent on the first applicant for her support and maintenance, is concerned at the lack of security provided by her present legal status, in particular the absence of any legal right to be maintained by him and of any potential rights of succession in the event of intestacy (see also paragraph 23 below). As is permitted by law, she has adopted the first applicant’s surname, which she uses amongst friends and neighbours, but for business purposes continues to use the name Williams. According to her, she has felt inhibited about telling employers of her domestic circumstances and although she would like to become an Irish citizen by naturalisation, she has been reluctant to make an application, not wishing to put those circumstances in issue. 14. The third applicant has, under Irish law, the legal situation of an illegitimate child and her parents are concerned at the lack of any means by which she can, even with their consent, be recognised as their child with full rights of support and succession in relation to them (see paragraphs 30-32 below). They are also concerned about the possibility of a stigma attaching to her by virtue of her legal situation, especially when she is attending school. 15. The first and second applicants state that although they have not practised any formal religion for some time, they have recently joined the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers) in Dublin. This decision was influenced in part by their concern that the third applicant receives a Christian upbringing. 16. The Constitution of Ireland, which came into force in 1937, includes the following provisions: ""40.3.1o The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen. 40.3.2o The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen. 41.1.1o The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law. 41.1.2o The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State. (...) 41.3.1o The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack. 41.3.2o No law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage. (...) 42.1. The State acknowledges that the primary and natural educator of the child is the Family and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide, according to their means, for the religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education of their children. (...) 42.5. In exceptional cases, where the parents for physical or moral reasons fail in their duty towards their children, the State as guardian of the common good, by appropriate means shall endeavour to supply the place of the parents, but always with due regard for the natural and imprescriptible rights of the child."" 17. As a result of Article 41.3.2o of the Constitution, divorce in the sense of dissolution of a marriage (divorce a vinculo matrimonii) is not available in Ireland. However, spouses may be relieved of the duty of cohabiting either by a legally binding deed of separation concluded between them or by a court decree of judicial separation (also known as a divorce a mensa et thoro); such a decree, which is obtainable only on proof of commission of adultery, cruelty or unnatural offences, does not dissolve the marriage. In the remainder of the present judgment, the word ""divorce"" denotes a divorce a vinculo matrimonii. It is also possible to obtain on various grounds a decree of nullity, that is a declaration by the High Court that a marriage was invalid and therefore null and void ab initio. A marriage may also be ""annulled"" by an ecclesiastical tribunal, but this does not affect the civil status of the parties. 18. The Irish courts have consistently held that the ""Family"" that is afforded protection by Article 41 of the Constitution is the family based on marriage. Thus, in The State (Nicolaou) v. An Bord Uchtála The Adoption Board 1966 Irish Reports 567, the Supreme Court said: ""It is quite clear from the provisions of Article 41, and in particular section 3 thereof, that the family referred to in this Article is the family which is founded on the institution of marriage and, in the context of the Article, marriage means valid marriage under the law for the time being in force in the State. While it is quite true that unmarried persons cohabiting together and the children of their union may often be referred to as a family and have many, if not all, of the outward appearances of a family, and may indeed for the purposes of a particular law be regarded as such, nevertheless as far as Article 41 is concerned the guarantees therein contained are confined to families based upon marriage."" The Supreme Court has, however, held that an illegitimate child has unenumerated natural rights (as distinct from rights conferred by law) which will be protected under Article 40.3 of the Constitution, such as the right to be fed and to live, to be reared and educated, to have the opportunity of working and of realising his or her full personality and dignity as a human being, as well as the same natural rights under the Constitution as a legitimate child to ""religious and moral, intellectual, physical and social education"" (G v. An Bord Uchtála 1980 Irish Reports 32). 19. Article 41.3.3o of the Constitution provides: ""No person whose marriage has been dissolved under the civil law of any other State but is a subsisting valid marriage under the law for the time being in force within the jurisdiction of the Government and Parliament established by this Constitution shall be capable of contracting a valid marriage within that jurisdiction during the lifetime of the other party to the marriage dissolved."" 20. A series of judicial decisions has established that the foregoing provision does not prevent the recognition by Irish courts, under the general Irish rules of private international law, of certain decrees of divorce obtained, even by Irish nationals, in another State. Such recognition used to be granted only if the parties to the marriage were domiciled within the jurisdiction of the foreign court at the time of the relevant proceedings (Re Caffin Deceased: Bank of Ireland v. Caffin 1971 Irish Reports 123; Gaffney v. Gaffney 1975 Irish Reports 133; however, since 2 October 1986 a divorce will be recognised if granted in the country where either spouse is domiciled (Domicile and Recognition of Foreign Divorces Act 1986). To be regarded as domiciled in a foreign State, a person must not only be resident there but also have the intention of remaining there permanently and have lost the animus revertendi. Moreover, the foreign divorce will not be recognised if domicile has been fraudulently invoked before the foreign court for the purpose of obtaining the decree. 21. If notice is served for a civil marriage before a Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths in Ireland and he is aware that either of the parties has been divorced abroad, he must, under the regulations in force, refer the matter to the Registrar-General. The latter will seek legal advice as to whether on the facts of the case the divorce would be recognised as effective to dissolve the marriage under Irish law and as to whether the intended marriage can consequently be permitted. 22. Persons who, like the first and second applicants, are living together in a stable relationship after the breakdown of the marriage of one of them are unable, during the lifetime of the other party to that marriage, to marry each other in Ireland and are not recognised there as a family for the purposes of Article 41 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above). 23. Such persons, unlike a married couple, have no legal duty to support or maintain one another and no mutual statutory rights of succession. However, there is no impediment under Irish law preventing them from living together and supporting each other and, in particular, from making wills or dispositions inter vivos in each other’s favour. They can also enter into mutual maintenance agreements, although the Government and the applicants expressed different views as to whether these might be unenforceable as contrary to public policy. In general, the married member of the couple remains, at least in theory, under a continuing legal obligation to maintain his or her spouse. In addition, testamentary dispositions by that member may be subject to the rights of his or her spouse or legitimate children under the Succession Act 1965. 24. As compared with married couples, persons in the situation of the first and second applicants: (a) have no access, in the event of difficulties arising between them, to the system of barring orders instituted to provide remedies in respect of violence within the family (Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, as amended by the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act 1981); they can, however, obtain analogous relief by seeking a court injunction or declaration; (b) do not enjoy any of the rights conferred by the Family Home Protection Act 1976 in relation to the family home and its contents, notably the prohibition on sale by one spouse without the other’s consent and the exemption from stamp duty and Land Registry fees in the event of transfer of title between them; (c) as regards transfers of property between them, are less favourably treated for the purposes of capital acquisition tax; (d) enjoy different rights under the social welfare code, notably the benefits available to deserted wives; (e) are unable jointly to adopt a child (see also paragraph 29 below). 25. In Irish law, the principle mater semper certa est applies: the maternal affiliation of an illegitimate child, such as the third applicant, is established by the fact of birth, without any requirement of voluntary or judicial recognition. The Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act 1930, as amended by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976 and the Courts Act 1983, provides procedures whereby the District Court or the Circuit Court may make an ""affiliation order"" against the putative father of a child directing him to make periodic payments in respect of the latter’s maintenance and also whereby the court may approve a lump-sum maintenance agreement between a person who admits he is the father of an illegitimate child and the latter’s mother. Neither of these procedures establishes the child’s paternal affiliation for all purposes, any finding of parentage being effective solely for the purposes of the proceedings in question and binding only on the parties. 26. Under the Registration of Births and Deaths (Ireland) Act 1863, as amended by the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act 1880, the Registrar may enter in the register the name of a person as the father of an illegitimate child if he is so requested jointly by that person and the mother. The act of registration does not, however, establish paternal affiliation. 27. The mother of an illegitimate child is his sole guardian as from the moment of his birth (section 6(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964) and has the same rights of guardianship as are jointly enjoyed by the parents of a legitimate child. The natural father can apply to the court under section 11(4) of the same Act regarding the child’s custody and the right of access thereto by either parent; however, he cannot seek the court’s directions on other matters affecting the child’s welfare nor is there any means whereby he can be established as guardian of the child jointly with the mother, even if she consents. 28. An illegitimate child may be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents, provided that, unlike the first and second applicants, they could have been lawfully married to one another at the time of the child’s birth or at some time during the preceding ten months (section 1(1) and (2) of the Legitimacy Act 1931). 29. Under the Adoption Act 1952, as amended, an adoption order can only be made in favour of a married couple living together, a widow, a widower, or the mother or natural father or a relative of the child. 30. The effect of the Illegitimate Children (Affiliation Orders) Act 1930, as amended by the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act 1976, is to impose on each of the parents of an illegitimate child an equal obligation to maintain him. This obligation cannot be enforced against the father until an ""affiliation order"" has been made against him (see paragraph 25 above). 31. The devolution of estates on intestacy is governed by the Succession Act 1965 which provides, basically, that the estate is to be distributed in specified proportions between any spouse or ""issue"" who may survive the deceased. In O’B v. S 1984 Irish Reports 316, the Supreme Court held that the word ""issue"" did not include children who were not the issue of a lawful marriage and that accordingly an illegitimate child had, under the Act, no right to inheritance on the intestacy of his natural father. Whilst also holding that the resultant discrimination in favour of legitimate children was justifiable by reason of sections 1 and 3 of Article 41 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 above), the Supreme Court stated that the decision to change the existing rules of intestate succession and the extent to which they were to be changed were primarily matters for the legislature. The relevant rules in the Act formed part of a statute designed to strengthen the protection of the family in accordance with Article 41, an Article which created not merely a State interest but a State obligation to safeguard the family; accordingly, the said discrimination was not necessarily unjust, unreasonable or arbitrary and the said rules were not invalid having regard to the provisions of the Constitution. An illegitimate child may, on the other hand, in certain circumstances have a right to inheritance on the intestacy of his mother. A special rule (section 9(1) of the Legitimacy Act 1931) lays down that where the mother of an illegitimate child dies intestate leaving no legitimate issue, the child is entitled to take any interest in his mother’s estate to which he would have been entitled if he had been born legitimate. 32. As regards testate succession, section 117 of the Succession Act 1965 empowers a court to make provision for a child for whom it considers that the testator has failed in his moral duty to make proper provision. An illegitimate child has no claim against his father’s estate under this section, but may be able to claim against his mother’s estate provided that she leaves no legitimate issue. 33. An illegitimate child inheriting property from his parents is potentially liable to pay capital acquisition tax on a basis less favourable than a child born in wedlock. 34. In 1983, a Joint Committee of the Dáil (Chamber of Deputies) and the Seanad (Senate) was established, inter alia, to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage. In its report of 1985, it referred to figures suggesting that approximately 6 per cent of marriages in Ireland had broken down to date, but noted the absence of accurate statistics. The Committee considered that the parties to stable relationships formed after marriage breakdown and the children of such relationships currently lacked adequate legal status and protection; however, it expressed no view on whether divorce legislation was at present necessary or desirable. In a national referendum held on 26 June 1986, a majority voted against an amendment of the Constitution, which would have permitted legislation providing for divorce. 35. In September 1982, the Irish Law Reform Commission published a Report on Illegitimacy. Its basic recommendation was that legislation should remove the concept of illegitimacy from the law and equalise the rights of children born outside marriage with those of children born within marriage. After considering the report, the Government announced in October 1983 that they had decided that the law should be reformed, and that reform should be concentrated on the elimination of discrimination against persons born outside marriage and on the rights and obligations of their fathers. However, the Government decided not to accept a proposal by the Law Reform Commission that the father be given automatic rights of guardianship in relation to a child so born. 36. In May 1985, the Minister of Justice laid before both Houses of Parliament a Memorandum entitled ""The Status of Children"", indicating the scope and nature of the main changes proposed by the Government. On 9 May 1986, the Status of Children Bill 1986, a draft of which had been annexed to the aforesaid Memorandum, was introduced into the Seanad. If enacted in its present form, the Bill - which has the stated purpose of removing as far as possible provisions in existing law which discriminate against children born outside marriage - would have, inter alia, the following effects. (a) Where the name of a person was entered on the register of births as the father of a child born outside marriage, he would be presumed to be the father unless the contrary was shown (cf. paragraph 26 above). (b) The father of a child born outside marriage would be able to seek a court order making him guardian of the child jointly with the mother (cf. paragraph 27 above). In that event, they would jointly have all the parental rights and responsibilities that are enjoyed and borne by married parents. (c) The proviso qualifying the possibility of legitimation by subsequent marriage would be removed by the repeal of section 1(2) of the Legitimacy Act 1931 (see paragraph 28 above). (d) The legal provisions governing the obligation of both of the parents of a child born outside marriage to maintain him would be similar to those governing the corresponding obligation of married parents (see paragraph 30 above). (e) For succession purposes, no distinction would be made between persons based on whether or not their parents were married to each other. Thus, a child born outside marriage would be entitled to share on the intestacy of either parent and would have the same rights in relation to the estate of a parent who died leaving a will as would a child of a family based on marriage (cf. paragraphs 31 and 32 above). The Explanatory Memorandum to the Bill states that any fiscal changes necessitated by the proposed new measures would be a matter for separate legislation promoted by the Minister for Finance. 37. Work is also in progress on legislation reforming the law of adoption, following the publication in July 1984 of the Report of the Review Committee on Adoption Services. That Committee recommended that, as at present (see paragraph 29 above), unmarried couples should not be eligible to adopt jointly even their own natural children.",['8'],[],[],"['14', '8']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Bad Brückenau, Germany. 6. The Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office indicted the applicant for preparation to counterfeit money (section 304 of the Criminal Code). 7. On 30 November 2006 the Budapest Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to a fine. 8. On appeal, the Budapest Court of Appeal held a public session and completed the findings of fact as established by the Regional Court. It observed that the defendant's act could be re-characterised as attempted aggravated fraud (section 318 of the Criminal Code) and enquired as to whether he wished to have an adjournment on that account. The applicant replied in the negative. 9. On 10 October 2007 the Budapest Court of Appeal reversed the first-instance judgment and re-characterised the applicant's offence as forgery of public documents (section 274 of the Criminal Code). The applicant submitted that there had been no taking of evidence in this regard before the Court of Appeal. His sentence remained unchanged; nevertheless, he filed a petition for review. 10. On 30 April 2009 the Supreme Court held a public session and upheld the applicant's conviction without taking evidence. In the reasoning of that decision, it was observed that the judgment of the Court of Appeal amounted to a violation of the substantive provisions of the Criminal Code in that although the applicant, a national of Germany, had committed the crime in question abroad, the lower courts had not explored whether his act was punishable under German law or obtained the Attorney General's requisite endorsement of the indictment. However, the Supreme Court held that the applicant's deed in fact constituted the offences of complicity in attempted aggravated fraud (section 318 of the Criminal Code) and in forgery of private documents (section 276 of the Criminal Code). It did not change the sanction imposed on the applicant. This decision was served on 18 June 2009. 11. Section 274(1) of the Criminal Code provides that a person who prepares a forged official document or falsifies the contents of an official document, uses a fake or forged official document or an official document issued under the name of another person, or co-operates in the inclusion of untrue data, facts or declarations in an official document regarding the existence, change or termination of a right or obligation, commits the felony of forgery of official documents. 12. According to section 276 of the Criminal Code, a person who uses a fake or forged private document or a private document with untrue contents for providing evidence for the existence, change or termination of a right or obligation, commits the offence of forgery of private documents. 13. Under section 304(1) of the Criminal Code, a person who copies or forges money with the purpose of distribution, obtains counterfeit or forged money with the purpose of distribution, exports or imports such money or transports it through the territory of the country, or distributes counterfeit or forged money commits the felony of counterfeiting money. 14. According to section 318(1) of the Criminal Code, a person who deceives someone, or maintains someone's deception, in order to make unlawful gains, commits the offence of fraud, provided that actual damage has occurred as a result of his conduct.",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']","['6-3-a', '6-3-b']",[],[],[],1

On 23 December 1991 the applicant was arrested and charged with murdering in a cruel manner for gain the eightyoneyears' old adoptive mother of a friend of his, Mr H. 11. On 18 March 1992 he was indicted. The Varna Regional Court held hearings in his case on 20 May, 19 June and 10 July 1992, but on 10 July 1992 discontinued the trial and remitted the case back to the prosecution authorities for the rectification of a breach of the rules of procedure. 12. Following an additional investigation, on 25 January 1993 the applicant was indicted again. A hearing listed before the Varna Regional Court for 28 February 1993 was adjourned because the applicant's counsel were absent. After holding hearings on 22 March, 26 April and 14 May 1993, in a judgment of 14 May 1993 that court found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to eighteen years' imprisonment. 13. Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed to the former Supreme Court. A hearing listed for 4 August 1993 was adjourned because the applicant's counsel were on leave, and took place on 20 October 1993. In a judgment of 10 November 1993 the former Supreme Court quashed the applicant's conviction and sentence and remitted the case for further investigation, holding that the Varna Regional Court had failed to substantiate its findings of fact and had erred in assessing the evidence. 14. On 6 January 1994 the case was transmitted to the investigator. He charged Mr H. with aiding and abetting the applicant. After that the case was twice forwarded to the prosecution and twice referred back for further investigation. That investigation was finished on 20 June 1997 and on 15 July 1997 the applicant and Mr H. were indicted. 15. Two hearings listed before the Varna Regional Court for 5 November 1997 and 9 February 1998 did not take place. On 9 April 1998 the court granted the applicant's request for the recusal of all prosecutors and judges of that court and sent the case to the Burgas Regional Court. The judge to whom the case was assigned there considered that it should be examined by the Varna Regional Court and sought a ruling on the matter by the Supreme Court of Cassation. In May 1998 the Supreme Court of Cassation held that the case was to be examined by the Varna Regional Court. 16. The proceedings before the Varna Regional Court then resumed, but at a hearing held on 6 October 1998 the court referred the case back to the prosecution authorities, finding that there had been procedural breaches which had violated Mr H.'s defence rights. On 19 January 1999 the prosecution authorities in turn referred the case back to the investigator, noting, inter alia, that he had not complied with instructions given as early as November 1996. 17. In January 2001 the prosecution authorities decided to stay the proceedings, as Mr H.'s whereabouts were unknown. Upon the applicant's appeal, their decision was quashed on 11 May 2001 by the Varna Regional Court, which held that the excessive length of the proceedings violated the applicant's rights and criticised the prosecution for having stayed them. The prosecution's ensuing appeal to the Varna Court of Appeals was dismissed on 26 June 2001. 18. On 9 July 2001 the prosecution authorities referred the case back for further investigation. This investigation was concluded on 15 February 2002 and the case was sent to the prosecution authorities. 19. On 19 March 2002 the prosecution authorities dropped the charges against Mr H., finding that they had not been sufficiently made out. On 16 May 2002 they indicted the applicant. 20. The Varna Regional Court held hearings on 30 September, 2 October and 17 December 2002 and 19 February 2003. In a judgment of 19 February 2003 it acquitted the applicant. 21. Upon the appeal of the prosecution, on 20 June 2003 the Varna Court of Appeals quashed the lower court's judgment and decided the case on the merits. It found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment. 22. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. After holding a hearing on 17 February 2004, on 30 March 2004 that court quashed the lower court's judgment and remitted the case. 23. The Varna Court of Appeals examined the case anew. In a judgment of 25 June 2004 it once again found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment. In determining the sentence it noted, inter alia, that the criminal proceedings against him had been “particularly lengthy”. 24. The applicant again appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. After holding a hearing on 7 March 2005, in a final judgment of 18 April 2005 that court quashed the lower court's judgment, examined the case on the merits and acquitted the applicant, finding that the charges against him had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. 25. For the examination of the case the authorities interviewed repeatedly about twenty witnesses, appointed several experts and gathered other evidence. The case file reached nine volumes. 26. On 23 December 1991 the applicant was arrested and remanded in custody on the basis of an investigator's order of 13 December 1991, which stated that he had been charged with an offence punishable with up to twenty years' imprisonment or death, that he did not have a fixed place of abode and that his whereabouts were unknown. There was also a risk that he could endanger the lives of witnesses. 27. On 23 March 1993 the Varna Regional Court denied an application for release by the applicant, holding that detention was mandatory in the case of persons charged with an offence punishable by more than ten years' imprisonment. An exception was only possible if there was no risk, i.e., it was physically unfeasible for the applicant to abscond or reoffend, which was not the case. A further application for release made on 26 April 1993 was likewise denied by the court, which noted that it had already ruled on such an application a month earlier and there had been no change in the circumstances since then. It also stated that the applicant's arguments concerning the lack of evidence against him went to the merits of the criminal case, not to the issue whether or not he should be released. 28. On 14 May 1993 the applicant was convicted and sentenced to a prison term. That conviction and sentence were quashed on 10 November 1993 (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). 29. After 10 November 1993 the applicant remained in custody. On 21 September 1994 the Varna Regional Prosecutor's Office refused his application for release, reasoning that, in view of the applicant's threats against certain witnesses and a prosecutor, there was a risk that he could hinder the investigation by destroying evidence and suborning and intimidating witnesses. 30. On an unspecified date in the meantime the applicant made offensive remarks against a prosecutor in a complaint concerning the handling of his case. On 2 September 1994 he was convicted on account of these remarks and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. On an unspecified date he was convicted on other charges concerning events before December 1991 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment. In accordance with the rules on sentencing, he was ordered to serve a nine months' prison term as a result of these convictions and sentences. It appears from the documents in the case file that the applicant did so between 18 November 1994 and 18 August 1995. After that his pretrial detention on the murder charges continued. 31. On 14 November 1995 the Varna Regional Prosecutor's Office denied an application for release by the applicant. It reasoned that in view of the seriousness of the charges against him pre-trial detention was mandatory by virtue of Article 152 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974 (“the CCP”). It also stated that it was impossible to use the exception provided for by paragraph 2 of that Article, as its application was excluded by paragraph 3 thereof owing to the fact that there were two other sets of criminal proceedings pending against the applicant (see paragraphs 4851 below). 32. The applicant submitted a number of other applications for release, some of which were denied by the prosecution authorities and some of which were apparently not replied to. Some of the decisions contained no reasoning, while others stated that his remand in custody was mandatory in view of the seriousness of the charges against him. 33. The applicant also submitted a number of applications for release to the competent court. He filed such applications on 7 June and 7 November 1997, and on 9 February, 29 April and 10 August 1998. He advanced various arguments regarding the weak case against him, the lack of a risk of fleeing and his weakening health. Most of the applications were dismissed with reference to Article 152 §§ 1 and 2 of the CCP. Thus, in a decision of 24 February 1998 the Varna Regional Court stated the applicant had been charged with a serious intentional offence and his detention was accordingly mandatory under Article 152 § 1 of the CCP. There were no grounds to apply the exception provided for by paragraph 2 of that Article, as a hearing had been listed in the trial against him, whereas his position with regard to the charges revealed a genuine risk that he might abscond or impede the course of justice. 34. On 9 December 1998 the Varna Regional Court ordered the applicant's release on bail, holding that after seven years of detention and several rounds of investigation there was no risk of him jeopardising the investigation. There was furthermore no indication that he could flee or reoffend. The court also said that the length of the applicant's detention had exceeded a “reasonable time” within the meaning of the Convention. It set the bail at 2,000,000 old Bulgarian levs (BGL), without providing reasons as to the amount. Its order was not subject to appeal (see paragraph 54 below). 35. The applicant was not released immediately as he was unable to secure the amount. Following an unsuccessful attempt to have it reduced by the court, he posted bail and was released on 17 December 1998. 36. The applicant spent his time in custody (23 December 1991 – 17 December 1998) on the premises of the Varna Regional Investigation Service and in the Varna Prison. It appears from the documents in the case file and the parties' submissions that throughout the bulk of this time he was in the Varna Prison, and was kept in the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility during six unspecified periods (probably when the proceedings against him were pending at the pretrial stage), the latest of which ended on 10 June 1997. The parties did not specify the exact periods when the applicant was kept on the Investigation Service premises, despite being requested to do so after the case was declared admissible (see paragraphs 6 and 7 above). 37. At the relevant time, the cells of the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility had central heating and were each – save for two – equipped with an en suite toilet. Natural light came through glass tiles secured by metal bars. According to the applicant, the influx of natural light was limited. The detainees slept on plank beds. The applicant averred that at times he had been detained together with eight other persons in a cell measuring five to three meters. According to him, the ventilation system in the cell only worked for a few hours a day. He also stated that there was no openair exercise area on the premises. He was accordingly not allowed to take walks. Visitors were allowed only once a month. Food was of extremely poor quality. 38. According to the Government, the premises of the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility were relatively new, built in 1982, offered conditions better than those of the Investigation Service's detention facilities in other towns, and were in line with the minimum European standards. The Government did not comment on the number of inmates kept in the applicant's cell. 39. The applicant submitted that in the Varna Prison he was kept in a cell measuring ten square meters, which he shared at times with three or four other inmates. According to him, during the nights they had to relieve themselves in a bucket kept in the cell. In 199293 warm water for bathing was available once a week, whereas later, in 1998, a warm shower was possible only once a month with the result that he often had to take showers with cold water, which had a negative impact on his health. He was allowed to take walks for approximately forty minutes a day. 40. The Government did not comment on the conditions in the Varna Prison. 41. During his time in custody the applicant was examined by a doctor on unspecified dates, apparently each time he was transferred from the Varna Prison to the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility, and was found to be physically healthy. However, in July 1998 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, for which he was treated in hospital between 14 July and 12 August 1998. Apparently he continued to receive medication for his illness after he was released from hospital. Reports on the applicant's mental health noted that he suffered from depression. 42. On 2 November 2000 the applicant issued a civil action against the Prosecutor's Office and the Varna Regional Investigation Service in the Sofia City Court. In his statement of claim he described the allegedly excessive length of the criminal proceedings against him and of his detention and pointed to the attendant negative consequences, such as a smear campaign against him in the press, a worsening of his health, the retention of the bail amount and a prohibition to leave the country. He alleged that this breached his rights under Article 5 of the Convention, his right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to a trial within a reasonable time, and his right under Article 8 of the Convention to respect for his private life. He claimed 50,000 new Bulgarian levs (BGN) in damages. He also requested the court to order the defendants to return the bail amount and allow him to leave the country. 43. Following instructions by the court to specify his request for relief, in three additional memorials the applicant indicated that he requested BGN 20,000 for the breach of his right to a trial within a reasonable time, BGN 15,000 for the injury to his reputation resulting from the impression, stemming from the length of the proceedings, that he was guilty of the offence alleged against him, and BGN 15,000 for the impossibility to leave the country during the pendency of the proceedings. He also stated that his claim was under section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (see paragraph 56 below). 44. In a judgment of 29 July 2002 the Sofia City Court dismissed the applicant's action, holding that the defendants, being part of the judicial branch, did not carry out “administrative action” within the meaning of section 1 of the abovementioned Act in performing their duties relating to the processing of the criminal case against the applicant. They could hence not be found liable for a breach of that provision. On the other hand, the applicant did not plead a breach of section 2 of the Act and there was no indication that at that point in time the facts alleged by him fell within its purview. Noting that the applicant had been exempted from paying the court fee up front, the court, acting in pursuance of section 10(2) of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 (see paragraph 59 below), ordered him to pay BGN 2,000 in fees. 45. Upon the appeal of the applicant, on 24 January 2003 the Sofia Court of Appeals affirmed with almost identical reasoning. 46. The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court of Cassation. In a final judgment of 23 December 2005 that court fully quashed the lower courts' judgments and awarded the applicant BGN 5,000 (2,556.46 euros (EUR)), plus interest as from 2 November 2000, the date of the filing of the action. It also ordered the defendants to pay the applicant's legal costs, amounting to BGN 1,340 (EUR 685.13). The court described in some detail the unfolding of the criminal proceedings against the applicant and his pre-trial detention, and found that the applicant's reliance on the provisions of the Convention was wellfounded. It stated that the length of the pre-trial detention had breached the law. It also found that at the material time and until 2003 Bulgarian law did not set any timelimits for finishing the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings. The provision that controlled this was therefore Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which was part of domestic law. The period between 1991 and 2003 – throughout which the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined and during which the applicant could not use any mechanism to speed up the proceedings – was significant and exceeded the reasonable time for examining the case. In such situations, where national law did not provide a possibility to vindicate infringed rights, they could be vindicated under international treaties which had been ratified by Bulgaria and had become part of its domestic law. For instance, Article 13 of the Convention, thus applicable, required an effective remedy against any alleged violation of that Convention. The inaction of the investigation and the prosecution authorities and the courts had infringed the applicant's right to a trial within a reasonable time and had caused him nonpecuniary damage. Taking into account that the applicant had sustained non-pecuniary damage on account of a pre-trial detention exceeding the time-limit provided by law and the failure to bring the criminal proceedings against him to an end between 1995 and 2003, and ruling in equity, the court considered that the damage could be made good by an award of BGN 5,000. It did not order the applicant to pay any court fees or costs for the remainder of his claim. 47. By Article 116(1), (7) and (9) of the Criminal Code of 1968, as worded at the time when the applicant was arrested and charged, premeditated murder committed in a particularly atrocious fashion and for gain was punishable by fifteen to twenty years' imprisonment or death. In 1995 life imprisonment also became one of the possible penalties. In 1998 the death penalty was abolished and replaced by life imprisonment, with or without parole. 48. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 152 of the CCP, as worded at the relevant time and until June 1995, provided as follows: “1. Detention pending trial shall be ordered [in cases where the charges concern] an offence punishable by ten or more years' imprisonment or death. 2. In the cases under the preceding paragraph [detention pending trial] shall not be imposed if there is no danger of the accused evading justice or committing further offences.” Between June 1995 and August 1997 these provisions provided: “1. Detention pending trial shall be ordered [in cases where the charges concern] a serious intentional offence. 2. In cases falling under paragraph 1 [detention pending trial] may be dispensed with if there is no danger of the accused's absconding, obstructing the investigation, or committing further offences.” 49. At the relevant time Article 93 § 7 of the Criminal Code of 1968 defined a “serious” offence as one punishable by more than five years' imprisonment, life imprisonment, or death. 50. The former Supreme Court's prevailing practice at the material time was to construe Article 152 § 1 of the CCP as requiring that a person charged with a serious intentional offence be remanded in custody. An exception was only possible, in accordance with paragraph 2 thereof, where it was clear beyond doubt that any danger of absconding or reoffending was objectively excluded, for example, if the accused was seriously ill, elderly, or already detained on other grounds, such as serving a sentence (опред. № 1 от 4 май 1992 г. по н.д. № 1/92 г. на ВС І н.о.; опред. № 48 от 2 октомври 1995 г. по н.д. № 583/95 г. на ВС І н.о.; опред. № 78 от 6 ноември 1995 г. по н.д. 768/95 г.). 51. Paragraph 3 of Article 152 of the CCP, as in force between June 1995 and August 1997, provided that remand in custody was mandatory without exception where other criminal proceedings for a publicly prosecutable offence were pending against the accused, or where he or she was a repeat offender. 52. Accused whose release on bail had been ordered have to remain in detention until they deposit the requisite amount (Article 150 § 5 of the CCP). 53. On the basis of the relevant law before 1 January 2000 and the Supreme Court's practice outlined above, when ruling on the applications for release of persons charged with a “serious” offence, the domestic courts generally disregarded facts and arguments concerning the reasonable suspicion against them and the existence of a risk of their absconding or committing other offences. In their view, every person accused of a such an offence had to be remanded in custody unless exceptional circumstances dictated otherwise (see the Supreme Court's decisions cited above and the decisions of the domestic authorities criticised by the Court in, inter alia, the cases of Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, ECHR 1999-II; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, 26 July 2001; and Zaprianov v. Bulgaria, no. 41171/98, 30 September 2004). 54. At the relevant time the firstinstance court's decision pursuant to an application for release was not subject to appeal (Article 152a § 3 of the CCP, as in force between August 1997 and 1 January 2000). 55. New Article 152b § 12 of the CCP, in force since 1 January 2000, as well as Article 65 § 11 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2005, which superseded it on 29 April 2006, provide that persons who remain in custody because they are unable to post bail are entitled to judicial review of their detention. In a binding interpretative decision of 25 June 2002 the Supreme Court of Cassation, construing the provisions of the CCP relating to pretrial detention, as amended on 1 January 2000, stated, inter alia, that in examining applications for release from pretrial detention the courts had to review, among other things, the lawfulness of detention resulting from the accused's failure to post bail (тълкувателно решение № 1 от 25 юни 2002 г. по н.д. 1/2002 г., ОСНК на ВКС). 56. Section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Act of 1988 („Закон за отговорността на държавата за вреди, причинени на граждани“), as in force at the relevant time, read as follows: “The State shall be liable for the damage suffered by individuals as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by its organs and officials, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of administrative action.” 57. Section 2 of the Act, which sets out causes of action for tort claims against the investigation and the prosecution authorities and the courts, provides, as relevant: “The State shall be liable for damage caused to individuals by the organs of ... the investigation, the prosecution, the courts ... for unlawful: 1. pretrial detention ..., if [the detention order] has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds; 2. accusation of a crime, if the accused has been acquitted...” 58. In a binding interpretative decision of 22 April 2005 (тълкувателно решение № 3 от 22 април 2005 г. по гр.д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК на ВКС) the Supreme Court of Cassation held, inter alia, that where the accused has been acquitted, the State is liable not only for the bringing of criminal charges, as specified by section 2(2) of the Act, but also for the pretrial detention imposed during the proceedings. The compensation for nonpecuniary damage should encompass the damage suffered on account of both, whereas the compensation for pecuniary damage should be assessed separately. In previous judgments (реш. № 978/2001 г. от 10 юли 2001 г. по г.д. № 1036/2001 г. на ВКС) the Supreme Court of Cassation has awarded compensation in such circumstances under section 2(1) of the Act. The view taken appears to have been that in such cases the acquittal retroactively had rendered the pretrial detention unlawful. 59. By section 10(2) of the Act, no court fees or costs are payable by plaintiffs upon the filing of actions under it, but in case the actions are eventually fully or partly dismissed, the court orders them to pay “the court fees and costs due”. The courts have construed this provision as meaning that the plaintiff should pay court fees and costs pro rata the dismissed part of his claims. 60. The CPT visited Bulgaria in 1995 and 1999. While it did not inspect the Varna Regional Investigation Service's detention facility and the Varna Prison, both of its reports include general observations about all Investigation Service's detention facilities, and its 1999 report includes observations on the high incidence of tuberculosis infections in the prisons during the preceding several years. 61. In this report (CPT/Inf (97) 1) the CPT found that most, even if not all, of the Investigation Service's detention facilities were overcrowded. With the exception of one facility where conditions were better, they were as follows: detainees slept on mattresses on sleeping platforms on the floor; hygiene was poor and blankets and pillows were dirty; cells did not have access to natural light; the artificial lighting was too weak to read by and was left on permanently; ventilation systems were in poor condition; detainees could use a toilet and washbasin twice a day (morning and evening) for a few minutes and could take a weekly shower; outside of the two daily visits to the toilets, detainees had to satisfy the needs of nature in a bucket kept in the cell; although according to the internal regulations detainees were entitled to a “daily walk” of up to thirty minutes, it was often reduced to five to ten minutes or not allowed at all; no other form of outofcell activity was provided to the inmates. 62. The CPT further noted that food was of poor quality and in insufficient quantity. In particular, the day's “hot meal” generally consisted of a watery soup (often lukewarm) and inadequate quantities of bread. At the other meals, detainees only received bread and a little cheese or halva. Meat and fruit were rarely included on the menu. Detainees had to eat from bowls without cutlery – not even a spoon was provided. 63. The CPT also noted that family visits were only possible with a permission. As a result the detainees' contact with the outside world was very limited. There was no radio or television. 64. The CPT concluded that the Bulgarian authorities had failed in their duty to provide detention conditions consistent with the inherent dignity of the human person and that “almost without exception, the conditions in the Investigation Service detention facilities visited could fairly be described as inhuman and degrading.” In reaction, the Bulgarian authorities agreed that the CPT's assessment was “objective and correctly presented”, but indicated that the possibilities for improvement were limited by the country's difficult financial circumstances. 65. In 1995 the CPT recommended to the Bulgarian authorities, inter alia, that sufficient food and drink and safe eating utensils be provided, that mattresses and blankets be cleaned regularly, that detainees be provided with personal hygiene products (soap, toothpaste, etc.), that custodial staff be instructed to allow detainees to leave their cells during the day to use a toilet facility, unless overriding security considerations required otherwise, that the regulation providing for thirty minutes' exercise per day be fully complied with, that cell lighting and ventilation be improved, and that pretrial detainees be as much as possible transferred to prison even before the preliminary investigation was completed. The need to afford detainees the opportunity for outdoor exercise was to be examined as a matter of urgency. 66. In this report (CPT/Inf (2002) 1) the CPT noted that new rules, providing for better conditions, had been enacted, but had not yet resulted in significant improvements. 67. In most places visited in 1999, the conditions of detention on the Investigation Service's premises remained generally the same as those found during the CPT's 1995 visit, including as regards hygiene, overcrowding and outofcell activities. In some places the situation had even worsened. 68. The CPT also observed that in the recent years there had been an increase in the incidence of tuberculosis cases in the Bulgarian prison system. It found that although certain efforts had been made to combat this disease, the steps taken by the authorities to ensure the medical screening of prisoners did not measure up to the relevant international standards. The CPT recommended that the authorities increase their efforts to implement these standards in the field of tuberculosis control (in particular, provide appropriate training and instructions to the prison doctors). During its visit to the Burgas Prison the CPT found that the conditions (in particular, the overcrowding and the poor lighting and ventilation) in the cells accommodating inmates suffering from tuberculosis, coupled with the limited possibilities for outdoor exercise, were conducive to the spread of the disease. Accordingly, it recommended that the authorities reduce the occupancy levels in these cells, improve access to natural light and ventilation, and enable the prisoners to maintain a level of personal hygiene consistent with the requirements of their state of health.","['3', '5']",['5-4'],[],['5'],"['5-3', '5-5']",[],1
54,001-61246,ENG,GBR,CHAMBER,2003,CASE OF EDWARDS AND LEWIS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,2,Violation of Art. 6-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"9. The first applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Woking. 10. On 9 August 1994, following a surveillance and undercover operation, he was arrested in a van in the company of an undercover police officer known only as “Graham”. In the van was a briefcase containing 4.83 kilograms of 50% pure heroin. On 7 April 1995 the applicant was convicted in Snaresbrook Crown Court of possessing a Class A drug with intent to supply and was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. 11. The first applicant's defence was that at the time of his arrest he believed he was taking part in a transaction to sell stolen jewellery. He alleged that his participation had been organised by a man named Geoffrey Lerway, whom he had met the previous year while both were detained on remand in Brixton Prison. According to the applicant, the week before his arrest Lerway had introduced him to a man called Jim Humphries and a man presented to him only as “Martin”. The day before the arrest, the applicant was contacted by Lerway and asked if he would be interested in going to Birmingham in connection with a jewellery deal in which Lerway was acting as intermediary to Martin. He would be given a cut of the purchase price. The applicant agreed that Lerway would pick him up from his home the next day. 12. The following morning he was told that the plans had changed as Martin was now coming to London. The first applicant agreed to accompany Lerway to a public house where, at approximately 12.45 p.m., a red Jaguar car and a white van drew up. The driver of the Jaguar was introduced to the applicant as “Jeff”; he was accompanied by a man and a woman, subsequently called “Terry” and “Carol”. The driver of the van was introduced as “Graham”. Jeff gave Lerway a briefcase containing GBP 125,000. They all then left in convoy for the Clive Hotel, Primrose Hill, where they were to meet Martin. 13. At the hotel, Lerway decided to stay with the money in the car and asked the applicant to see if Martin had arrived. The applicant therefore went into the hotel where he met Jim Humphries, who told him that the arrangements had changed again as Martin was now in Euston. Humphries and Lerway asked the applicant to take a taxi to Euston and ask Martin to return with him to the Clive Hotel. The applicant followed these instructions and found Martin, who told him he had to leave immediately for another meeting. Martin, having spoken to Humphries or Lerway by mobile phone, gave the applicant the key to a room in the nearby Ibis Hotel, and explained that the “goods” were in a briefcase in the room. 14. According to the applicant, Graham came from Primrose Hill in his van and met the applicant outside the Ibis. Graham then suggested that the applicant should accompany him up to the room and offered to give him a lift back to Primrose Hill afterwards. In the hotel room, Graham forced the lock on the case while the applicant was in the bathroom and when he came out Graham was ready to go. They returned to the van where the briefcase was opened and within moments the applicant had been arrested. 15. Of all the participants in the above transaction, only the applicant was arrested and charged. The applicant suspects that the other participants were undercover police officers or informers acting on police instructions, but their identities and status have never been revealed to him. In this regard he considers it relevant that at the time of the alleged dealings, Lerway was on bail to the Middlesex Crown Court in respect of a large scale conspiracy to supply cannabis. One of the conspirators was a former Flying Squad Detective. It was known to the applicant that Lerway had acted as a participating police informer in that case and it was further known that the police officers involved in the applicant's case had also investigated the conspiracy for which Lerway was on bail. The applicant believes that sentencing in Lerway's trial was deliberately postponed until 12 April 1995, some five days after the conclusion of the applicant's own trial, as a disincentive for Lerway to come forward and give evidence concerning the true nature of the transaction. 16. Prior to the commencement of the applicant's trial the prosecution gave notice to the defence that an application to withhold material evidence had been made ex parte in advance of the trial under the procedure approved in R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe (see paragraph 34 below). Judge Owen Stable QC, who considered the material in the absence of the defence, concluded that it would not assist the defence and that there were genuine public interest grounds for withholding it. This ruling was subsequently reconsidered by the trial judge, who had the benefit of a document prepared by the defence, outlining the issues in the case, as well as of the oral submissions of defence counsel. In the course of the present proceedings before the European Court, the Government revealed for the first time that the material placed before the trial judge included information indicating that the applicant had been involved in the supply of heroin before the start of the undercover operation. The subject matter of the public interest immunity evidence was not disclosed to the applicant during the domestic proceedings, either at first instance or on appeal. He denies any prior involvement in drug dealing. The trial judge, who directed himself in accordance with the approach set out by the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane (see paragraph 36 below), decided that the evidence in question would not assist the defence and found genuine public interest grounds in favour of non-disclosure. 17. Following the ruling on disclosure, the defence made an application to the trial judge under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (“PACE”: see paragraph 29 below) to exclude the evidence of Graham, on the basis that the applicant had been entrapped into committing the offence. These submissions were rejected. The judge held that in the course of the ex parte application he had heard nothing and seen no material which would have assisted the defence in their argument that evidence should be excluded under section 78 on grounds of entrapment. He continued that, if he had seen or heard any such material, he would have ordered disclosure. 18. Apart from the applicant, Graham was the only participant in the offence to give evidence at the trial. He testified that the applicant had made a number of incriminating statements to him when they were alone together in the van and hotel room. Although Graham claimed to have made a full note of the alleged conversations, these notes were never shown to the applicant and the applicant was not questioned in connection with their content by the investigating police officers. According to the applicant it was, however, difficult for the defence to undermine Graham's credibility because his full name and other identifying details were not disclosed. 19. Following his conviction the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal on the ground, inter alia, that the judge had been wrong to refuse to order disclosure. Dismissing the appeal on 18 July 1996 the Court of Appeal, having itself examined the undisclosed evidence, observed that “each one of us reached the clearest possible view that nothing in the documents withheld could possibly have assisted the defence at trial; indeed quite the reverse”. 20. Prior to the events in question, the applicant was of good character. He had been employed as accounts director in a firm which had gone into liquidation a year earlier, and at the time of his arrest in July 1995 he was unemployed and in considerable debt. 21. The applicant's version of events, which he maintained from the time of his first interview with the police, was that he had been introduced to a man named “Terry” by an acquaintance, Colin Phelps, since Terry appeared interested in purchasing from the applicant some bankrupt stock. At a meeting in July 1995 Terry had started talking about counterfeit currency and had pressed the applicant to obtain some as part of the transaction. Although the applicant had never hitherto been involved with counterfeit currency, he did have a contact, “John”, who was able to supply forged bank notes. 22. Terry went on to introduce the applicant to two men called “Jag” and “Jazz”. At a third meeting on 14 July 1995, Jag turned up with “Chris”, who was subsequently revealed to be an undercover police officer, and an order for a large amount of currency was placed. It appears from the transcript of covert tape recordings made during this meeting that, while the applicant was not unwilling to become involved, he was actively encouraged to do so by Jag and Chris, who pressurised him to a certain degree to supply more notes of a higher denomination than had at first been agreed. On 25 July 1995 the applicant met Chris and another undercover officer, “Ian”, in a public house car park. He showed them some counterfeit notes, and was immediately arrested by uniformed officers. More counterfeit notes were found when his house was searched. 23. The applicant maintained that he had been entrapped by undercover police officers and/or participating informers into committing the offences. On 11 November 1996 he applied to the Crown Court judge for an order that the indictment should be stayed on the grounds that, as a result of the covert activities of undercover police officers and/or participating informers, (a) it was not possible for him to have a fair trial and (b) the moral integrity of the criminal proceedings had been impugned. He also requested the judge to order the prosecution to provide more information and documents, including information relating to the question whether Colin Phelps, “Terry” or “Tel”, “Jazz” or “Jag” were participating informers or undercover police officers. 24. Prior to making his ruling on the defence application, the judge heard, ex parte, an application by the prosecution to withhold certain material evidence on grounds of public interest immunity. The judge refused to grant a stay or to order further disclosure, indicating that most of the information sought was subject to public interest immunity. He also ruled that, while it was clear that “Chris” was coaxing the applicant, there was no evidence of pressure being applied. 25. A second submission was then made on the applicant's behalf to exclude the evidence of undercover police officers under section 78 of PACE. However, before evidence was called from the officers in question – “Chris” and “Ian” – the defence counsel sought guidance from the judge as to the areas of cross examination which would or would not be allowed, given that certain issues relating to the investigation were covered by public interest immunity. It became apparent that most of the areas of cross examination necessary to develop the submission were not to be allowed. Accordingly, the submission was withdrawn and the applicant entered guilty pleas to the indictment on 12 November 1996. 26. On 20 November 1996 he was sentenced to a total of four and a half years' imprisonment. 27. On 28 November 1996 counsel advised that the applicant had no prospects of success in appealing against conviction, since he would have to demonstrate that the convictions were unsafe before an appeal could succeed. This would be impossible given that, on his own account, he had been motivated by money to enter into the deal to sell counterfeit currency. Counsel also expressed the view that: “Had there been anything within the [public interest immunity] material which could have assisted the Defendant in developing his case to exclude the evidence under s.78 PACE I am confident the Judge would have released it. In those circumstances, I advise that there are no grounds of appeal against conviction.” 28. The fact that a defendant would not have committed an offence were it not for the activity of an undercover police officer or an informer acting on police instructions does not provide a defence under English law. The judge does, however, have a discretion to order a stay of a prosecution where it appears that entrapment has occurred, as the House of Lords affirmed in R. v. Looseley; Attorney General's Reference (No. 3 of 2000) ([2001] UKHL 53), a judgment which followed and approved earlier case-law, including case-law which applied at the times of the applicants' trials (for example, the judgment of the House of Lords in R. v. Latif [1996] vol. 1 Weekly Law reports p. 104). In Looseley, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead explained, (§ 1): “My Lords, every court has an inherent power and duty to prevent abuse of its process. This is a fundamental principle of the rule of law. By recourse to this principle courts ensure that executive agents of the state do not misuse the coercive, law enforcement functions of the courts and thereby oppress citizens of the state. Entrapment ... is an instance where such misuse may occur. It is simply not acceptable that the state through its agents should lure its citizens into committing acts forbidden by the law and then seek to prosecute them for doing so. That would be entrapment. That would be a misuse of state power, and an abuse of the process of the courts. The unattractive consequences, frightening and sinister in extreme cases, which state conduct of this nature could have are obvious. The role of the courts is to stand between the state and its citizens and make sure this does not happen”. 29. In addition, the court has a discretion, under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, to exclude evidence obtained by an undercover police officer where, inter alia, the defendant would not have committed the offence without the police incitement (R. v. Smurthwaite; R. v. Gill (1994) vol. 98 Criminal Appeal Reports p. 437, judgment of the Court of Appeal; and Looseley, cited above). Of the two remedies, the grant of a stay, rather than the exclusion of evidence, is the more appropriate remedy because a prosecution founded on entrapment is an abuse of the court's process and should not have been brought in the first place. 30. In Looseley, their Lordships agreed that it was not possible to set out a comprehensive definition of unacceptable police conduct or “state created crime”. In each case it was for the judge, having regard to all the circumstances, to decide whether the conduct of the police or other law enforcement agency was so seriously improper as to bring the administration of justice into dispute. Factors to be taken into account included the nature of the offence, the reason for the particular police operation, the possibility of using other methods of detection and the nature and extent of police participation in the crime; the greater the inducement held out by the police, and the more forceful and persistent the police overtures, the more readily might a court conclude that the police had overstepped the boundary, since their conduct might well have brought about the commission of a crime by a person who would normally avoid crime of that kind. The police should act in good faith to uncover evidence of criminal acts which they reasonably suspected the accused was about to commit or was already engaged in committing, and the police operation should be properly supervised. The defendant's criminal record was unlikely to be relevant unless it could be linked to other factors grounding reasonable suspicion that he or she had been engaged in the criminal activity in question prior to the involvement of the police (per Lord Nicholls, §§ 26-29; Lord Hoffmann, §§ 50-71). 31. At common law, the prosecution has a duty to disclose any material which has or might have some bearing on the offence charged. This duty extends to any earlier written or oral statement of a prosecution witness which is inconsistent with evidence given by that witness at the trial and statements of any witnesses potentially favourable to the defence. 32. In December 1981 the Attorney-General issued Guidelines, which did not have the force of law, concerning exceptions to the common law duty to disclose to the defence evidence of potential assistance to it ((1982) 74 Criminal Appeal Reports, p. 302 (“the Guidelines”)). According to the Guidelines, the duty to disclose was subject to a discretionary power for prosecuting counsel to withhold relevant evidence if it fell within one of the categories set out in paragraph 6. One of these categories (6(iv)) was “sensitive” material which, because of its sensitivity, it would not be in the public interest to disclose. “Sensitive material” was defined as follows: “... (a) it deals with matters of national security; or it is by, or discloses the identity of, a member of the Security Services who would be of no further use to those services once his identity became known; (b) it is by, or discloses the identity of, an informant and there are reasons for fearing that the disclosure of his identity would put him or his family in danger; (c) it is by, or discloses the identity of, a witness who might be in danger of assault or intimidation if his identity became known; (d) it contains details which, if they became known, might facilitate the commission of other offences or alert someone not in custody that he is a suspect; or it discloses some unusual form of surveillance or method of detecting crime; (e) it is supplied only on condition that the contents will not be disclosed, at least until a subpoena has been served upon the supplier – e.g. a bank official; (f) it relates to other offences by, or serious allegations against, someone who is not an accused, or discloses previous convictions or other matters prejudicial to him; (g) it contains details of private delicacy to the maker and/or might create risk of domestic strife.” 33. In R. v. Ward ([1993] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 619) the Court of Appeal stressed that the court and not the prosecution was to decide whether or not relevant evidence should be retained on grounds of public interest immunity. It explained that “... a judge is balancing on the one hand the desirability of preserving the public interest in the absence of disclosure against, on the other hand, the interests of justice. Where the interests of justice arise in a criminal case touching and concerning liberty or conceivably on occasion life, the weight to be attached to the interests of justice is plainly very great indeed”. 34. In R. v. Davis, Johnson and Rowe ([1993] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 613), the Court of Appeal held that it was not necessary in every case for the prosecution to give notice to the defence when it wished to claim public interest immunity, and outlined three different procedures to be adopted. The first procedure, which had generally to be followed, was for the prosecution to give notice to the defence that they were applying for a ruling by the court and indicate to the defence at least the category of the material which they held. The defence would then have the opportunity to make representations to the court. Secondly, however, where the disclosure of the category of the material in question would in effect reveal that which the prosecution contended should not be revealed, the prosecution should still notify the defence that an application to the court was to be made, but the category of the material need not be disclosed and the application should be ex parte. The third procedure would apply in an exceptional case where to reveal even the fact that an ex parte application was to be made would in effect be to reveal the nature of the evidence in question. In such cases the prosecution should apply to the court ex parte without notice to the defence. 35. The Court of Appeal observed that although ex parte applications limited the rights of the defence, in some cases the only alternative would be to require the prosecution to choose between following an inter partes procedure or declining to prosecute, and in rare but serious cases the abandonment of a prosecution in order to protect sensitive evidence would be contrary to the public interest. It referred to the important role performed by the trial judge in monitoring the views of the prosecution as to the proper balance to be struck and remarked that even in cases in which the sensitivity of the information required an ex parte hearing, the defence had “as much protection as can be given without pre-empting the issue”. Finally, it emphasised that it was for the trial judge to continue to monitor the position as the trial progressed. Issues might emerge during the trial which affected the balance and required disclosure “in the interests of securing fairness to the defendant”. For this reason it was important for the same judge who heard any disclosure application also to conduct the trial. 36. The leading case on disclosure at the time of the applicant's trial was the judgment of the Court of Appeal in R. v. Keane ([1994] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 746). The Lord Chief Justice, giving the judgment of the court, held that the prosecution should put before the judge only those documents which it regarded as material but wished to withhold on grounds of public interest immunity. “Material” evidence was defined as evidence which could be seen, “on a sensible appraisal by the prosecution: (1) to be relevant or possibly relevant to an issue in the case; (2) to raise or possibly raise a new issue whose existence is not apparent from the evidence which the prosecution proposes to use; (3) to hold out a real (as opposed to fanciful) prospect of providing a lead on evidence which goes to (1) or (2)”. 37. Once the judge was seized of the material, he or she had to perform the balancing exercise between the public interest in non-disclosure and the importance of the documents to the issues of interest, or likely to be of interest, to the accused. If the disputed material might prove the defendant's innocence or avoid a miscarriage of justice, the balance came down firmly in favour of disclosing it. Where, on the other hand, the material in question would not be of assistance to the accused, but would in fact assist the prosecution, the balance was likely to be in favour of non-disclosure. 38. In the case of R. v. Turner ([1995] vol. 1 Weekly Law Reports p. 264), the Court of Appeal returned to the balancing exercise, stating inter alia: “Since R. v. Ward ... there has been an increasing tendency for defendants to seek disclosure of informants' names and roles, alleging that those details are essential to the defence. Defences that the accused has been set up, and allegations of duress, which used at one time to be rare, have multiplied. We wish to alert judges to the need to scrutinise applications for disclosure of details about informants with very great care. They will need to be astute to see that assertions of a need to know such details, because they are essential to the running of the defence, are justified. If they are not so justified, then the judge will need to adopt a robust approach in declining to order disclosure. Clearly, there is a distinction between cases in which the circumstances raise no reasonable possibility that information about the informant will bear upon the issues and cases where it will. Again, there will be cases where the informant is an informant and no more; other cases where he may have participated in the events constituting, surrounding, or following the crime. Even when the informant has participated, the judge will need to consider whether his role so impinges on an issue of interest to the defence, present or potential, as to make disclosure necessary ...” 39. The requirements of disclosure have since been set out in a statutory scheme. Under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (“the 1996 Act”), which came into effect in England and Wales immediately upon gaining Royal Assent on 4 July 1996, the prosecution must make “primary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed evidence which, in the prosecutor's view, might undermine the case for the prosecution. The defendant must then give a defence statement to the prosecution and the court, setting out in general terms the nature of the defence and the matters on which the defence takes issue with the prosecution. The prosecution must then make a “secondary disclosure” of all previously undisclosed material “which might reasonably be expected to assist the accused's defence as disclosed by the defence statement”. Disclosure by the prosecution may be subject to challenge by the accused and review by the trial court. 40. Following the judgments of the Court in Chahal v. the United Kingdom (15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V) and Tinnelly v. the United Kingdom (10 July 1998, Reports 1998-IV), the United Kingdom has introduced legislation making provision for the appointment of a “special counsel” in certain cases involving national security. The provisions are contained in the Special Immigration Appeals Commission Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”), and the Northern Ireland Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”). Under this legislation, where it is necessary on national security grounds for the relevant tribunal to sit in camera, in the absence of the affected individual and his or her legal representatives, the Attorney General may appoint a special counsel to represent the interests of the individual in the proceedings. The legislation provides that the special counsel is not however “responsible to the person whose interest he is appointed to represent”, thus ensuring that the special counsel is both entitled and obliged to keep confidential any information which cannot be disclosed. The relevant rules giving effect to the 1997 and 1998 Acts are set out in the Court's judgment in Jasper v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 27052/92, § 36, ECHR 2000). 41. In December 1999 the Government commissioned a comprehensive review of the criminal justice system, under the chairmanship of a senior Court of Appeal judge, Sir Robin Auld. The report, published in September 2001 after extensive consultation and entitled “The Review of the Criminal Courts in England and Wales” (“the Auld Report”), recommended, inter alia, the introduction of a “special counsel” scheme in cases where the prosecution wished to seek, ex parte, non-disclosure on grounds of public interest immunity. The recommendation was explained in the Report as follows (footnotes omitted): “193. The scheme [developed by the common law since R v. Ward and reflected in the 1996 Act: see above] is an improvement on what went before and has been generally welcomed on that account. But there is widespread concern in the legal professions about lack of representation of the defendant's interest in the [ex parte] forms of application, and anecdotal and reported instances of resultant unfairness to the defence. ... A suggestion, argued on behalf of applicants in Strasbourg and widely supported in the Review, is that the exclusion of the defendant from the procedure should be counterbalanced by the introduction of a 'special independent counsel'. He would represent the interest of the defendant at first instance and, where necessary, on appeal on a number of issues: first, as to the relevance of the undisclosed material if and to the extent that it has not already been resolved in favour of disclosure but for a public interest immunity claim; second, on the strength of the claim to public interest immunity; third, on how helpful the material might be to the defence; and fourth, generally to safeguard against the risk of judicial error or bias. 194. In my view, there is much to be said for such a proposal, regardless of the vulnerability or otherwise of the present procedures to Article 6. Tim Owen QC, in a paper prepared for the Review, has argued powerfully in favour of it. It would restore some adversarial testing of the issues presently absent in the determination of these often critical and finely balanced applications. It should not be generally necessary for special counsel to be present throughout the trial. Mostly the matter should be capable of resolution by the court before trial and, if any question about it arises during trial, he could be asked to return. If, because of the great number of public interest immunity issues now being taken in the courts, the instruction of special counsel for each would be costly, it simply indicates, as Owen has commented, the scale of the problem and is not an argument against securing a fair solution. 195. The role would be similar to that of an amicus curiae brought in to give independent assistance to a court, albeit mostly on appeal. In rape cases, where an unrepresented defendant seeks to cross-examine a complainant, the court must inform him that he may not do so, and should he refuse to instruct counsel, the court will appoint and instruct one. After the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Chahal and Tinnelly, the Government introduced such a procedure in immigration cases involving national security. Although such cases are extremely rare, it is sufficient that the principle of a 'third' or 'special' counsel being instructed on behalf of a defendant has been conceded in a number of areas. 196. The introduction of a system of special independent counsel could, as Owen has also noted, in part fill a lacuna in the law as to public interest immunity hearings in the absence of a defendant appellant in the Court of Appeal, to which the 1996 Act and supporting Rules do not apply. Where there has been a breach of Article 6 because a trial judge did not conduct a public interest immunity hearing due to the emergence of the material only after conviction, the European Court of Human Rights has held that the breach cannot be cured by a hearing before the Court of Appeal in the absence of the appellant. The Court's reasons for so holding were that the appeals court is confined to examining the effect of non-disclosure on the trial ex post facto and could possibly be unconsciously influenced by the jury's verdict into underestimating the significance of the undisclosed material. 197. However, even the introduction of special counsel to such hearings would not solve the root problem to which I have referred of police failure, whether out of incompetence or dishonesty, to indicate to the prosecutor the existence of critical information. Unless, as I have recommended, the police significantly improve their performance in that basic exercise, there will be no solid foundation for whatever following safeguards are introduced into the system. I recommend the introduction of a scheme for instruction by the court of special independent counsel to represent the interests of the defendant in those cases at first instance and on appeal where the court now considers prosecution applications in the absence of the defence in respect of the non-disclosure of sensitive material.”",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were respectively born in 1938, 1943 and 1948 and live in Rome. 5. The applicants' father was the owner of a flat in Rome, which he had let to C.C. 6. In a writ served on the tenant on 24 January 1984, the applicants' father informed the tenant that he intended to terminate the lease on expiry of the term and summoned him to appear before the Rome Magistrate. 7. By a decision of 17 April 1984, which was made enforceable on 2 May 1984, the Rome Magistrate upheld the validity of the notice to quit and ordered that the premises be vacated by 16 April 1985. 8. On 10 March 1985, the applicants' father served notice on the tenant requiring him to vacate the premises. 9. On 3 April 1987, the applicants' father served notice on the tenant informing him that the order for possession would be enforced by a bailiff on 12 May 1987. 10. On 14 February 1992, the applicants' father died and they inherited the flat. Subsequently they became parties to the eviction proceedings. 11. Between 12 May 1987 and 15 February 2000, the bailiff made fifty-seven attempts to recover possession. Each attempt proved unsuccessful, as neither the applicants' father nor themselves were entitled to police assistance in enforcing the order for possession. 12. On an unspecified date in February 2000, reaching an agreement with the tenant, the applicants recovered possession of the flat. 13. Since 1947 the public authorities in Italy have frequently intervened in residential tenancy legislation with the aim of controlling rents. This has been achieved by rent freezes (occasionally relaxed when the Government decreed statutory increases), by the statutory extension of all current leases and by the postponement, suspension or staggering of the enforcement of orders for possession. The relevant domestic law concerning the extension of tenancies, the suspension of enforcement and the staggering of evictions is described in the Court's judgment in the case of Immobiliare Saffi v. Italy [GC], no. 22774/93, §§ 18-35, ECHR 1999-V. Lastly, a suspension of the enforcement of the orders for possession until 30 June 2004 was introduced by Legislative Decree no. 147 of 24 June 2003, which became Law no. 200 of 1 August 2003. 14. As regards the control of the rents, the evolution of the Italian legislation may be summarised as follows. 15. The first relevant measure was the Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978 which provided machinery for “fair rents” (the so-called equo canone) on the basis of a number of criteria such as the surface of the flat and its costs of realisation. 16. The second step of the Italian authorities dated August 1992. It was taken in the view of progressive liberalisation of the market of tenancies. Accordingly, a legislation relaxing on rent levels restrictions (the so-called patti in deroga) entered into force. Owners and tenants were in principle given the opportunity to derogate from the rent imposed by law and to agree on a different price. 17. Lastly, Law no. 431 of 9 December 1998 reformed the tenancies and liberalised the rents. 18. The tenant is under a general obligation to refund the owner any damages caused in the case of late restitution of the flat. In this regard, Article 1591 of the Italian Civil Code provides: “The tenant who fails to vacate the immovable property is under an obligation to pay the owner the agreed amount until the date when he leaves, together with other remaining damages.” 19. However, Law no. 61 of 1989 set out, inter alia, a limit to the compensation claimable by the owner entitling him to a sum equal to the rent paid by the tenant at the time of the expiration of the lease, proportionally increased according to the cost of living (Article 24 of Law no. 392 of 27 July 1978) plus 20%, along the period of inability to dispose of the possession of the flat. 20. In the judgment no. 482 of 2000, the Constitutional Court was called upon to decide whether such a limitation complied with the Constitution. The Constitutional Court held that it was compatible with the Constitution with regard to periods of time during which the suspension of the evictions was determined by law. The Constitutional Court explained that the introduction of that limitation was intended to settle the tenancies of the time of the emergency legislation, when the housing shortage made the suspension of the enforcement necessary. While evictions were suspended ex lege, the law predetermined the quantum of the reimbursement chargeable to the tenant, both measures being temporary and exceptional. Besides, the interests of the owner were counterbalanced by the exemption for him from the burden to prove the damages. 21. The Constitutional Court declared the limitation to the compensation claimable by the owner unconstitutional with regard to cases where the impossibility for the owner to repossess the flat depended on the conduct of the tenant and was not due to a legislative intervention. Accordingly, it opened the way to owners for the institution of civil proceedings in order to obtain full reparation of the damages caused by the tenant.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Slavyanovka village, Kaliningrad region. 7. On 6 April 2001 the Gusevskiy Town Court of the Kaliningrad Region convicted the applicant of theft, robbery and forgery and sentenced him to seven years and six months' imprisonment. This judgment was upheld by the Kaliningrad Regional Court on 5 June 2001. The courts found, inter alia, that the applicant had paid for a car, purchased from Mr O., with counterfeit United States dollars. The court further indicated that Mr O. might bring civil proceedings against the applicant. 8. In June 2001 Mr O. lodged a civil claim against the applicant, seeking to recover his car from the applicant. It was received by the Gusevskiy Town Court on 19 June 2001. 9. On 20 June 2001 Judge G. of the Gusevskiy Town Court forwarded a copy of the statement of claim to the administration of the detention centre where the applicant was being detained (remand prison IZ-39/1). In a cover letter, the judge instructed the administration to hand the statement of claim to the applicant and obtain his written observations in reply by 11 July 2001. 10. According to the Government, on 21 June 2001 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony OM-216/13 where he was to serve his sentence. That colony was situated in Slavyanovka village, Kaliningrad region. The documents sent by Judge G. to the applicant were forwarded to his new address in that colony. The colony received them on 13 July 2001. 11. On 11 July 2001, the Gusevskiy Town Court examined the civil claim in the applicant's absence. On the same day the Town Court, by a default judgment, ordered the applicant to return the car to Mr O. The court indicated, inter alia, that the defendant (the applicant) had been properly notified of the date of the hearing but had failed to appear. Mr O. was present and made oral submissions to the court. 12. The applicant alleged that he had been notified of the hearing only on 16 July 2001. The following day he had approached the Town Court seeking the reopening of the proceedings and reversal of the judgment on the ground that the hearing had taken place in his absence. The applicant had also requested legal aid and insisted on his personal presence at the hearing. On 19 July 2001 his letters were dispatched to the Town Court by the administration of the correctional colony. They were received by the court on 25 July 2001. 13. On 17 August 2001 the court set a date for hearing the applicant's request and informed the applicant thereof. The Government maintained that the notification had been received by the applicant on 28 August 2001. 14. On 31 August 2001 the applicant wrote a letter to the Town Court asking them to examine the case in his presence and provide him with a lawyer. That letter was dispatched to the court by the head of the correctional colony. His cover-letter was dated 4 September 2001; however, according to the postal stamp, the applicant's letter was actually posted on 7 September 2001. 15. On 6 September 2001 the hearing took place in the applicant's absence. Mr. O was present and made oral submissions. The applicant alleged that he had been unable to attend the hearing for want of a court's “conveyance request” (заявка на этапирование) ordering the correctional colony administration to escort him to the court. 16. By a decision of 6 September 2001 the Gusevskiy District Court refused to re-examine the case. The court found that the applicant had not presented any new evidence that might affect the court's findings of 11 July 2001. The applicant's argument that he had not been properly notified of the hearing and his request for legal aid were left open in the court's decision. The next day, that decision was sent to the applicant. 17. Following the Town Court's refusal to reopen the proceedings, the applicant appealed to the Regional Court, complaining about the first-instance court's decisions of 11 July and 6 September 2001. He insisted that his personal presence at the hearing of 11 July 2001 had been necessary to prove that the deal with Mr. O.'s car was legal and valid, and that the proceedings should therefore be reopened. He also asked the Regional Court to order his conveyance from the correctional colony in order to take part in the hearing. 18. On 9 October 2001 Judge G. informed the applicant of the date of the appeal hearing, by way of a simple notice. The judge indicated that the applicant's personal presence at the hearing was not mandatory, and that bringing him to the court hearing was “inopportune”. 19. On 10 October 2001 the Kaliningrad Regional Court examined the appeal in absentia and upheld the judgment of 11 July and the decision of 6 September 2001. The court indicated that, under Article 213-11, proceedings ending with a default judgment should only be reopened if two conditions were met: (a) the absent party had been unable, with good reason, to attend the hearing or to inform the court in a timely fashion thereof, and (b) the absent party produced evidence that might affect the conclusions of the default judgment. The court further indicated that the default judgment of 11 July 2001 had been fully based on the courts' findings in the criminal case against the applicant. Lastly, the Regional Court established that the applicant's submissions about the circumstances of the deal with the car would not have had any impact on the findings of the default judgment. In conclusion the court stated as follows: “The argument that [the applicant's] absence in court was excusable because he had been unable to inform the court in a timely fashion of the valid reasons for his absence cannot be accepted as a sole ground for quashing the judgment since the default judgment may only be quashed if both of the above-mentioned conditions have been met. Furthermore, [the applicant] does not explain why he was not able to inform the court that he was serving a prison sentence.” 20. As a consequence, the Regional Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the default judgment. 21. Parties to civil proceedings could appear before a court in person or act through a representative (Article 43 of the Code of Civil Procedure in force until 31 January 2003 (“the old CCP”). 22. Article 106 of the old CCP provided that a summons was to be served on the parties and their representatives in such a way that they would have enough time to appear at the hearing and prepare their case. Where necessary, the parties could be summoned by a telephone call or a telegram. Pursuant to Articles 108 and 109, court summonses were to be sent by post or by courier and served on the person who was a party to the case. The party was to sign the second copy of a summons which was to be returned to the court. If a summons could not be served on a party, it was to be served on an adult family member who lived with the party. If a party was absent, the person who delivered the summons was to note on the second copy of the summons where the party could be found (Article 109). 23. Article 144 required that civil cases be heard in a court session with mandatory notification of the case to all parties. Article 151 provided that court sessions started with the court secretary informing the judge of the parties who had received summons but had failed to appear. The secretary had to inform the judge of the reasons for their absence. Pursuant to Article 157, if a party to the case failed to appear and there was no evidence that the party had been duly summoned, the hearing was to be adjourned. 24. Article 213-1 provided that if a defendant was duly notified of the hearing but failed to appear, the court might proceed with the case, provided that the plaintiff did not object. Article 213-6 provided that a default judgment could be challenged either by lodging a request for the reopening of the case with the first-instance court, or by appealing directly to the court of appeal. Under Article 213-9, a decision of the first-instance court not to reopen the case was subject to an appeal as well. Under Article 213-11, the reopening of a case was possible if two conditions were met: (a) the absent party had been unable, with good reason, to attend the hearing or to inform the court in a timely fashion thereof, and (b) the absent party produced evidence which might have affected the outcome of the case. 25. The Penitentiary Code provides that convicted persons may be transferred from a correctional colony to an investigation unit if their participation is required as witnesses, victims or suspects in connection with certain investigative measures (Article 77.1). The Code does not mention the possibility for convicted persons to take part in civil proceedings, whether as plaintiffs or defendants. 26. The USSR Advocates Act (Law of 30 November 1979), together with the RSFSR Rules on Advocates (Law of 20 November 1980), in force until 1 July 2002, provided that free legal assistance in civil cases could be provided to certain categories of litigants and for certain categories of disputes such as labour disputes, disputes concerning disability pensions, work-related accidents, etc. (sections 11 and 22 respectively). Disputes involving prisoners similar to the one at the heart of the present case were not mentioned amongst them. However, the law stipulated that free legal assistance could be provided for litigants who had no means to pay for it, on the initiative of the advocate's office, the investigator or the court (section 11(3) of the USSR Advocates Act). If free legal assistance was granted by the court, the lawyers' fees had to be paid by the State.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

BULGARIA,3,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Art. 5-3;Violation of Art. 5-4;Violation of Art. 5-5;Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award,Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Volodymyr Butkevych;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. At about 5 a.m. on 9 May 1998 the applicant and an accomplice were surprised by police while in the process of trying to enter a computer equipment shop through a hole in the wall of the basement of a neighbouring building. They had previously drilled the hole over the course of several nights, and in this way had attracted the attention of the building’s inhabitants. 6. On the morning of 9 May 1998 the applicant and his accomplice were heavily armed. The applicant opened fire and shot a police officer dead. Later he detonated a hand grenade. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire his accomplice was injured and died. The special antiterrorism squad intervened later in the morning. The applicant gave himself up and was arrested at about 8.30 a.m., after negotiations with the police, a psychologist and a public prosecutor. 7. On the same day, 9 May 1998, the applicant was charged with attempted robbery committed in conspiracy with others and accompanied by murder, and placed in pretrial detention. 8. The charges against him were later amended to include the unlawful possession of firearms, ammunition and explosives in large quantities, the murder of a police officer, and attempted murder of six police officers committed in a manner and by means which endangered several lives and by a person who had already committed murder. The maximum penalty on conviction for those offences was life imprisonment, with or without parole. 9. After the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office referred the case back to the investigator on three occasions for additional investigation, on 13 August 1999 the investigator finished his work on the case, recommending that the applicant be committed for trial. 10. On 29 December 1999 the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office filed an indictment against the applicant with the Sofia City Court. 11. On 21 February 2000 the judgerapporteur to whom the case was assigned set it down for hearing on 8 and 9 June 2000. As required by Article 241 § 2 (4) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at that time, he examined of his own motion whether the applicant’s pretrial detention should be replaced with a more lenient measure, and confirmed it without giving reasons. 12. The trial against the applicant began in June 2000, but had to restart in October 2001, as in May 2001 the judge-rapporteur was appointed as the Minister of Justice and the formation examining the case did not include a reserve judge. 13. Over the course of the next few years numerous hearings were adjourned for various reasons. On some occasions the adjournments were made necessary by the fact that the applicant had dismissed his counsel and instructed new ones, who needed time to acquaint themselves with the case file. 14. In a judgment of 14 October 2005 the Sofia City Court found the applicant guilty of murdering a police officer, attempting to murder another police officer and unlawfully possessing firearms and explosives. Although under the relevant provisions of the 1968 Criminal Code it could have imposed a sentence of life imprisonment, it opted for a lesser penalty and sentenced the applicant to thirty years’ imprisonment, citing his clean criminal record, and the facts that he had a family and had not been fully discredited morally and socially. 15. Both the applicant and the prosecution appealed. The prosecution requested that the applicant’s sentence be increased to life imprisonment. 16. On 2 October 2007 the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld the Sofia City Court’s judgment. When considering the appropriateness of the applicant’s sentence, it found that the mitigating circumstances relied on by the lower court were not sufficient to warrant a sentence less than the maximum penalty. It also found that the Sofia City Court had failed to take into account certain aggravating circumstances, such as the victim’s good moral character. In its judgment, the murder committed by the applicant was considerably graver than other offences of that type and the aggravating circumstances were, overall, of such weight and intensity as to rule out a penalty showing any degree of lenience. However, it went on to say, by express reference to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, that the criminal charges against the applicant had not been determined within a reasonable time, with all the negative repercussions which this had had on him. It found that the excessive length of the proceedings was not attributable to the applicant’s conduct, although he had at times failed to organise his defence efficiently. In the court’s view, the undue delay amounted in itself to a mitigating circumstance, which obviated the need to imprison the applicant for life, in line with the former Commission’s and the Court’s caselaw that the excessive length of criminal proceedings could be remedied by a reduction in sentence. 17. The applicant and the prosecution appealed on points of law. The prosecution again argued that the penalty was far too lenient and should be increased to life imprisonment. 18. In a judgment of 5 March 2008 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia Court of Appeal’s judgment, endorsing its reasoning. 19. The applicant was arrested on 9 May 1998 and detained by an investigator’s order of the same day. The reasons given by the investigator were that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence and that there existed a genuine risk that he might abscond. On the same day the investigator’s order was approved by a prosecutor. 20. The applicant made his first request for release on 2 October 1998, when the proceedings against him were at the preliminary investigation stage. The request was dismissed by the Sofia City Court at a public hearing held on 13 October 1998. The court observed that the applicant had committed a serious wilful offence carrying a very severe penalty, and that no special circumstances warranting his release existed. This decision was not subject to appeal. Nevertheless, on 13 December 2000, when the proceedings against him had already progressed to the trial stage, the applicant appealed against it to the Sofia Court of Appeal. In a decision made in private on 15 January 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal, finding that the applicant’s legal challenge was actually not an appeal but a fresh request for release, sent it to the Sofia City Court for a ruling. On 1 February 2001 the applicant appealed against this decision to the Supreme Court of Cassation. On 21 February 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal returned the appeal, informing the applicant that its decision was not subject to appeal on points of law. It seems that the Sofia City Court did not examine the request. 21. On 26 February 2001 the applicant appealed against the decision of the judgerapporteur to confirm his detention of his own motion following receipt of the indictment (see paragraph 11 above). On 9 March 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal, sitting in private, declared the appeal inadmissible. 22. The applicant made further requests for release at several trial hearings, held on 9 April and 29 November 2001, and 18 March and 9 May 2002. They were all turned down by the Sofia City Court at the respective hearings. The applicant’s ensuing appeals were dismissed by the Sofia Court of Appeal by decisions made in private on 4 May 2001, 7 January, 15 April and an unknown later date in 2002. 23. In their reasoning the Sofia City Court and the Sofia Court of Appeal stressed, with various degrees of detail, the following points: (i) the applicant stood accused of several very serious offences, which in itself justified the conclusion that he was a dangerous individual who could abscond or reoffend, (ii) there were no fresh circumstances warranting his release, and (iii) no unwarranted delays had taken place in the criminal proceedings, as the case was factually and legally complex. 24. In its decision of 4 May 2001 the Sofia Court of Appeal stated that the presumption under Article 152 § 2 (3) of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, in the 1 January 2000 version, about the existence of a risk that the detainee might abscond or reoffend (see paragraph 32 below) applied to the applicant’s case. In two other decisions – those of 7 January and 15 April 2001 – that court expressed the view that the applicant’s lack of a criminal record, known identity and permanent place of abode were not enough to rebut this presumption. 25. On at least two occasions, in April and May 2002, the applicant’s appeals against the decisions of the Sofia City Court were sent to the competent public prosecutors, who commented on them in writing. These comments were not communicated to the applicant and later the Sofia Court of Appeal ruled on the appeals in private, without holding a hearing, with the result that the applicant did not have the opportunity of replying to these comments. 26. In October 2002 and April and December 2003 the applicant made three further requests for release in writing. They were turned down by the Sofia City Court in decisions made in private on 18 October 2002 and 14 April and 29 December 2003. On appeal, these decisions were upheld by the Sofia Court of Appeal in decisions also made in private on 11 November 2002, 23 May 2003 and 12 January 2004. 27. The applicant later lodged four more requests for release. They were all rejected by the Sofia City Court at public hearings held on 27 January, 4 May, 8 September and 23 November 2004. The applicant’s ensuing appeals were dismissed by the Sofia Court of Appeal by decisions made in private on 19 February, 7 June, 21 September and 20 December 2004. The Sofia City Court declined to examine a further request for release made by the applicant during the trial hearing on 13 January 2005, on the grounds that his counsel was absent and it could not proceed with the case. 28. In turning down the requests for release made between October 2002 and November 2004 the courts relied on the seriousness of the charges against the applicant, the lack of change in the circumstances save for the passage of time, the complexity of the case and the diligent conduct of the proceedings. In their decisions of 4 May 2004 and 8 September and 23 November 2004 the Sofia Court of Appeal and the Sofia City Court expressed the view that the length of the proceedings was due to the numerous adjournments caused by the applicant. 29. In its decisions of 4 May, 8 September and 23 November 2004 the Sofia City Court stated that under the newly added Article 268a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 36 below), when ruling on requests for release made during the trial, it was barred from examining the existence or otherwise of a reasonable suspicion against the applicant. In its view, to do so would mean to prejudge the merits of the criminal case against the applicant. It was true that under Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention the court had to examine whether a reasonable suspicion existed, but that applied only to rulings made at the pretrial stage. This view was endorsed by the Sofia Court of Appeal in its decision of 21 September 2004. For this reason, the courts declined to delve into the applicant’s arguments concerning this point. 30. On 14 October 2005 the Sofia City Court convicted the applicant (see paragraph 14 above). In a separate decision it confirmed his detention. 31. On 17 June 2002 the applicant asked the Supreme Administrative Court to annul certain provisions of Regulation no. 2 governing the legal regime of pretrial detainees (see paragraph 42 below), which, in his view, violated, inter alia, his freedom of correspondence. In a final judgment of 19 July 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected his application. 32. The relevant provisions of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure and the Bulgarian courts’ practice before 1 January 2000 are summarised in the Court’s judgments in several similar cases (see, among others, Nikolova v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 31195/96, §§ 2536, ECHR 1999-II; Ilijkov v. Bulgaria, no. 33977/96, §§ 5559, 26 July 2001; and Yankov v. Bulgaria, no. 39084/97, §§ 7988, ECHR 2003-XII (extracts)). On 1 January 2000 the legal framework of pretrial detention was amended with the aim of ensuring the compliance of Bulgarian law with the Convention (тълк. реш. № 1 от 25 юни 2002 г. по н.д. № 1/2002 г., ОСНК на ВКС). The amendments and the resulting practice of the Bulgarian courts are summarised in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Dobrev v. Bulgaria (no. 55389/00, §§ 3235, 10 August 2006), and Yordanov v. Bulgaria (no. 56856/00, §§ 2124, 10 August 2006). 33. On 29 April 2006 the 1974 Code was superseded by the 2005 Code of Criminal Procedure, which reproduced all the provisions brought in with the January 2000 reform. 34. By Article 304 § 1 of the 1974 Code, during the trial the detainees’ requests for release were examined by the trial court (the same is currently provided for by Article 270 of the 2005 Code). It followed from Article 304 §§ 1 and 2 of the 1974 Code that these requests could be examined in private or at an oral hearing (under Article 270 § 2 of the 2005 Code, these requests must be examined at an oral hearing). The law did not – and still does not – require the court to decide within a particular timelimit. 35. The trial court’s decision was subject to appeal to the higher court (Article 344 § 3 of the 1974 Code; superseded by Article 270 § 4 of the 2005 Code). The higher court could examine the appeal in private or, if it considered it necessary, at an oral hearing (Article 348 § 1 of the 1974 Code, reproduced in Article 354 § 1 of the 2005 Code). 36. A new Article 268a was added to the 1974 Code in May 2003. By paragraph 1 of that Article (presently reproduced in Article 270 § 1 of the 2005 Code), a fresh request for release at the same level of court could be made only if there had been a change in circumstances. Paragraph 2 in fine of this Article (presently reproduced in Article 270 § 2 in fine of the 2005 Code) provided that the trial court had to refrain from examining the existence or otherwise of a reasonable suspicion against the detainee. 37. Section 2 of the 1988 State Responsibility for Damage Caused to Citizens Act (“the SRDA” – Закон за отговорността на държавата за вреди, причинени на граждани – this was the original title; on 12 July 2006 it was changed to the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, Закон за отговорността на държавата и общините за вреди), provides as follows: “The State shall be liable for damage caused to [private persons] by the organs of ... the investigation, the prosecution, the courts ... for unlawful: 1. pretrial detention, including when imposed as a preventive measure, when it has been set aside for lack of lawful grounds; 2. criminal charges, if the person concerned has been acquitted, or if the criminal proceedings have been discontinued because the act has not been committed by the person concerned or did not constitute a criminal offence...” 38. In a binding interpretative decision (тълк. реш. № 3 от 22 април 2004 г. на ВКС по тълк.д. № 3/2004 г., ОСГК) made on 22 April 2004 the Plenary Meeting of the Civil Chambers of the Supreme Court of Cassation resolved a number of contentious issues relating to the construction of various provisions of the SRDA. In line with the courts’ earlier case-law, in point 13 of the decision it held that pretrial detention was unlawful when it did not comply with the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that the State was liable under section 2(1) of the SRDA when such detention had already been set aside as unlawful. 39. Individuals seeking redress for damage resulting from decisions of the investigating and prosecuting authorities or the courts in circumstances falling within the scope of the SRDA have no claim under general tort law as the Act is a lex specialis and excludes the application of the general regime (section 8(1) of the Act; реш. № 1370/1992 г. от 16 декември 1992 г., по г.д. № 1181/1992 г. на ВС, ІV г.о.). 40. Articles 30, 32 § 1 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution read, as relevant: “Everyone has the right to meet in confidence with the person who defends him. The confidentiality of their communication shall be inviolable.” “The private life of citizens shall be inviolable. Everyone has the right to protection against unlawful interference in his private or family life and against encroachment on his honour, dignity and reputation.” “1. The freedom and secrecy of correspondence and other communications shall be inviolable. 2. This rule may be subject to exceptions only with the permission of the judicial authorities when necessary for uncovering or preventing serious offences.” 41. Section 18(2) of the 1991 Bar Act (Закон за адвокатурата), presently superseded by section 33(2) of the 2004 Bar Act, provided that the correspondence between lawyers and their clients was inviolable, could not be subject to interception and could not be used as evidence in court. 42. Between 1993 and 2000 the legal regime of pretrial detainees, including their correspondence, was the subject of two successive regulations issued by the Minister of Justice: Regulation no. 12 of 15 April 1993, superseded by Regulation no. 2 of 19 April 1999. 43. Under section 18(5) of Regulation no. 12, detainees had the right to send and receive an unlimited number of letters. Section 19(2) of the Regulation provided that letters (except those to and from the detainees’ counsel), which contained advice about the criminal proceedings against them, were not allowed to be passed on, but instead had to be made available to the competent prosecutor or court. 44. Section 25(1) of Regulation no. 2 provided that “the correspondence of the accused and of the indicted [was] subject to inspection by the [detention facilities] administration”. 45. In a decision of 22 December 2000 (реш. № 7982 от 22 декември 2000 г. по адм.д. № 3351/2000 г., ВАС, петчленен състав, обн., ДВ, бр. 4 от 12 януари 2001 г.) the Supreme Administrative Court annulled this provision, holding that it was contrary to Articles 30 § 5, 32 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraph 40 above), Article 8 of the Convention and section 18(2) of the 1991 Bar Act (see paragraph 41 above), as it provided for systematic monitoring of the entirety of the detainees’ correspondence. 46. In June 2002 the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act (Закон за изпълнение на наказанията), which is the statute regulating, along with other matters, the manner of serving custodial sentences, was amended and now incorporates, in the newly added sections 128132h, special rules relating to pretrial detainees. As a result, Regulation no. 2 ceased to apply; it was however expressly repealed only on 1 September 2006, when the Minister of Justice amended the Regulations relating to the application of the Act (see paragraph 49 below). 47. The new section 132d(3) of the 1969 Act provided that “[t]he correspondence of the accused and of the indicted [was] subject to inspection by the [prison] administration”. 48. In a decision of 18 April 2006 (реш. № 4 от 18 април 2006 г. по к.д. № 11 от 2005 г., обн., ДВ, бр. 36 от 2 май 2006 г.) the Constitutional Court, acting pursuant to a request by the Chief Prosecutor, declared this provision unconstitutional. After analysing in detail the relevant constitutional and Convention provisions and making reference to, among others, the cases of Campbell v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 25 March 1992, Series A no. 233), Calogero Diana v. Italy (judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996V) and Petra v. Romania (judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports 1998VII), it held that a blanket authorisation to inspect the correspondence of all detainees without regard to their particular circumstances and the threat which they allegedly posed to society through such correspondence was contrary to Articles 30 § 5 and 34 of the 1991 Constitution (see paragraph 40 above). 49. Following the Constitutional Court’s decision, on 1 September 2006 the Regulations for application of the 1969 Execution of Punishments Act were amended. Under the new section 178(1), pretrial detainees are entitled to unlimited correspondence which is not subject to monitoring. Envelopes have to be sealed and opened in the presence of members of staff, in a manner allowing those members to make sure that they do not contain money or other prohibited items (section 178(2) of the Regulations).","['5', '8']","['5-3', '5-4', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Violation of Art. 5-4;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"8. In April 1970 the applicant, then aged 21, was convicted of manslaughter, qualified as such on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Medical evidence adduced at the trial showed that the applicant suffered from a mental abnormality induced by alcohol. 9. On 27 July 1993 the applicant was released on life licence for the third time subject to the condition, amongst others, that he should comply with any reasonable requirement imposed by his probation officer for the treatment of his alcohol problem. He had been recalled to prison twice previously and had since been transferred to open prison conditions in 1989. 10. On 1 July 1996 the police were called to the home of the applicant's partner, M., who is a deaf mute. She was taken to hospital where she received treatment for injuries to her face and back. 11. On 2 July 1996 the Secretary of State revoked the applicant's licence and recalled him to prison. By a letter dated 4 July 1996, the Secretary of State indicated that the licence was revoked on the grounds that the applicant had caused M.'s injuries after drinking at least eight cans of lager. This was so stated in the report by the applicant's probation officer who had met with M. on 2 July 1996. The case was referred to the Parole Board which confirmed the revocation of the applicant's licence on 12 July 1996. 12. On 8 November 1996 the Parole Board's Discretionary Lifer Panel (“the DLP”), chaired by a High Court judge, met to consider the applicant's representations against recall. It considered the applicant's written and oral representations, the views of two probation officers, the oral evidence of M. and the submissions of the applicant's solicitor and counsel for the Secretary of State. In her oral evidence M. gave evidence to the effect that it had been she and not the applicant who had been responsible for her injuries. A prison officer, who had attained a stage 1 British Sign Language qualification and was training towards stage 2, attended the hearing and acted as interpreter for M. 13. In its written decision of 12 November 1996 the DLP stated, in its reasons for rejecting the applicant's representations, that it had accepted the evidence which indicated that the applicant had been responsible for M.'s injuries, rather than the account put forward on behalf of the applicant. It expressed the opinion that, in order to minimise the risk posed by the applicant to members of the public, the applicant needed to carry out further work in respect of alcohol, anger and relationships. This was communicated to the applicant in a letter dated 15 November 1996 by the Secretary of State, who informed the applicant that his next Parole Board review was set for November 1998. 14. The applicant and M. married in prison on 6 February 1997. 15. The applicant applied for legal aid to challenge the DLP's decision by judicial review. On appeal, legal aid was granted for the limited purpose of seeking further evidence and counsel's opinion. On 15 March 1997, counsel advised that an application for judicial review would be unsuccessful and legal aid was not extended. 16. While in prison, the applicant attended courses in anger management, relationships, alcohol awareness and men and violence run by the Manchester Probation Service. These had been completed within eight months of his recall. 17. On 7 December 1998 the applicant had a further hearing before the DLP. Despite expressing some reservations, the DLP concluded that the applicant had made significant and sufficient progress since his previous review and recommended to the Secretary of State that he be released on licence. The applicant was released on 17 December 1998. 18. Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment, custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty's pleasure have a “tariff” set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. After the expiry of the tariff, the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence. Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change, most notably following the coming into force on 1 October 1992 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”), which was in force at the relevant time. (The provisions of the 1991 Act were replaced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (“the 1997 Act”) from 1 October 1997.) 19. Section 39 of the 1991 Act allowed the Secretary of State to revoke a discretionary life prisoner's licence where it appeared to be expedient in the public interest to recall him to prison. Once recalled, the prisoner had to be informed of the reasons for his recall and could make representations in writing. 20. According to section 32(2) of the 1991 Act, the Parole Board had a duty to advise the Secretary of State with respect to any matter referred to it by him which was connected with the early release or recall of prisoners. The Parole Board's chairman appointed three members of the Parole Board to consider discretionary life cases. They comprised the DLP. The DLP always held an oral hearing when considering whether to release a discretionary life prisoner whose tariff had expired or whether to recall a discretionary life prisoner whose licence had been revoked. It was the duty of the Secretary of State to release the prisoner if the DLP directed his release. 21. According to the Parole Board Rules 1992, which came into force on 1 October 1992, a prisoner was entitled, among other things, to an oral hearing, disclosure of evidence before the Parole Board and legal representation. He was also entitled to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross-examine those who had written reports about him. A reasoned decision by the DLP was delivered within seven days of the hearing. 22. When deciding under section 39 that recall should be confirmed, the DLP often gave guidance as to the timing of the next review. It normally recommended a further review in two years but an earlier date could be given in appropriate cases, with reasons. Where no guidance was given, the Secretary of State decided the date of the next review. Where it became clear that the prisoner had made unexpectedly rapid progress prior to the set review date, the date of the review could be brought forward. A discretionary life prisoner may request the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board after the end of the period of two years beginning with the disposal of a previous reference to the Board (section 34(5)(b) of the 1991 Act, now section 28(7)(b) of the 1997 Act).",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[],1

BULGARIA,4,Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Impartial tribunal),David Thór Björgvinsson;George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. The applicant was born in 1981 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Pleven Prison. 6. The applicant was detained in Belene Prison from an unspecified date in August 2002 until 29 March 2007, when he was moved to Pleven Prison. He stated that the conditions of detention in Belene Prison had been inhuman and degrading. 7. It appears that the applicant submitted frequent complaints to various institutions against the administration of Belene Prison. 8. On an unspecified date in 2005 he complained to the prosecuting authorities that some of the letters he had sent had been withheld by the administration and had never reached their addressees. Following an inquiry, his complaint was dismissed both by the regional prosecutor on 14 July 2005 and on appeal on 17 August 2005 by the prosecutor in appeal proceedings who established that between January 2004 and June 2005 the applicant had sent thirty-one letters, which had been duly entered in the prison register and forwarded to their addressees. 9. On 26 and 31 October 2006 the director of Belene Prison ordered the confinement of the applicant in an isolation cell for two five-day periods following two violent incidents between the applicant and another prisoner which had occurred at short intervals. The applicant appealed. 10. The Levski District Court opened two sets of proceedings and on 10 November 2006 examined the applicants’ appeals in two separate hearings held consecutively. The applicant appeared in person while the prison administration did not send a representative. 11. At the start of the first hearing the court stated that it had summoned Mr K., a prison guard, as a witness. It noted that Mr K. had not appeared, the prison administration having submitted a medical certificate to the effect that he had been admitted to hospital. The applicant requested that another prison guard, Mr S., be questioned but nevertheless agreed that the court should proceed with the examination of the case. 12. On the merits, the applicant stated that he had been insulted and attacked by an inmate. He denied having insulted the inmate concerned and claimed that he was not responsible for the incident and that the punishment was unjustified. 13. In a final decision of the same date the District Court upheld the order of 31 October 2006, stating that the director of the prison had taken into consideration all relevant circumstances and had delivered a reasoned and lawful order. The director had considered the applicant’s and witnesses’ statements and the report of a prison employee. The court further noted that the written statements of the witnesses corroborated the director’s conclusions and did not support the applicant’s account of the events. As to the punishment, it had been determined with due regard to the gravity of the offence and the applicant’s conduct as a whole. 14. Then the court proceeded with the second hearing. It noted that the prison guard Mr S., who had been summoned as a witness, was also in hospital. The applicant insisted on the appearance of Mr S. and stated that he wanted to call a second witness, Mr F. He also asked to be assigned a court-appointed lawyer and sought an adjournment. 15. The court dismissed those requests, stating that it was obliged to complete the examination of the applicant’s appeal within three days of its being lodged and that the absence of a lawyer was not a reason for adjourning the hearing. 16. On the merits, the applicant explained that the incident had been similar to the first one and that he had been insulted and attacked by the same inmate. 17. In a final decision of the same date the District Court upheld the order of 26 October 2006. It found that on 28 September 2006 a conflict had arisen between the applicant and another prisoner which had developed into a fight. That had necessitated the intervention of the guard on duty. The director of the prison had taken into consideration all relevant circumstances and had delivered a reasoned and lawful order. He had considered the applicant’s and witnesses’ statements and the report of a prison employee. The court further noted that the written statements of the witnesses corroborated the director’s conclusions and did not support the applicant’s account of the events. As to the punishment, it had been determined with due regard to the gravity of the offence and the applicant’s conduct as a whole. 18. On 18 December 2006, while the applicant was isolated in a disciplinary cell in connection with the above punishments, his mother sent him a parcel which was not delivered to him. On an unspecified date in December 2006 the applicant asked why his right to receive parcels had been restricted. The prison administration informed him that no parcel had arrived. 19. On 3 January 2007 the applicant complained to the public prosecutor that the prison administration had refused to give him the parcel. He requested that the matter be investigated and the responsible officials punished. He stated that the prison employees often made such mistakes in respect of prisoners. Lastly, he stated that the incident amounted to a criminal offence under Article 171 of the Criminal Code, which made it an offence to, inter alia, hide or destroy a package intended for another person. 20. On 8 January 2007 the applicant gave a copy of his complaint to a prison employee, who transmitted it to the prison director. Following an internal inquiry, it was established that on 18 December 2006 a parcel for the applicant had indeed arrived and was sent back to the sender because the applicant was not entitled to receive parcels while in isolation. In relation to the above, the director of Belene Prison considered the applicant’s statements to the public prosecutor defamatory and on 29 January 2007 punished him with fourteen days’ isolation in a disciplinary cell. He also justified the punishment on grounds of the applicant’s overall conduct, referring to the punishments imposed on him on 26 and 31 October 2006 (see paragraph 9 above) and the fact that the applicant had frequently sent similar complaints to various institutions. The applicant appealed. 21. The District Court held a hearing on 5 February 2007. An employee of the prison submitted that the parcel had been lawfully returned because prisoners were not allowed to receive parcels while punished with solitary confinement. The witness further stated that he had suggested that the applicant be punished because the latter had made insulting and defamatory statements against the prison administration. The witness pointed out that this was the applicant’s third breach of the disciplinary rules. 22. The applicant replied that he would not have complained to the public prosecutor had the prison administration informed him about the parcel. He stated that he had not received a reply from the public prosecutor. 23. In a final decision of the same date the District Court upheld the order of 29 January 2007. It referred to the statements of the witness and the information contained in the disciplinary file and held that the order was reasoned and lawful and that the conduct of the applicant within the last year had been taken into consideration. 24. On an unspecified date in 2007 the applicant requested the General Directorate of Enforcement of Sentences at the Ministry of Justice to transfer him to another prison, stating that the administration of Belene Prison had subjected him to harassment. In particular, he referred to the dispute about the parcel and the ensuing punishment (see paragraphs 18-23 above). 25. On 16 March 2007 the Deputy Minister of Justice granted the applicant’s request and ordered that he be moved to Pleven Prison. He noted that the prison authorities had given inaccurate information to the applicant about the parcel and that, therefore, the applicant had acted in good faith in complaining to the public prosecutor. The honesty of his intention was also evident from the fact that he had provided the prison administration with a copy of his complaint. The Deputy Minister further noted that prisoners were entitled to make applications and complaints to public bodies and stressed that the disciplinary liability envisaged in the Enforcement of Sentences Act could not be used to restrict that right. Noting that the punishment of 29 January 2007 had been upheld by the court and had become final, the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant had understandably lost confidence in the administration of Belene Prison and that that risked jeopardising his reform, should he remain in that prison. 26. Under section 76(k) of the Execution of Sentences Act (ESA) of 1969, in force at the relevant time, a prisoner who violated prison regulations or disciplinary rules or failed to fulfil his duties could be punished by, inter alia, confinement in an isolation cell for up to fourteen days. During confinement, prisoners could not use the telephone or receive any visits or parcels but were still entitled to one hour’s daily exercise in the open air, separated from the other prisoners (section 76a of the ESA and section 103 of the ESA Implementing Regulation of 1969). 27. Section 46 of the ESA Implementing Regulation of 1969 provided that where a prisoner used defamatory or offensive language in his or her submissions or complaints, he or she was liable to disciplinary and criminal punishment. On 1 June 2009 the ESA of 1969 was superseded by the new Enforcement of Sentences and Detention Orders Act (the “ESDOA”). Pursuant to section 90 (5) of the ESDOA, prisoners shall not be liable to disciplinary punishment because of having made a request or lodged a complaint. 28. In accordance with sections 78 and 78b of the ESA of 1969, an appeal lay to the General Directorate of Enforcement of Sentences or the district court against punishment by confinement in an isolation cell. The former was obliged to examine the case within two months, and the latter within three days. Execution of the punishment was not suspended pending the outcome of the appeal, unless the relevant appeal body decided otherwise. In proceedings before the district court the public was excluded and the absence of the prisoner’s lawyer was not an obstacle to the examination of the case. The court was obliged to examine all circumstances relevant to the lawfulness of the punishment. Its decision was final. 29. Pursuant to the ESA of 1969 and the relevant Implementing Regulation, the General Directorate of Enforcement of Sentences at the Ministry of Justice was responsible for managing and supervising prisons. Its General Director could annul the decisions of prison directors. 30. Under the Judiciary Act of 2007 and the ESA of 1969, the public prosecutor was competent to supervise prisons and the enforcement of sentences. His powers included examining complaints from prisoners, giving mandatory instructions to the prison administration for correcting irregularities, and suspending unlawful acts which were amenable to appeal. 31. Disputes between prisoners and the prison administration concerning the enjoyment of rights such as visiting rights or the rights to receive correspondence or parcels were not amenable to appeal before the court. 32. Section 1 of the 1988 State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (“the SMRDA”), as amended in July 2006, provides as follows: “The State and the municipalities shall be liable for damage caused to individuals and legal persons by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by their organs and officials committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of administrative action.” 33. The relevant extracts from the Recommendation on the European Prison Rules read as follows: “70.1 Prisoners, individually or as a group, shall have ample opportunity to make requests or complaints to the director of the prison or to any other competent authority. 70.2 If mediation seems appropriate this should be tried first. 70.3 If a request is denied or a complaint is rejected, reasons shall be provided to the prisoner and the prisoner shall have the right to appeal to an independent authority. 70.4 Prisoners shall not be punished because of having made a request or lodged a complaint. ... 70.7 Prisoners are entitled to seek legal advice about complaints and appeals procedures and to legal assistance when the interests of justice require.”",['10'],['10-1'],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant is a Turkish citizen who was born in 1957 and lives in Istanbul. 9. At the material time, the applicant was the major shareholder in Deniz Basın Yayın Sanayi ve Ticaret Organizasyon, a Turkish limited liability company which owns a weekly review entitled Haberde Yorumda Gerçek (“The Truth of News and Comments”), published in Istanbul. 10. In issue no. 23 dated 30 August 1992, two readers’ letters, entitled “Silahlar Özgürlüğü Engelleyemez” (“Weapons cannot win against freedom”) and “Suç Bizim” (“It is our fault”), were published. 11. The letters read as follows (translation): (a) “Weapons cannot win against freedom In the face of the escalating war of national liberation in Kurdistan, the fascist Turkish army continues to carry out bombings. The ‘Şırnak massacre’ which Gerçek journalists revealed at the cost of great self-sacrifice has been another concrete example this week. The brutalities in Kurdistan are in fact the worst that have been experienced there in the past few years. The massacre carried out in Halepçe in southern Kurdistan by the reactionary BAAS administration is now taking place in northern Kurdistan. Şırnak is concrete proof of it. By causing provocation in Kurdistan, the Turkish Republic was heading for a massacre. Many people were killed. In a three-day attack with tanks, shells and bombs, Şırnak was razed to the ground. And the bourgeois press, en masse, wrote about the slaughter. And as the bourgeois press has said, there are indeed scores of ‘unanswered’ questions to be asked. As to Şırnak, the attack on Şırnak is the most effective form of the campaign that is being waged throughout Turkey to eradicate the Kurds. Fascism will follow it up with many more Şırnaks. But the struggle of our people for national freedom in Kurdistan has reached a point where it can no longer be thwarted by bloodshed, tanks and shells. Every attack launched by the Turkish Republic to wipe out the Kurds intensifies the struggle for freedom. The bourgeoisie and its toadying press, which draw attention every day to the brutalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, fail to see the brutalities committed in Kurdistan. Of course, one can hardly expect reactionary fascists who call for a halt in the brutalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina to call for a halt in the brutalities in Kurdistan. The Kurdish people, who are being torn from their homes and their fatherland, have nothing to lose. But they have much to gain.” (b) “It is our fault The TC[] murder gang is continuing its murders ... on the grounds of ‘protecting the Republic of Turkey’. But as people wake up to what is happening and become more aware, as they gradually learn to stand up for their rights and the idea that ‘if they won’t give, then we’ll take by force’ gradually germinates in people’s minds and grows stronger day by day – as long as this continues, the murders will obviously also continue ... Beginning of course with those who planted the seed in people’s minds – according to the generals, imperialism’s hired killers, and according to the double-chinned, pot-bellied, stiff-necked Turguts, Süleymans and Bülents ... Hence the events of 12 March, hence the events of 12 September ... Hence the gallows, hence the prisons, hence the people sentenced to 300 or 400 years. Hence the people murdered in the torture rooms ‘in order to protect the Republic of Turkey’. Hence the Mazlum Doğans exterminated in Diyarbakır Prison ... Hence the Revolutionaries recently officially assassinated ... The TC murder gang is continuing – and will continue – to commit its murders. Because the awakening of the people is like a flood of enthusiasm ... Hence Zonguldak, hence the municipal workers, hence the public service employees ... Hence Kurdistan. Can the ‘murder gangs’ stop that flood? There may be some who see the title of this letter and wonder what on earth it has to do with the text. The ‘hired killers’ of imperialism, i.e. the authors of the 12 September coup d’état, and their successors of yesterday and today, those who are still looking for ‘democracy’, who in the past participated in one way or another in the struggle for democracy and freedom, who now covertly or openly criticise their past actions, who confuse the masses and present the parliamentary system and the rule of law as the means of salvation, give the green light to the killings of the TC murder gang. I am addressing the ‘faithful servants’ of imperialism and its hardened spokesman (men), the one(s) who said some time ago ‘You won’t get me to say that the nationalists commit crimes’[], who say(s) today ‘Those are not what we call journalists’, who say(s) ‘Who’s against demonstrations? Who’s against claiming one’s rights? Of course they can hold a march ... They’re my workers, my peasants, my public employees’, but then has (have) the public employees who march to Ankara beaten up in the very heart of the city and say(s) afterwards ‘The police did the right thing’, and who postpone(s) strikes for months on end. I am addressing the blabbers, the deserters and the charlatans who are stirring up the reactionary consciousness of the masses, who try to judge these people by their attitude towards Kurdistan and try to work out how ‘democratic’ they are. The guilt of the murder gang is proven. It is through flesh-and-blood experience that people are beginning to see it and realise it. But what about the guilt of the charlatans, the ones who are thwarting the struggle for democracy and freedom ... Yes, what about their guilt ... They have their share in the killings by the murder gang ... May their ‘union’ be a happy one!” 12. In an indictment dated 21 September 1992, the public prosecutor at the Istanbul National Security Court (İstanbul Devlet Güvenlik Mahkemesi) charged the applicant in his capacity as the owner of the review, as well as the review’s editor, with disseminating propaganda against the indivisibility of the State and provoking enmity and hatred among the people. The charges were brought under Article 312 of the Criminal Code and section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act” – see paragraphs 22 and 24 below). 13. In the proceedings before the Istanbul National Security Court, the applicant denied the charges. He asserted that the expression of an opinion could not constitute an offence. He further stated that the letters in issue had been written by the readers of the review and for that reason could not engage his responsibility. 14. In a judgment dated 12 April 1993, the court found the applicant guilty of an offence under the first paragraph of section 8 of the 1991 Act. It found no grounds for convicting him under Article 312 of the Criminal Code. The court initially sentenced the applicant to a fine of 200,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL). However, having regard to the applicant’s good conduct during the trial, it reduced the fine to TRL 166,666,666. The editor of the review was for his part sentenced to five months’ imprisonment and to a fine of TRL 83,333,333. 15. In its judgment, the court held that the incriminated letters contravened section 8 of the 1991 Act. The court concluded that the letters referred to eight districts in the south-east of Turkey as an independent State, “Kurdistan”, described the PKK (Workers’ party of Kurdistan) as a national liberation movement involved in a “national independence war” against the Turkish State and amounted to propaganda aimed at the destruction of the territorial integrity of the Turkish State. In addition the court found that the letters contained discriminatory statements on grounds of race. 16. The applicant appealed against his conviction to the Court of Cassation, contending that his trial and conviction contravened Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention. He asserted that section 8 of the 1991 Act was contrary to the Constitution and denied that the letters in question disseminated separatist propaganda. He also maintained that he had not been able to be present at the hearing at which the decision on his conviction had been given. He pleaded that the decision given in his absence and without his final statement having been taken was contrary to law. 17. On 26 November 1993 the Court of Cassation ruled that the amount of the fine imposed by the National Security Court was excessive and set aside the applicant’s conviction and sentence on that account. The court remitted the case to the Istanbul National Security Court. 18. In its judgment of 12 April 1994, the Istanbul National Security Court sentenced the applicant to a fine of TRL 100,000,000 but subsequently reduced the fine to TRL 83,333,333. As to the grounds for conviction, the court, inter alia, reiterated the reasoning used in its judgment of 12 April 1993. 19. The applicant appealed. He relied on the defence grounds which he had invoked at his first trial. He also maintained that the National Security Court had convicted him without having duly heard his defence. 20. On 30 September 1994 the Court of Cassation dismissed his appeal, upholding the National Security Court’s reasoning and its assessment of the evidence. 21. Following the amendments made by Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995 to the 1991 Act (see paragraph 25 below), the Istanbul National Security Court ex officio re-examined the applicant’s case. On 8 March 1996 the court confirmed the sentence which it had initially imposed on him. 22. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: “Where the legislative provisions in force at the time when a crime is committed are different from those of a later law, the provisions most favourable to the offender shall be applied.” “The term ‘heavy fine’ shall mean payment to the Treasury of from twenty thousand to one hundred million Turkish liras, as the judge shall decide ...” “In the event of conviction, the court shall order the seizure and confiscation of any object which has been used for the commission or preparation of the crime or offence …” “Harmful propaganda 1. A person who by any means whatsoever spreads propaganda with a view to establishing the domination of one social class over the others, annihilating a social class, overturning the fundamental social or economic order established in Turkey or the political or legal order of the State shall, on conviction, be liable to a term of imprisonment of from five to ten years. 2. A person who by any means whatsoever spreads propaganda in favour of the State’s being governed by a single person or social group to the detriment of the underlying principles of the Republic and democracy shall, on conviction, be liable to a term of imprisonment of from five to ten years. 3. A person who, prompted by racial considerations, by any means whatsoever spreads propaganda aimed at abolishing in whole or in part public-law rights guaranteed by the Constitution or undermining or destroying patriotic sentiment shall, on conviction, be liable to a term of imprisonment of from five to ten years. …” “Public incitement to commit an offence … Where incitement to commit an offence is done by means of mass communication, of whatever type – whether by tape recordings, gramophone records, newspapers, press publications or other published material – by the circulation or distribution of printed papers or by the placing of placards or posters in public places, the terms of imprisonment to which convicted persons are liable shall be doubled …” “Non-public incitement to commit an offence A person who expressly praises or condones an act punishable by law as an offence or incites the population to break the law shall, on conviction, be liable to between six months’ and two years’ imprisonment and a heavy fine of from six thousand to thirty thousand Turkish liras. A person who incites the people to hatred or hostility on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races, religions, denominations or regions, shall, on conviction, be liable to between one and three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from nine thousand to thirty-six thousand liras. If this incitement endangers public safety, the sentence shall be increased by one-third to one-half. The penalties to be imposed on those who have committed the offences defined in the previous paragraph shall be doubled when they have done so by the means listed in Article 311 § 2.” 23. The relevant provisions of the Press Act 1950 read as follows: “For the purposes of the present Law, the term ‘periodicals’ shall mean newspapers, press agency dispatches and any other printed matter published at regular intervals. ‘Publication’ shall mean the exposure, display, distribution, emission, sale or offer for sale of printed matter on premises to which the public have access where anyone may see it. An offence shall not be deemed to have been committed through the medium of the press unless publication has taken place, except where the material in itself is unlawful.” “Where distribution of the printed matter whose distribution constitutes the offence is prevented … by a court injunction or, in an emergency, by order of the Principal Public Prosecutor … the penalty imposed shall be reduced to one-third of that laid down by law for the offence concerned.” 24. The relevant provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 read as follows: “It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to announce, orally or in the form of a publication, that terrorist organisations will commit an offence against a specific person, whether or not that person’s ... identity is divulged provided that it is done in such a manner that he or she may be identified, or to reveal the identity of civil servants who have participated in anti-terrorist operations or to designate any person as a target. It shall be an offence, punishable by a fine of from five million to ten million Turkish liras, to print or publish declarations or leaflets emanating from terrorist organisations. … Where the offences contemplated in the above paragraphs are committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the sales of the previous issue if the periodical appears monthly or less frequently, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched[]. However, the fine may not be less than fifty million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher.” “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited, irrespective of the methods used and the intention. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than two and not more than five years’ imprisonment and a fine of from fifty million to one hundred million Turkish liras. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the above paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly, or from the average sales for the previous month of the daily newspaper with the largest circulation if the offence involves printed matter other than periodicals or if the periodical has just been launched[2]. However the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment.” “Written and spoken propaganda, meetings, assemblies and demonstrations aimed at undermining the territorial integrity of the Republic of Turkey or the indivisible unity of the nation are prohibited. Any person who engages in such an activity shall be sentenced to not less than one and not more than three years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras. The penalty imposed on a reoffender may not be commuted to a fine. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of periodicals within the meaning of section 3 of the Press Act (Law no. 5680), the publisher shall also be liable to a fine equal to ninety per cent of the income from the average sales for the previous month if the periodical appears more frequently than monthly. However, the fine may not be less than one hundred million Turkish liras. The editor of the periodical concerned shall be ordered to pay a sum equal to half the fine imposed on the publisher and sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment. Where the crime of propaganda contemplated in the first paragraph is committed through the medium of printed matter or by means of mass communication other than periodicals within the meaning of the second paragraph, those responsible and the owners of the means of mass communication shall be sentenced to not less than six months’ and not more than two years’ imprisonment and a fine of from one hundred million to three hundred million Turkish liras … …” “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve.” “The penalties for the offences contemplated in the present Law may not be commuted to a fine or any other measure, nor may they be accompanied by a reprieve. However, the provisions of this section shall not apply to convictions pursuant to section 8[].” “Persons convicted of the offences contemplated in the present Law who ... have been punished with a custodial sentence shall be granted automatic parole when they have served three-quarters of their sentence, provided they have been of good conduct. … The first and second paragraphs of section 19[] … of the Execution of Sentence Act (Law no. 647) shall not apply to the convicted persons mentioned above.” 25. The following amendments were made to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1991 following the enactment of Law no. 4126 of 27 October 1995: “In the month following the entry into force of the present Law, the court which has given judgment shall re-examine the case of a person convicted pursuant to section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) and, in accordance with the amendment ... to section 8 of Law no. 3713, shall reconsider the term of imprisonment imposed on that person and decide whether he should be allowed the benefit of sections 4[] and 6[] of Law no. 647 of 13 July 1965.” 26. The following provisions are relevant to sentences in respect of offences under the Press Act: “The execution of sentences passed on those who were convicted under the Press Act (Law no. 5680) or other laws as editors for offences committed before 12 July 1997 shall be deferred. The provision in the first paragraph shall also apply to editors who are already serving their sentences. The institution of criminal proceedings or delivery of final judgments shall be deferred where proceedings against the editor have not yet been brought, or where a preliminary investigation has been commenced but criminal proceedings have not been instituted, or where the final judicial investigation has been commenced but judgment has not yet been delivered, or where the judgment has still not become final.” “If an editor who has benefited under the provisions of the first paragraph of section 1 is convicted as an editor for committing an intentional offence within three years of the date of deferment, he must serve the entirety of the suspended sentence. … Where there has been a deferment, criminal proceedings shall be instituted or judgment delivered if an editor is convicted as such for committing an intentional offence within three years of the date of deferment. Any conviction as an editor for an offence committed before 12 July 1997 shall be deemed a nullity if the aforesaid period of three years expires without any further conviction for an intentional offence. Similarly, if no criminal proceedings have been instituted, it shall no longer be possible to bring any, and, if any have been instituted, they shall be discontinued.” 27. The Execution of Sentences Act 1965 provides, inter alia: “The term ‘fine’ shall mean payment to the Treasury of a sum fixed within the statutory limits. … If, after service of the order to pay, the convicted person does not pay the fine within the time-limit, he shall be committed to prison for a term of one day for every ten thousand Turkish liras owed, by a decision of the public prosecutor. … The sentence of imprisonment thus substituted for the fine may not exceed three years …” “… persons who ... have been ordered to serve a custodial sentence shall be granted automatic parole when they have served half of their sentence, provided they have been of good conduct ...” 28. The Code of Criminal Procedure contains the following provisions: “An appeal on points of law may not concern any issue other than the lawfulness of the impugned judgment. Non-application or erroneous application of a legal rule shall constitute unlawfulness[].” “Unlawfulness is deemed to be manifest in the following cases: 1- where the court is not established in accordance with the law; 2- where one of the judges who have taken the decision was barred by statute from participating; …” 29. The Government supplied copies of several decisions given by the prosecutor attached to the Ankara National Security Court withdrawing charges against persons suspected of inciting people to hatred or hostility, especially on religious grounds (Article 312 of the Criminal Code), or of disseminating separatist propaganda against the indivisible unity of the State (section 8 of Law no. 3713 – see paragraph 24 above). In the majority of cases where offences had been committed by means of publications the reasons given for the prosecutor’s decision included such considerations as the fact that the proceedings were time-barred, that some of the constituent elements of the offence could not be made out or that there was insufficient evidence. Other grounds included the fact that the publications in issue had not been distributed, that there had been no unlawful intent, that no offence had been committed or that those responsible could not be identified. 30. Furthermore, the Government submitted a number of decisions of the National Security Courts as examples of cases in which defendants accused of the above-mentioned offences had been found not guilty. These were the following judgments: 1991/23–75–132–177–100; 1992/33–62–73–89–143; 1993/29–30–38–39–82–94–114; 1994/3–6–12–14–68–108–131–141–155–171–172; 1995/1–25–29–37–48–64–67–84–88–92–96–101–120–124–134–135; 1996/2–8–18–21–34–38–42–43–49–54–73–86–91–103–119–353; 1997/11–19–32–33–82–89–113–118–130–140–148–152–153–154–187–191–200–606; 1998/6–8–50–51–56–85–162. 31. As regards more particularly proceedings against authors of works dealing with the Kurdish problem, the National Security Courts in these cases reached their decisions on the ground that there had been no dissemination of “propaganda”, one of the constituent elements of the offence, or on account of the objective nature of the words used. 32. The constitutional provisions governing judicial organisation of the National Security Courts are worded as follows: “In the performance of their duties, judges shall be independent; they shall give judgment, according to their personal conviction, in accordance with the Constitution, statute and the law. No organ, authority, ... or ... person may give orders or instructions to courts or judges in the exercise of their judicial powers, or send them circulars or make recommendations or suggestions to them.” “Judges … shall not be removed from office or compelled to retire without their consent before the age prescribed by the Constitution …” “National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members, two substitute members, a prosecutor and a sufficient number of assistant prosecutors. The president, one of the regular members, one of the substitutes and the prosecutor shall be appointed from among judges and public prosecutors of the first rank, according to procedures laid down in special legislation; one regular member and one substitute shall be appointed from among military judges of the first rank and the assistant prosecutors from among public prosecutors and military judges. Presidents, regular members and substitute members ... of National Security Courts shall be appointed for a renewable period of four years. Appeals against decisions of National Security Courts shall lie to the Court of Cassation. ...” “Military legal proceedings The personal rights and obligations of military judges … shall be regulated by law in accordance with the principles of the independence of the courts, the safeguards enjoyed by the judiciary and the requirements of military service. Relations between military judges and the commanders under whom they serve in the performance of their non-judicial duties shall also be regulated by law ...” 33. Based on Article 143 of the Constitution, the relevant provisions of Law no. 2845 on the National Security Courts, provide as follows: “In the capitals of the provinces of … National Security Courts shall be established to try offences against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the territorial integrity of the State or the indivisible unity of the nation or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security.” “The National Security Courts shall be composed of a president, two other regular members and two substitute members.” “The president of a National Security Court, one of the [two] regular members and one of the [two] substitutes ... shall be civilian … judges, the other members, whether regular or substitute, military judges of the first rank …” “The appointment of military judges to sit as regular members and substitutes shall be carried out according to the procedure laid down for that purpose in the Military Legal Service Act. Except as provided in the present Law or other legislation, the president and the regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts … may not be appointed to another post or place, without their consent, within four years … … If, after an investigation concerning the president or a regular or substitute member of a National Security Court conducted according to the legislation concerning them, competent committees or authorities decide to change the duty station of the person concerned, the duty station of that judge or the duties themselves … may be changed in accordance with the procedure laid down in that legislation.” “National Security Courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons charged with (a) the offences contemplated in Article 312 § 2 … of the Turkish Criminal Code, … (d) offences having a connection with the events which made it necessary to declare a state of emergency, in regions where a state of emergency has been declared in accordance with Article 120 of the Constitution, (e) offences committed against the Republic, whose constituent qualities are enunciated in the Constitution, against the indivisible unity of the State – meaning both the national territory and its people – or against the free democratic system of government, and offences which directly affect the State’s internal or external security. …” “The Court of Cassation shall hear appeals against the judgments of the National Security Courts.” “The rules governing the rights and obligations of … military judges appointed to the National Security Courts and their supervision …, the institution of disciplinary proceedings against them, the imposition of disciplinary penalties on them and the investigation and prosecution of any offences they may commit in the performance of their duties ... shall be as laid down in the relevant provisions of the laws governing their profession … The observations of the Court of Cassation on military judges, the assessment reports on them drawn up by Ministry of Justice assessors … and the files on any investigations conducted in respect of them … shall be transmitted to the Ministry of Justice.” “A National Security Court may be transformed into a Martial-Law Court, under the conditions set forth below, where a state of emergency has been declared in all or part of the territory in respect of which the National Security Court concerned has jurisdiction, provided that within that territory there is more than one National Security Court …” 34. The relevant provisions of the Military Legal Service Act are worded as follows: “The aptitude of military judges … appointed as regular or substitute members of the National Security Courts that is required for promotion or advancement in salary step, rank or seniority shall be determined on the basis of assessment reports drawn up according to the procedure laid down below, subject to the provisions of the present Law and the Turkish Armed Forces Personnel Act (Law no. 926). (a) The first superior competent to carry out assessment and draw up assessment reports for military judges, whether regular or substitute members … shall be the Minister of State in the Ministry of Defence, followed by the Minister of Defence. …” “Members … of the National Security Courts belonging to the Military Legal Service … shall be appointed by a committee composed of the personnel director and the legal adviser of the General Staff, the personnel director and the legal adviser attached to the staff of the arm in which the person concerned is serving and the Director of Military Judicial Affairs at the Ministry of Defence …” “Military judges … shall be appointed by a decree issued jointly by the Minister of Defence and the Prime Minister and submitted to the President of the Republic for approval, in accordance with the provisions on the appointment and transfer of members of the armed forces … … The procedure for appointment as a military judge shall take into account the opinion of the Court of Cassation, the reports by Ministry of Justice assessors and the assessment reports drawn up by the superiors …” “The rules governing the salary scales, salary increases and various personal rights of military judges … shall be as laid down in the provisions relating to officers.” “The Minister of Defence may apply to military judges, after considering their defence submissions, the following disciplinary sanctions: A. A warning, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that he must exercise more care in the performance of his duties. … B. A reprimand, which consists in giving the person concerned notice in writing that a particular act or a particular attitude has been found to be blameworthy. … The said sanctions shall be final, mentioned in the assessment record of the person concerned and entered in his personal file …” “When military judges … sit in court they shall wear the special dress of their civilian counterparts …” 35. Article 112 of the Military Criminal Code of 22 May 1930 provides: “It shall be an offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment, to abuse one’s authority as a civil servant in order to influence the military courts.” 36. Under section 22 of Law 1602 the First Division of the Supreme Military Administrative Court has jurisdiction to hear applications for judicial review and claims for damages based on disputes relating to the personal status of officers, particularly those concerning their professional advancement.",['6'],['6-1'],[],['10'],[],[],1

HUNGARY,1,Preliminary objection dismissed (Article 35-1 - Effective domestic remedy);Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 6+6-3-c - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Public hearing;Article 6-3-c - Defence in person) (Article 6-3-c - Defence in person;Article 6 - Right to a fair trial),,"5. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Budapest. 6. On 18 March 2003 the Eger District Public Prosecutor’s Office indicted the applicant and two other individuals for aggravated extortion. The applicant was assisted by defence counsel of his choice. After hearings held on 16 June and 8 October, on 13 October 2003 the District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to 3½ years’ imprisonment. The court relied on evidence given by the victim and several witnesses. 7. The prosecution appealed to have the sentence increased, while the applicant appealed to be acquitted or to have his sentence reduced. He also proposed that two further witnesses be heard. 8. At deliberations held in camera on 20 February 2004, the Heves County Regional Court upheld the applicant’s conviction, while increasing his sentence to 4 years’ imprisonment. Neither the applicant nor his lawyer was present. In its reasoning, the court did not deal with the proposal to hear two more witnesses. “(1) In the Republic of Hungary, everyone is equal before the law, and has the right to have any criminal charge against him or his civil rights and obligations determined in a fair and public trial by an independent and impartial court established by law. ... (3) Individuals subject to criminal proceedings are entitled to the right of defence at all stages of the proceedings. ...” “(3) The Constitutional Court shall order the review of such criminal proceedings as have been finally concluded under unconstitutional legal provisions if the convicted person has not yet been exempted from the legal effects of the conviction – provided that from the nullity of the provision applied in the procedure, the reduction or non-imposition of the punishment or measure, or the exemption from or reduction of [criminal] liability would follow.” “(1) Any person who claims to have suffered a violation of his rights enshrined in the Constitution on account of the application of an unconstitutional provision and has exhausted all other legal remedies or there are no such remedies available, may submit a constitutional complaint to the Constitutional Court. (2) A constitutional complaint may be filed in writing within 60 days of the service of the legally binding decision.” “(3) An appeal may concern questions of fact or law.” “(2) In order to eliminate the ill-foundedness of the first-instance judgment, evidence may be taken if the findings of fact have not been established or are deficient. Evidence shall be taken ... at a hearing.” “(1) Within 30 days of receiving the file, the president of the panel in charge shall schedule, in order to deal with an appeal, deliberations in camera (tanácsülés), a public session (nyilvános ülés) or a hearing (tárgyalás). ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall hold a public session, if – the first-instance judgment being ill-founded – the complete and/or correct findings of fact may be established from the contents of the file or through drawing factual conclusions, or if the defendant must be heard in order to clarify the circumstances relevant for imposing the sentence. (2) The second-instance court shall summon to the public session those persons whose hearing it deems necessary ...” “(1) The second-instance court shall notify the public prosecutor and – if they are not summoned – ... the defendant and his lawyer of the public session. ...” “(2) In order to take evidence, a hearing ... shall be scheduled.” “(1) Review proceedings may be instituted against a final decision on the merits if: ... e) the Constitutional Court has ordered (elrendelte) the review of criminal proceedings concluded by a final judgment, provided that the defendant has not yet been exempted from the legal consequences flowing from his conviction, or the execution of the imposed punishment ... has not yet been terminated ... or its enforceability has not yet ceased; f) the determination of criminal liability or the imposition of a sanction ... has been effected in application of a criminal law provision, whose unconstitutionality has already been established by the Constitutional Court, but the defendant has already been exempted from the legal consequences flowing from his conviction, or the execution of the punishment has already been terminated or its enforceability has ceased ...” “(1) The Constitutional Court finds that section 360(1) of Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure is unconstitutional and therefore annuls it as of the date of delivery of this decision. ... (3) The Constitutional Court finds that Parliament has committed an unconstitutional omission by failing to regulate, in Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure and in accordance with the requirements of legal certainty and fair trial, the scope of those cases in which the appellate court may hold in camera deliberations. The Constitutional Court invites Parliament to comply with its legislative duties by 31 October 2005. (4) The Constitutional Court holds that section 360(1) of Act no. XIX of 1998 on the Code of Criminal Procedure was unconstitutional and therefore this provision cannot be applied in the following cases, concluded by a final judgment (jogerősen befejezett ügyeiben nem alkalmazható): ... nos.

The applicant was born in 1925 in Bucharest and lives in Le Cannet (France). 5. In 1952, under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation, the State took possession of a building located at 16 Negustori Street in Bucharest which belonged to the applicant's parents, Romanian citizens and members of the Jewish faith. 6. On 18 September 1998 the applicant lodged an action to recover possession of the property with the Bucharest District Court. The action was directed against Bucharest local council, the Rental Property Administration Department (Departamentul de administrare a fondului locativ) and the State company Titan, which managed such properties. He alleged that, under Decree no. 92/1950, property belonging to certain social categories had been exempt from nationalisation and that his parents had belonged to one such category. 7. In a judgment of 24 June 1999 the court allowed the action on the ground that the State had taken possession of the property without any valid title. It ordered the defendants to restore the building and the adjoining land to the applicant. 8. Following an appeal by the Bucharest mayor's office acting on behalf of the local council, the Bucharest County Court upheld the decision of the first-instance court in a judgment of 6 December 1999. 9. The mayor's office lodged a further appeal with the Bucharest Court of Appeal, which in a final judgment of 21 June 2000 declared the appeal inadmissible for failure to give reasons. 10. In a decision of 25 September 2000 the mayor of Bucharest ordered the return of the building to the applicant. 11. On 9 November 2000 the applicant, accompanied by a bailiff, went to the building with a view to taking possession and found that it was occupied by the United States Peace Corps under a lease concluded with the State company Locato, which managed the buildings placed at the disposal of diplomatic missions in Romania. 12. On 14 November 2001 the applicant brought an action against Locato and the United States Peace Corps seeking the setting-aside of the lease and an order requiring the Peace Corps to vacate the building. 13. In a judgment of 30 May 2001 the Bucharest District Court dismissed the action. It observed that in 1992, by a government decision, ownership of the building had been transferred from the Bucharest mayor's office to the company managing the buildings used by diplomatic missions in Romania. That company had been letting the building to the United States Peace Corps since 1993. The latest lease, which had been concluded on 12 January 1999 and set the rent at 4,907 United States dollars (USD) per month, was due to expire on 31 March 2002. Taking the view that Locato had proper authority to manage the building, the court held that the disputed lease was valid. 14. In a judgment of 5 November 2001 the Bucharest County Court, on an appeal by Mr Hirschhorn, set aside the impugned decision and allowed the applicant's action. The County Court observed that in its final judgment of 24 June 1999 the Bucharest District Court had held that the State had appropriated the building without any valid title. Taking the view that the State could not dispose of a property which did not belong to it, the court set aside the lease and ordered the eviction of the tenant organisation. Locato appealed on points of law. 15. On 21 December 2001 the bailiff was authorised by the Bucharest District Court to evict the tenant organisation under the decision of 5 November 2001. On 31 January 2002 he directed Locato to comply with the decision. 16. In a letter of 6 February 2002 Locato informed the bailiff that the building was the property of the State and that the tenant organisation had diplomatic immunity. That being so, it considered that enforcing the eviction order would be inappropriate and liable to damage Romania's image internationally. 17. On 11 and 20 February 2002 the bailiff went to the building but was refused entry by a representative of the United States Peace Corps on the ground that the Peace Corps was a United States governmental organisation which had diplomatic immunity and could not therefore be evicted. 18. On 25 February 2002 the bailiff wrote to the President of the Bucharest Court of Appeal informing him of the difficulties encountered in enforcing the judgment of 24 June 1999 and the decision of the mayor of Bucharest, as Locato and the United States Peace Corps were invoking diplomatic immunity. The letter included the following passage: “Given the applicability of certain international law conventions in situations such as this, we would be grateful if you could consider the possibility – and inform us accordingly – of taking specific enforcement measures, in view of the fact that the writ of execution is supposed to take effect and that the appeal by Locato against the Bucharest County Court judgment of 5 November 2001 is pending before your court and has been set down for hearing on 26 February 2002.” 19. On 4 March 2002 the President of the Bucharest Court of Appeal replied to the bailiff's letter and informed him that his concerns had been looked into by an inspecting judge, whose report he forwarded to the bailiff. The report indicated that under the Vienna Convention of 18 April 1961 the property of diplomatic missions was inviolable. As the immunity from jurisdiction extended to enforcement procedures, the inspecting judge concluded that the applicant could not regain possession of his building, and asked the bailiff to advise him to apply for compensation corresponding to the value of the building on the ground that it was not possible to have the judgment of 24 June 1999 enforced. 20. Meanwhile, on 20 February 2002, the applicant, who lives in France, sent a fax to the registry of the Court of Appeal stating that he was dispensing with the services of his lawyer and requesting an adjournment of the hearing scheduled for 26 February so that he could instruct a replacement. 21. At the hearing of 26 February the Court of Appeal refused the request for an adjournment, taking the view that the applicant had had sufficient time to appoint a new lawyer. However, it adjourned delivery of the judgment, first until 5 March and then until 12 March 2002, in order to allow the applicant to submit conclusions in writing. 22. In a final judgment of 12 March 2002 the Civil Division of the Bucharest Court of Appeal, sitting as a bench of three judges, allowed Locato's appeal on points of law and dismissed the applicant's action. It confirmed the validity of the lease, finding that it had been entered into in good faith since, although the company had not in fact been the owner of the building in question at the time of signature of the lease, it had appeared to be. 23. On 21 March 2002 the Bucharest District Court rejected a complaint by the applicant against the bailiff alleging that the latter had failed to take action to enforce the judgment of 24 June 1999. The court observed that the bailiff had gone to the building but had been informed that the United States Peace Corps enjoyed immunity from jurisdiction. Accordingly, the court held that the bailiff could not be said to have failed to enforce the judgment in question. 24. On 9 August 2001, on the basis of Law no. 10/2001 on the rules governing immovable property wrongfully nationalised by the State between 6 March 1945 and 22 December 1989 (“Law no. 10/2001”), the applicant requested that Locato return the property to him. His request was rejected by a decision of 9 October 2001. 25. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Bucharest County Court and requested that Locato be evicted from the building. He argued that the building belonged to him by virtue of the judgment of 24 June 1999. 26. In a judgment of 13 May 2002 the County Court allowed the claim for restitution of the building but rejected the eviction request on the ground that the Peace Corps was not a party to the proceedings. Locato appealed on points of law. 27. By a governmental decision (no. 533) of 30 May 2002, Locato became the State Diplomatic Property Management Agency (Regia autonoma Administratia patrimoniului protocolului de Stat – “the Agency”). The applicant's property continued to appear in the lists attached to that decision as State property managed by the Agency. 28. By judgment of 31 March 2004 the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicant's claim on the ground that Mr Hirschhorn had not adduced evidence either that title to the building had passed to him as his parents' heir or that he had failed to be compensated contrary to the agreement concluded in 1959 between France and Romania concerning property formerly owned by French citizens and nationalised by the Romanian State. 29. An appeal on points of law by the applicant is currently pending before the High Court of Cassation and Justice. 30. In an action to recover possession lodged with the Bucharest County Court on 15 August 2002, the applicant requested that the Agency return the building, that the lease concluded with the Peace Corps be set aside and the latter evicted, and that the rent received by the Agency under the lease be paid to him. 31. By judgment of 17 February 2003 the County Court declared the action inadmissible on the ground that the applicant could not lodge an ordinary action to recover possession while the action based on Law no. 10/2001 was still pending. 32. The applicant appealed to the Bucharest Court of Appeal, which upheld the judgment on 29 October 2003. The applicant then lodged an appeal on points of law with the High Court of Cassation and Justice. The latter, in a judgment of 7 July 2005, allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the Bucharest Court of Appeal. The proceedings are still pending. 33. The Agency was reorganised by Government Decision no. 60 of 21 January 2005. The applicant's building is still on the list of State-owned properties managed by the Agency. 34. Although the lease concluded with the United States Peace Corps expired on 31 March 2002, that organisation continues to occupy the building. The Government have not provided any details as to the legal basis for the occupancy. 35. The documents supplied by the applicant show that he has paid all the taxes and duties due on the building. However, in 2004 and 2005 the Agency also paid taxes and duties into the local budget in respect of the building. 36. Under the Administration of Justice Act (Law no. 92/1992) in force at the material time, the president of the court of appeal performed mainly administrative, organisational and supervisory duties. The relevant provisions of the Act read as follows: “The president [of the court of appeal] and, where appropriate, the presidents of the divisions [of that court] shall decide on the composition of the benches...” “Where the president, the vice-president or the division president is a member of the bench, he or she shall preside. In all other cases the president or division president shall appoint the presiding judge of the bench.” “The Minister of Justice shall be responsible for the proper organisation and operation of the justice system as a public service. The inspecting judges of the courts of appeal shall keep the Minister of Justice informed of the functioning of the courts and of any irregularities liable to compromise the standard of judicial activity and the application of the laws and regulations coming within the jurisdiction of the courts of appeal. The presidents and vice-presidents of the courts shall monitor the organisation and quality of the service and compliance with the laws and regulations... The presidents of the courts of appeal may exercise this prerogative through the intermediary of the inspecting judges of the court of appeal. In no circumstances may the monitoring activities entail interference in the conduct of proceedings in progress or call into question a decision already given...” “Promotion for judges shall be on the basis of merit, as attested by the appraisals carried out by their superiors. Appraisals shall be conducted annually and shall reflect the performance of the persons concerned, their conduct in the workplace and in society, their professional qualities and their career prospects.” “Judges shall be prohibited from providing advice, orally or in writing, concerning ongoing cases, even if the case in question is being heard by a court other than the one in which they sit. They may not express opinions in public concerning ongoing cases.” “Judges' disciplinary liability shall be incurred in the event of irregularities in the performance of their duties or conduct liable to damage the interests of the service or the reputation of the justice system.” “Disciplinary proceedings ... shall be initiated by the Minister of Justice...” “In order to initiate disciplinary proceedings..., a preliminary investigation ordered by the Minister of Justice shall be compulsory. The investigation shall be carried out either by judges of at least the same ranking as the judge under investigation, by general inspectors or by other Ministry officials assimilated to judges.” “On receiving the findings of the investigation, the Minister may refer the matter to the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. The Supreme Council shall give a decision accompanied by a statement of reasons...” 37. The position of inspecting judge at the court of appeal was abolished by Law no. 247 of 19 July 2005. However, the possibility for the president or vice-presidents of the court of appeal to appoint judges to carry out inspections was maintained. Nevertheless, these inspections must respect judges' independence and comply with final court decisions. 38. Article 66 of Law no. 92/1992 was repealed by the Status of Judges Act (Law no. 303/2004), which stipulates that judges' performance shall be assessed every three years by a committee under the authority of the Supreme Council of the Judiciary. 39. The method for designating the judges to sit on the benches of the courts of appeal was amended by the Administration of Justice Act (Law no. 304/2004), which states that the composition of the benches shall be decided by a panel within each court of appeal, made up of the president and six members elected by the general assembly of judges. 40. Under Law no. 317/2004 on the Supreme Council of the Judiciary, disciplinary proceedings are a matter exclusively for a disciplinary committee within the Supreme Council, to which any interested party may apply. 41. The relevant international provisions are as follows: “For the purpose of the present Convention, the following expressions shall have the meanings hereunder assigned to them: ... (i) The 'premises of the mission' are the buildings or parts of buildings and the land ancillary thereto, irrespective of ownership, used for the purposes of the mission including the residence of the head of the mission.” “1.The functions of a diplomatic mission consist, inter alia, in: (a) Representing the sending State in the receiving State; (b) Protecting in the receiving State the interests of the sending State and of its nationals, within the limits permitted by international law; (c) Negotiating with the Government of the receiving State; (d) Ascertaining by all lawful means conditions and developments in the receiving State, and reporting thereon to the Government of the sending State; (e) Promoting friendly relations between the sending State and the receiving State, and developing their economic, cultural and scientific relations. ...” “1.

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Athens. 11. In the evening of 13 September 1995 the police tried to stop the applicant, who had driven through a red traffic light in the centre of Athens, near the American embassy. Instead of stopping, the applicant accelerated. He was chased by several police officers in cars and on motorcycles. During the pursuit, the applicant’s car collided with several other vehicles. Two drivers were injured. After the applicant had broken through five police roadblocks, the police officers started firing at his car. The applicant alleged that the police were firing at the car’s cab, whereas the Government maintained that they were aiming at the tyres. 12. Eventually, the applicant stopped at a petrol station, but did not get out. The police officers continued firing. The applicant alleged that the policemen knelt down and fired at him, whereas the Government maintained that they were firing in the air, in particular because there were petrol pumps in danger of exploding. One of the police officers threw a pot at the windscreen. Finally, the applicant was arrested by a police officer who managed to break into the car. The applicant claimed that he was shot on the sole of his foot while being dragged out of his car. The Government contested that claim, referring to the findings of the domestic court (see paragraph 19 below). The applicant was immediately driven to hospital, where he remained for nine days. He was injured on the right arm, the right foot, the left buttock and the right side of the chest. One bullet was removed from his foot and another one is still inside his buttock. The applicant’s mental health, which had broken down in the past, has deteriorated considerably since the incident. 13. Following the incident, an administrative investigation was carried out by the police. Twenty-nine of the police officers who had taken part in the chase were identified. There were also other policemen who had participated in the incident of their own accord and who had left the scene without identifying themselves and without handing in their weapons. In total, thirty-five sworn witness statements were taken. Laboratory tests were conducted in order to examine thirty-three police firearms, three bullets and four metal fragments. The applicant’s car was also examined. 14. On 12 January 1996 the police laboratory issued a report which contained the following findings: “... The car that has been examined is severely damaged due to collisions/crashes, but also to bullets ... At the front, there is damage to the car’s windscreen, where there are three holes and a mark ... Bullets, directed from the inside of the car outwards, caused the three holes as well as the mark. From the general damage to the car (the rear window is broken and has collapsed), the location of the examined damage and the course (direction) of the bullets that caused it, it may be assumed that the bullets in question broke through the rear window and ended up hitting the windscreen, producing the holes and the mark. ... The rear window is broken and has collapsed. Because of its total destruction, it is not possible to determine exactly why it broke. From the rest of the findings (the damage to the windscreen, etc.) it may be assumed that bullets were responsible ... The trajectory of the bullets that caused the holes is from the rear of the car towards the front ... The shape and size of the holes suggest that the bullets were fired by a 9 mm calibre firearm. ... On the driver’s side of the car, there is a mark on the rear wing, near the wheel; its dimensions are approximately 55 x 25 mm. From the shape of the mark it may be assumed that the bullet that caused it came from the rear of the car towards the front, with an upward trajectory. On the right-hand side of the car, the window of the front passenger’s door is broken. There is a bump on the roof of the car, and a corresponding hole in the upholstery inside. This has been caused by a bullet that travelled upwards from the rear of the car towards the front. It may be assumed that the bullet entered the car through the rear window ...” “In total, twenty-three revolvers, six pistols, four submachine guns and three bullets were sent to us ... Twenty-three of the weapons are revolvers of .357 Magnum calibre; six are pistols, five of which are of 9 mm Parabellum calibre and one of .45 ACP calibre; and four are HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. The serial numbers of the weapons, their make and the names of the police officers to whom they belong are indicated in the above-mentioned document as well as in the delivery and confiscation reports of 14 and 16 September 1995 of the Paleo Faliro police station, copies of which are attached to this report. We performed the same number of trial shots with the twenty-three weapons, using three cartridges in each case. All the weapons functioned properly. The spent cartridges and bullets for each weapon were put into plastic envelopes for identification purposes, and each envelope was marked with the distinctive characteristics of the weapon. ... Two of the three bullets were found in the car and the third was surgically removed from the first metatarsal of the injured driver’s right foot. For identification purposes, the bullets were marked ‘PB1/4722’ (for the bullet from the injured person’s body) and ‘PB2 and PB3/4722’ (for the bullets found in the car). They will be regarded as evidence ... The heads and cylindrical surfaces of all three bullets are more or less deformed as a result of hitting hard surfaces, and have broken sabots and parts missing. The average diameter of the bullet bases is 9 mm. From the measurements and their characteristics it is surmised that the bullets come from 9 mm Parabellum cartridges (9 x 19). These kinds of cartridges are fired mainly by pistols and submachine guns of the same calibre ...” “... Sixteen holes were found on the car, caused by the direct impact of the same number of bullets. It is assumed that the bullets that caused the holes were fired by 9 mm calibre weapons. Inside the car, there are holes due to secondary impact and ricochets from some of the above bullets. ... The exhibit bullet ‘PB2’ and the bullets the metal sabots ‘PP1’ and ‘PP2’ come from were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun no. C273917. ... The exhibit the metal sabot ‘PP3’ comes from was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038275. ... The exhibit bullet ‘PB1’ that was removed from the injured driver’s body and the bullet ‘PB3’ that was found in the car have a 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre and were fired by the same weapon of the same calibre. Despite being deformed, the two bullets exhibit sufficient and reliable traces from the inner part of the weapon barrel from which they were fired; comparison of these traces has led to the conclusion that they are identical. Comparative tests of the traces on these two bullets and those on the sample bullets fired with the examined 9 mm calibre weapons (see above) have not disclosed any similarities, which leads to the conclusion that the bullets in question were not fired by any of these weapons ...” 15. Following the administrative investigation, the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against seven police officers (Mr Manoliadis, Mr Netis, Mr Markou, Mr Souliotis, Mr Mahairas, Mr Ntinas and Mr Kiriazis) for causing serious bodily harm (Articles 308 § 1 (a) and 309 of the Criminal Code) and unauthorised use of weapons (section 14 of Law no. 2168/1993). At a later stage, the applicant joined the proceedings as a civil party claiming a specific amount by way of damages. 16. The trial of the seven police officers took place on 5 December 1997 before the Athens First-Instance Criminal Court. The applicant’s statement was taken down as follows: “I was on Dinokratous Street. I turned right at the traffic lights, and saw two police officers in front of me on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I was driving at a high speed and I couldn’t stop immediately. I moved a little to the left, and they immediately started firing at me. I was afraid, I thought they wanted to kill me, so I accelerated and drove off. They chased me and fired constantly. I moved into the oncoming lane and hit some cars. I was very scared. I had recently been in hospital for depression. I stopped at a petrol station and, while I was taking off my seat belt, I opened the door a little and they injured my arm and chest. They pulled me out of the car; a police officer injured me again, on the leg, and put handcuffs on me. I heard banging noises on the car, but I don’t know what they were. There were gunshots coming from everywhere, also from above. I don’t know exactly who injured me. I didn’t have a weapon. I never carry a weapon. They took me to the General State Hospital. A chief officer of police came and brought me a document to sign, but I didn’t sign it because I didn’t know what they had written in it. This happened at the same place where they took 3.5 litres of blood from me. They removed the bullet from my leg without anaesthetic. It was very painful; I don’t know why they did this. I had internal bleeding and the doctors said it was from my teeth. My father obtained a paper from the public prosecutor so that he could take me from the General State Hospital to the KAT (centre for rehabilitation following injury). A bullet has remained in my lung and the other bullet has caused an internal wound below my waist. The first gunshot was on Vassilissis Sofias Street. Perhaps they were looking for something; perhaps they thought I was someone else. I drove towards Sintagma. They fired at me during the entire chase. When they pulled me out of the car, they made me lie on the ground, shot at me and then put handcuffs on me. It was then that they shot me in the foot. After the incident I suffered from psychological shock and was admitted to the State Hospital. I am still receiving medical attention from [another hospital] and I take medication. Before the incident I worked as a plasterer. Since then I haven’t been able to work. I have never in my life held a gun, apart from when I was in the army, where I served normally. There was no roadblock on Vassilissis Sofias Street. I saw two police officers. One of them waved at me to stop and the other pointed his weapon at me. I was frightened because of the weapon and I didn’t stop immediately. After some time they started firing at me. I don’t remember whether I noticed a police car or not near the War Museum. When I reached Parliament, they had their sirens on and they were following me and firing at me. I moved into the oncoming lane. I wanted to get home quickly. In Siggrou Avenue there was a police roadblock. I didn’t take any notice of it. On Flisvos Street there was another roadblock. I didn’t take any notice of that one either. Further down, at some traffic lights, I wove my way through the traffic in order to get away. I remember colliding sideways with someone, not head on. I don’t remember causing a car to turn over. I don’t remember a seeing a roadblock on Kalamakiou Street. I don’t remember if they were shooting at me there. I stopped at the petrol station because I had already been hit by a bullet and I was in pain. Besides, there were a lot people there and I wasn’t so scared. I stopped and tried to unbuckle my seat belt. Right then, I felt bullets in my back. The windows were broken. A police officer came, pulled me out and, while I was lying on my side, face down, they shot me in the foot. I don’t know which one of them shot me. I didn’t see who shot me because I was lying face down. Before the incident I had been in hospital once only, for minor depression. After the incident I developed persecution mania. Before the incident I had only had minor depression. When I was at the petrol station I did not make any movements that could make the police officers think I was carrying a weapon.” 17. The defendants’ statements were taken down as follows: “I was in police car no. A62. We were in the Paleo Faliro area. We heard about the chase on the radio. We arranged with the control centre to create traffic congestion at the beginning of the road close to Trokadero. We positioned the police car sideways across the road, facing the sea. I also stopped some civilian cars in order to block the road. Suddenly I saw flashing lights, sirens and a car at a distance of 30 metres coming towards me. The driver moved to the right of the street that leads to the marina and drove past me at a distance of 1 metre; I even jumped out of the way so that he wouldn’t run me over. Motorcycles and police cars drove past, following at a distance of 30 to 40 metres. There were no gunshots fired by anyone there. We got in the car and followed the other police cars at a distance of about 300 metres. I remember seeing a red car that had skidded on to the barrier. We lost control briefly, then continued driving. I heard gunshots after seeing the car that was turned upside down on Kalamakiou Street. I used my weapon later. We followed the fugitive’s course. When we reached Kalamakiou Street, we heard gunshots again. We went towards the petrol station. I got out of the car, there was chaos everywhere, and I heard gunshots. Some colleagues had ducked, others were on the ground, others were taking cover. I didn’t know where the gunshots were coming from. They could also have been coming from the Skoda [the applicant’s car]. I saw some of my colleagues firing in the air. Then I fired two shots in the air and threw myself to the ground. I was 50 metres away from the car. I didn’t get close to fire the shots, because there was a block of flats nearby. I heard the shouts of the colleagues who were telling the driver to get out of the car. Finally, I saw the police officers who were at the front walking freely and I realised the incident was over. I believe that the weapons of the colleagues who were summoned, or who had notified the control centre, were checked. From where I was standing, I couldn’t see the victim in the car.” “Since 9 p.m., we had been on duty at the B department of the Flying Squad. We heard on the radio that a chase was in progress, starting from the American embassy, of a car which had almost run over two pedestrians and a traffic warden. We followed the car. Near Trokadero we saw that the police had formed a roadblock. Manoliadis was using his whistle to stop the cars. The Skoda drove over to the right, to the side street, and then suddenly turned left. Manoliadis jumped out of the way instinctively, and the Skoda passed very near him. At Rodeo there was a roadblock similar to the one where Mr Manoliadis was. The victim hit a red car and caused it to turn upside down. The radio of the first police car informed us of the course the Skoda was taking. As we approached the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets and we were 50 to 60 metres behind, I heard the first gunshots. We continued driving and entered Kalamakiou Street. There were some police cars ahead of us. Among them, there may have been some that had not been called but had come on their own initiative. When we arrived, I got out of the police car and went towards the vehicle that was being chased. Other colleagues kept calling to the driver to get out of the car. He didn’t get out. I heard someone say, ‘Let’s fire some shots to intimidate him’, and I took my weapon out and shot twice in the air. One of my colleagues took advantage of a break in the shooting to pull the driver out of the car. I was 10 to 15 metres away from the Skoda, or 8; I don’t remember exactly. The control centre issued a warning that the man was carrying a weapon. I have been in many chases, and this particular individual gave me the impression that he was familiar with this kind of thing.” “I ride a motorcycle. On Posidonos Street we heard on the radio that a chase was in progress from the American embassy. Very soon afterwards we heard that the driver had reached Onassio Hospital. I tried to get on to the central reservation to take up my position and wait for him. I saw the car coming. Risking my life, I got down from the high pavement and followed it. A police car and two motorcycles were in pursuit. I heard on the radio that the individual was dangerous and possibly carrying a weapon; he was driving very dangerously. At the traffic lights on Posidonos Street, close to Edem, as we reached the marina of Amfithea and Posidonos, I was struck by his ability to weave in and out of the other cars. I had never seen a chase like this one, although I had spent fifteen years in the service. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets, he collided with a taxi. At the traffic lights at that junction there was a police roadblock. Makaratzis turned right and entered the side street. He was driving into the oncoming traffic and, having gone past the traffic lights, he turned left and created confusion, because the lights changed and the cars were moving off. I didn’t know whether anyone had been killed, or what was happening. I was still in the right side street. The Skoda had been blocked by the other cars, and I shot three times in the air to intimidate him. It was impossible to aim at the Skoda because it was between other cars. Makaratzis drove off, continued down Kalamakiou Street, drove uphill and, as I was approaching at a distance of 30 metres, I saw the car at the petrol station. I got off my motorcycle and entered the petrol station from the right. I went into the workshop and shouted ‘Everyone move out of the way!’. I climbed up a staircase and on to the veranda. While I was climbing up the stairs, I heard gunshots. I didn’t know where they were coming from. When I got up there I heard the others calling to the driver to get out of the car. I saw him leaning over to the side and opening the glove compartment, and I assumed that he was going to take out a weapon and shoot. I shouted at the others to be careful because he might have a weapon. I picked up a big pot and threw it at the car. I was watching the driver’s hands, so as to be able to shout and warn my colleagues if I saw him taking something out to throw.” “Mahairas and I set off together. At 9.15 p.m. I was standing in front of the police car. I saw the Skoda coming from the Naval Hospital, going through a red light and almost hitting a couple. I waved to the driver to stop. He drove straight towards me and almost hit me. I jumped aside. No one took out their weapons. I got in the car and we chased him, not only for contravening traffic regulations, but also because he had almost hit me. At Vassilissis Sofias Street we crossed into the oncoming lane and turned right at a red light. We had the flashing lights on and we were driving very fast, but we couldn’t locate him. Suddenly, we saw the Skoda in front of the War Museum. We turned on the flashing lights and the siren, and we flashed our lights at him. He saw us from his car, braked and turned on his hazard lights, and suddenly he drove off again at high speed, sounding his horn. He reached Sintagma, crossed into the oncoming lane near the flower shops and drove into Amalias Street against the traffic. We turned the flashing lights on again and followed him. We continued driving and notified the control centre. On Kallirois Street he almost collided with another police car. At the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he went through a red light, crossed into the oncoming lane, hit a car and continued driving. Two motorcycles came close to him. At Trokadero, a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars had formed a roadblock. He drove towards the right, mounted the pavement and went past them. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down. We thought that whoever was in it must be dead. The control centre told the officers on motorcycles to follow him from a distance because of the danger. At Amfithea he collided with a taxi driver, causing him a neck injury; he later had to wear a collar. He continued down Posidonos Street and Kalamakiou Street. He entered the side street and drove against the traffic. He drove past the other cars and crossed over to Kalamakiou. That was where the first gunshots were fired. I leaned out of the left window at the back and shot at the back left tyre of the Skoda. The tyre burst. I was certain about the direction of the bullet. I knew that no one was in danger. When a bullet hits a tyre, it does not ricochet. I fired from a distance of 5 metres. After firing, I saw that the tyre had been punctured. Mahairas fired at the right tyre at the back. With his tyres burst, Makaratzis stopped at the petrol station. We were almost level with him. I acted as a traffic controller. I stopped the oncoming cars, and once the arrest had been made I saw how many police cars there were. There were more than nine. When all the police cars were at the petrol station, shots were fired in the air, not at the car. The car had been hit at the junction. There were a lot of policemen. They occupied both lanes of the street. The Skoda had to slow down, and they fired at him. I was stopping the cars. If they had aimed at the car when we were at the petrol station, they would have shot me too. I believe all the gunshots, even the ones that hit the windows, were aimed at the tyres.” “I was at the American embassy with Markou. We saw a Skoda going through a red light. The traffic warden waved to him to stop. The Skoda continued driving towards our colleague, at the risk of hitting him. We got in our car and followed him. He crossed into the oncoming lane and went through a red light at Vassilissis Sofias Street. We lost him and then we suddenly saw him at the War Museum. We followed him, turned on the flashing lights and waved to him to stop. At the flower shops he turned on his hazard lights as if he were going to stop. Suddenly, he increased his speed and crossed into the oncoming lane on Amalias Street and continued towards Sintagma and Siggrou. We followed him. Other police cars arrived. At Trokadero he bypassed a roadblock by driving around the side. At Flisvos he caused a Daihatsu to turn upside down and continued on his way. Further down the road there was a roadblock. He collided with a taxi driver and continued on. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets there was another roadblock. He turned right into a side street and then turned left, crossing Posidonos Street. I heard some gunshots there. We drove to the top of the side street, followed him and, when we reached Posidonos Street, we were 5 metres away from him. I took my weapon out and aimed at his right rear tyre. When you fire shot after shot it is difficult to aim. I put my weapon on to automatic, which makes it fire three or four times. The Skoda stopped 70 metres away, at the petrol station, and we followed. The entire course and his behaviour had seemed extremely dangerous to us, like that of a terrorist. Other police cars and motorcycles arrived. They called to him to get out of the car. He didn’t, and some gunshots were fired. We were 10 metres behind him. If they did fire from the other police cars directly at him, we weren’t in their line of fire. I heard some colleagues say, ‘Let’s fire some gunshots to intimidate him’. Someone got up on the veranda and threw a pot down. One of my colleagues, who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, and whom I did not know, along with someone else, got close, broke the window and called to him to get out. He didn’t, so they pulled him out. One of them attempted to put handcuffs on him. Someone shouted ‘Careful, he is injured’ and they didn’t put them on. The ambulance came. I didn’t know whether he had been injured by a bullet or in a car accident. Neither my weapon nor Souliotis’s fires Magnum bullets. The A-45 is very powerful and has a great force of penetration. I don’t know who said that he was armed and that we should fire in the air.” “Kiriazis and I were on duty as instructed at Neos Kosmos. We received a message to go to Siggrou, where a car which had hit other cars and hadn’t stopped when signalled to by a traffic warden, etc., was being chased. We went to Siggrou and followed the driver. At Interamerican he drove through a red light and continued towards the coastal avenue. At Trokadero we saw a lot of police cars and flashing lights. We remained behind him and, at Flisvos, we saw the car that had been turned upside down. We were left a bit behind. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets we lost him completely. We asked a civilian, who told us that he had turned right and was heading towards Kalamakiou Street, and we headed that way. I heard some gunshots that I thought were coming from the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. Artificial traffic congestion had been created. The control centre issued a warning that the man was armed and dangerous. We stopped 100 metres to the right of the petrol station and heard gunshots. We didn’t know whether they were coming from the victim or the police officers because we couldn’t see the car. We took cover and heard him being called out of the car. We fired some intimidation shots in order to confuse him, because we knew that a police officer would try to arrest him.” “Ntinas was my chief of crew. We received a message and chased the car, getting close to it at the traffic lights at Amfitheas Street. At Trokadero we were falling behind. The driver went through the roadblock that had been set up. At Flisvos we saw the car that had been turned upside down. There was a problem with the traffic and we were left behind. At the junction of Amfitheas and Posidonos Streets a taxi had been damaged. Further down we heard gunshots. Some civilians told us that the driver had turned left. We followed him. When we got to the petrol station we heard gunshots. Some colleagues were heard shouting, ‘Get out’, ‘Be careful’, and someone else said, ‘Shoot to intimidate him’. So I fired two shots to intimidate him. I have served for fifteen years. I have never seen anything like this. During the chase we heard from the control centre that the individual was extremely dangerous and possibly armed.” 18. The witnesses’ statements were taken down as follows: “I am the driver who chased the victim. Mahairas, Souliotis and I serve in the Flying Squad. The victim’s car was considered suspicious. We consider suspicious anything that moves around the American embassy. One of my colleagues, who was not carrying a gun, signalled the driver to stop. My other colleague and I waited at a distance, outside the car. Instead of stopping, the driver continued towards my colleague and almost hit him. Then he drove off. We considered him dangerous, and had to chase after him. At first we lost him for a while, but then we spotted him again near the War Museum. We waved to him to stop. He hesitated for a while, looked as if he was about to stop, but then drove on. At this point we started chasing him with the sirens on. He reached Parliament, crossed into the oncoming lane and continued towards Siggrou at full speed. We had notified other police cars that were going to Siggrou. At some stage he almost collided with a police car. When he reached the coastal avenue, we had already formed a roadblock. He collided with some civilian cars, got away, and drove on. Further down, at Flisvos, he collided with a red car and caused it to turn over, and then drove off at full speed. There was traffic in the area. There was a lot of traffic in Kalamakiou and he moved on to the hard shoulder. It was in that area, in Kalamakiou, that we heard gunshots for the first time. Until then we hadn’t fired because there was a lot of traffic and we could have injured civilians. We didn’t lose him at any point; we only almost lost him at the beginning of Kalamakiou, where there was an obstacle on the pavement. Mr Mahairas and Mr Souliotis were in the car with me and it was around that area that our colleagues fired at the tyres of the car. I maintain that, with our training, we can hit the target in 99% of cases, if not 100%. The driver stopped at the petrol station. We moved the civilians out of the way and some other colleagues who were wearing bullet-proof vests approached his car, broke the windows and pulled him out of the car, because they had called to him to get out several times but he hadn’t. Gunshots were heard from a distance. I don’t know where they were coming from. A colleague had gone up on to the veranda, but I don’t think he fired. He threw a pot at the driver. When the gunshots were fired, the victim’s car was parked sideways on the right of the petrol station. We were at the left of the petrol station and the others were behind me. I don’t know if others fired at the car. We heard gunshots at the beginning of Kalamakiou, and at the end, when everything was over. The final shots were probably fired to intimidate the victim. [Officer] Boulketis was the one that pulled him out. I don’t think he fired at him. There was no reason to do so. The victim made some movements in the car: he moved right and then left, as if looking for something, and it was conceivable that he had a weapon. That is why colleagues wearing bullet-proof vests went to pull him out of the car. I don’t know about the ballistic investigation. The bullets found inside the car were from the weapons of Souliotis and Mahairas. However, my colleagues were aiming at the tyres. The speed of the chase was approximately 60 km/h in Vassilissis Sofias and Amalias Streets, because there was traffic. We were about 10 metres behind him. Near the columns [of the Temple of Olympian Zeus] motorcycles appeared both ahead of us and behind. At the beginning of Siggrou another police car came up in front of the victim and he almost collided with it. He was moving from left to right in Siggrou, racing at 160 km/h and changing lanes constantly. I can’t say which police cars were behind us at the corner of Kalamakiou, because when we chase someone we don’t see what is going on behind. We stopped at the petrol station; two motorcycles stopped behind us, and another car stopped behind them. The first gunshots were fired at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. In Kalamakiou Street, before Posidonos Street, when we were 5 metres behind him, Mr Mahairas used his firearm and shot at the tyres of the car. Mr Souliotis must have used his weapon too at the same spot. When the driver reached the petrol station and stopped, I called from the car to the civilians to move out of the way and to the driver to get out, and a colleague who was wearing a bullet-proof vest went to pull him out. I don’t know how many bullets were fired; the front windscreen broke because a pot was thrown at it. I do not know how the front passenger’s window broke, or how the back window broke. I don’t know how the victim’s foot was injured. It couldn’t have been when shots were fired around the car. Finally, we went to the police station to make a statement. Our lives weren’t directly at risk during the incident. The driver had caused accidents, driven into the oncoming traffic and endangered many people. In total, he had been chased by thirty-three policemen, whose weapons were confiscated, but others had also got involved. We had never seen anything like it. They told us on the radio to be careful, that the individual was carrying a weapon and might be extremely dangerous. Souliotis is a traffic warden. Of course he was not carrying a weapon when he waved to him to stop. The police roadblocks were set up because they had been ordered by the control centre. We also created artificial traffic congestion with civilian cars at the traffic lights. During the incident we noticed that civilians were injured, that cars were turned upside down; we didn’t have any other way of stopping him, after the roadblocks and the artificial traffic congestion. The last roadblock was on Kalamakiou Street. There were police officers on foot in the side street. He drove straight at them. That was the moment when the first gunshots were fired. That was also the moment when my colleagues first fired from the car at his tyres. It is possible that other weapons were used besides the thirty-three that were confiscated. For that matter, the bullet that was taken from his leg did not belong to any of the thirty-three weapons that were confiscated. If someone had fired in the victim’s direction at the petrol station, the petrol would have caught fire. At the petrol station they fired shots in the air. Probably in order to cover the colleague that went to pull him out. One of my colleagues climbed up on to the veranda and threw a pot at him to create confusion. Boulketis pulled him out and handcuffed him. We saw that he was bleeding and they took him to hospital. The investigation was carried out by our officers and some other department, not by those of us who had gone to the police station.” “I was on the old coastal avenue in Agia Skepi. I saw a vehicle driving erratically. We got an order from the control centre and went after it. On the way we saw all the accidents, the cars that had been hit and someone who was injured. We reached Kalamakiou from Amfitheas. We were far behind. We didn’t hear any gunshots. Even if there had been gunshots, we would not have heard them. Mr Boulketis, who was with me, had a bullet-proof vest. He put it on, while another colleague broke the window. Mr Boulketis pulled the driver out and put handcuffs on him, but when he saw that he had been injured he removed them. The victim was looking right and left; his hands were on the floor, we could not see them, and we assumed he had a gun. When we reached the petrol station, I heard one or two gunshots; I don’t know where they came from. Boulketis and Xilogiannis were with me in the police car. Xilogiannis and I didn’t have bullet-proof vests and we didn’t move closer, as Boulketis did. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. There is no way any weapons could have been concealed or changed hands. Our weapons are given to each of us personally. We do not give them to other colleagues. At the petrol station, when we moved closer so that Boulketis could pull the driver out of the car, nobody fired. No colleague could have become involved in the incident without receiving an order, unless someone heard about it and came on his own initiative. If such a person had used his weapon, there is no way he would have left without handing it over.” “I was the driver of the last police car, where Mr Boulketis was. We received an order from the centre and we followed the chase. We were the last to get to the petrol station where the Skoda was parked. There were a lot of police cars and motorcycles. Everybody was out of their cars; the Skoda was right next to the pump that is on the right-hand side when facing the petrol station. Everyone was out of their cars ... Mr Boulketis put on his bullet-proof vest and I covered him from the back, while behind me there were more officers covering him. When we got there, we heard some gunshots. When we got out of the car and were standing very close to the Skoda two or three gunshots were fired; they were not fired in my direction, because we were very close to the Skoda ... Perhaps the car was hit in the process, I don’t know. I am not in a position to know at which stage the victim was hit; probably during the chase ...” “... The shots fired at the petrol station were for intimidation. I didn’t see any shots fired at the car, the shots were fired towards the car but in the air, that is, the bullets went up in the air. I don’t know the [police officers] who fired. I had never seen them before. I know Markou and Kasoris. The police officer who climbed up on to the veranda didn’t shoot; he threw a pot. We are bound by our duty and have to follow orders when it comes to the areas we are patrolling, but we don’t always follow them and often go on our own initiative to the scene of incidents like this one where colleagues are in danger and all manner of things have happened in the past. The entire operation at the petrol station lasted ten to fifteen minutes; the Skoda had stopped along the kerb at the petrol station. I parked on the right, I arrived almost at the same time as the men in the first police car, and the rest got there immediately afterwards, one after the other. All the men were holding weapons in their hands. Usually all police cars have a light machine gun. After I got there I took cover behind a column. We called to the driver to get out of the car, and then the shooting began. I don’t remember even approximately how long afterwards the shooting began. The victim made some movements in the car. The movements he made while he was unlocking the car and all his other movements could have been seen by us as movements to get his weapon out from a holster under his arm, or to take out a hand grenade. At the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets I didn’t notice any shots being fired at the right-hand side of the Skoda, only the ones fired at the tyres on the left-hand side. The first photograph shows that the tyres on the left-hand side are burst, the second one shows that the ones on the right are burst. As to the injury to [the applicant’s] right foot, it is possible that a bullet that was fired at the tyres ricocheted and penetrated through the metal plate of the car, which is only a few millimetres thick. There are bullets that can pierce metal plates of double thickness. In those cars there is no chassis. There are only plain metal plates, which can be pierced by a ricocheting bullet: the victim may have been hit in the buttock in this way. He may have been hit in the armpit area in the same way. At some point I saw him leaning towards the seat; I thought he might have been hit and I shouted.” “I am the petrol station attendant. I was in front of the pump, filling up. Suddenly, I saw the Skoda slowly coming up and stopping next to me, with the front facing the street as you can see in the photograph. The driver was not moving. Then the police cars arrived; the policemen were shouting, ‘Move out of the way, move out of the way!’. I left the pump and went inside, 4 to 5 metres away, and the owner and I moved to an area further at the back. There is a second door, and we went through to the workshop. When I went inside the store I heard gunshots. There was chaos. More gunshots were fired. They were firing, but I don’t know in which direction. I couldn’t see anything. The pumps were next to the store; if they had fired towards the car the bullets would also have hit the pumps. I think someone went up on to the veranda and threw a pot down. I saw it because I had gone out the back but I didn’t go close. I couldn’t see anything and I didn’t witness the arrest or see whether they shot him. When the car arrived I saw the tyres were burst, but I do not remember whether the windows were also broken. In the first photograph, I think the tyres are burst. It was the first statement I had ever made, I was still in a state of panic and I don’t know whether I reported everything accurately. It’s the same today, two years having passed since the incident. When I went to the back, I saw the police officer. He didn’t shoot, he threw a pot, but I couldn’t see the victim’s car. Neither the Vespa, which was half a metre away, next to the car, nor the pumps, of course, had any bullet holes. The end of the veranda where the police officer went overlooked the car. The front of the car must have been protruding a bit under the veranda.” “I am the owner of the petrol station. I was standing a bit further inside than Mastrokostas. I saw the Skoda coming up slowly. It stopped, and seconds later I heard gunshots. The boy heard the shouting, I didn’t. When I heard the gunshots I left, I went up to the house, and then a police officer came and threw a large pot at the roof of the car. He didn’t shoot. I came down when the shooting had stopped and I saw the victim as they were pulling him out of the car. I think the man who pulled him out was wearing civilian clothes. I am not sure. I saw him holding a big machine gun. I don’t know if he fired. I don’t remember. If he had fired, I would remember it. He may have fired; but I didn’t see him do it. I don’t remember whether the windows of the car were broken. I remember that he had crashed ... I didn’t find any cartridge cases anywhere. I didn’t find any bullet holes anywhere. When I saw the police officer who came from the back on to the veranda, I left and didn’t see if he fired. I went downstairs and saw them pulling the driver out of the car. The police officer didn’t shoot him. It may also have been the person that got off the motorcycle. The veranda is wide and it covered more than half of the car.” “I was at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets ... Suddenly, I saw in my rear-view mirror a car coming from the side street at great speed; it drove over the curb, came from the right and crashed into me. It threw me a distance of 10 to 15 metres. There was a police car next to me. The police officers must have been out of the car, and were holding weapons. I heard gunshots and I was frightened. More police cars came and followed the Skoda to the left, towards Kalamakiou Street. He caused great damage to me. If someone had been sitting in the back seat, they would not have survived.” 19. Having deliberated, the court acquitted the seven police officers on both the criminal charges brought against them (see paragraph 15 above). On the first count (causing serious bodily harm), the court found that it had not been established that the accused were the ones who had injured the applicant. A number of police officers who had taken part in the incident had left the scene after the applicant’s arrest without revealing their identity or giving the necessary information concerning their weapons. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired from the same weapon but were unrelated to the traces from the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The other bullet and some of the metal fragments found in the applicant’s car had been fired from the weapons of two of the accused. However, it had not been shown beyond a reasonable doubt that these officers had injured the applicant, given that many other shots had been fired from unidentified weapons. As regards the second charge (unauthorised use of weapons), the court held that the police officers had used their weapons for no other purpose than trying to stop a car whose driver they reasonably considered to be a dangerous criminal. The relevant passages of the court’s judgment read as follows: “On 13 September 1995 the victim, Christos Makaratzis, was driving a private vehicle with the number plate YIM 8837 in Athens in the area around the American embassy. At the junction of Telonos and Kokkali Streets, a unit of the special police control division of the Flying Squad of Attica was carrying out checks on passing cars. The accused Mahairas, Souliotis and Ventouris were part of this unit. The victim’s vehicle was coming from the direction of the hospital; he drove through a red light and the accused Souliotis signalled to him to stop. Instead of stopping at the signal made by the traffic warden, however, he continued driving towards him and almost hit him. The police crew got into their car immediately and began chasing him. At Vassilissis Sofias Street he entered the oncoming lane and drove through a red light. Because of the traffic, the police officers lost the car, which they were chasing with their flashing lights on, and met with it again near the War Museum. They flashed their lights at the driver in order for him to stop; the siren and the flashing lights of the police car were on. Initially the victim turned his hazard lights on, as if he were going to stop the car. However, he suddenly accelerated and drove off. He reached Sintagma near the flower shops; he entered the oncoming lane at Amalias Street and continued towards Siggrou Avenue. The police car informed the Flying Squad control centre, and the control centre notified other units that were on duty in the area in which the victim was moving, in order for them to come and assist. At Siggrou Avenue the car was moving at a very high speed from one lane to the other. Near Kallirois Street the driver almost collided with a police car; at the traffic lights at Diogenis Palace he drove through a red light, entered the oncoming lane and collided with a car. At Trokadero there was a roadblock formed by a police car, two motorcycles and fifteen civilian cars, which he got past by driving on the pavement, and the crew of the police car were almost run over. At Flisvos he collided with a Daihatsu that was stationary, caused it to turn upside down, injuring the driver, and on Amfitheas Street he collided with a car and a taxi, whose driver was injured. At the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets there was a police car in the side street, and the cars moving towards Glifada had been blocked. The victim drove over the central reservation towards the right, in order to head towards the side street, but then he noticed the police car and drove over the central reservation towards the left and collided with two cars that were crossing Posidonos Street and almost ran over Police Constable Stroumpoulis. The first gunshots directed at the pursued car, which were fired in order to stop the victim, were heard at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets. It was in that area that the accused Mahairas, who was riding in the police car and had been chasing the vehicle from the beginning, fired a burst of shots when the car was at a distance of approximately 5 metres, with his firearm no. MP 5 C273917, because the car was moving. He aimed at the rear right tyre. The accused Souliotis, who was riding in the same police car, fired from the left window, with his pistol no. AO 38275, aiming at the rear left tyre, which he punctured. Near that junction the victim had to slow down. Many police officers had reached that spot and occupied both lanes; other police officers, besides those already mentioned, also fired at the car, as many gunshots were fired at that spot. It is also to be noted that, during the entire course, policemen, police cars and motorcycles joined the chase, without being able to stop the vehicle. It continued its course along Kalamakiou Avenue, despite the gunshots, and stopped at the junction of Kalamakiou and Artemidos Streets, at the entrance of a petrol station and near the petrol pumps, with the front facing the street. There, he was surrounded by the police units that were chasing him, and which the control centre knew had taken part in the operation, and also by other units that had come on their own initiative to help their colleagues when they heard about the incident from the control centre. In other words, there were units in the area that had gone to the scene of the incident, without being called. The police officers got out of their cars and off their motorcycles, holding their weapons. The victim made some movements in his car, which gave the police officers the impression that he had a weapon. The police officers asked him to get out of the car, but he did not, and the police officer who was wearing a bullet-proof vest, Nikolaos Boulketis, approached the car. Then, a lot of the police officers who were present began firing in order to intimidate the victim and cover their colleague; Nikolaos Boulketis took the opportunity to break the car window and arrest the victim. Earlier, the accused police officer Christos Markou had climbed on to the veranda which was above the petrol station and had thrown a pot down, which broke the windscreen without making it fall in. When the victim got out of the car, he was immobilised by the police officer who had arrested him, and by his colleagues, and then it became clear that he was injured. He had an exit wound on his right arm, another exit wound on the right of the thorax, with the entry from the back of the armpit. He had an exit wound at the end of his left foot, a wound high up on his left buttock and wounds on the outer surface of the kidney area. The windscreen of the car driven by the victim was broken, but had not fallen in; it had three bullet holes and a mark made by another. There were three bullet holes in the metal part of the left door at the back, and a bullet mark on the metal surface of the chassis. The back window was smashed and on its metal part there were two bullet holes and another one at the left rear lights. There was a bullet mark on the right rear wing above the wheel. The front passenger window was broken and there was a bullet mark on the outside of the roof. There were bullet holes inside the car under the glove compartment on the dashboard, on the radio, the top part of the dashboard, in the driver’s seat, in the front passenger seat and in the back seat. Two bullets and four fragments were found inside the car. Of the police officers who took part in the operation, thirty-three handed over their weapons, that is, all those who had been ordered to take part in the chase or who had notified the control centre and whose departments knew that they had taken part in the operation. However, others had taken part of their own accord in order to help their colleagues, and it is not known who they are or why they left after the arrest of the victim without informing the control centre of their presence at the scene of the incident. Among the thirty-three weapons, there were twenty-three revolvers of .357 Magnum calibre; six pistols, five of which were of 9 mm Parabellum and one of .45 ACP calibre; and four HK MP 5 submachine guns of 9 mm Parabellum calibre. Of the thirty-three weapons, only the weapons of the accused had been fired. The three bullets that were found in the car and the one that was removed from the first metatarsal of the right foot of the driver came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. Such cartridges are fired mainly from pistols and submachine guns with the same calibre. The four fragments found inside the car are sabot fragments of coated bullets of different calibre and it was not possible to identify the calibre of the bullets, although one of the fragments was assessed as a fragment of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The report by the laboratory expert confirmed that the three bullets, two of which were found in the car and one of which was found in the foot of the victim, came from cartridges of 9 mm Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre. The bullet [PB2] and the two metal sabots [PP1 and PP2] found inside the car were fired by the HK MP 5 submachine gun number no. C273917 that belonged to the accused Mahairas. The bullet from which the other metal sabot [PP3] came, which was found inside the car, was fired by the Sphinx pistol no. A038275 that belonged to the accused Souliotis. The bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and a bullet that was found inside the car were fired by the same weapon, of Parabellum (9 x 19) calibre, but bear no relation to the traces left by the thirty-three weapons that were examined. The victim, Christos Makaratzis, was indeed injured by the submachine guns used by the police officers who took part in the chase and which were fired during the pursuit at the junction of Posidonos and Kalamakiou Streets where, apart from Souliotis, Mahairas and Markou [illegible] (third accused) other police officers fired who have not been identified, since there were many police officers who fired at that spot. This emerges indirectly from the fact that the bullet that was removed from the body of the victim and another one were fired by a weapon the owner of which was not identified and were not fired by the weapons of the accused. The fact that bullets and sabots that were found inside the car were fired by the weapons of the accused Souliotis and Mahairas leads to the conclusion that the physical injuries of the victim were caused by the weapons that belonged to the accused, apart from the one to his foot. In addition, since there were many bullet holes in his car that were caused by other, unidentified, weapons, the victim might have been injured by those bullets. As already stated, submachine guns and pistols are also of the same calibre. The first, second, third, sixth and seventh defendants fired shots for the purpose of intimidation in the area of the final operation (the petrol station). It is also to be noted that many others also fired shots there for intimidation purposes in order to assist their colleagues who were closer to the car to arrest the victim. They cannot have fired towards the car, because there was a danger of hitting the pumps of the petrol station, and there were no traces of gunshots in that area. The victim’s foot injury was caused from above, since only the top of the shoe was hit and not the sole, but it cannot be said that the shot was fired by the accused Markou, who had climbed on to the veranda of the petrol station, because the car was parked in such a way that almost half of it was under the veranda and thus the direction of the shot would have to have been almost vertical in order to hit the top part of the foot. If that had been the case, the bullet would also have had to go through a part of the dashboard. There is no trace of this, the closest mark being on the radio. Besides, if this injury had been caused by the weapon of the accused, it would have been confirmed by the expert investigation ... The injury was indeed on the top part of the foot; but it could have been caused by a shot that was fired from behind the car while the victim was driving and his foot was almost vertical to the accelerator, by one of the weapons fired at him at the junction of Kalamakiou and Posidonos Streets. The victim’s allegation that he was shot immediately after he was pulled out of the car must be considered groundless, since, as he stated, he was shot when he was ‘lying on his side, face down’. If that had been the case, the injury would have been different. Having regard to the above, and taking into account the fact that other police officers who have not been identified took part in the operation, some of whom possibly used their weapons, the Court has doubts as to whether the accused caused the victim’s injury. As a result, they should be declared innocent of the first act attributed to them. They should also be declared innocent of the second act because, although they used their weapons, they had attempted to stop the car by creating artificial traffic congestion and roadblocks and had failed, as the victim had continued driving while he was being chased by a large number of police officers, in a manner that was dangerous to the civilians that were in his way. Furthermore, the police officers did not know whether the civilians in the cars that had collided with the victim were killed, and they understandably considered him to be a dangerous criminal because of his behaviour and because they had received that information from the control centre. The Court also doubts whether the accused could have avoided using their weapons, which they did in order to stop him and intimidate him, so that he would stop driving in a manner that was dangerous to other civilians, and to protect the latter, as was their duty. Therefore, the accused must be declared innocent of the acts attributed to them in the indictment.” 20. The applicant, who was present when the judgment was pronounced, did not have the right to appeal under domestic law. The text of the judgment was finalised on 20 May 1999. 21. On 20 April 1997 the public prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant. The indictment read as follows: “[The applicant] is accused ... of committing a number of offences and more specifically: A. While driving [his] car in Athens on 13 September 1995, he caused with his vehicle bodily injury and harm to others by his negligence, that is, by failing to take the care he should and could have taken in the circumstances and to anticipate the culpable consequences of his acts. More specifically: (a) while he was driving the vehicle referred to above in Posidonos Avenue, near Paleo Faliro, towards the airport, he did not keep enough distance between himself and the vehicles in front to be able to avoid a crash in case they reduced their speed or stopped, so that he crashed the front of his car into the back of the car with the private registration number IR-8628 that Iliostalakti Soumpasi was driving in the same direction, resulting in injuries to her neck; (b) after the above crash, the accused continued driving the vehicle referred to above and, while he was going along Posidonos Avenue near Kalamaki, he again failed to keep enough distance from the vehicles in front, thus crashing the front of his car into the back of the car with the taxi registration number E-3507 that Ioannis Goumas was driving and that had stopped at a red light in the left lane of Posidonos Avenue, the consequence of which was to cause injury to the aforementioned driver who suffered a cervical hernia and an injury to the head. B. While he was driving [his] car at the time and place referred to above, he did not keep enough distance from the vehicles in front to avoid a crash in case they reduced their speed or stopped. C. While he was driving [his] car at the time and place referred to above, he did not abide by the police officers’ signal to stop and, specifically, while he was driving the vehicle referred to above in Athens, crossing Vassilissis Sofias Street, Amalias Avenue, Siggrou Avenue and Posidonos Avenue, he did not comply with a signal to stop made by police officer Sotirios Souliotis, who was using a car of the Hellenic Police, registration number EA-11000, in Vassilissis Sofias Street, but continued driving, crossing all the streets mentioned above, while the above-mentioned police car and other police cars of the Hellenic Police were chasing him ...” 22. By judgment no. 16111/2000, the Athens First-Instance Criminal Court sentenced the applicant to forty days’ imprisonment. 23. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: “Intentional infliction of bodily harm on another person ... shall be punishable by up to three years’ imprisonment ...” “Where the act punishable under Article 308 has been committed in a way which could have endangered the victim’s life or caused him grievous bodily harm, imprisonment of at least three months shall be imposed.” 24. Section 14 of Law no. 2168/1993 provides: “Anyone who uses a gun ... while committing a serious crime or lesser offence of which he is subsequently convicted shall be punished by a term of imprisonment of at least three months to be added to the sentence imposed for that offence.” 25. At the material time, the use of firearms by law-enforcement officials was regulated by Law no. 29/1943, which was enacted on 30 April 1943 when Greece was under German occupation. Section 1 of that statute listed a wide range of situations in which a police officer could use firearms (for example in order “to enforce the laws, decrees and decisions of the relevant authorities or to disperse public gatherings or suppress mutinies”), without being liable for the consequences. These provisions were modified by Article 133 of Presidential Decree no. 141/1991, which authorises the use of firearms in the situations set forth in Law no. 29/1943 “only when absolutely necessary and when all less extreme methods have been exhausted”. Law no. 29/1943 was criticised as “defective” and “vague” by the Public Prosecutor of the Supreme Court (see Opinion no. 12/1992). Senior Greek police officers and trade unions have called for this legislation to be updated. In a letter to the Minister of Public Order dated April 2001, the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), an advisory body to the government, expressed the view that new legislation which would incorporate relevant international human rights law and guidelines was imperative (NCHR, 2001 Report, pp. 107-15). In February 2002 the Minister of Public Order announced that a new law would shortly be enacted, which would “safeguard citizens against the reckless use of police weapons, but also safeguard police officers who will be better informed as to when they can use them”. 26. In the summer of 2002, a group called the “Revolutionary Organisation 17 November” was dismantled. That group, established in 1975, had committed numerous terrorist acts, including the assassination of United States officials in 1975, 1983, 1988 and 1991. 27. On 24 July 2003 Law no. 3169/2003, which is entitled “Carrying and use of firearms by police officers, training of police officers in the use of firearms and other provisions”, came into force. Law no. 29/1943 was repealed (section 8). Further, in April 2004, the “Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police”, which was prepared by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights, was translated into Greek with a view to being distributed to Greek policemen. 28. Article 6 § 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides: “Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.” 29. In this connection, the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations noted the following (see General Comment no. 6, Article 6, 16th Session (1982), § 3): “The protection against arbitrary deprivation of life which is explicitly required by the third sentence of Article 6 § 1 is of paramount importance. The Committee considers that States Parties should take measures not only to prevent and punish deprivation of life by criminal acts, but also to prevent arbitrary killing by their own security forces. The deprivation of life by the authorities of the State is a matter of the utmost gravity. Therefore, the law must strictly control and limit the circumstances in which a person may be deprived of his life by such authorities.” 30. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (“United Nations Force and Firearms Principles”) were adopted on 7 September 1990 by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. Paragraph 9 of the Principles provides: “Law-enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.” 31. Paragraph 5 of the Principles provides, inter alia, that law-enforcement officials shall “act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved”. Under the terms of paragraph 7, “governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law-enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their law”. Paragraph 11 (b) states that national rules and regulations on the use of firearms should “ensure that firearms are used only in appropriate circumstances and in a manner likely to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm”. 32. Other relevant provisions read as follows: “... law-enforcement officials shall identify themselves as such and shall give a clear warning of their intent to use firearms, with sufficient time for the warnings to be observed, unless to do so would unduly place the law-enforcement officials at risk or would create a risk of death or serious harm to other persons, or would be clearly inappropriate or pointless in the circumstances of the incident.” “... Governments and law-enforcement agencies shall ensure that an effective review process is available and that independent administrative or prosecutorial authorities are in a position to exercise jurisdiction in appropriate circumstances.

65,001-57534,ENG,BEL,CHAMBER,1979,CASE OF MARCKX v. BELGIUM,2,Violation of Art. 8;Violation of Art. 14+8;Violation of Art. 14+P1-1;Non-pecuniary damage - finding of violation sufficient,,"8. Alexandra Marckx was born on 16 October 1973 at Wilrijk, near Antwerp; she is the daughter of Paula Marckx, a Belgian national, who is unmarried and a journalist by profession. Paula Marckx duly reported Alexandra’s birth to the Wilrijk registration officer who informed the District Judge (juge de paix) as is required by Article 57 bis of the Belgian Civil Code (""the Civil Code"") in the case of ""illegitimate"" children. 9. On 26 October 1973, the District Judge of the first district of Antwerp summoned Paula Marckx to appear before him (Article 405) so as to obtain from her the information required to make arrangements for Alexandra’s guardianship; at the same time, he informed her of the methods available for recognising her daughter and of the consequences in law of any such recognition (see paragraph 14 below). He also drew her attention to certain provisions of the Civil Code, including Article 756 which concerns ""exceptional"" forms of inheritance (successions ""irrégulières""). 10. On 29 October 1973, Paula Marckx recognised her child in accordance with Article 334 of the Code. She thereby automatically became Alexandra’s guardian (Article 396 bis); the family council, on which the sister and certain other relatives of Paula Marckx sat under the chairmanship of the District Judge, was empowered to take in Alexandra’s interests various measures provided for by law. 11. On 30 October 1974, Paula Marckx adopted her daughter pursuant to Article 349 of the Civil Code. The procedure, which was that laid down by Articles 350 to 356, entailed certain enquiries and involved some expenses. It concluded on 18 April 1975 with a judgment confirming the adoption, the effect whereof was retroactive to the date of the instrument of adoption, namely 30 October 1974. 12. At the time of her application to the Commission, Ms. Paula Marckx’s family included, besides Alexandra, her own mother, Mrs. Victorine Libot, who died in August 1974, and a sister, Mrs. Blanche Marckx. 13. The applicants complain of the Civil Code provisions on the manner of establishing the maternal affiliation of an ""illegitimate"" child and on the effects of establishing such affiliation as regards both the extent of the child’s family relationships and the patrimonial rights of the child and of his mother. The applicants also put in issue the necessity for the mother to adopt the child if she wishes to increase his rights. 14. Under Belgian law, no legal bond between an unmarried mother and her child results from the mere fact of birth: whilst the birth certificate recorded at the registry office suffices to prove the maternal affiliation of a married woman’s children (Article 319 of the Civil Code), the maternal affiliation of an ""illegitimate"" child is established by means either of a voluntary recognition by the mother or of legal proceedings taken for the purpose (action en recherche de maternité). Nevertheless, an unrecognised ""illegitimate"" child bears his mother’s name which must appear on the birth certificate (Article 57). The appointment of his guardian is a matter for the family council which is presided over by the District Judge. Under Article 334, recognition, ""if not inserted in the birth certificate, shall be effected by a formal deed"". Recognition is declaratory and not attributive: it does not create but records the child’s status and is retroactive to the date of birth. However, it does not necessarily follow that the person effecting recognition is actually the child’s mother; on the contrary, any interested party may claim that the recognition does not correspond to the truth (Article 339). Many unmarried mothers - about 25 % according to the Government, although the applicants consider this an exaggerated figure - do not recognise their child. Proceedings to establish maternal affiliation (action en recherche de maternité) may be instituted by the child within five years from his attainment of majority or, whilst he is still a minor, by his legal representative with the consent of the family council (Articles 341a-341c of the Civil Code). 15. The establishment of the maternal affiliation of an ""illegitimate"" child has limited effects as regards both the extent of his family relationships and the rights of the child and his mother in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions. 16. In the context of the maternal affiliation of an ""illegitimate"" child, Belgian legislation does not employ the concepts of ""family"" and ""relative"". Even once such affiliation has been established, it in principle creates a legal bond with the mother alone. The child does not become a member of his mother’s family. The law excludes it from that family as regards inheritance rights on intestacy (see paragraph 17 below). Furthermore, if the child’s parents are dead or under an incapacity, he cannot marry, before attaining the age of twenty-one, without consent which has to be given by his guardian (Article 159 of the Civil Code) and not, as is the case for a ""legitimate"" child, by his grandparents (Article 150); the law does not expressly create any maintenance obligations, etc., between the child and his grandparents. However, certain texts make provision for exceptions, for example as regards the impediments to marriage (Articles 161 and 162). According to a judgment of 22 September 1966 of the Belgian Court of Cassation (Pasicrisie I, 1967, pp 78-79), these texts ""place the bonds existing between an illegitimate child and his grandparents on a legal footing based on the affection, respect and devotion that are the consequence of consanguinity ... (which) creates an obligation for the ascendants to take an interest in their descendants and, as a corollary, gives them the right, whenever this is not excluded by the law, to know and protect them and exercise over them the influence dictated by affection and devotion"". The Court of Cassation deduced from this that grandparents were entitled to a right of access to the child. 17. A recognised ""illegitimate"" child’s rights of inheritance on intestacy are less than those of a ""legitimate"" child. As appears from Articles 338, 724, 756 to 758, 760, 761, 769 to 773 and 913 of the Civil Code, a recognised ""illegitimate"" child does not have, in the estate of his parent who dies intestate, the status of heir but solely that of ""exceptional heir"" (""successeur irrégulier""): he has to seek a court order putting him in possession of the estate (envoi en possession). He is the sole beneficiary of his deceased mother’s estate only if she leaves no relatives entitled to inherit (Article 758); otherwise, its maximum entitlement - which arises when his mother leaves no descendants, ascendants, brothers or sisters – is three-quarters of the share which he would have taken if ""legitimate"" (Article 757). Furthermore, his mother may, during her lifetime, reduce that entitlement by one-half. Finally, Article 756 denies to the ""illegitimate"" child any rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother’s relatives. 18. Recognised ""illegitimate"" children are also at a disadvantage as regards voluntary dispositions, since Article 908 provides that they ""may receive by disposition inter vivos or by will no more than their entitlement under the title ‘Inheritance on Intestacy’"". Conversely, the mother of such a child, unless she has no relatives entitled to inherit, may give in her lifetime or bequeath to him only part of her property. On the other hand, if the child’s affiliation has not been established, the mother may so give or bequeath to him the whole of her property, provided that there are no heirs entitled to a reserved portion of her estate (héritiers réservataires). The mother is thus faced with the following alternative: either she recognises the child and loses the possibility of leaving all her estate to him; or she renounces establishing with him a family relationship in the eyes of the law, in order to retain the possibility of leaving all her estate to him just as she might to a stranger. 19. If the mother of a recognised ""illegitimate"" child remains unmarried, she has but one means of improving his status, namely, ""simple"" adoption. In such cases, the age requirements for this form of adoption are eased by Article 345 para. 2, sub-paragraph 2, of the Civil Code. The adopted child acquires over the adopter’s estate the rights of a ""legitimate"" child but, unlike the latter, has no rights on intestacy in the estates of his mother’s relatives (Article 365). Only legitimation (Articles 331-333) and legitimation by adoption (Articles 368-370) place an ""illegitimate"" child on exactly the same footing as a ""legitimate"" child; both of these measures presuppose the mother’s marriage. 20. Belgium has signed, but not yet ratified, the Brussels Convention of 12 September 1962 on the Establishment of Maternal Affiliation of Natural Children, which was prepared by the International Commission on Civil Status and entered into force on 23 April 1964. Neither has Belgium yet ratified, nor even signed, the Convention of 15 October 1975 on the Legal Status of Children born out of Wedlock, which was concluded within the Council of Europe and entered into force on 11 August 1978. Both of these instruments are based on the principle ""mater semper certa est""; the second of them also regulates such questions as maintenance obligations, parental authority and rights of succession. 21. However, the Belgian Government submitted to the Senate on 15 February 1978 a Bill to which they referred the Court in their memorial of 3 July 1978 and subsequently at the hearings on 24 October. The official statement of reasons accompanying the Bill, which mentions, inter alia, the Conventions of 1962 and 1975 cited above, states that the Bill ""seeks to institute equality in law between all children"". In particular, maternal affiliation would be established on the mother’s name being entered on the birth certificate, which would introduce into Belgian law the principle ""mater semper certa est"". Recognition by an unmarried mother would accordingly no longer be necessary, unless there were no such entry. Furthermore, the Civil Code would confer on children born out of wedlock rights identical to those presently enjoyed by children born in wedlock in the matter of inheritance on intestacy and voluntary dispositions.","['14', '8', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1952, 1960, 1962 and 1934 respectively and live in Bursa. 4. In 2004 the General Directorate of Highways seized a plot of land belonging to the applicants without any formal expropriation, for the construction of a highway. The applicants brought an action before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain compensation for the de facto expropriation of their property. They requested 5,500 Turkish liras (TRY) as compensation from the court and reserved their right to increase this claim in due course. 5. On 22 June 2006 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 5,500 as compensation for the de facto expropriation of their land, as requested, plus interest. The applicants initiated execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain that amount (file no. 2009/2802). 6. On 13 March 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. 7. The applicants subsequently brought an additional action (“ek dava”) before the Karacabey Civil Court to obtain further compensation for their land in the light of the expert report obtained during the previous proceedings, which had valued the land at a rate higher than that initially requested by them. 8. On 24 May 2007 the Karacabey Civil Court awarded the applicants TRY 126,725, plus interest. The applicants initiated another set of execution proceedings before the Bursa Execution Office to obtain the amount awarded (file no. 2007/6192). 9. On 16 October 2007 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Karacabey Civil Court. 10. On 23 March and 13 November 2009 the administration paid TRY 8,821 and 187,447 respectively to the files before the Bursa Execution Office. 11. According to the information provided by the applicants, there has been no outstanding debt in the execution files.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

DENMARK,3,Violation of Art. 5-1;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses (Convention proceedings) - claim dismissed,Christos Rozakis,"7. On 11 August 1995 on a public bus in the city of Århus the applicant, born in 1928, had a dispute with a ticket inspector, who accused her of having travelled without a valid ticket. When he was about to issue a penalty fare she refused to disclose her identity and the police were consequently called. They requested that the applicant give her name and address, and since she refused, she was arrested at 9.30 p.m. in accordance with section 755, subsection 1, cf. section 750 of the Administration of Justice Act (Retsplejeloven) and brought to the police station. 8. From the police reports it appears that the police estimated that the applicant was approximately sixty years old. Having been deprived of her personal belongings, she was put in a waiting room at 9.45 p.m. and after a visit to the toilet at 11.00 p.m. she was moved to a detention cell. On 12 August 1995 at 10.45 a.m. the applicant revealed her identity and she was released at 11.00 a.m. 9. Immediately after her release, the applicant collapsed and was hospitalised for three days diagnosed with high blood pressure. 10. The charge with the offence of refusing to reveal her identity was not followed up by an indictment. The outcome of the applicant's dispute with the bus company is unknown. 11. On 16 August 1995 the applicant complained about the detention to the Chief Constable of Århus (Politimesteren i Århus). In a letter of 14 September 1995 the Chief Constable provided his comments on the course of event, stating inter alia that the applicant had not been in possession of any papers which could have revealed her identity, that she appeared hysterical and refused to reveal her identity and that in the light thereof for security reasons she was placed in a detention cell. Furthermore, the Chief Constable noted that during the detention the applicant was regularly attended to and called upon through the intercommunication system but that each approach was met with screaming and continuing refusal to reveal her identity, 12. On 14 June 1996 the applicant claimed compensation for having been detained. The Chief Constable decided on the matter on 18 July 1996, and in so far as relevant his letter of the same day to the applicant reads as follows: “In connection with your previous complaint ... you received a ... letter of 14 September 1995 from Chief Superintendent HJH. [My] reply to your complaint... will not differ essentially from the content of [that letter]. However, in view of your relatively advanced age I find reason to regret that you were not, as promised, attended to by a doctor in connection with your stay in the detention cell. In general, I find the fact that you were taken to the police station, that you were placed in the detention cell, and that the length of your stay in the detention cell from 11.00 p.m. until your release the following day at 11.00 a.m., totalling 12 hours can be ascribed substantially to your conduct and unwillingness to assist in replying to the question on which the police needed clarification. This decision can be appealed against to the Ministry of Justice... The claim for compensation made by you as regards the deprivation of liberty will be decided by the Regional State Prosecutor, who has received a copy of this letter”. 13. The applicant did not appeal to the Ministry of Justice against the Chief Constable's decision, but on 31 July 1996 she complained against the decision to the Regional State Prosecutor in Viborg (Statsadvokaten i Viborg), who refused to grant her compensation on 6 February 1997. 14. In accordance with section 1018 e of the Administration of Justice Act on 5 and 12 March 1997 the applicant appealed to the Prosecutor General, who upheld the decision on 25 November 1997. 15. Thereafter, pursuant to section 1018 a of the Administration of Justice Act the applicant brought her claim for compensation before the City Court of Århus (Retten i Århus). The prosecution maintained that the applicant's behaviour necessitated the arrest and the length of the detention. A court session was held on 26 June 1998, in which the applicant, represented by counsel, explained inter alia that she had refused to give her name to the ticket inspector partly because she was angry, partly because he already knew her. She alleged that the police did not question her or talk to her during the arrest, during the transportation to the police station, or after the arrival to the station. She had handed over various belongings among those, she believed, various letters from public authorities bearing her name. Four police officers were heard as witnesses on 17 September 1998. The two police officers who made the arrest explained inter alia that the applicant twice had refused to give her name and address on their request, once after they had warned her that she would be arrested did she not state the data required. It had been difficult to get in touch with the applicant, who screamed and appeared hysterical. At the police station she was brought before the officer on duty and again she refused to reveal her identity. She had not been in possession of any identification. The officer who had been on duty on 11 August 1995 explained among other things that after repeated attempts to obtain the applicant's name and date of birth, he gave up and the applicant was thereafter placed in a waiting room, whereto he went at least once without success to ask her to disclose her personal data before he was off duty at 11 p.m. The officer who had been on duty on 12 August 1995 as from 6.30 a.m. stated inter alia that several times during the morning he send a colleague down to try to get the requested data from the applicant, but they only succeeded around 10.45 a.m., whereupon she was released. A note of 9 July 1996 from the Chief of Police in Århus was submitted, of which it appeared that the applicant's case had been thoroughly talked over with the group of duty officers. It had been discussed in particular that the applicant had not been attended to by a doctor in connection with her placement in the detention cell, that she had been detained for many hours, and that no documentation existed to substantiate which steps had been taken during the evening, the night and the early morning hours in order to gain knowledge of the applicant's identity. The duty officers were ordered, in the future, to appoint at the commencement of every duty period one among them to be responsible for the detainees. 16. By judgment of 25 September 1998 the City Court decided as follows: “As the [applicant] did not disclose her name and address to the two [named] police officers, she infringed section 750 of the Administration of Justice Act, which authorises the imposition of a fine. Thus, pursuant to section 755, subsection 1 of the Administration of Justice Act the [applicant] could be arrested. Also, when brought to the police station immediately after the arrest [the applicant] refused to reveal her name and address and consequently, she was put in a waiting room. It is unknown, which efforts were taken to identify [the applicant] in the period between 11.00 p.m. and 06.30 a.m. during which, the sixty-seven year old [applicant] was placed in the detention cell at least for some time, and during which according to the information available she was denied medical treatment. Having regard to the fact that [the applicant] was detained for breaching section 750 of the Administration of Justice Act, the police officers on duty were under an obligation continuously to make attempts to establish her identity, and to secure that the detention did not exceed a period proportionate to the cause of the detention cf. the principles set out in section 760, subsection 1 and section 755, subsection 4 of the Administration of Justice Act. Under these circumstances, the court finds that there was no reason to extend the detention until the following day 11.00 a.m. Accordingly, [the applicant] is entitled to compensation in the amount of DKK 2,200 pursuant to section 1018 a, subsection 1 of the Administration of Justice Act.” 17. The prosecution appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret), before which the applicant amended slightly her statement given before the City Court in that she admitted that the police had asked her before and after the arrest to provide them with her personal data, but that she had refused because she had been angry. Two of the police officers who were heard as witnesses before the City Court repeated their testimonies. 18. On 11 February 1999 the High Court gave judgment against the applicant stating as follows: “Having breached section 750 of the Administration of Justice Act [the applicant] could be arrested pursuant to section 755, subsection 1 of the Administration of Justice Act. During the arrest, and the subsequent detention [the applicant] was requested continuously to reveal her name and address, which she refused. Furthermore, she did not possess any identity papers, which could have enabled the police to determine her name and address. Finally, [the applicant] was released as soon as she revealed her name and address. Under these circumstances, there is no basis for granting [the applicant] compensation pursuant to section 1018 a, subsection 1 of the administration of Justice Act. Moreover, as no circumstances has been established, which could provide a basis for granting compensation pursuant to section 1018 a, subsection 2, [the court finds for the prosecution.]” 19. The applicant's request of 24 February 1999 for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret) was refused by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) on 25 May 1999. 20. The relevant provisions of the Administration of Justice Act reads as follows: Section 101, subsection 2: “The Regional State Prosecutors shall supervise the Chief Constables' conduct as to criminal trials, and hear appeals against decisions made by the Chief Constables as to instigation of criminal proceedings. Decisions by the Regional State Prosecutors cannot be appealed against to the Prosecutor General or to the Ministry of Justice... “ Section 109, subsection 1: “The Minister of Justice is the chief superior of the police and exercises his powers through the National Commissioner of Police, the Commissioner of the Copenhagen Police and the Chief Constables” Section 750: “... Every person has a duty to disclose his name, address and date of birth to the police upon request. Failure to do so is punishable with a fine.” Section 755: 1. “The police may arrest any person who is reasonably suspected of a criminal offence subject to public prosecution, if arrest must be deemed necessary to prevent further criminal offences, to secure the person's presence for the time being or to prevent his association with others. ... 4. “No arrest may be made if, in the nature of the case or the circumstances in general, deprivation of liberty would be a disproportionate measure.” Section 758 1. “An arrest must be carried out as leniently as the circumstances permit. In compliance with section 792 e, the police may search and examine the person affected and his clothes with a view to depriving him of belongings which can be used for violent behaviour or for his absconding, or which may cause danger to the person affected or to others. The police may temporarily seize such belongings and money that are found in the person's possession. Otherwise, during an arrest the person affected is not subject to any limitations of his personal liberty other than those necessitated for the purpose of the arrest and for the prevention of disorder. 2. The police shall as soon as possible inform the person being arrested of the charge against him and the time of his arrest. It must appear from the police report that this rule have been observed” Section 760, subsection 1: “Any person who is arrested must be released as soon as the basis for the arrest ceases to exists.” Section 1018 a: “1. Any person who has been arrested or held in custody as part of a criminal prosecution is entitled to compensation for the damage suffered thereby if the charges are withdrawn or the accused is acquitted ... 2. Even if the conditions for granting compensation under subsection 1 are not satisfied, compensation may be granted if the deprivation of liberty cannot be considered proportionate to the outcome of the prosecution, or if it is found unreasonable for other particular grounds. 3. The compensation may be reduced or refused, if the person charged has given rise to the measures himself.”",['5'],['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1938 and lives in Moscow. He is a lawyer and President of the Moscow City Bar. 6. On 25 October 2003 Mr Khodorkovskiy, a co-owner of the Yukos company, was charged with criminal offences and placed in custody. On 27 October 2003 he was transferred to special-purpose remand centre IZ99/1 in Moscow operating under the authority of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation (hereinafter “the remand centre”). 7. On 30 October 2003 a lawyer, Ms A., accepted to represent Mr Khodorkovskiy in the criminal proceedings. 8. On 11 November 2003 Ms A. visited her client in the remand centre. On leaving the centre, she was stopped by a prison inspector, Mr B., who accused her of carrying unauthorised material that Mr Khodorkovskiy had given her. 9. It appears from a personal inspection report (протокол личного досмотра) of the same date that Mr B. “examined the belongings and clothing of the lawyer, Ms A.” and seized two documents: a printed document concerning the case against Mr Khodorkovskiy’s co-defendant, and a torn handwritten note. The report was signed by Mr B., Ms A. and two prison officers who were present during the search. The parties agreed that one of them had been a man (Mr F.); the identity and sex of the second officer was in dispute: the Government claimed that it had been a woman, “L-va”; the applicant insisted that it had been a man, “L-vich”. 10. The investigators claimed that the note had contained instructions about exercising influence on witnesses and interfering with the investigation. On 22 December 2003 the Ministry of Justice asked the Moscow City Bar to disbar Ms A. for acting in breach of the law and the lawyers’ code of ethics. The applicant, as President of the Moscow City Bar, publicly criticised the request by the Ministry of Justice. 11. On 25 December 2003 the NTV channel invited the applicant and Mr Buksman, the Director of the Moscow Department of the Ministry of Justice, to the talk show, “The Country and the World” («Страна и мир»), for a discussion of the incident involving Ms A. The debate was broadcast live at about 10 p.m. 12. In the first few minutes of the discussion the applicant asked Mr Buksman about his view on the events and the grounds for making the request for disbarment. Mr Buksman did not give specific answers, stating that the issue was not within his competence. 13. The presenter then asked the applicant about the relationship between the Moscow City Bar and the Ministry of Justice, implying that it was rather strained. The applicant denied that any tension existed and added: “I have to say that we have now examined the matter of lawyer A. There was no attempt to pass any note from Mr Khodorkovskiy outside the remand centre. There were no grounds for carrying out a search (обыск) which, by the way, was performed by men who rummaged (шарили) about the body of the woman lawyer. Evidence obtained by criminal or unlawful means has no legal value. There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in Ms A.’s records that could warrant her disbarment.” 14. The presenter then gave the floor to Mr Buksman, who said that there existed a normal professional relationship between the Moscow City Bar and the Ministry of Justice. The show ended. 15. On 8 January 2004, remand prison IZ-99/1 and warders Mr B. and Mr F. lodged defamation claims against the applicant and the NTV television company with the Cheremushkinskiy District Court of Moscow. They claimed that the applicant had falsely stated that male officers had “rummaged” about Ms A.’s body and carried out a “search” on her, whereas they had merely “inspected” her documents. Since the domestic law made a distinction between a “search” (обыск) and an “inspection” (досмотр), the applicant’s statement amounted to an allegation of a breach of the Russian law that was false and damaging both to the professional reputation of the remand prison and to the honour and dignity of its officers. They sought a rectification and compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 16. In the defamation proceedings the District Court heard many witnesses and, in particular, the warders of the remand prison who had taken part in the incident involving counsel A. One of them, Mr L-vich, testified as follows: “I received a phone call and I was invited to take part in the drafting of a report. When I arrived, Ms A., Mr B. and Mr F. were in the office. B. was drafting the report. A. snatched a piece of paper and began tearing it apart. We removed the document [from her], I signed the report and left.” 17. Ms A. described the way in which the documents had been removed from her: “I was subjected to a humiliating procedure, as a woman and as a lawyer. They took the materials of the defence away from me by force. How is it possible to take the materials, without touching me, while I was holding onto them? ... Could there be any contact, other than bodily contact, if I was clutching the materials to my chest and the prison employees were tearing them away from me? It was not just my hands that they touched. [They touched] the clothing that was covering my body.” 18. In the meantime, on 3 February 2004 the Council of the Moscow City Bar formally rejected the Ministry’s request for Ms A.’s disbarment. It found, in particular, that the inspection (досмотр) carried out on the person of Ms A. on 11 November 2003 and the seizure of her materials had been unlawful. 19. On 10 June 2004 the District Court gave judgment on the defamation claim, finding as follows: “It was established at the court hearing that on 25 December 2003 a televised discussion between ... Mr Buksman and the lawyer Mr Reznik had been broadcast live on the NTV channel. The presenters did not edit the text of the interventions by Mr Buksman or Mr Reznik ... Mr Buksman was connected with the presenter via a direct link, the defendant Mr Reznik was present in the studio. It can be seen from a video recording which the court examined ... that Mr Buksman and the defendant made statements of a controversial nature. The participants put questions to each other and replied to questions from the presenters. ... The court considers that the statements by the defendant [Mr Reznik] were simply an expression of his opinion on an event that had attracted public attention and was widely discussed at the time. During the show “The Country and the World” on 25 December 2003, a public official and a lawyer held a discussion in which they expressed different opinions on the same event. The statements by the defendant Mr Reznik were not offensive and did not damage the plaintiffs’ honour, dignity or professional reputation. The defendant, in his reply to the presenter’s question, did not mention either remand prison no. 1 or the plaintiffs F. and B. ... The plaintiff – remand prison no. 1 – alleged a violation of the rights of individuals rather than those of prison no. 1. ... In the instant case, the statements by the defendant, Mr Reznik, did not contain allegations about the plaintiff, remand prison no. 1, nor did Mr Reznik’s statements damage its reputation. It follows that the claims by remand prison no. 1 are unlawful and unjustified because the plaintiff seeks the rectification of allegations concerning its employees. The claims by the plaintiffs F. and B. are likewise unjustified because the statements by the defendant did not mention any names, still less the plaintiff’s names. Moreover, ... there was no mention of their place of work or place of residence, or of their appearance or characteristic features, their rank or their position; the discussion was not accompanied by any photographs or video footage of the plaintiffs; nor were their voices broadcast. It follows that the defendant’s statements did not contain any information damaging to the honour or dignity of Mr F. or Mr B. [The court rejects as] unfounded the arguments by remand prison no. 1 to the effect that the discussion was preceded by footage showing a building with its postal address, which could have enabled television viewers to recognise Matrosskaya Tishina remand prison no. 1. Neither Mr Buksman nor Mr Reznik mentioned remand prison no. 1 in their replies. Moreover, it was the NTV channel that decided to broadcast the footage featuring the building with its address at the beginning of the show, but the plaintiffs have lodged no defamation claim against the channel ... Having regard to the above-stated, the court finds that the claims are unjustified and must be rejected.” 20. The remand centre, Mr B., and Mr F., all lodged statements of appeal. 21. On 10 August 2004 the Moscow City Court quashed the District Court’s judgment and granted the defamation claims by all three plaintiffs, finding as follows: “... the conclusion of the [district] court to the effect that the statements made by the defendant in a live television show did not damage the reputation [of the plaintiffs] is not correct. The statements did damage the honour and dignity of the prison officers F. and B. and the professional reputation of remand prison no. 1 because they actually contained an accusation that the male prison officers had searched the female lawyer in a degrading manner. ... It can be seen from the statements by the witnesses Mr L-vich and Mr T., the personal inspection report, and the conclusions of the Qualifications Panel of the Moscow City Bar that the prison officers did not carry out a search on Ms A., contrary to what Mr Reznik alleged, but the [district] court did not take this fact into account ... The law distinguishes between the terms ‘inspection’ and ‘search’, and the defendant Mr Rezink, a professional lawyer, could not have been unaware of that distinction. Although he had at his disposal reliable information that the prison officers had carried out an inspection of Ms A.’s documents rather than searched her, he made untrue statements in a live television show ... Further, the [city] court cannot agree with the [district] court’s conclusion that the defendant [Mr Reznik] did not identify any of the plaintiffs by name ... That conclusion contradicted the operative part of the judgment, in which the [district] court found that the incident ... had taken place on the premises of remand prison no. 1 and concerned the removal of a note from Ms A. ... The NTV channel showed the building at 18 Matrosskaya Tishina Street, and the defendant Mr Reznik later made the contested statements. In those circumstances, the professional reputation of remand prison no. 1 had been undermined and it had standing to seek judicial protection from defamation. The plaintiffs F. and B., who were employees of the remand prison and who had taken part in the inspection of [Ms A.’s] papers ... also had standing to sue in defamation.” 22. The City Court ordered the applicant to pay 20 Russian roubles (RUB) to each of Mr B. and Mr F. in respect of compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The NTV channel was ordered to broadcast a rectification. 23. Article 29 guarantees freedom of thought and expression, together with freedom of the mass media. 24. Article 152 provides that an individual may apply to a court with a request for the rectification of statements that are damaging to his or her honour, dignity or professional reputation if the person who disseminated such statements does not prove their truthfulness. The aggrieved person may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of the dissemination of such statements. 25. A personal inspection (личный досмотр) or an inspection of personal belongings may be carried out with a view to uncovering instruments or objects of an administrative offence (Article 27.7 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offices). Personal inspections must be carried out by a person of the same sex, in the presence of two attesting witnesses (понятые) of the same sex (Article 27.7 § 3). 26. A suspect in a criminal case may be subjected to a body search (личный обыск) (Article 93 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). Body searches must be carried out by a person of the same sex, in the presence of attesting witnesses (понятые) or specialists of the same sex (Article 184 § 3). 27. The Pre-Trial Detention Act (Law no. 103-FZ of 15 July 1995) established that, if there were grounds to suspect visitors of passing prohibited objects, substances or food, prison officers were entitled to carry out an inspection of their clothes and belongings upon their entry or exit from the prison premises (part 6 of section 34).",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1
69,001-59470,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,2001,CASE OF BAUMANN v. FRANCE,1,Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion);Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine P1-1;Violation of P4-2,Nicolas Bratza,"8. On 27 November 1993 Strasbourg police officers spotted an occupied vehicle parked in a car park. It turned out that the vehicle had been stolen the previous day in Strasbourg. The investigators proceeded to arrest O.H., who had come to take delivery of the stolen vehicle, and S.B, who had handled it. The on-the-spot investigation established that other transactions had taken place and that the two arrested men used to meet in a hotel in Brumath (Bas-Rhin). The police officers went to the hotel where they arrested O.H.'s wife and Miss C.E while the latter was about to get into a vehicle belonging to the applicant. 9. When questioned at the hotel C.E. stated that her boyfriend, the applicant, had been staying at the hotel for some time, but had been taken into hospital in Germany on 26 November 1993 because his health had given cause for alarm. 10. Their hotel room was searched. The investigators seized a German passport in the applicant's name, 7,700 German marks (DEM) and 2,150 French francs (FRF) found in C.E.'s handbag, bank documents, a vehicle registration certificate and various hand-written documents. Those items were sealed and deposited at the consignment of exhibits department at the Strasbourg tribunal de grande instance. 11. After her release from police custody no court proceedings were brought against C.E. None were brought against the applicant either. 12. On 30 November 1993 O.H. and S.B were charged by an investigating judge of the Strasbourg tribunal de grande instance. 13. The applicant's lawyer lodged an application under Article 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 6 December 1993, registered at the investigating judge's office on 8 December 1993, requesting the investigating judge to return the money and other seized items, including the passport. He received no reply from the investigating judge. 14. On 5 January 1994 the applicant was arrested by the criminal police of Pirmasens (Germany) and convicted by a criminal court in Landau. Since then he has since been imprisoned in Zweibrücken Prison, where he is due to remain until 4 March 2006. 15. O.H. and S.B. were committed for trial at the Strasbourg Criminal Court where they were tried and convicted on 13 June 1994 without the applicant or his girlfriend having been informed. The applicant could not therefore lodge an application for the return of his possessions with the criminal court trying the case. 16. On 14 September 1994 the applicant's lawyer renewed his request to the investigating judge of 6 December 1993. He received no reply. 17. On 28 October 1994 the applicant's lawyer lodged an application with the public prosecutor under Article 41-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the return of the DEM 7,700, the bank statements and a rechargeable mobile-telephone battery. 18. On 7 November 1994 the public prosecutor refused his application on the ground that the items had been confiscated by order of the Criminal Court in its judgment of 13 June 1994 in the proceedings against O.H. and S.B. In his reply the public prosecutor referred to the application lodged with the investigating judge on 6 December 1993 and renewed on 14 September 1994. 19. On 6 January 1995 the applicant's lawyer lodged an application with the Sixth Criminal Division of the Strasbourg tribunal de grande instance under Article 710 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the return of the seized items. The application, which just bore the stamp of the Strasbourg public prosecutor's office, dated 6 January 1995, concerned the applicant's passport, the DEM 7,700, the bank statements and the rechargeable mobile-telephone battery. 20. On 6 February 1995 the public prosecutor replied to that application as follows: “Despite my letter of 7 November 1994 advising you that nothing could be returned to Mr Baumann on any grounds whatsoever because the court had ordered confiscation of the sealed items, you persist in wishing to obtain a hearing in connection with the sealed items in question. I regret to have to repeat myself in pointing out that the judgment dated 9 May 1994 has become res judicata and that Article 710 of the Code of Criminal Procedure does not provide for the reopening of proceedings terminated by a confiscation decision which has become final. Article 710 of the Code of Criminal Procedure is reserved for interlocutory applications relating to the execution of a decision and not disputes about the penalties imposed. The court in question did not have any power to reconsider a measure which had become res judicata. ...” 21. In a letter of 12 February 1996 C.E. requested the public prosecutor to return the seized DEM 7,700 and FRF 2,150 on the ground that the money belonged to her and that she was not in any way involved in the criminal proceedings. In a letter of 29 April 1996 she renewed her request, stating among other things: “my ex-boyfriend has put me in a difficult position which has seriously changed my life ... I have incurred debts because of him ... it is very important for me to recover my money...” 22. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide: ... “Where the nature of the crime is such that it can be proved by seizing papers, documents or other objects in the possession of persons who appear to have participated in the crime or to hold documents or objects relating to the offence, a senior police officer shall immediately go to their place of residence where he shall search the premises and draw up a search report. He alone, together with the persons listed in Article 57 and those to whom he may refer under Article 60, shall have power to examine papers or documents before seizing them. However, he must first take all measures necessary to ensure that professional confidentiality and the rights of the defence are respected. An inventory shall be made immediately of all seized objects and documents which shall then be placed under seal. Where an on-the-spot inventory presents difficulties, the items shall be provisionally sealed until an inventory of them can be made and they can be definitively sealed, which shall be done in the presence of the persons present during the search in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article 57. With the agreement of the public prosecutor, the senior police officer shall retain only those objects and documents necessary for establishing the truth.” ...",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1967, 1959 and 1970, respectively. All three live in Kyiv. 5. On 26 June 1996 criminal proceedings against the applicants were instituted. 6. On 31 June 1996 A.D. was arrested on suspicion of fraud and theft. On 16 August 1996 V.S. and, on 19 August 1996 A.A., were arrested on similar charges. The prosecution’s case was that the applicants had fraudulently (using false documents) converted and subsequently sold an apartment belonging to Mr K. 7. During the investigation the prosecution authorities obtained several economic expert opinions regarding the suspect transaction. 8. On 3 March 1997 the Kyiv City Prosecutor approved the indictment and referred the case to the Kyiv City Court, requesting it to determine the territorial jurisdiction in the case. On 5 March 1997 the Kyiv City Court (hereafter “City Court”) remitted the case to the Shevchenkovsky District Court of Kyiv (hereafter “the District Court”). The applicants stood trial on charges of theft, fraud, and embezzlement of official documents (A.D.), fraud and forgery (V.S.) and fraud and theft (A.A.). 9. On 2 April 1997 the District Court committed the applicants for trial. 10. On 3 April 1997 the District Court released A.A. and V.S. on bail of UAH 3,000 each (approximately USD 1,500 at the material time) and an undertaking not to abscond. On 19 May 1997 A.D. was also released on bail of UAH 4,000 (approximately USD 2,000) and an undertaking not to abscond. On 27 May 1997 the applicants’ bail was raised to UAH 17,000 (approximately USD 8,500) each. 11. Between April 1997 and June 1998 the District Court listed 22 hearings (14 between September 1997 and June 1998). Ten hearings were adjourned mainly due to the failure of the victim, witnesses and the applicants’ lawyers to appear in court. In the course of the proceedings on 24 October 1997 the court issued a compulsory summons for the witness F. 12. On 22 June 1998 the District Court decided to remit the case for further inquiries on account of the insufficiency of the original investigation. The court stated inter alia, that the investigative authorities had failed to establish the whereabouts of one of the key witnesses, F., which made it impossible for the court to summon her to give evidence. The prosecution appealed against this decision. The decision was, apart from one point, quashed by the City Court in its ruling of 6 August 1998 because the flaws in the investigation indicated in this decision could be remedied during the trial. However, the City Court upheld the findings of the District Court that the charges of aggravated embezzlement filed against A.D. needed additional investigation. 13. The trial resumed on 2 November 1998. During the period November 1998 to April 2000 thirty hearings were scheduled, of which seven were held. Fifteen hearings were cancelled due to the victim’s failure to appear, five hearings were adjourned on account of the applicants’ absence and on two occasions the presiding judge was ill. In particular, the hearing scheduled for 12 May 2000 was adjourned until 17 May 1999 on account of V.S. being on a mission. On 15 March 2000 he lodged with the trial court a successful request for permission to go to the Russian Federation for medical treatment. 14. On 20 April 2000 the District Court remitted the case for further investigation, referring to the similar circumstances in its decision of 22 June 1998. The prosecution’s appeal out of time was rejected by the City Court on 28 September 2000. On 18 January 2001 the Kyiv City Prosecutor lodged a supervisory protest (an extraordinary appeal) against the decision 20 April 2000. On 29 January 2001 the Presidium of the City Court granted the protest and remitted the case to the first instance court for further consideration. 15. The District Court resumed the examination of the case on 4 April 2001. Between April 2001 and July 2002 the court listed 23 hearings of which 13 were adjourned due to the failure of the victim (on 9 occasions), the applicants (on 3 occasions) and the prosecutor (on one occasion) to appear. In the course of the proceedings on 24 April and 21 May 2001 the court ordered the compulsory summons of the victim. 16. On 17 July 2002 the District Court disjoined the proceedings concerning the charges of theft and embezzlement of documents (A.D. and A.A.) and remitted the case in this part for additional investigation. 17. On 19 July 2002 the District Court terminated proceedings concerning the charges of fraud (all three applicants), embezzlement of documents (A.D.) and forgery (V.S.) as time-barred, lifted the bail condition and ordered the return of the bail money. 18. According to both parties’ submissions, the criminal proceedings for (presumably) theft against A.D. and A.A. are still pending. 19. The text of Articles 148, 149 and 150 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1960 (general rules on the application of preventive measures) is set out in Merit v. Ukraine, no. 66561/01, 30 March 2004 (Relevant domestic law and practice). 20. Article 154-1 of the Code (application of bail) is set out in Koval v. Ukraine (no. 65550/01, 10 December 2002). 21. Article 281 (remittal of a case for additional investigation) is set out in the judgment of 6 September 2005 in the case of Salov v. Ukraine (see no. 65518/01, § 72). 22. Article 151 of the Code provides that an undertaking not to abscond consists in obtaining from the suspect or the accused an agreement not to leave the place of residence or temporary stay without the permission of an investigator (or a trial judge). In the event of a breach of the written undertaking given by him, a stricter measure of restraint may be applied to the suspect or accused.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Baku. 8. The applicant was an activist of the National Front, an organisation which played one of the key roles in the country's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union. In 1992, when the National Front came into power in the country, he was appointed to a number of high military posts and in 1993 he became the Commander of the Special Police Force. 9. After the National Front lost political power in 1993, on 24 May 1994 the applicant was arrested and detained on remand. Upon arrest, allegedly, he was not informed of the charges against him and was refused access to a lawyer. On 7 August 1995 the Military Chamber of the Supreme Court, acting as a court of first instance, convicted the applicant for attempted murder (ten years' imprisonment), abuse of authority at wartime (eight years), intentional abuse of authority (four years), misuse of weapons (two years), negligent approach to military service (two years) and humiliation of a subordinate person (one year and six months), and sentenced him to a total of ten years' imprisonment by merging the sentences. 10. On 26 June 1996 the same court, again sitting in first instance, convicted the applicant for “failure to use authority to resist the Armenian occupation of the town of Khojaly and prevent the subsequent mass killing of the civilians fleeing the town”. The court sentenced the applicant to fifteen years' imprisonment, merging his previous ten-year sentence into this new sentence. The imprisonment period was to be calculated from the first day of the applicant's arrest on 24 May 1994. Pursuant to the old criminal procedure law applicable at that time, both Supreme Court judgments were final and not subject to appeal. 11. At the time of Azerbaijan's admission to the Council of Europe, the applicant's name appeared in the lists of “alleged political prisoners” in Azerbaijan submitted to the experts of the Secretary General. Azerbaijan had made a commitment to either release or give a re-trial to all persons identified as “political prisoners” by these experts. However, ultimately, the applicant was not regarded as a political prisoner by the experts of the Secretary General (see Cases of alleged political prisoners in Armenia and Azerbaijan, SG/Inf (2001) 34, Addendum I, 24 October 2001, Chapter 2 (III), Case No. 10 (the applicant's name is transliterated as “Fahmin Hadjiyev” in this document)). 12. In 2000 a new Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter “CCrP”) was adopted. Before its entry into force on 1 September 2000, on 14 July 2000 Parliament passed the Law On the Adoption and Entry into Force of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan (hereinafter the “Transitional Law”), which allowed lodging an appeal under the new CCrP against final judgments delivered in accordance with the old criminal procedure. 13. On 29 January 2002 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal against the Supreme Court's judgments of 7 August 1995 and 26 June 1996. By a letter of 13 February 2002, the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that, in addition to the appellate complaint, he also had to file a petition in order to restore the appeal period. 14. According to the applicant, he filed such a petition on 7 March 2002. Having not received an answer, he appealed again on 7 June 2002 and yet again on 7 October 2002. In reply to these applications, in its identical letters of 24 October 2002 and 27 November 2002 signed by a court clerk (the Head of the Correspondence Department of the Court of Appeal), the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that his case would be examined shortly by the Court of Appeal's Chamber on Military Courts' Cases and that he would be informed of any further developments in due course. 15. However, during the following period of over a year, despite the applicant's continuous inquiries, no examination of the case took place and no information in this regard was given to the applicant. 16. Finally, more than two years after lodging his appeal, by a letter of 31 March 2004 signed by the same court clerk, the applicant was informed that: “... in accordance with Article 72.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure currently in force, the Court of Appeal may only examine criminal cases ... based on appeals or protests against first-instance courts' judgments and other decisions which have not entered into force [i.e. have not become final]... For re-consideration of the firstinstance judgments of the Supreme Court's Military Chamber of 7 August 1995 and 26 June 1996 you are advised to apply to the Supreme Court.” 17. Although, during the same period, the applicant was actively engaged in correspondence with the Supreme Court with regard to unrelated proceedings concerning the reduction of his sentence, the applicant did not file a formal appeal with the Supreme Court concerning the present case. 18. On 10 May 2004 the applicant was pardoned and released from prison pursuant to a presidential pardon decree. 19. Law of 14 July 2000 on the adoption and entry into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan (the “Transitional Law”) Article 7: “Judgments and other final decisions delivered by first-instance courts under the [old] Code of Criminal Procedure ... before the entry into force of this [new] Code, may be reconsidered by an appellate court or the Supreme Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan in accordance with Articles 383-407, 409-427 or 461-467 of the [new] Code of Criminal Procedure.” 20. Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Azerbaijan of 1 September 2000 Article 72.1 provides that the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Azerbaijan is a court of appellate instance concerning criminal cases and other matters related to criminal prosecution. Article 72.2 provides that the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Azerbaijan has a competence to examine criminal cases and other matters related to criminal prosecution based on appellate complaints or protests against judgments and other decisions of first-instance courts that have not entered into legal force. Article 73.1 provides that the Supreme Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan is a court of cassation instance concerning criminal cases and other matters related to criminal prosecution. Article 73.2 provides that the relevant chambers of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan have a competence to examine criminal cases and other matters related to criminal prosecution based on cassation complaints or protests against judgments and other decisions of the appellate courts or jury courts. Article 391.1 provides that the appellate court must hold a preliminary hearing of the case within 15 days after the receipt of an appellate complaint. The parties to the case and the state prosecutor have a right to attend this hearing. These persons must be informed in advance of the time and place of the hearing. Article 391.2 provides that, during the initial hearing, the appellate court must determine, inter alia, whether it has competence to examine the appellate complaint and whether the appellate complaint was submitted in accordance with the relevant procedural requirements. Article 391.3 provides that, upon the initial hearing, the appellate court may decide, inter alia, to leave the appellate complaint without examination, to forward the appellate complaint to a court having appropriate competence, to reinstate or refuse to reinstate the expired period for filing the appellate complaint, to appoint a judicial hearing for examination of the merits of the appellate complaint, or to refuse to admit the appellate complaint for examination.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1977 and lives in Šiauliai. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8. On 9 November 1998 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of armed robbery. While remanded in custody the applicant was held in Šiauliai Remand Prison, Šiauliai Police Detention Facility and other remand establishments. 9. On 11 November 1998 the Šiauliai City District Court authorised the applicant's remand in custody until 19 November 1998. In ordering the detention, the court referred to the nature and gravity of the charges against the applicant, and stated that “it was likely that the applicant could attempt to abscond from investigators and the trial as well as obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case”. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing. 10. On 18 November 1998 the Šiauliai City District Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 18 January 1999 due to the fear “that he would abscond”. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearing. 11. On 24 December 1998 the applicant appealed against that ruling. 12. Having received the appeal on 4 January 1999, on 7 January 1999 the Šiauliai Regional Court dismissed it, arguing that the applicant “had been charged with a serious crime and if released would obstruct the investigation and the establishment of the truth”. The applicant's counsel was present at the hearing. 13. On 15 January 1999 the Šiauliai City District Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 18 March 1999. Having briefly summed up the charges against the applicant the court stated that “the applicant had been charged with a serious crime, therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he could attempt to hide from investigators and the court, obstruct the establishment of the truth and commit fresh crimes”. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing. 14. On 18 February 1999 the applicant appealed against the order to extend his detention. On 26 February the appeal was received by the Šiauliai Regional Court, which on 2 March 1999 dismissed the applicant's appeal, his defence counsel being present. The court again stated that “the applicant had been charged with a serious crime, therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he could attempt to hide from investigators and the court and would obstruct the investigation”. 15. On 17 March 1999 the Šiauliai City District Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 9 May 1999. Listing the charges against the applicant the court stated that “the applicant had been charged with a serious crime, therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would try to abscond from the investigators, commit fresh crimes and influence witnesses”. The applicant and his lawyer were present. 16. On 7 May 1999 the Šiauliai Regional Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 9 July 1999 on the ground that “he had been charged with a serious crime, therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would commit fresh crimes and obstruct the establishment of the truth”. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing. The applicant appealed, stating, inter alia, that he had to undergo surgery. 17. The applicant's appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 25 May 1999, with his defence counsel present. The court stated that “the applicant had been charged with serious crimes, he had not confessed and his guilt was based on statements by numerous witnesses, therefore there was a reason to believe that if at liberty he would try to influence witnesses and would obstruct the establishment of the truth in this case”. 18. On 8 July 1999 the Šiauliai Regional Court extended the term of the applicant's remand in custody until 30 September 1999. The court again listed the charges against the applicant and stated that “the applicant had been charged with a serious crime. There is a reason to believe that if at liberty he would obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case and would commit fresh crimes”. The applicant and his lawyer were present at the hearing. 19. The applicant appealed, arguing that the investigation had been delayed and that the authorities had not exercised due diligence in investigating the case. The applicant also submitted that he had no criminal record and had a permanent place of residence. There was no evidence that he would try to abscond from the investigation or commit fresh crimes. 20. On 29 July 1999 the applicant's appeal against the order of 8 July 1999 was dismissed by the Court of Appeal, with the applicant's defence counsel being present. For the court, the reasons for extending the applicant's detention were that “the evidence in the case allowed the conclusion that the applicant had committed the crimes he had been charged with. Given that the applicant denied his guilt, the lower court had correctly concluded that if released the applicant would obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case that is to say he could influence witnesses, either himself or through others. He might also abscond from the investigation or commit fresh crimes”. 21. On 29 September 1999 the Šiauliai Regional Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 1 December 1999. Stating the charges against the applicant in three sentences, the court noted that “the applicant was accused of two crimes, one of which was serious. The data in the case file allowed the presumption that the applicant had committed those crimes. Given that the applicant denied his guilt, it was reasonable to believe that, if at liberty, he could obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case and influence witnesses and co-accused, either himself or though third parties. He might also hide from investigators or commit other crimes”. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing. 22. The applicant appealed, reiterating that he had a permanent place of residence and that there were no grounds to believe that he might abscond or obstruct the course of justice. The charges had already been presented to him. Moreover, notwithstanding the requirements of Article 104 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to demonstrate the need to keep a person in detention, the prosecutor had presented no such evidence to the court. As regards the applicant, the fact that he had not confessed to the crimes he had been charged with was not a reason to assume that he would commit fresh crimes or attempt to obstruct the establishment of the truth in his case. Lastly, he mentioned that he had no prior convictions and had a permanent place of residence, his parents' flat. 23. On 18 October 1999 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal, endorsing the reasons given by the lower court. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearing. 24. The Šiauliai Regional Court further extended the term of the applicant's detention by the following orders: - order of 29 November 1999: until 30 January 2000; - order of 28 January 2000: until 30 March 2000; - order of 30 March 2000: until 9 May 2000. For that court, the reasons to keep the applicant in detention were that the applicant, if released, would “attempt to obstruct the establishment of the truth in his case”, “influence witnesses”, “hide from investigators” and “commit fresh crimes”. 25. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at all the hearings at which his detention was extended. 26. On 28 August 2002 the prosecution approved the bill of indictment concerning the charges of armed robbery against the applicant and four other co-accused. The case was sent to court. 27. On an unknown date the Panevėžys District Court requested the Šiauliai Regional Prosecutor's Office to ensure that D.R. and M.S., two of the applicant's accomplices who had testified against him and had been released from criminal liability by the prosecutors, were brought before the court for questioning. On 11 April and 16 June 2003 the State Border Guard Service and the Šiauliai Police Commissariat informed the prosecutors that, according to the information they had gathered, D.R. and M.S. had left Lithuania and their place of residence was unknown. 28. On 3 November 2003 the Panevėžys District Court convicted the applicant of complicity in armed robbery (Articles 24 § 6 and 180 § 3 of the Criminal Code). The court based its conclusion, inter alia, on the evidence given by D.R. and M.S., whose statements as recorded during the pre-trial investigation were read out. The applicant was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, towards which the court counted the period from 9 November 1998 to 9 May 2000, when the applicant had been in pre-trial detention. 29. The applicant appealed, complaining that the proceedings were unreasonably long. He also alleged that the trial court should not have admitted the submissions of D.R. and M.S. in evidence, as he had not been afforded an opportunity to challenge these witnesses in open court. The applicant alleged a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. 30. Invoking Article 5 § 3 of the Convention the applicant also submitted that he had already been in pre-trial detention four years and ten months (from 9 November 1998) and argued that the detention had been extended on numerous occasions without lawful grounds. The prosecutors had joined his case to other cases and disjoined it later. During all that time he was detained, the courts would dismiss his appeals to impose another, milder remand measure. Given that on 4 September 2003 the Court of Appeal had acquitted him [in the second set of criminal proceedings] and he had been released from pre-trial detention only on that day, in its judgment of 3 November 2003 the Panevėžys District Court had wrongly assessed the time which needed to be counted towards the punishment. 31. By a ruling of 26 February 2004 the Court of Appeal ordered the Šiauliai Police Commissariat to bring D.R. and M.S. to court for questioning. However, the police informed the court that it was not possible to summon D.R. and M.S. as they had left Lithuania. Moreover, the relatives of D.R. and M.S. had moved house, therefore it was not possible to question them in order to establish where the former were living. 32. On 9 March 2004 the Court of Appeal inquired of the State Border Guard Service as to whether M.S. and D.R. had crossed the State border and whether they had returned to Lithuania. On 16 March 2004 the State Border Guard Service informed the Court of Appeal that M.S. and D.R. had left the country. 33. On 31 March 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. It noted that the trial court had based its conclusion on various pieces of evidence, namely the submissions of the applicant's co-defendant and a witness, both of whom had been questioned at the trial. In the opinion of the appellate court, D.R. and M.S. had only provided information which was also known from other sources. Having analysed those other sources at length and in depth, alone and against each other, the Court of Appeal concluded that even without the testimony of D.R. and M.S. there was sufficient proof of the applicant's guilt. Lastly, the Court of Appeal concluded that the trial court was impartial towards the applicant, given that it had substituted the charges against the applicant with a lesser charge, by convicting him as a person who had merely assisted in the commission of a crime and not as the organiser. 34. In contrast, the Court of Appeal agreed with the applicant's argument that all the time he had spent in pre-trial detention should be counted towards his sentence: “The chamber notes the not entirely correct nature of the information given in the bill of indictment, to the effect that L. Balčiūnas was arrested on 9 November 1998, remanded in custody on 11 November 1998 and the detention continued only until 9 May 2000; and that afterwards detention was imposed in another criminal case, adjudicated by the Šiauliai Regional Court. From supplementary information the Court of Appeal has received (the 1 May 2000 ruling of the Šiauliai Regional Court) it transpires that in another criminal case, in which L. Balčiūnas was convicted and acquitted (...) [paragraphs 48-50 hereinafter], new pre-trial detention has not been imposed on the applicant; it was the detention of 11 November 1998 which was being continued.” The Court of Appeal upheld the applicant's sentence of two years' imprisonment. However, the applicant was deemed to have completed the sentence in view of the time spent remanded in custody – from 9 November 1998 to 4 September 2003. 35. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal, complaining that his conviction had been based on the submissions of witnesses who had not been questioned by him or the courts. He also alleged that the Court of Appeal had not examined the issue concerning the allegedly excessive length of the proceedings and the lawfulness of his remand in custody. 36. On 12 October 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's cassation appeal. The cassation court noted that the evidence leading to the applicant's conviction had been properly handled and assessed by the lower courts. His guilt had been based to a substantial degree on the evidence given by a witness and two of his co-defendants, who had all been examined in open court. The trial court was entitled to refer to the submissions by D.R. and M.S., which had been recorded during the pre-trial investigation. The authorities had taken all the necessary measures to summon D.R. and M.S. to the hearing, but had failed to obtain their attendance in view of the fact that their place of residence was unknown. The Supreme Court acknowledged that the appellate court had not answered the applicant's allegation that the investigation and his pre-trial detention had lasted an unreasonably long time. It noted however that these circumstances did not constitute sufficient grounds to find that the Court of Appeal had failed to respect the relevant procedural requirements. Lastly, the Supreme Court noted that the Court of Appeal had rectified the trial court's mistake and correctly counted the period of pre-trial detention towards the time of the punishment. 37. On an unspecified date, another set of criminal proceedings was instituted against the applicant. In particular, it was suspected that he had been a member of a criminal organisation, and that in January 1998 he had been involved in organising two explosions in public places, causing a number of injuries to others. Five other persons were charged alongside the applicant; the charges related to events which took place in 1996-98. 38. On 19 April 2000, upon approval of the bill of indictment, the case was transmitted to the Šiauliai Regional Court. 39. On 1 May 2000 the Šiauliai Regional Court ordered the applicant's detention to be “continued” until 10 July 2000, referring to the risk that he would abscond, commit new offences and obstruct the investigation. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing. 40. The applicant appealed. However, on 18 May 2000 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, referring to the gravity of the charges against the applicant. The applicant's counsel was present at the hearing. 41. Subsequently the applicant's detention was extended by court orders of 12 June, 6 September, 9 November and 7 December 2000 and of 2 May, 4 July and 4 October 2001. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearings. The courts referred to the risk of the applicant reoffending, influencing witnesses and obstructing the investigation. All his appeals were unsuccessful. 42. On 6 February 2002 the Šiauliai Regional Court ordered the Šiauliai Regional Prosecutor's office to summon D.R. and M.S. to the hearing for questioning. 43. By the same ruling the Šiauliai Regional Court extended the term of the applicant's detention until 9 May 2002 on the ground that he might influence witnesses and commit fresh crimes. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearing. The applicant appealed, requesting a variation of the remand. He submitted, inter alia, that the lengthy stay in custody had negatively affected his health. He also alleged that the pre-trial investigation had been concluded, and that there were no grounds to believe that he might abscond from the trial or influence witnesses. 44. On 27 February 2002 the Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, endorsing the grounds indicated in the order of 6 February 2002. The court acknowledged that the applicant had been in detention “for a long time already” and observed that after the case was transferred to court, some delays had been caused by “organisational matters of the court”. Nonetheless, in the view of the Court of Appeal, the length of the applicant's detention was justified by the complexity of the case (multiple charges against several co-defendants, numerous victims and witnesses) and a voluminous case file. The case had been adjourned several times at the request of the defence to examine certain additional evidence, or due to the failure by certain witnesses or defence lawyers to appear at the hearing. The circumstances justifying the applicant's detention persisted. The applicant and his defence counsel were present at the hearing. 45. On 9 May 2002 the Šiauliai Regional Court further extended the applicant's detention until 9 August 2002 on the same grounds. The applicant's lawyer was present at the hearing. 46. The applicant appealed, requesting a variation of the remand. He argued, inter alia, that the pre-trial investigation had been terminated, most of the victims and witnesses had been questioned in court, and it remained only for the court to evaluate the evidence and pass a judgment. Thus it was not likely that the applicant would influence witnesses or obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case, given that he had not done so for three and a half years. 47. On 24 May 2002 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against the order of 9 May 2002. The court acknowledged that the applicant had been detained for a prolonged period. However, in view of the circumstances, such as the complexity and volume of the case and the number of charges against various co-defendants, the court concluded that the applicant's continuing detention was justified. The grounds for the applicant's detention thus continued to persist - it was necessary in order to guarantee that he would appear before the court, as well as to prevent the commission of new offences. 48. On 19 July 2002 the Šiauliai Regional Court convicted the applicant of being a member of a criminal organisation which possessed explosives (Article 227 § 2 of the Criminal Code), illegal possession of explosives (Article 234 § 1), attempts at aggravated murder (Articles 16 § 2, 105 §§ 2, 4, 8, 13), and destruction of property (Article 278 § 2). He was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment and fined, and his property was confiscated. 49. On 4 September 2003 the Court of Appeal acquitted the applicant. The court noted that the conviction was based to a decisive extent on the submissions of two witnesses, D.R. and M.S., who had not been examined in open court. The applicant was released in the courtroom. 50. On 2 March 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by the prosecution. 51. On an unknown date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Ombudsman, arguing that the conditions of his detention at the Šiauliai Remand Prison were inadequate. In particular, the applicant contended that the facility was overcrowded and that the cell he had been placed in was constantly damp, the mats were wet and a sanitary unit did not work properly. 52. In the report of 1 July 2003 the Ombudsman partly agreed with the applicant's complaints, noting that the Šiauliai Remand Prison suffered from overcrowding (760 persons were held there, the limit being 454) and from a shortage of properly set up sanitary units. In the report the Ombudsman also observed that: “the fact that the applicant was detained for more than four and a half years could demonstrate a significant risk that a violation of his right to a trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial, that is to say a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, would be found. It could be said that a lengthy period of detention during judicial proceedings could have a disproportionate impact on his other rights: for example, the restriction on longer visits for those in pre-trial detention, no opportunity to take exercise, and other restrictions”. 53. In the operative part of the report the Ombudsman urged the responsible authorities to resolve the problem of overcrowding and to evaluate the hygiene conditions at the Šiauliai Remand Prison. “Detention on remand shall be used only ... in cases where a statutory penalty of at least one year's imprisonment is envisaged. ... The grounds for the detention shall be specified. The grounds ... shall be the reasonable suspicion that the accused will: (1) abscond from the investigation and trial; (2) obstruct the determination of the truth in the case [influence other parties or destroy evidence]; (3) commit new offences ... whilst suspected of crimes provided in Articles ... 105 [aggravated murder], ... 227 [founding a criminal organisation], ... 278 § 2 [aggravated destruction of property] ... of the Criminal Code ... . Where there is a reasonable risk that the accused will abscond from the investigation and trial, detention on remand may be ordered, taking into account the accused's family status, permanent place of residence, employment relations, health, criminal record, relations abroad and other circumstances. ...”. “... After the case has been transmitted to the court ... [a judge] can order, vary or revoke the detention. ...” “Detention on remand cannot last longer than six months. A specific term of detention shall be fixed by the judge issuing the remand order; this term can be extended by the same judge or another judge of the same district court, but only for a period not exceeding six months. In view of the particular complexity or size of a case, a judge of a regional court may extend the maximum term specified in the first paragraph of this Article for a period not exceeding three months. The extension may be repeated, but the total length of the term at the stage of the pre-trial investigation may not exceed eighteen months ... For the purpose of extending the term of detention at the pre-trial stage ... a judge must convene a hearing to which defence counsel and the prosecutor and to which, if necessary, the detained person shall be summoned ... .” “A person remanded in custody or his defence counsel shall have the right during the pre-trial investigation or trial to lodge [with an appellate court] an appeal against detention or the extension of its term ... . A judge or appellate court must examine the appeal within seven days of its receipt. With a view to examining the appeal, a hearing may be convened, to which the arrested person and his counsel or counsel alone shall be summoned. The presence of a prosecutor is obligatory at such a hearing. The decision taken by [the appellate judge] is final and cannot be the subject of a cassation appeal ... . A further appeal shall be determined when examining the extension of the term of the detention.” “A judge, individually or a court in a directions hearing, in deciding whether to commit the accused for trial, shall determine ... (11) whether the selection of a remand measure is appropriate.” “After deciding that there is a sufficient basis to commit the accused for trial, a judge individually or a court in a directions hearing shall determine the questions ... (2) of the remand measure in respect of the accused ...” “In the course of the trial, a court may decide to order, vary or revoke a remand measure in respect of the defendant.” 60. According to Article 16 of the Law on Pre-Trial Detention (Kardomojo kalinimo įstatymas), the administration of the relevant remand institution can allow detainees visits of up to two hours with family members.",['5'],['5-3'],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],1
73,001-57603,ENG,NLD,CHAMBER,1985,CASE OF X AND Y v. THE NETHERLANDS,2,Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,C. Russo,"7. Mr. X and his daughter Y were born in 1929 and on 13 December 1961 respectively. The daughter, who is mentally handicapped, had been living since 1970 in a privately-run home for mentally handicapped children. 8. During the night of 14 to 15 December 1977, Miss Y was woken up by a certain Mr. B, the son-in-law of the directress; he lived with his wife on the premises of the institution although he was not employed there. Mr. B forced the girl to follow him to his room, to undress and to have sexual intercourse with him. This incident, which occurred on the day after Miss Y’s sixteenth birthday, had traumatic consequences for her, causing her major mental disturbance. 9. On 16 December 1977, Mr. X went to the local police station to file a complaint and to ask for criminal proceedings to be instituted. The police officer said that since Mr. X considered his daughter unable to sign the complaint because of her mental condition, he could do so himself. The statement lodged by Mr. X read as follows: ""In my capacity as father I denounce the offences committed by Mr. B on the person of my daughter. I am doing this because she cannot do so herself, since, although sixteen years of age, she is mentally and intellectually still a child."" 10. The police officer drew up a report and it was signed by Mr. X (Articles 163 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure). The officer subsequently informed the public prosecutor’s office that in the light of the father’s statement and of his own observations concerning the girl’s mental condition, she did not seem to him capable of filing a complaint herself. According to the headmaster of the school she was attending and another teacher there, she was unable to express her wishes concerning the institution of proceedings. 11. On 29 May 1978, the public prosecutor’s office provisionally decided not to open proceedings against Mr. B, provided that he did not commit a similar offence within the next two years. The official in charge of the case so informed Mr. X at a meeting on 27 September 1978. 12. On 4 December 1978, Mr. X appealed against the decision of the public prosecutor’s office to the Arnhem Court of Appeal, under Article 12 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; he requested the court to direct that criminal proceedings be instituted. In a supplementary memorial of 10 January 1979, he pointed out that subject to an exhaustive list of exceptions none of which applied in the instant case, a legal representative was entitled to act on behalf of the complainant. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on 12 July 1979. In fact, it considered it doubtful whether a charge of rape (Article 242 of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 14 below) could be proved. As for Article 248 ter (see paragraph 16 below), it would have been applicable in the instant case, but only if the victim herself had taken action. In the Court of Appeal’s view, the father’s complaint (Article 64 para. 1 of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 16 below) could not be regarded as a substitute for the complaint which the girl, being over the age of sixteen, should have lodged herself, although the police had regarded her as incapable of doing so; since in the instant case no one was legally empowered to file a complaint, there was on this point a gap in the law, but it could not be filled by means of a broad interpretation to the detriment of Mr. B. 13. By virtue of Article 445 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there was no possibility of appealing on a point of law to the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) against this decision. 14. As regards sexual offences, the Netherlands Criminal Code makes a distinction between rape (Article 242) and indecent assault (Article 246), recourse to physical violence also being a constituent element of the latter offence. 15. Other more specific provisions afford in this area protection to certain categories of persons whose age, position of dependence or physical incapacity renders it difficult or impossible for them to determine or impose their wishes. Articles 244 and 245, respectively, make it a criminal offence to have sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of twelve or with a girl between the ages of twelve and sixteen, and under Article 247 it is a criminal offence to commit an indecent assault on boys or girls under the age of sixteen. Articles 243 and 247 concern, respectively, sexual intercourse with, and indecent assault on, a woman known to the offender to be unconscious or helpless. According to the Supreme Court, however, the word ""helpless"" refers only to physical incapacity. Article 249 relates to indecent acts committed with a minor who is in a position of dependence vis-à-vis the perpetrator. Finally, Article 239 concerns indecency, either in public or while another person is present against his will. Save for Article 245, none of these provisions makes the institution of criminal proceedings conditional on the filing of a complaint by the victim. 16. The same does not apply to Article 248 ter, whereby a sentence of not more than four years’ imprisonment may be imposed on any person who, ""through gifts or promises ..., through abuse of a dominant position resulting from factual circumstances, or through deceit, deliberately causes a minor of blameless conduct to commit indecent acts with him or to suffer such acts from him"": in a case of this kind, the offender can be prosecuted only on complaint by the actual victim. Under Article 64 para. 1, however, the legal representative may lodge the complaint on behalf of the victim if the latter is under the age of sixteen or is placed under guardianship (curateele); this latter institution exists only for persons who have reached the age of majority, namely twenty-one (Article 378, Book I, of the Civil Code). 17. At the hearings, counsel for the Government informed the Court that the Ministry of Justice had prepared a Bill modifying the provisions of the Criminal Code that related to sexual offences. Under the Bill, it would be an offence to make sexual advances to a mentally handicapped person.",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

UKRAINE,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-5 - Compensation),André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Ganna Yudkivska,"5. The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in the town of Konotop, Ukraine. 6. On 22 November 2003, at around 10 p.m., the applicant, who was drunk, together with P. and R., had a quarrel with seven other persons (M., S., Pv., Ps., Z., Kh. and D.). According to the applicant’s own account, D. hit him in the left eye and the applicant hit D. in the jaw. Afterwards they were separated by others. However, according to the court’s findings in the criminal case against the applicant (see paragraph 40), after an attempt to have a fight with Pv., the applicant stabbed D. with a knife. D. brought this to the attention of the traffic police officers Ku. and G., who happened to be passing. 7. At about 11 p.m. on the same day, the applicant, together with P. and R., was arrested by the traffic police officers, handcuffed and taken to the traffic police station. According to the entries in the traffic police station register, the applicant remained in the traffic police station from 11.30 p.m. until 12.15 a.m. the next day. 8. According to the applicant, in the traffic police station he was beaten by two officers. One of them hit the applicant about five times on the head. Another one hit him in the face, twice or three times hit him in the chest, and with a truncheon on the left ear, the kidneys and on the legs. 9. The applicant was subsequently taken to an ambulance station to check whether he was drunk. According to a medical report, the applicant was examined by a doctor at a municipal ambulance station at 11.45 p.m. on 22 November 2003. The applicant was drunk but had no visible injuries. After that the applicant was handed over to the ordinary police. 10. The applicant was taken to the police station at about 1 a.m. on 23 November 2003. There he was examined by a police officer, Ma., in the presence of two witnesses. It was noted that the applicant had no bodily injuries and had no complaints about the police officers. A report drafted by a police officer was signed by two witnesses and by the applicant. The applicant also signed a statement that he had no complaints about his arrest and that no physical force or special restraining equipment had been used on him. 11. Later, according to the applicant, he was tortured and ill-treated and was forced to make self-incriminating statements. In particular, according to the accounts given by the applicant on an unidentified date, in the police station he had his head banged against the wall and table, and was hit in the kidneys. 12. According to the police officers, the applicant was released at about 2-3 a.m. on 23 November 2003. The applicant, however, states that he was released at 8 a.m. 13. At 9 a.m. the applicant caught a bus. According to the bus driver, Kt., the applicant had bruises on his left ear and left eye and said that he had been beaten by the police. 14. According to the testimony of the applicant’s sister and mother, given by them later during the investigation into the applicant’s complaints of ill-treatment, on 23 November 2003 the applicant was at home. An ambulance was allegedly called for him which did not come. The applicant’s mother had arrived at home late at night on 23 November 2003 and, as the applicant was feeling bad and had fallen to the floor after getting up from the bed, she called him an ambulance. The ambulance arrived at 4.58 a.m. on 24 November 2003. The applicant was diagnosed with concussion and head injury, and taken to hospital. 15. On 24 November 2003 the applicant’s mother complained to the prosecutor’s office that the applicant had been ill-treated. 16. The applicant stayed in Konotop Central District Hospital from 24 November to 8 December 2003. He was diagnosed with concussion, bruises to the neck and left ear and acute bronchitis. The applicant told doctors that he had fallen. 17. According to the conclusions of the Konotop traffic police internal investigation of 18 December 2003, two traffic police officers, Ku. and G., were approached by D., who said that he had been stabbed in a bar. Ku. and G. arrested the applicant, handcuffed him and took him to the traffic police station. Later they took the applicant to the ambulance station, where he was tested for alcohol. The test was positive and the applicant was then taken back to the traffic police station and handed over to the police. The applicant’s injuries had been inflicted during the fight in which D. was stabbed. 18. During a forensic medical examination carried out between 25 November and 24 December 2003 the applicant stated that he had been beaten by the traffic police officers after fighting with D. According to the applicant, he was punched about three times on the head and chest and hit in the ear. He also had a helmet put on his head and was hit twice with a truncheon on the head. It was revealed that the applicant had bruises on his left ear and scratches on his left arm. The scratches had been caused by handcuffs. These injuries could have occurred on 22-23 November 2003 in the circumstances described by the applicant. The expert concluded that there were no marks indicating truncheon blows. 19. According to the conclusion of a report dated 24 December 2003, signed by the head of the Konotop traffic police unit, the use of handcuffs on the applicant had been justified. When Ku. and G. had arrived at the bar, there had been around twenty-five persons there. People started to run away and a window was broken. The applicant, P., and R. were recognised by Z.; however, as they were drunk, they refused to enter the police car, and they swore and resisted. 20. On 24 December 2003, following complaints by the applicant’s mother, the Konotop Town Prosecutor’s Office refused to institute criminal proceedings. Two traffic police officers, Ts. and T., testified that they had seen the applicant upon his arrival at the traffic police station and he had had no bodily injuries. Nobody had ill-treated the applicant. This was further confirmed by four other traffic police officers, D., and the doctor who had examined the applicant. Further, the prosecutor referred to the report of the police officer Ma. It was concluded that the police officers had not ill-treated the applicant. 21. On 2 March 2004 the Sumy Regional Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 24 December 2003 and remitted the case for additional investigation. It was noted that when Kt. had been driving the applicant home at 9 a.m. on 23 November 2003, the latter had said that he had been beaten by police officers. The police officers testified that the applicant had been released at 2 a.m. The prosecutor noted that these, as well as other relevant circumstances, had not been verified and the quashed decision had been based on the testimony of the persons involved. Moreover, the cause of the applicant’s injuries had not been established. 22. On 19 March 2004 the Konotop Town Prosecutor’s Office again refused to institute criminal proceedings. It was found that, on the day of the incident, two young people, one having a stab wound, had asked the traffic police officers for help. The applicant, together with two other persons, had been taken to the traffic police station. Because they resisted arrest, they had been handcuffed. The applicant did not have any bodily injuries and that had been confirmed by a medical examination. A doctor, K., had been questioned and confirmed that, during the examination in the ambulance station on the night of 22 November 2003, the applicant had had no bodily injuries. Police officers had stated that the applicant had been questioned and released at about 2 a.m. on 23 November 2003. He had not had any injuries and they had not ill-treated him. Although R., who had been arrested together with the applicant, had testified that he had seen the applicant being beaten by the traffic police officers, it was concluded that his testimony, as well as the applicant’s statements, were not confirmed by the medical conclusions, and, in particular, that there had been no marks from truncheon blows on the applicant’s body (see paragraph 18). 23. On 3 December 2004 the Konotop Local Court quashed the decision of 19 March 2004 and remitted the case for further investigation. The court held that the cause of the applicant’s injuries had not been established and the testimony of Kt. had not been verified. 24. On 24 December 2004 the Konotop Prosecutor’s Office again rejected the applicant’s request to institute criminal proceedings. It was concluded that the applicant’s version of events was not confirmed by “the medical conclusion of 24 November 2003”. Furthermore it had been impossible to establish where the applicant had been between 3 and 9 a.m. on 23 November 2003. 25. On 26 May 2005 the Konotop Local Court quashed the decision of 24 December 2004 because the prosecutor had made a reference to the wrong provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure when rejecting the applicant’s complaints. 26. On 14 June 2005 the Konotop Town Prosecutor’s Office rejected a request by the applicant for the institution of criminal proceedings. The prosecutor found that the applicant’s description of events was not confirmed by the findings of the forensic medical examination which had been completed on 24 December 2003. 27. On 20 July 2005 the Sumy Regional Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 14 June 2005 and remitted the case for further investigation. It was noted that the hospital doctors who had examined the applicant on 24 November 2005 had not been questioned. An additional medical examination of the applicant needed to be carried out, taking into consideration material from the hospital medical file. Moreover, it was unclear when exactly the applicant had been released. 28. During additional investigations in 2005 the majority of the witnesses (ambulance doctors, police officers, relatives of the applicant) stated that as the events of 22-24 November 2003 had happened long ago, they did not clearly remember them. Witness Kt. was not questioned since he had moved abroad. The records of the ambulance visit to the applicant of 24 November 2003 and the police station register had already been destroyed as their keeping period (one year for the police station register) had expired. 29. On 12 December 2005 the forensic medical examination concluded that the applicant had a scar on his right wrist. According to medical documents, on 22 November 2003 the applicant had sustained light bodily injuries. Such injuries could have been inflicted in the circumstances described by the applicant. It was unlikely that they had been inflicted by the applicant’s falling down. 30. On 23 December 2005 the Konotop Town Prosecutor’s Office again refused to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant’s complaint of ill-treatment. It was found that the applicant had been hospitalised on 24 November 2003 complaining of headache, nausea and a left ear injury. The applicant had not told the doctors that he had been beaten by the police. The applicant’s sister had testified that the applicant had come home during the morning of 23 November 2003 feeling ill and had told her that he had been beaten by the police. The prosecutor, however, referred to the findings of the courts in the criminal case against the applicant and decided that there were no grounds to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. This decision was not appealed against. 31. On 11 December 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant for hooliganism. 32. On 28 December 2003 the applicant was charged with hooliganism and the use of an offensive weapon. He signed an undertaking not to abscond. 33. On 31 January 2004 the applicant’s representative, B., was refused permission to represent the applicant in the criminal proceedings because B. did not hold an advocate’s certificate. B.’s appeals against that decision were unsuccessful. The applicant was represented in the criminal proceedings by his mother and by the advocates T. and S. 34. Between 9 February and 17 March 2004 the criminal proceedings were stayed because the applicant was ill. 35. On 17 March 2004 the criminal proceedings were resumed and the applicant was arrested. 36. On 19 March 2004 the Konotop Town Court authorised the applicant’s pre-trial detention. In doing so the court stated that “the materials of the case presented before the court confirmed the investigating officer’s conviction that the applicant might abscond or interfere with the course of justice”. 37. On 13 April 2004 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 19 March 2004 because, by a Decree of the President of Ukraine which had entered into force on 19 March 2004, the Konotop Town Court had been dissolved. Therefore, the decision appealed against had been adopted by a court which no longer existed in law. The case was transferred to the newly created Konotop Local Court for fresh consideration. 38. On 28 April 2004 the Konotop Local Court authorised the applicant to be placed in pre-trial detention. In particular, the court held that the applicant had been accused of committing a serious crime to which he had not confessed. The court further noted that it was “the investigating officer’s right to decide on the tactics for the investigation and it was his right to decide to change the preventive measure [from an obligation not to abscond to pre-trial detention]”. 39. The applicant appealed against that decision. According to the Government, this appeal was received by the court on 5 May 2004. 40. On 18 May 2004 the Konotop Local Court found the applicant guilty of hooliganism and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. In particular, the court found that the applicant, P., and R., had followed M., S., Pv., Ps., Z., Kh. and D. onto the street. The applicant had asked M. why he had not stayed in the bar. The applicant then started to swear and tried to have a fight with Pv. When M., D. and Z. had tried to calm the applicant down he had struck D. with a knife. 41. In the court hearing the applicant stated that he had had a quarrel with D. but had not struck him with a knife. The court listened to the testimony of Ps., Kh. and S. The two latter witnesses withdrew the testimony they had given at the pre-trial stage and stated that the applicant had not in any way committed an offence against them. None of the other persons present during the incident attended the hearing because they were out of town. The court took into consideration the testimony they had given during the pre-trial investigation. The court also relied on various pieces of evidence and the conclusions of the forensic examinations. 42. On 1 June 2004 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal rejected an appeal by the applicant against the decision of 28 April 2004, because the applicant had already been sentenced to imprisonment. 43. On 3 August 2004 the Sumy Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 18 May 2004. It also rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaints that he had been ill-treated. No particular reasoning was given for this conclusion as the court referred to certain undated decisions not to institute criminal proceedings following the applicant’s complaints. 44. By a decision of 14 April 2005 the Konotop Local Court rejected a request by the applicant to have his sentence commuted. 45. On 10 May 2005 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected an appeal in cassation by the applicant against his conviction. 46. On 23 June 2005 the Sumy Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 14 April 2005 and remitted the case for fresh consideration. 47. On 8 July 2005, by a decision of the Konotop Local Court, the applicant was granted an amnesty. 48. The applicant’s representative, B., asked the courts and the prosecutor’s office to provide him with copies of documents necessary for lodging a complaint before this Court. All his requests were rejected, mainly on the ground that he had not presented a valid power of authority and because he had requested documents other than those required in connection with the lodging of his complaints before the Court. 49. Articles 1 and 2 (as worded before the amendments of 1 December 2005) can be found in the following judgments respectively: Kobtsev v. Ukraine, no. 7324/02, § 35, 4 April 2006, and Afanasyev v. Ukraine, no. 38722/02, § 52, 5 April 2005). 50. Following the amendments to the Compensation Act of 1 December 2005, the range of cases where the right to compensation would arise was expanded to include those in the following category: “(1-1) where ... unlawfulness of remand and holding in custody ... has been established by a conviction or other judgment of a court (save for rulings on the remittal of cases for additional investigation)”.","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1
75,001-59215,ENG,GRC,CHAMBER,2001,CASE OF PIALOPOULOS AND OTHERS v. GREECE,3,Violation of P1-1;Violation of Art. 6-1;Not necessary to examine Art. 13;Just satisfaction reserved,András Baka,"9. The first applicant is a Greek citizen, born in 1951 and living in Pefki in Attika. The second applicant is also a Greek citizen born in 1930 and living in Filothei in Attika. The third applicant is the first applicant’s stepbrother. He is a Greek citizen, born in 1964 and living in Athens. The fourth applicant is the first applicant’s sister. She is a Greek citizen, born in 1949 and living in Geneva. 10. On 11 February 1987 the first two applicants bought a plot of land in Neo Psihiko of a total surface of 7,723 m2 (block No 16 on the town plan). The first applicant became the owner of 83% of the plot and the second applicant of the rest. On 12 February 1987 the Prefecture (Nomarhia) of Eastern Attika gave the two applicants permission to demolish some old buildings that existed on the plot. 11. On 18 February 1987 the two applicants applied to the Prefecture for a permit to build a multi-storey shopping centre thereon. 12. On 25 February 1987 at a meeting of the Municipal Council of Neo Psihiko the mayor informed the councillors that urgent action had to be taken to block the proposed development and accepted that unusual means were being used to forestall the delivery of the permit. However, a councillor drew the mayor’s attention to the fact that the municipality lacked adequate means to expropriate the applicants’ plot. 13. On 1 June 1987 the Prefect of Eastern Attika decided not to issue any new building permits in respect of commercial premises of a certain size (buildings exceeding 1/4 of the maximum authorised size) in Neo Psihiko for a year (decision no. 10311/1987 published in the Official Gazette on 10 June 1987). He exempted commercial premises for which an application had already been lodged, provided that the file was “complete” in accordance with the presidential decree of 8 September 1983. 14. On 5 June 1987 the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works advised the first two applicants that the file which they had submitted together with their application for a building permit was “complete”. Given the Prefect’s decision of 1 June 1987, the file “would continue to be considered complete pending resumption of the delivery of new building permits”. 15. On 31 July 1987 the Prefect of Eastern Attika decided “to extend the freeze on new building licences in respect of block No. 16 in Neo Psihiko by six months as from 13 September 1987”. 16. On 1 March 1988 the Prefect decided to change the authorised use of the applicants’ plot from development land to park land (decision no. 13580/277/87/1988 published in the Official Gazette on 24 March 1988). Following this decision, the first two applicants requested the town planning authorities of the prefecture to decide who should compensate them for the expropriation of their plot of land. On 16 June 1988 the town planning authorities decided that the applicants should be expropriated by, among others, the Municipality of Neo Psihiko (act no. 51/88). The municipality appealed to the Prefect who, on 26 September 1988, confirmed act no. 51/88 of the town planning authorities and ordered the municipality to compensate the two applicants in respect of 5,697 m2. The municipality appealed against the prefect’s decision of 26 September 1988 to the Secretary General of the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works claiming that it should not bear on its own the cost of compensating the applicants for the 5,697 m2 in question. On 4 January 1989 the Secretary General confirmed the decision of 26 September 1988 of the prefect (decision no. 84888/4910/1989). 17. On 19 January 1989 the first two applicants asked the single-member first instance civil court (monomeles protodikio) of Athens provisionally to determine their compensation. On 16 November 1989 the court decided that the two applicants should receive 732,300,000 drachmas. 18. On 20 February 1989 the Municipality of Neo Psihiko applied to the Council of State (Simvulio Epikratias) for judicial review of decision no. 84888/4910/1989 of the Secretary General of the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works. The first two applicants intervened in favour of the Secretary General. 19. On 28 September 1989 the Secretary General of the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works approved a new town plan for Neo Psihiko, which was published in the Official Gazette on 9 October 1989. 20. On 21 May 1990 the Prefect of Eastern Attika decided to amend the new town plan of Neo Psihiko. It was provided that the applicants’ plot could only be used as a park and for underground parking. The decision was published in the Official Gazette on 5 June 1990. 21. On 31 July 1991 the first two applicants requested the Court of Appeal (efetio) of Athens to declare under Article 17 § 4 of the Constitution and Article 11 of legislative decree no. 727/1971 that the Prefect’s decision no. 13580/277/87/1988 concerning the expropriation had been revoked ipso jure on 16 May 1991 because the compensation fixed provisionally had not been paid within eighteen months from the first instance civil court’s decision of 16 November 1989. The State and the Municipality of Neo Psihiko were parties to the proceedings. On 8 November 1991 the Athens Court of Appeal acceded to the applicants’ request (decision no. 9779/1991). 22. On 21 and 26 February 1992 the Municipal Council of Neo Psihiko discussed the future of the applicants’ plot. On the second occasion, the mayor stated that he had been unable to conclude a loan in order to compensate the applicants in full. He also stated that the owners of neighbouring plots of land had informed him that they lacked the funds to pay part of the applicants’ compensation. Some councillors made proposals which would have lowered the value of the applicants’ plot. 23. On 4 March 1992 the first two applicants received a letter from the Municipality of Neo Psihiko referring to negotiations which had been conducted with them. The two applicants were invited to agree to a plan for the development of the plot. According to the plan, the municipality would acquire part of the plot and transform it into a park. The applicants would be allowed to construct a building with a two-storey underground garage. There would be shops on the ground floor and offices on the other floors. 24. On 23 March 1992 the Legal Council of State (Nomiko Simvulio tu Kratus) decided not to appeal in cassation against the decision of the Court of Appeal. On 13 May 1992 it informed the Prefecture of Eastern Attika and the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works accordingly and requested them to take the necessary steps to give effect to that decision. 25. On 6 July 1992 the Municipal Council of Neo Psihiko discussed the outcome of the negotiations with the first two applicants. The mayor invited the members of the council not to lose sight of the fact that the municipality risked finding itself in a position where it would be unable to pay full compensation to the two applicants for the expropriation of their plot. In the end, the council decided to request the prefecture to expropriate the plot (decision no. 96/92). It proposed the creation of a park, an underground garage and a public building. The two applicants protested. 26. On 8 July 1992 the first two applicants requested the Prefect of Eastern Attika formally to revoke decision no. 13580/277/87/1988, as he was required to do by the law. 27. On 30 November 1992 the Council of State examined the Municipality of Neo Psihiko’s application for judicial review of decision no. 84888/4910/1989 of the Secretary General of the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works. The first two applicants, who had intervened in favour of the Secretary General, claimed that this decision did not produce any legal effects because on 8 November 1991 (decision no. 9779/1991) the Court of Appeal had declared that it had been ipso jure revoked. However, the Council considered that, the decision of the appeal court notwithstanding, the administration was under an obligation formally to revoke decision no. 13580/277/87/1988 expropriating the plot. As long as this had not happened, decision no. 84888/4910/1989 could be judicially reviewed. Moreover, the Council considered that the Secretary General of the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works had illegally ordered the Municipality of Neo Psihiko to bear on its own the cost of compensating the applicants for the 5,697 m2 in question. The owners of other neighbouring property were liable as well. The Council of State, therefore, decided to quash decision no. 84888/4910/1989 (decision no. 3730/1992). 28. On 3 December 1992 the town planning authorities of the Prefecture of Eastern Attika asked the Municipality of Neo Psihiko whether it wished to expropriate the applicants’ plot again and drew its attention to the conditions for doing so. On 19 February 1993 the town planning authorities informed the municipality that, if it wanted the plot to be expropriated, a decision by the municipal council concerning the necessary funds should be adopted before 26 April 1993. On both occasions the town planning authorities informed the municipality that, if it did not take the necessary measures for a fresh expropriation, the prefecture would proceed to the revocation of the first expropriation as it was required to do by law. 29. On 23 March 1993 the first two applicants applied to the prefecture for a building permit. 30. On 12 April 1993 the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works informed the Prefecture of Eastern Attika that, decision no. 3730/1992 of the Council of State notwithstanding, the prefecture had to comply with decision no. 9779/1991 of the Athens Court of Appeal and officially revoke the expropriation decision. The ministry also considered that the amendment of the town plan of 21 May 1990 amounted to a new expropriation. According to the case-law of the Council of State, this would be lawful only if there was a serious town-planning need and the money for the compensation was readily available. 31. On 25 May 1993 the Municipal Council of Neo Psihiko requested the Prefect of Eastern Attika to re-issue act no. 51/88 on the persons liable to pay compensation taking into consideration decision no. 3730/1992 of the Council of State or else to adopt a new decision expropriating the applicants’ plot of land. The municipal council declared that it was ready to pay the compensation required in order for the expropriation to be completed (decision no. 87/1993). 32. On 17 June 1993 the first two applicants, with a view to reaching a friendly settlement, applied for a building permit offering, at the same time, to construct at their expense a public building for the municipality. 33. On 19 August 1993 the Prefect of Eastern Attika considered that the municipality’s case for a new expropriation was not convincing and decided to free part of the applicants’ plot for development (decision no. 26224/839/1993 published in the Official Gazette on 3 September 1993). On 20 October 1993 the Municipality of Neo Psihiko applied to the Council of State for judicial review of this decision. The first two applicants intervened in the proceedings in favour of the Prefect. 34. On 10 July 1995 the Council of State considered that its previous decision no. 3730/1992 could not affect the obligation of the Prefect of Eastern Attika to comply with decision no. 9779/1991 of the Athens Court of Appeal of 8 November 1991 and officially revoked the first expropriation decision. The Council of State found that the Prefecture of Eastern Attika had complied with the above-mentioned decision of the Court of Appeal by issuing decision no. 26224/839/1993. However, this decision had not taken into consideration the fact that the Municipality of Neo Psihiko had fully cooperated in the first expropriation procedure. Neither had it taken into consideration the fact that the main reason for the non-completion of the first expropriation procedure had been the dispute which had arisen as to who should have compensated the first two applicants. In the light of all the above, the Council found that the Prefect of Eastern Attika’s decision not to accede to the municipality’s request for a second expropriation did not contain adequate reasons. The Council of State, therefore, quashed decision no. 26224/839/1993 of the Prefect of Eastern Attika (decision no. 3927/95). 35. On 2 May 1996 the second applicant requested the Mayor of Neo Psihiko to provide him with a certified copy of the municipality’s budget and of the minutes of the meeting of the municipal council at which the budget had been approved. 36. On 9 May 1996 the town planning authorities of the Prefecture of Athens, which had taken over the functions of the Prefecture of Eastern Attika, informed the Municipality of Neo Psihiko that, since decision no. 26224/839/1993 of the Prefect of Eastern Attika had been quashed, it was still under an obligation to comply with decision no. 9779/1991 of the Athens Court of Appeal. It also invited the municipality to inform it within 30 days whether there existed a serious town-planning need for the expropriation of the applicants’ plot of land and whether there existed sufficient funds in the municipality’ budget for compensating the applicants. Finally, the prefecture warned the municipality that, in the absence of a prompt reply, it would change the authorised use of the applicants’ plot to development land. 37. The Mayor of Neo Psihiko replied to the Prefecture of Athens on 9 July 1996 requesting that the applicants’ plot should be expropriated for the following reasons. On the one hand, a number of supermarkets and banks had been recently built in the area, which attracted 5,000 persons and a lot of traffic every day. On the other hand, there were no parks or parking space. As a result, if a new development were authorised, the situation would become intolerable. The mayor referred to the Prefect of Eastern Attika’s decision of 21 May 1990 according to which the applicants’ plot could only be used as a park and for underground parking. The mayor also informed the prefecture that provision had been made for 450,000,000 drachmas in the municipality’s budget for 1996 and an additional sum would be made available in 1997. 38. On 27 September 1996 the Prefecture of Athens asked the municipality to clarify within ten days whether the sum of 450,000,000 drachmas had been earmarked for the expropriation of the applicants’ plot, what was the estimated total cost of the expropriation, whether the additional sum required existed and, if not, which were the sources from which it could be obtained and what were the prospects of obtaining it. The municipality was again threatened with a decision changing the authorised use of the applicants’ land. 39. On 16 November 1996 the first two applicants invited the Prefect to comply with decision no. 3927/1995 of the Council of State and decision no. 9779/1991 of the Athens Court of Appeal. 40. Having received no reply, on 6 February 1997 the second applicant requested the Prefecture of Athens to inform him of the conditions for the development of his plot in Neo Psihiko. On 14 February 1997 the Prefecture of Athens informed the second applicant that, according to the decision of the Prefect of Eastern Attika of 21 May 1990, the plot could only be used as a park and for underground parking. Decision no. 26224/839/1993 of the Prefect of Eastern Attika had been quashed by the Council of State. When the two applicants had originally applied for a building permit there were no restrictions on their plot of land. However, on 1 June 1987 and 31 July 1987 the prefect of Eastern Attika had decided to suspend the delivery of building permits of the kind requested by the two applicants. 41. On 14 October 1997 the second applicant applied to the town planning authorities of the prefecture for permission to construct an open-air parking area on his plot. The authorities turned his application down referring, inter alia, to the decision of the Prefect of Eastern Attika of 21 May 1990. On 17 October 1997 the second applicant applied to the town planning authorities for permission to construct an underground garage. On 4 November 1997 the authorities replied that the garage would be built by the appropriate organ after the conclusion of the expropriation. 42. Following a further query by the first two applicants, on 11 December 1997 the Prefecture of Athens informed them that, according to the decision of the Prefect of Eastern Attika of 21 May 1990, their plot of land could only be used as a park and for underground parking and that the decision in question had not been revoked. 43. On 19 December 1997 the first applicant transferred 20.75% of the plot to the third applicant and 20.75% to the fourth applicant. 44. On 16 March 1998 the town planning authorities of the Prefecture of Athens informed the Legal Council of State that the decision of 21 May 1990 of the Prefect of Eastern Attika amounted to an expropriation of the applicants’ plot. However, when the town planning authorities wrote to the Municipality of Neo Psihiko on 9 May 1996, they were not aware of this decision. Following the quashing of decision no. 26224/839/1993 of the Prefect of Eastern Attika by the Council of State, the use of the applicants’ plot is governed by the decision of 21 May 1990. The town planning authorities, further to a request by the Municipality of Neo Psihiko, were in the course of determining those liable to pay compensation because of the expropriation. 45. According to decision no. 3284/86 of the Council of State, an expropriation that has been revoked may be re-imposed only if there is a serious town-planning need and the authorities are able to pay appropriate compensation immediately. In 1986 the Ministry for the Environment, Town Planning and Public Works issued a circular informing the authorities of this development (circular no. 141/1986). 46. According to the case-law of the Council of State, amendments to town plans must be published in the Official Gazette together with a detailed plan. Otherwise they are null and void (decisions nos. 488/91 and 489/91).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Pskov, a town in the Pskov Region. 5. The applicant sued his employer, a regional department of the Federal Debt Recovery Centre, for salary arrears. 6. On 18 May 2004 the Pskov Town Court awarded him against the Government 342,578 Russian roubles (RUB) in respect of the arrears and RUB 20,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damages. This judgment became binding on 7 June 2004. In July and December 2004 the applicant sent enforcement papers to the Ministry of Finance, but in September 2005 the Ministry returned the papers, because they did not indicate the Ministry as the defendant and did not specify the financial source to be charged. The applicant asked the Town Court to clarify the judgment, but on 23 November 2005 the court refused this request, because the judgment was clear as it stood. The judgment has not been enforced to date. 7. In the meantime, on the Government’s request, on 12 November 2004 the Presidium of the Pskov Regional Court quashed the judgment in the part concerning the damages, and rejected this claim. The Presidium found that the courts below had misinterpreted material law. 8. On 17 April 2006 the Town Court gave two other judgments in the applicant’s favour. In the first judgment it adjusted the outstanding award of 18 May 2004 for the cost of living and awarded RUB 87,357. This judgment became binding on 28 April 2006. In the second judgment the court awarded the applicant RUB 206,672 in respect of salary arrears. This judgment became binding on 3 May 2006. In May 2006 the applicant sent enforcement papers to the Ministry of Finance, but later the same month the Ministry returned the papers, because they did not specify the financial source to be charged. The applicant sent the enforcement papers to the bailiff’s service, but in December 2006 the service returned the papers, because it was not authorised to enforce debts against the treasury. 9. Under section 9 of the Federal Law on Enforcement Proceedings of 21 July 1997, a bailiff must enforce a judgment within two months. Under section 242.2.6 of the Budget Code of 31 July 1998, the Ministry of Finance must enforce a judgment within three months.","['6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Olsztyn. 6. At the material time the applicant was editor-in-chief of the local weekly newspaper “Iławski Tydzień”. 7. On 17 October 2005 the newspaper published an article coauthored by the applicant, entitled “Municipality in danger; authorities fail to see problem”. It described in detail the situation concerning the sewage system in the Iława municipality. The thrust of the article was that the sanitary situation in the municipality was a matter of concern and posed significant public health risks; extensive investments were necessary to improve it; there was a serious shortage of available funds; the municipal authorities were dealing with the problems in a slow and incompetent manner; it was more important for them to save money than to prevent serious health risks and to avert a danger to the population; the quality of water was unsatisfactory; and the mayor, despite the fact that he had been in office for two terms, had failed to deal with the problems properly. 8. In a letter to the newspaper of the same date the mayor of Iława complained about the article. The first paragraph of that letter was couched in ironic terms. The mayor expressed doubts about the applicant’s intentions and suggested that the applicant had been acting in his own personal interest. He maintained that the general tone of the article was inappropriate. He also voiced doubts as to whether the newspaper had any readers at all and whether it was therefore worth his while to react to the article. 9. He further requested, referring to section 31 § 1 read together with section 32 of the Press Act 1984, that the applicant publish a rectification (see paragraph 22 below). He stated that the development of the sewage network was a priority for the municipal authorities and listed a number of projects undertaken by the municipality during the preceding five years. Further, three projects planned for the years 2007-2013 were listed. The mayor stated that the quality of the water was monitored by the appropriate services and referred to several projects for modernising and overhauling the existing sewage and sanitary systems. 10. The applicant did not reply to this letter and did not publish it. 11. On an unspecified later date the municipality of Iława brought a private bill of indictment against the applicant before the Elbląg District Court for the offence of failure to publish a rectification or reply as prescribed by section 46 § 1 of the Press Act (see paragraph 24 below). 12. In his written pleadings of 4 December 2005 the applicant argued that the mayor’s letter could not reasonably be regarded as a request for rectification within the meaning of section 31 of the Press Act, because its content lacked the essential characteristics of a “rectification”. It was not related to the facts and it was not couched in objective terms, as stipulated by that provision. In fact, its first part, in particular, was very critical of the applicant and contained innuendos about his character, motives and about the newspaper and its journalists. This alone made it impossible to regard the letter as a request for rectification. Furthermore, the style of the letter lacked the objectivity which could be expected of a rectification. It could therefore not be reasonably seen as such. It resembled rather a “reply”, within the meaning of the same provision of the Press Act, expressing the value judgments and views of its author vis-à-vis the impugned article. Even assuming that the letter could be seen as a rectification, it did not comply with the relevant requirements laid down by section 33 of the Press Act as it was more than twice the length of the contested article. 13. The applicant further submitted that the letter could not be seen as a rectification request because it breached his personal rights and the rights of other journalists working for the “Tydzień Iławski”, by calling into doubt their professionalism and personal integrity. The applicant referred to section 33 of the Press Act, which obliged an editor-in-chief to refuse the publication of a rectification or a reply if its form or content were incompatible with the principles of co-existence with others (“zasady współżycia społecznego”). 14. On 13 December 2006 the Elbląg District Court found the applicant guilty of an offence punishable by section 46 § 1 of the Press Act in conjunction with its section 31 § 1. The court sentenced the applicant to four months’ restriction of liberty in the form of twenty hours’ community service per month and suspended the sentence for a period of two years. It further deprived him of the right to exercise the profession of journalist for a period of two years and ordered that the judgment be made public by being displayed at the Iława Municipal Office. 15. The court noted that the facts of the case, for the most part, were not disputed by the parties. It found that the applicant had not replied to the mayor’s letter and had not published that letter or excerpts thereof, either as a rectification or reply. It noted that he was clearly obliged to do so under the provisions of the Press Act. He was aware of his obligation as he had previously published rectifications in the newspaper. No objective grounds existed which could be said to have legitimately prevented the applicant from complying with that obligation and, in any event, he had not invoked any such grounds. It was the applicant’s own decision to refuse to publish the rectification requested. Similarly, he had failed to reply to the mayor, explaining to him the reasons for his refusal to publish. His failure corresponded to the offence specified in section 46 of the Press Act read together with section 31 of that Act. 16. The judgment further read: “The above assessment of the [applicant’s conduct] is additionally supported by the fact that in the impugned article he had discussed a question of significant importance for the municipality of Iława, namely the condition of its sewage system, by saying that the mayor had failed to take effective steps in order to have the sewage system installed. Assuming that the accused took into consideration the significance of his article, he should have, as a diligent journalist and editor-in-chief, either published the rectification demanded by the municipality, which directly concerned the questions raised in the article and outlined the steps which the municipality had already taken, or informed the municipality of the grounds for his refusal to publish a rectification.” 17. The court further held that the applicant’s failure to publish the mayor’s letter had been to the serious detriment of the Iława municipality as by making it impossible for a fair and public debate to develop it had undermined the confidence which a democratically elected municipal executive authority should enjoy. 18. The applicant appealed, essentially reiterating his arguments as submitted to the first-instance court. 19. On 29 March 2007 the Elbląg Regional Court upheld the contested judgment. 20. Article 54 of the Constitution provides: “1. Freedom to express opinions, and to acquire and disseminate information shall be ensured to everyone. 2. Preventive censorship of means of social communication and licensing of the press shall be prohibited.” Article 31 of the Constitution reads: “1. Freedom of the person shall receive legal protection. 2. Everyone shall respect the freedoms and rights of others. No one shall be compelled to do that which is not required by law. 3. Any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order, or to protect the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms and rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights.” Article 190 of the Constitution, regarding the effects of judgments of the Constitutional Court, provides, in so far as relevant: “1. Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final. 2. Judgments of the Constitutional Court, ... shall be published without delay. 3. A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from the day of its publication; however, the Constitutional Court may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act. Such a time-limit may not exceed eighteen months in relation to a statute or twelve months in relation to any other normative act. ... 4. A judgment of the Constitutional Court on non-conformity with the Constitution, an international agreement or statute, of a normative act on the basis of which a final and enforceable judicial decision or a final administrative decision ... is given, shall be a basis for reopening the proceedings or for quashing the decision ... in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings.” 21. The relevant provisions concerning the correction of information in the press and other media are contained in the Press Act (Prawo prasowe) of 26 January 1984. Section 31 provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “At the request of a natural or legal person or other organisational entity, the editorin-chief of the relevant daily or magazine is under an obligation to publish, free of charge: 1. a factually based (rzeczowe i odnoszące się do faktów) rectification of untrue or inaccurate statements, 2. a factually based (rzeczową) reply to any statement which might infringe someone’s personal rights” 22. Section 32 provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “...Without the consent of the claimant, it is forbidden to shorten or make any other amendments to the correction or reply which would weaken its significance or alter the intentions of the author. The correction may not be commented upon in the same edition or broadcast ...” 23. Section 33 provides, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1. The editor-in-chief is under an obligation to refuse publication of the rectification or reply if: 1) it does not fulfil the requirements laid down in section 31 (...) 3. The editor-in-chief, when refusing to publish a rectification or reply, shall, without undue delay, send the claimant written notification of the refusal and the reasons for it. If the refusal is based on reasons referred to in subsection (1), the editorin-chief shall indicate those parts which cannot be published; the seven-day time-limit for producing an amended correction or reply starts running again from the day on which the refusal and its justification were delivered. The editor cannot refuse to publish a rectification or reply which has been amended in accordance with his or her indications.” 24. Section 46 provides for the following penal provision: “Whosoever, in breach of the statutory obligation, refuses to publish a rectification or reply, as referred to in section 31, or who publishes such a rectification or reply contrary to the conditions laid down in this Act, shall be subject to a fine or a restriction of liberty.” 25. In a judgment of 5 May 2004 the Constitutional Court (P 2/03) examined the constitutionality of the prohibition on making editorial comments on a request for rectification in the same issue of a newspaper in which the rectification was published, which was at that time provided for by section 32 § 6 of the Press Act 1984 and backed up by a criminal sanction provided for by section 46 § 1 of that Act. 26. In the light of section 32 § 6 of the 1984 Act, the prohibition on publishing comments on requests for rectifications was not absolute, since it was permissible to include such comments in the next issue or broadcast. That prohibition was necessary to protect the freedom of expression of the person having submitted the request for rectification. The challenged provisions of the Press Act made it possible to maintain a balance of power between the media and persons submitting requests for rectifications to be published, with the latter generally having more limited opportunity to publicly express their views. 27. The court further noted that the practical application of section 46 had given rise to serious difficulties in judicial practice; the Press Act did not formulate any conditions concerning either the form or the substance that would allow for a clear categorisation of a given request submitted to an editor-in-chief as a “rectification” or a “reply”. Hence, editors could have – and in practice did have – serious problems in classifying such submissions. Since it was impossible to provide an unambiguous interpretation of the relevant criminal law norm and no uniform interpretation had been developed in practice, the challenged provision (that is, section 32 § 6 of the Press Act) failed to respect the principle nullum crimen sine lege, enshrined in Article 46 of the Constitution. As a result, the prohibition on commenting on a rectification in the same issue, hitherto based on that provision, was deprived of its criminal sanction. The remaining elements of the criminal law provision contained in section 46 § 1 of the Press Act retained their binding force. 28. The court further observed that the prohibition expressed in section 32 § 6 of the Press Act should be secured by an adequately effective sanction, independently of civil liability. It should take into account the principle of proportionality and assume, on the one hand, the protection of the interests of those harmed by press publications and, on the other hand, values linked to the freedom of expression. 29. On 1 December 2010 the Constitutional Court held that section 46 § 1, sections 31 and 32 § 1 of the Press Act were incompatible with Article 46 of the Constitution. It reiterated its findings concerning the lack of precision in the manner in which criminal offences punishable under those provisions were defined. It further held that as a result of the judgment those provisions were to lose their binding force no later than eighteen months after the judgment was officially published. Until that time, they should be applied by the courts. 30. Article 23 of the Civil Code contains a non-exhaustive list of rights known as “personal rights” (dobra osobiste). This provision states: “The personal rights of an individual, such as, in particular, health, liberty, reputation (cześć), freedom of conscience, name or pseudonym, image, secrecy of correspondence, inviolability of the home, scientific or artistic work, [as well as] inventions and improvements shall be protected by the civil law regardless of the protection laid down in other legal provisions.” 31. Article 24 of the Civil Code provides for ways of redressing infringements of personal rights. In accordance with that provision, a person facing the threat of an infringement may demand that the prospective perpetrator refrain from the wrongful activity, unless it is not unlawful. Where an infringement has taken place, the person affected may, inter alia, request that the wrongdoer make a relevant statement in an appropriate form, or claim just satisfaction from him or her. If an infringement of a personal right causes financial loss, the person concerned may seek damages. 32. Under Article 448 of the Civil Code, a person whose personal rights have been infringed may seek compensation. That provision, in its relevant part, reads: “The court may grant an adequate sum as pecuniary compensation for non-material damage (krzywda) caused to anyone whose personal rights have been infringed. Alternatively, the person concerned, regardless of seeking any other relief that may be necessary for removing the consequences of the infringement sustained, may ask the court to award an adequate sum for the benefit of a specific public interest ...”",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1
78,001-69028,ENG,UKR,CHAMBER,2005,CASE OF CHIZHOV v. UKRAINE,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,Zoryana Bortnovska,"6. The applicant, Mr Sergey Vasilyevich Chizhov, is a Ukrainian national, who was born in 1962 and lives in Zaporizzhia. 7. On 6 October 1997 the applicant was apprehended by police officers B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. On the same day he was brought to the medical sobering-up facility by these officers. In the course of the applicant’s apprehension the police officers inflicted bodily injuries on him, resulting in a short-term health disorder. 8. On 7 October 1997 the applicant was charged with assaulting and attempting to bribe them. 9. On 21 October 1997 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia acquitted the applicant. 10. The applicant complained to the Regional Prosecution Service and the General Prosecution Service seeking to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had unlawfully apprehended and harmed him. 11. On 12 February 1998 the applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Zaporizzhia City Police Department in the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia, seeking compensation for the moral damage caused by the actions of B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. 12. On 9 March 1998 the Prosecution Service of Zaporizzhia instituted criminal proceedings against the officers. 13. On 29 January 1999 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia sentenced B.Y.Y. and L.G.T. to a 3 year suspended prison sentence following their conviction for abuse of power and inflicting bodily harm on the applicant. It also ordered the Zaporizzhia City Police Department to pay the applicant UAH 3,709.13 in compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 14. On 22 March 1999 the Zaporizzhia Regional Court upheld that decision. 15. On 1 April 1999 the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizzhia initiated the execution proceedings for the judgment of 29 January 1999. 16. On 14 April 1999 the writ of execution was lodged with the Leninsky District Bailiffs’ Service in Zaporizzhia. 17. On 20 May 1999 the respondent in the case was changed from the City Police Department of Zaporizzhia to the Regional Police Department of Zaporizzhia, because the latter was responsible for managing the medical sobering-up facilities. 18. On 27 July 1999 the writ of execution was transferred to the Ordzhonikidze Bailiffs’ Service for further enforcement. 19. In August 1999 the State Treasury Department confirmed the lack of funds of the Regional Police Department. 20. On 16 August 1999 the applicant lodged a motion to attach the property of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department. 21. On 14 September 1999 the Ordzhonikidze District Execution Service of Zaporizzhia informed the applicant that the attachment of the property of a State institution was prohibited by law. 22. On 3 November 1999 the Ordzhonikidze District Execution Service informed the applicant of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department’s lack of funds. It also stated that the latter owned no property and therefore attachment was not possible. 23. During 1999-2000, the applicant repeatedly lodged a number of motions with the Prosecution Service of Zaporizzia, the General Prosecution Service, the State Security Service, the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the Human Rights Ombudsman, seeking to institute criminal proceedings against various officials of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department, the execution service officials, Judge D.L.A of the Leninsky District Court, and a private person, D.S.S., who had allegedly assaulted the applicant. 24. On 5 April 2000 the Ordzhonikidze District Bailiffs’ Service terminated the proceedings in the applicant’s case due to the lack of funds of the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department. The Government mentioned that the applicant retained a right to reintroduce the writ of execution with the Bailiffs’ Service for up to three years. 25. On 17 November 2000 the Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Ukraine refused to initiate supervisory review proceedings in the applicant’s case. It also remitted the applicant’s claims concerning the non-execution of the judicial decision to the Ministry of Justice. 26. On 9 June 2003 the Ordzhonikidze District Bailiffs’ Service issued resolution no. 1131/9 concerning the institution of the enforcement proceedings for the judgment of 29 January 1999. It also proposed to the debtor that it enforce the judgment given in the applicant’s favour voluntarily. On the same date the resolution instituting the criminal proceedings was sent to the Zaporizzhia Regional Police Department and to the applicant. 27. On 20 June 2003 the bailiff requested the State Treasury to transfer the funds awarded to the applicant by the judgment of 29 January 1999 to his account. 28. On 7 August 2003 the applicant requested that the funds be transferred to his account. 29. On 14 August 2003 the judgment of 29 January 1999 was enforced and the applicant received UAH 3,709.13. 30. On 20 November 2003 the Ordzhonikidze Bailiffs’ Service terminated the execution proceedings in the case in view of the fact that the judgment of 29 January 1999 had been enforced in full. 31. The relevant domestic law is summarised in the judgment of Romashov v. Ukraine (no. 67534/01, §§ 16-18, 27 July 2004).","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
79,001-93496,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2009,CASE OF TARNOPOLSKAYA AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni,"5. The applicants' names and other details are indicated in the appended table. 6. The applicants emigrated to Israel from the USSR in the 1980s and 1990s and obtained Israeli nationality. Before immigration they had been receiving old-age pensions from the Soviet authorities. However, once the applicants left the USSR, the payments were discontinued in accordance with the USSR pension law applicable at the material time. As they left the USSR prior to its collapse, they were not entitled to a pension under the new Russian legislation. 7. In early 2000 the applicants unsuccessfully applied to the regional departments of the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation (“the Pension Fund”) for the payment of their pensions to be restored. On unspecified dates they brought civil proceedings against the Pension Fund requesting restoration of the payment of their pensions. 8. By the final judgments listed in the appended table the applicants' claims were allowed and the Pension Fund was ordered to restore pension payments. 9. In their judgments the courts found, inter alia, that although the pensions had initially been awarded in accordance with the USSR legislation, the latter was also applicable in the Russian Federation. The courts interpreted the relevant legal provisions in the light of the Constitutional Court judgment of 15 June 1998, considering that the pension payments should be restored regardless of the date or place of emigration from the Russian Federation. 10. The Pension Fund restored the payments in ten cases (see § 43 below). 11. On 17 June 2005 the Pension Fund, in a letter numbered ГВ2115/6390, asked the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation to provide an explanation of the issue. It based the request on the fact that courts of different regions had different attitudes towards the problem. Thus, it noted that in Moscow, the Moscow Region and in most of the other regions the courts rejected claims for payment of pensions to emigrant pensioners whose pensions had been awarded in accordance with the legislation of the USSR. At the same time, the courts in St Petersburg, in the Samara Region, in the Kaluga Region and in the Yaroslavl Region awarded such payment. 12. Subsequently the Pension Fund, as a party to the proceedings in the present case, lodged requests with the competent regional courts for supervisory review of the final judgments in the applicants' favour. The Presidia of the regional courts granted the requests, quashed the judgments and dismissed the applicants' claims. 13. The Presidia found that according to the relevant USSR legislation, under which the pensions had been awarded, there was no possibility to continue the payments to the applicants, as they had left the country. According to their interpretation of the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of 15 June 1998, the payments were to be restored only if the pensions had been awarded in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation, not the USSR. The Presidia accordingly concluded that there was no basis under the domestic law for the payments to be awarded to the applicants. 14. The relevant data on the Presidia decisions is listed below. 15. For the relevant provisions on the supervisory-review proceedings contained in the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation see, among many other authorities, the Court's judgment in the case of Sobelin and Others v. Russia (nos. 30672/03 et seq., § 34, 3 May 2007). 16. According to the law “On the Judicial System of the Russian Federation”, no. 1-FKZ of 31 December 1996, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation is a supreme judicial body performing judicial supervision over the activities of all the courts of general jurisdiction and, inter alia, providing explanations on the issues of judicial practices. 17. The relevant provisions on the payment of pensions to those who left the USSR and the Russian Federation are as follows. 18. According to the Provisions regulating the award and payment of state pensions, which were approved by the USSR Council of Ministers Decree on 3 August 1972, USSR citizens living abroad shall be paid their pensions unless they left the USSR for permanent residence or for capitalist countries. 19. The law of 24 October 1990 “On the Operation of Legislation of the USSR on the Territory of the Russian Federation” provided that the USSR legal acts operated directly on the territory of the Russian Federation unless they contradicted the Russian Federation legislation. 20. According to the Order of the Supreme Council of the RSFSR of 11 December 1991 “On Ratification of the Agreement Establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States”, the judicial norms of the former USSR were to be applied in the Russian Federation prior to adoption of the relevant legislation of the Russian Federation. 21. According to the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation no. 4461-I of 11 February 1993, the Pension Fund was allowed to pay pensions awarded under the USSR legislation to pensioners who had been receiving such pensions in the Russian Federation and had left for permanent residence abroad. 22. The law “On Pension Payments to Persons Leaving the Russian Federation for Permanent Residence Abroad” no. 5318-I of 2 July 1993 provided that upon a written request by a pensioner leaving Russia the pension should be transferred to him or her abroad. 23. On 15 June 1998 the Constitutional Court ruled (in Decision no. 18P) that law no. 5318-I of 2 July 1993, applied at the material time, contradicted the Constitution in the part concerning the refusal to pay pensions to persons who had left the Russian Federation before 1 July 1993. 24. According to the law “On Pension Payments to Persons Leaving the Russian Federation for Permanent Residence Abroad” no. 21-FZ of 6 March 2001, pensions were to be paid to persons who had acquired the right to receive a pension in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation at the time they left the country. 25. The new law “On State Pensions in the Russian Federation” no. 173FZ of 17 December 2001 reiterated that upon a written request by a pensioner leaving Russia the pension should be paid in Russia by power of attorney or transferred to him or her abroad (Article 24). It also provided that payments that had not been received in time because of the fault of the bodies responsible for the pension award or payment should be paid for the entire previous period (Article 23). 26. On 29 November 2006 in Ruling no. 85-B06-13 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation found that no pension payments should be made if they were initially awarded in accordance with USSR, not Russian Federation, legislation. It noted, in particular, that “those who had been entitled to pension in accordance with the USSR legislation [...] and had left the Russian Federation for permanent residence abroad have lost their title to the pension”.","['6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1
80,001-114032,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,2012,CASE OF C.N. AND V. v. FRANCE,3,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 4 - Prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 4-1 - Servitude;Article 4-2 - Compulsory labour;Forced labour);No violation of Article 4 - Prohibition of slavery and forced labour (Article 4-1 - Servitude;Article 4-2 - Compulsory labour;Forced labour);Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - award,Angelika Nußberger;Ann Power-Forde;Dean Spielmann;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger,"5. The applicants, C.N. and V., are French nationals who were born in 1978 and 1984 respectively in Burundi. They are sisters. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. C. N. (“the first applicant”) arrived in France in 1994, at the age of sixteen. V. (“the second applicant”) and their three younger sisters arrived in France in 1995. The second applicant was ten years old at the time. Their arrival was arranged by their aunt, N., wife of Mr M., a national of Burundi. 8. The applicants left their country of origin, Burundi, following the civil war in 1993, during which their parents were purportedly killed. On a trip to Burundi, Mrs M. organised a family council. According to a record of the meeting dated 25 February 1995, it was decided to give guardianship and custody of the applicants and their younger sisters to Mr and Mrs M. The family considered that the couple, who lived in France, were the only members of the family “capable of taking care of [the applicants] and giving them a proper education and upbringing”. 9. Mr M., a former government minister of Burundi, was a UNESCO staff member and, as such, enjoyed diplomatic immunity. The spouses owned a four-bedroom detached house in Ville d’Avray in the Hauts de Seine département. They had seven children, one of whom was disabled. 10. When they arrived in France the applicants were housed in what they described as a poorly heated unconverted cellar in the basement of the house. The Government pointed out that it was not a cellar as such, but a basement room with a door opening into the garden and a window. The room contained a boiler, a washing machine and two beds. At the beginning of their stay the applicants shared the room with their three younger sisters. 11. At the same time, Mr and Mrs M. contacted an evangelical church with a view to placing the applicants’ three younger sisters with foster families, except in the school holidays. They were in fact taken in by two families in 1995 and 1996. In June 1996 two of the three sisters went to spend a few weeks with Mr and Mrs M.; the foster family, who had parental authority over them, had to take legal action to get them back in April 1997. 12. The applicants said that as soon as they arrived they had been made to do all the housework and domestic chores necessary for the upkeep of the house and the M. family of nine. They alleged that they had been used as “housemaids”. The first, older applicant said that she had to look after the family’s disabled son and do the gardening. They were not paid for their work or given any days off. 13. The applicants affirmed that they had had no access to a bathroom and only an unhygienic makeshift toilet at their disposal. The Government submitted that they were not denied access to the bathroom, but that it was limited to certain times of day. The applicants added that they were not allowed to eat with the family. They were given only pasta, rice and potatoes to eat, and occasionally leftovers from the family’s meat dishes. They had no leisure activities. 14. The second applicant was a pupil in the Ville d’Avray primary school from May 1995, then in the special general and vocational learning department of a Versailles secondary school from the start of the 1997 school year. As a non-French speaker she had had integration difficulties which she said increased her isolation. Her aunt nevertheless objected to her seeing the school psychologist as suggested by the teaching staff. Nor was the second applicant given any additional help in learning to read French, allegedly because this would have meant paying for her to have school meals. In spite of these difficulties she did well at school. When she got home from school she would have to do her homework then help her sister with the domestic chores. 15. The first applicant was never sent to school or given any vocational training. She spent all day doing housework and looking after her disabled cousin. The Government pointed out that the applicant had admitted in the course of the subsequent criminal proceedings that she had in fact refused to go to school. 16. On 19 December 1995 the Hauts de Seine welfare department submitted a report on children in danger to the Nantes public prosecutor according to which there was a risk that the children were being exploited “to do household chores among other things”. Following an investigation by the police child protection services, it was decided not to take any further action. 17. The first applicant turned eighteen on 23 March 1996. She contended that Mr and Mrs M. did nothing to legalise her situation vis-à-vis the authorities. According to the Government, her situation was not illegal because she was included in her aunt’s diplomatic passport. 18. From September 1997 the aunt refused to pay the second applicant’s bus fare to school. The applicant explained that when her uncle bought her a bus pass behind his wife’s back, her aunt got very angry and threatened to hit her. When she had no bus pass the second applicant had either to walk to school, which was a forty-five minute walk from where she lived, or to take the bus without a ticket. The applicant said that her aunt also refused to pay for her to have school meals. 19. In July 1998 the second applicant, after going several months without urgent dental treatment, had had to go to a dentist near the school at her own initiative. She had never received the orthopaedic treatment the dentist prescribed. As to the first applicant, she alleged that she had been hospitalised three times under her cousin’s name after being beaten by one of the of the boys in the family. 20. The applicants further alleged that they had been physically and verbally harassed on a daily basis by their aunt, who regularly threatened to send them back to Burundi to punish them and made disparaging remarks about their late parents. The second applicant claimed that once, when she was sick in bed, her aunt had threatened to hit her with a broomstick to make her clean the kitchen. 21. On 4 January 1999 the association “Enfance et Partage” drew the attention of the Nanterre public prosecutor’s office to the applicants’ situation, stating that the conditions they lived in – in the insalubrious, unheated basement of the M. family’s house – were contrary to human dignity, that the first applicant was used as a “housemaid” and had to look after the family’s disabled eldest son, that their aunt refused to buy the second applicant a travel card or pay for her to have school meals, and that both girls complained of ill-treatment and physical aggression by their aunt. The applicants ran away from the house the next day and were taken into the association’s care. 22. On 7 January 1999 the Nanterre public prosecutor’s office applied to the Director General of UNESCO to have Mr M.’s diplomatic immunity lifted. 23. On 27 January 1999 that request was granted, exceptionally, as part of an investigation into allegations of ill-treatment. The immunity of Mr M.’s wife was also lifted. 24. On 29 January 1999 a preliminary investigation was opened on the instructions of the Nanterre public prosecutor’s office. 25. On 2 February 1999 the police interviewed the two applicants, who confirmed the terms of the report by “Enfance et Partage”. They did, however, explain that their uncle had tried to temper his wife’s behaviour. The second applicant said that when their situation was first reported in 1995 she had not dared to tell the police the truth for fear of reprisals from her aunt. 26. That same day the association “Enfance et Partage” gave the police photos taken by the applicants in November 1998 of the basement they lived in. The photos confirmed the deplorable conditions of hygiene and insalubrity they lived in. 27. On 3 February 1999 Mr M. was interviewed by the police. He said he had done nothing wrong and that he had helped the applicants by bringing them to France. He told them that his wife, Mrs M., had left for Burundi on 15 January 1999. He also complained about an article in the press on 28 January 1999 making accusations against him and his wife. 28. The police established that, contrary to what Mr M. had told them, his wife had gone back to Burundi on 2 February 1999, a few days after the article appeared in the press. 29. Mr M. denied the investigators access to his house, alleging that his lawyer was not available. He added that renovation work was being done on the house. 30. On 16 February 1999 a judicial investigation was opened against Mr and Mrs M. for degrading treatment (Articles 225-14 and 225-15 of the Criminal Code) and against Mrs M. for wilful violence on a child under fifteen years of age, by a person in a position of authority, not entailing unfitness for work for more than eight days. An arrest warrant was issued against Mrs M. and Mr M. was placed under judicial supervision. 31. The applicants joined the proceedings as civil parties. 32. On 22 April and 3 May 1999 the applicants were heard by the investigating judge. They confirmed their previous statements and added that their situation at the home of Mr and Mrs M. had gradually deteriorated. The second applicant told the judge that at the time of the first report and investigation in 1995-1996 she had said nothing to the police because “things were not [yet] all that bad” with her aunt (a fact confirmed by the first applicant at a later hearing on 30 June 2000). The applicants emphasised the leading role played by their aunt, who had no qualms about hitting them and waking them up in the middle of the night if there was the slightest problem. The first applicant said she had even had to sleep outside the house one night. The applicants confirmed that their uncle had tried to smooth things over, but he was frequently away from home. When present he would often try to reason with his wife, and had even paid their bus fares or bought them clothes without his wife knowing. 33. On 29 April 1999 Mr M. was charged with infringement of human dignity under Articles 225-14 and 225-15 of the Criminal Code. 34. On 30 June 1999 the results of the medico-psychological examination of the two applicants ordered by the investigating judge were submitted. They revealed that the applicants showed no signs of serious psychological disorders or psychiatric decompensation, but that the psychological impact of what they had experienced was characterised by mental suffering, combined, in the case of the first applicant, with feelings of fear and a sense of abandonment, as the threat of being sent back to Burundi was synonymous in her mind with a threat of death and the abandonment of her younger sisters. As to the second applicant, the report stated that being sent back to Burundi was felt to be “even worse” than living with Mr and Mrs M. 35. On 30 June and 14 September 1999 the investigating judge noted that Mrs M. had twice failed to appear. She explained that she had been in Burundi. She was not heard until 15 June 2000. 36. Investigations carried out at the home of Mr and Mrs M. at the judge’s request revealed that the basement of the house had been completely refurbished after the applicants left. 37. On 5 February 2001 the investigating judge at the Nanterre tribunal de grande instance ordered Mrs M.’s committal for trial before the criminal court on charges of wilful violence on a child under fifteen years of age, by a person in a position of authority, not entailing unfitness for work for more than eight days (an offence punishable under Article 222-13 of the Criminal Code) in respect of the second applicant, and on charges of subjecting a person who is vulnerable or in a position of dependence to working conditions (in respect of the first applicant) or living conditions (in respect of both applicants) incompatible with human dignity (offences punishable under Articles 225-14 and 225-15 of the Criminal Code). In the same order, the investigating judge requested the termination of the proceedings against Mr M. concerning the charges of offences against human dignity. 38. On 7 February 2001 the applicants appealed against the decision to terminate that part of the proceedings. 39. On 18 December 2002 the Investigation Division of the Versailles Court of Appeal ordered further inquiries to determine the exact scope and measure of the lifting of Mr M.’s immunity by the Director General of UNESCO, and whether it applied to the preliminary investigation alone or to the proceedings as a whole. 40. On 30 April 2003 the Investigation Division of the Versailles Court of Appeal set aside the order of 5 February 2001 terminating part of the proceedings and ordered Mr M.’s committal for trial by the criminal court for having subjected the applicants, and also their three younger sisters, to treatment contrary to human dignity. As to the scope of the lifting of Mr M.’s immunity, the court found that no immunity applied, for the following reasons: “The explicit terms of the letter addressed to the court on 20 January 2003 by the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Minister, who has authority to interpret and measure the scope of the immunity granted to diplomats, dispel all uncertainty about the situation of Mr [M.]; the latter ceased to be a UNESCO staff member on 30 November 2001; as the deeds in question were not committed in the course of his duties, he no longer enjoys diplomatic immunity; there is accordingly no obstacle to his prosecution;” 41. Mr M. appealed against that ruling. 42. On 12 April 2005 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation confirmed that Mr M. did not enjoy diplomatic immunity, but set aside the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 30 April 2003 in so far as it had ordered Mr. M.’s committal for trial for offences committed against the applicants’ three sisters, as this was outside the remit of the investigating judge. 43. On 22 January 2007 the Nanterre Criminal Court rejected the objections as to admissibility raised by Mr and Mrs M. based on their diplomatic immunity. It adjourned the case to a hearing on 17 September 2007 to rule on the merits. 44. In a judgment of 17 September 2007 the Nanterre Criminal Court found Mr and Mrs M. guilty as charged. Mr M. was sentenced to twelve months’ imprisonment, suspended, and fined 10,000 euros (EUR). Mrs M. was sentenced to fifteen months’ imprisonment, suspended, and fined EUR 10,000. The couple were jointly ordered to pay the first applicant EUR 24,000 in damages, and the second applicant one symbolic euro, as she had requested. The relevant passages of the judgment read as follows: “... It appears from the information available that [the applicants], who found themselves in a situation of total dependence at the time, who were orphans and minors and whose papers had been taken away, were housed by their uncle and aunt in deplorable conditions of hygiene in an unheated, insalubrious basement; the photos adduced by counsel for the civil parties ... show the state of the place they lived in from 1995 to 1999; they had no access to the bathroom and had to fetch a pail of water from the kitchen to wash themselves, and the elder sister [the first applicant] was used as a housemaid by the couple [Mr and Mrs M.] with no day off and no pay. It is further established that they did not pay for [the second applicant’s] school meals or travel card, obliging her to walk several kilometres to school along a road through woods. It is also established that the accused refused to give them the medical treatment they needed, even though [Mr M.] had registered them with the UNESCO social security scheme. Although some of the girls’ statements indicate that the role played by [Mr M.] was a rather passive one, probably to avoid having to stand up to his wife’s strong character, he could not have been unaware of the difference in the way his nieces and his own children were treated. His frequent absences from home could not have made him unaware of the situation. In addition, he refused to let the police take photos of the basement, and then took pains to have it very comfortably refurbished when released from police custody. That being so, the actus reus and mens rea of the offence against human dignity in respect of the two accused are made out and they must be convicted.” 45. Mr and Mrs M. appealed against that judgment on 24 and 25 September 2007. 46. On 29 June 2009 the Versailles Court of Appeal set aside the judgment on the charge of subjecting several vulnerable people, including at least one minor, to indecent living and working conditions, acquitted the defendants of that charge and dismissed the applicants’ claims for compensation for the damage suffered in respect of that charge. However, it upheld the guilty finding against Mrs M. on the charge of aggravated wilful violence against the second applicant. She was fined EUR 1,500 and ordered to pay one euro in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 47. The relevant passages of the judgment read as follows: “The charge of subjecting several vulnerable people, including at least one minor, to indecent living and working conditions: It is not disputed that [Mrs M.] went to fetch her nieces at a time when a civil war was raging in Burundi that left 250,000 people dead and orphaned about 50,000 children; ... the elements of the proceedings show that [Mr and Mrs M.] paid their nieces’ fare from Burundi to France; this shows that their concern was to protect these members of their family by placing the children out of harm’s way; ... Under Article 225-14 of the Criminal Code in force at the material time, offences against human dignity were characterised by the fact of abusing a person’s vulnerability or situation of dependence to subject them to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity, and were punishable by two years’ imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 francs (FRF); the legislation now in force punishes such offences more severely and gives them a broader definition; ... the new, harsher law cannot be applied retroactively; In the instant case, while the living and domestic working conditions were poor, uncomfortable and blameworthy, they cannot be qualified as degrading in the context and the circumstances of family solidarity with no intention of economic gain or of exploiting another’s work; the living and working conditions the defendants gave their nieces were not intended to debase them as human beings or to violate their fundamental rights, but obeyed a duty to help them; ... [Mr and Mrs M.] cannot be blamed for not having asked their own children, who shared their rooms, ... to give up their comfort; and they cannot reasonably be blamed for giving more to their own children than to their nieces; ... The case materials show that the boiler which heated the house was in the basement where the complainants lived and the temperature recorded in their room during the investigation was in excess of 20oC; As stated by the defendants’ daughter ... and confirmed by [the second applicant], the aunt had not formally denied them access to the bathroom, but simply wanted to rationalise its use because of the large number of people who had to use it; ... ... even though more could have been done to secure [the first applicant’s] integration, [Mrs M.] did call the welfare services for help; the fact that [the first applicant], who did not speak French and did not want to go to school, was required to play an active part in the housework as the eldest sister, even without pay, did not amount to working conditions incompatible with human dignity, or slave labour, or violation of any fundamental personal rights, but rather to repayment for her having been permanently taken into the home and care of an already large family; there is no evidence in the case file that [Mr and Mrs M.] stood to make any financial gain by taking their nieces into their home and care, for they were an extra financial burden for them, taken on out of moral obligation; According to the testimony, the living and working conditions were compatible with [the applicants’] human dignity; and it has not been established that the defendants took advantage of the vulnerability of their orphaned nieces or the fact that they were dependent on them; Therefore, as the mens rea of the charge of subjecting several vulnerable people, including at least one minor, to indecent living and working conditions has not been made out, the constituent elements of the offence have not been established and the judgment in respect of this charge must be set aside ... The charges against [Mrs M.] of wilful violence with two aggravating circumstances on [the second applicant], a child under 15 years of age, by a person in a position of authority: [The second applicant] told the police that her aunt hit her when she asked for a travel card or when her uncle bought her one ...; she also alleged that she was slapped when she accidentally dropped a plate; on one occasion her aunt allegedly threatened to hit her with a broom and on another occasion she violently scratched her hand; ... There is no doubt that [the second applicant] was under fifteen years of age between January 1995 and 10 December 1998, and that she was an orphan under the authority of her aunt, who had taken her in; the investigation established that [Mrs M.] shouted at [the second applicant], scolded her and threatened to send her back to Africa; The facts are established ...; the charge is made out in all its elements ... ; the judgment convicting [Mrs M.] of aggravated violence must be upheld ...” 48. The applicants appealed against that judgment on 3 July 2009. Mrs M. also appealed. The Principal Public Prosecutor did not appeal. 49. On 23 June 2010 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation rejected the appeals lodged by the applicants and Mrs M. The relevant passage from the judgment reads as follows: “The terms of the impugned judgment place the Court of Cassation in a position to affirm that the Court of Appeal, for reasons which are neither insufficient nor contradictory and which address the essential grounds raised in the pleadings submitted to it, stated the reasons for its decision that, in the light of the evidence before it, the charge of subjecting vulnerable or dependent people, including at least one minor, to living or working conditions incompatible with human dignity had not been made out against the accused, and had thus justified its decision dismissing the claims of the civil parties. ...” “Abusing a person’s vulnerable or dependent situation to obtain the performance of unpaid services or services against which a payment is made which clearly bears no relation to the amount of work performed is punished by two years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 500,000 francs.” “Abusing a person’s vulnerable or dependent situation by subjecting him or her to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity is punished by two years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 500,000 francs.” “The offences under articles 225-13 and 225-14 are punished by five years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 1,000,000 francs when they are committed against more than one person.” “Obtaining the performance of unpaid services or services against which a payment is made which clearly bears no relation to the amount of work performed from a person whose vulnerability or dependence is obvious or known to the offender is punished by five years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 150,000 euros.” “Subjecting a person whose vulnerability or dependence is obvious or known to the offender to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity is punished by five years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 150,000 euros.” “The offences under articles 225-13 and 225-14 are punished by seven years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 200,000 euros when they are committed against more than one person. Where they are committed against a minor, they are punished by seven years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 200,000 euros. Where they are committed against two or more people, one or more of whom are minors, they are punished by 10 years’ imprisonment and by a fine of 300,000 euros.” “For the application of articles 225-13 and 225-14, minors or people who have been victims of the acts described by these articles upon their arrival on French national territory are considered to be vulnerable or in a situation of dependence.” 50. Court of Cassation, appeal no. 08-80787, 13 January 2009: “... As to the single ground for appeal based on the violation of Article 4 of the European Court of Human Rights, and of Articles 225-14 of the Criminal Code, 1382 of the Civil Code, 2, 591 and 593 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; In so far as the judgment acquitted Affiba Z... of the charge of subjecting a vulnerable or dependent person to working or living conditions incompatible with human dignity; ... Considering that according to the case file Affiba Z..., who employed and housed Marthe X..., who was born on 22 March 1979 in Côte-d’Ivoire, from December 1994, the date of her illegal arrival in France at the age of 15 and a half, until 2000, was sent before the criminal court on charges of aiding unlawful entry and residence, employing an alien with no work permit, obtaining unpaid services from a vulnerable person and subjecting that person to working and living conditions incompatible with human dignity; that the impugned judgment, ruling on the appeals lodged by the accused, the civil party and the public prosecutor, upheld the judgment in so far as it found Affiba Z... guilty of the first three charges and acquitted her of the last charge; Considering that, for the reasons given and adopted, while Marthe X..., whose passport Affiba Z... took from her, had been made to do domestic chores on a permanent basis, with no holidays, in exchange for a little pocket money or subsidies paid in Côte-d’Ivoire, the judgment, in upholding the acquittal, took into account that the young woman had been housed in the same conditions as the family and the accused had shown true affection towards her, and the judges concluded that there had been no offence against human dignity; However, in so ruling when all forced labour is incompatible with human dignity, the Court of Appeal failed to draw the legal conclusions of its own findings and to justify its decision vis-à-vis the above-mentioned texts; ... Quashes the above judgment of the Paris Court of Appeal ... in respect of the civil action ...” 51. The Court refers to paragraphs 49 to 51 of the Siliadin v. France judgment (no. 73316/01, ECHR 2005VII) and to paragraphs 137 to 174 of the Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia judgment (no. 25965/04, ECHR 2010 (extracts)), which present the relevant provisions of the international conventions concerning forced labour, servitude, slavery and human trafficking (Geneva Convention of 25 September 1926 prohibiting slavery; Convention no. 29 of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) of 28 June 1930, on forced labour; Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery of 30 April 1956; Convention on the Rights of the Child of 20 November 1989; Additional Protocol to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime, known as the “Palermo Protocol”, of December 2000; Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings, of 16 May 2005) and the relevant extracts from the Council of Europe’s work on the subject (Recommendations 1523 of 26 June 2001 and 1623 of 22 June 2004 of the Parliamentary Assembly, explanatory report of the Council of Europe Convention on action against trafficking in human beings). 52. The following extracts from “The cost of coercion: global report under the follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work”, adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1999: “24. The ILO’s definition of forced labour comprises two basic elements: the work or service is exacted under the menace of a penalty and it is undertaken involuntarily. The work of the ILO supervisory bodies has served to clarify both of these elements. The penalty does not need to be in the form of penal sanctions, but may also take the form of a loss of rights and privileges. Moreover, the menace of a penalty can take many different forms. Arguably, its most extreme form involves physical violence or restraint, or even death threats addressed to the victim or relatives. There can also be subtler forms of menace, sometimes of a psychological nature. Situations examined by the ILO have included threats to denounce victims to the police or immigration authorities when their employment status is illegal, or denunciation to village elders in the case of girls forced to prostitute themselves in distant cities. Other penalties can be of a financial nature, including economic penalties linked to debts. Employers sometimes also require workers to hand over their identity papers, and may use the threat of confiscation of these documents in order to exact forced labour. 25. As regards “voluntary offer”, the ILO supervisory bodies have touched on a range of aspects including: the form and subject matter of consent; the role of external constraints or indirect coercion; and the possibility of revoking freely-given consent. Here too, there can be many subtle forms of coercion. Many victims enter forced labour situations initially out of their own choice, albeit through fraud and deception, only to discover later that they are not free to withdraw their labour, owing to legal, physical or psychological coercion. Initial consent may be considered irrelevant when deception or fraud has been used to obtain it.”",['4'],"['4-1', '4-2']",[],['4'],"['4-1', '4-2']",[],1

On 7 June 1996, at approximately 6.00 a.m., two detective police officers left Limerick city in an unmarked police car escorting a post office van carrying significant sums of money on its way to Adare village, Co. Limerick. When the two vehicles arrived at the post office in Adare, the police car was rammed from behind by a stolen vehicle and immediately surrounded by five heavily armed and masked individuals dressed in paramilitary style uniforms. One of the five opened fire at point blank range on the police officers. One of those officers died instantly and the other was seriously wounded. 9. The police suspected a local unit of the Irish Republican Army (an unlawful paramilitary organisation known as the IRA) and the IRA later claimed responsibility for the murder. It was also suspected by the police that, on the night prior to the attack in Adare, the stolen vehicle together with all firearms and ammunition used in the attempted robbery had been stored in a safe house in Patrickswell, Co. Limerick. As part of the investigation that followed, a number of persons suspected of being members of the local unit of the IRA were arrested and charged, including the applicant’s brother who was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery (in relation to the Adare incident), possession of ammunition and of membership of the IRA. A total of 63 persons were arrested and asked to account for their movements at particular times surrounding the attack, including the remaining members of the applicant’s family except his two sisters. All of those persons who were asked to account for their movements did so. 10. On 19 July 1996 at 9.30 a.m. the applicant, who resided in the family home in Patrickswell, Co. Limerick, was arrested under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 (""the 1939 Act"") on suspicion of being a member of the IRA contrary to section 21 of the 1939 Act. 11. He was questioned on eight occasions during two 24-hour consecutive periods of detention for which provision is made under section 30 of the 1939 Act. While in detention, he saw his solicitor on three occasions: between 11.12 a.m. and 11.36 a.m. on 19 July 1996 prior to his first interview with the police; between 5.54 p.m. and 6.27 p.m. on 19 July 1996 and between 1.28 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. on 20 July 1996. That solicitor did not attend the applicant’s interviews with the police. 12. At the beginning of the interviews, the applicant was cautioned that he was not obliged to say anything, but that anything he did say would be taken down in writing and could be given in evidence. Many of the questions put to the applicant related to the attack in Adare and to his alleged membership of the IRA. On several occasions during those interviews he was also requested to account for his movements during certain periods of time on 6 and 7 June 1996 immediately before, during and after the incident in Adare. In being so requested, he was informed by the questioning police officers that a failure to provide this information would constitute an offence under section 52 of the 1939 Act for which the potential penalty was six months’ imprisonment. The applicant was also informed, on certain occasions only, that the initial caution given to him did not apply as he was obliged to respond under section 52 of the 1939 Act. 13. The applicant denied any connection with the events in Adare, indicated that he was in London when he heard the news of the murder and otherwise refused to give an account of his movements stating, on one occasion, that he had been advised by his solicitor not to answer questions. 14. On 17 January 1997 he was charged, pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act, on three counts of refusing to give an account of his movements. On 15 May 1997 the District Court dismissed one charge, he was convicted on the second charge (a section 52 request made on 21 July 1996) and no ruling was made on the remaining charge. The applicant was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. 15. The applicant appealed against conviction and sentence to the Circuit Court and was released on bail pending the appeal. He appealed on the basis, inter alia, of an overlap in the times referred to in the charge which was dismissed and the charge on which he was convicted. In early October 1997 the Circuit Court rejected this part of his appeal. When the Circuit Court sat on 20 January 1998 to hear the applicant’s submissions on sentence, he withdrew that portion of the appeal which was then struck out. The applicant was detained immediately to serve his prison sentence and was released on 4 June 1998. 16. In February 1999 the applicant’s brother pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery and the remaining charges were not proceeded with. Four other men pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of the detective police officer and the wounding of his colleague in Adare, Co. Limerick. 17. Article 38(1) of the Irish Constitution provides that no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law. By Article 40, the State guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions. 18. The Offences Against the State Act 1939 (“the 1939 Act”) is described in its long (explanatory) title as an Act to make provision for actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and, for that purpose, to provide for the punishment of persons guilty of offences against the State, and to establish Special Criminal Courts. 19. Section 21 of the 1939 Act makes it an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation as defined in the Act. 20. Section 30 deals with the arrest and detention of suspected persons and provides that a member of the police can arrest and detain a person whom he suspects of having committed an offence under the 1939 Act or an offence scheduled under Part V of the 1939 Act (the scheduled offences are mainly offences under the firearms and explosive substances’ legislation). This power of arrest is a permanent power so that it is not dependent on a section 35 proclamation (see the following paragraph). 21. Section 35 of the 1939 Act provides that Part V of that Act (which establishes the Special Criminal Courts and contains section 52) is to come into force by means of a proclamation by the Government made when the Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order, and when the Government therefore makes and publishes a proclamation to that effect. The proclamation was made in 1972 and is still in force. Accordingly, section 52 of the 1939 Act has been in force since 1972 to date. 22. By section 36 of the 1939 Act the Government may declare that a particular class or kind of offence is a scheduled offence for the purpose of the 1939 Act and such offences are to be tried by the Special Criminal Courts established under section 38 of the 1939 Act. 23. Section 52 of the 1939 Act reads as follows: “1. Whenever a person is detained in custody under the provisions in that behalf contained in Part IV of this Act, any member of the <police> may demand of such person, at any time while he is so detained, a full account of such person’s movements and actions during any specified period and all information in his possession in relation to the commission or intended commission by another person of any offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or any scheduled offence. 2. If any person, of whom any such account or information as is mentioned in the foregoing sub-section of this section is demanded under that sub-section by a member of the <police>, fails or refuses to give to such member such account or any such information or gives to such member any account or information which is false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.” 24. Under the terms of the Good Friday Peace Agreement of 10 April 1998, the Government committed to initiating a wide ranging review of, inter alia, the 1939 Act with a view to reform and dispensing with those elements of the 1939 Act which would no longer be required. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform has, with Government approval, established a committee to examine all aspects of the Offences Against the State Acts and to report to the Minister with recommendations for reform. The Committee has commenced its work. 25. In the case of the People (Director of Public Prosecutions) v. McGowan (1979 IR 45) the accused had been arrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act and had made certain statements to the police. The defence argued that because of the basis of his arrest (section 30), the existence of section 52 of the 1939 Act and even though no section 52 requests had actually been made, the accused was bound under penalty to give an account of his movements. Accordingly, the statements which had been made by him were involuntary and not therefore admissible. The Court did not find this argument persuasive since no section 52 requests had in fact been made. It went to point out that, even if section 52 had been invoked by the police, the defence submission was not well-founded because of previous Irish case-law which had held that statements obtained in accordance with Irish law, even a law which made it a criminal offence to refuse to answer, were not inadmissible in any legal proceedings. 26. The Garda Siochana (police) Handbook contains relevant legislation and commentaries and is published by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland in association with the Garda Siochana. The commentary on section 52 of the 1939 Act in the sixth edition (1991) provides as follows: “The fact that the accused is bound under threat of penalty to answer questions lawfully put under section 52 does not render the resultant answers or statements inadmissible in evidence” The judicial authority for that proposition was noted in the handbook as being found in the above-cited McGowan case and the earlier Irish case-law approved in the McGowan case. 27. In the case of Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General ([1994] 2 ILRM), two individuals had been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment pursuant to section 52 of the 1939 Act for failing to give an account of their movements. The High Court rejected their challenge to the constitutionality of section 52, considering that section 52 constituted a proportionate interference with those persons’ right to silence guaranteed by Article 38 of the Constitution: the objective was to assist police investigations into serious crimes of a subversive nature involving the security of the State; the restrictions were not considered arbitrary or irrational; and other legal protections were available to persons in custody under section 30 of the 1939 Act which minimised the risk of an accused wrongfully confessing to a crime and safeguarded against the possible abuse of the powers provided by section 52 of the 1939 Act. Those protections were listed by the High Court: the requirement that a police officer must have a bona fide suspicion prior to arrest; the obligatory informing of the suspect of the offences under the 1939 Act and/or of the scheduled offences of which he is suspected; the right to legal assistance when reasonably requested; the right to medical assistance; the right of access to court; the right to remain silent and to be told of that right; the obligations to provide appropriate cautions to detainees and to abstain from cross-examining a person in detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act and from unfair and oppressive questioning of such detainees; and the conditions attaching to any extension of the length of detention under section 30 of the 1939 Act. The Supreme Court rejected the appeal (Anthony Heaney and William McGuinness v. Ireland and the Attorney General [1996] IR 580). It noted that section 52 of the 1939 Act was silent on the question of the later use of statements made pursuant to requests of the police under that section. While it noted that the Court of Criminal Appeal had suggested in the above-cited McGowan case that information lawfully obtained under Section 52 might be later used in evidence, the Supreme Court expressly reserved its position as to whether that view was correct or not. The Supreme Court pointed out that the right to silence was a corollary to the freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40 of the Constitution. The relevant assessment was, therefore, to consider the proportionality of the restriction on the right to silence in view of the public order exception to Article 40 of the Constitution. It noted that the 1939 Act was aimed at actions and conduct calculated to undermine public order and the authority of the State and that the proclamation made under section 35 of the 1939 Act remained in force. As to whether section 52 restricted the right to silence more than was necessary in light of the disorder against which the State was attempting to protect the public, the court noted that an innocent person had nothing to fear from giving an account of his or her movements even though such a person may wish, nevertheless, to take a stand on grounds of principle and to assert his or her constitutional rights. However, it considered that the entitlement of citizens to take such a stand must yield to the right of the State to protect itself. The entitlement of those, with something relevant to disclose concerning the commission of a crime, to remain silent must be regarded as of an even lesser order. 28. In the case of National Irish Bank Ltd (In the matter of National Irish Bank Ltd and the Companies Act 1990, 1999 1 ILRM 321, at 343) the Supreme Court found that a confession of a bank official obtained by Inspectors as a result of the exercise by them of their powers under Section 10 of the Companies Act 1990 would not, in general, be admissible at a subsequent criminal trial of that official unless, in any particular case, the trial judge was satisfied that the confession was voluntary. The Supreme Court considered that compelling a person to confess and then convicting that person on the basis of the compelled confession would be contrary to Article 38 of the Constitution. That court also found that any other evidence obtained as a result of information provided under section 52 of the 1939 Act would be admitted in evidence in a subsequent trial if the trial judge considered, in all the circumstances, that it would be just and fair to admit it.",['6'],"['6-1', '6-2']",[],[],[],[],1

LITHUANIA,3,Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);Violation of Art. 8;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,,"8. The applicant was born in 1972. He lives in Šiauliai. 9. The applicant, a former police investigator, was suspected of abuse of office and bribery. His detention on remand was ordered by the Šiauliai City District Court on 12 March 1999 on the fear of his absconding and influencing witnesses. His remand in custody was thereafter prolonged. 10. On 3 October 2000 the Šiauliai Regional Court convicted the applicant of abuse of office and bribery, sentencing him to eight years’ imprisonment. On 29 June 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld the lower judgment. On 18 December 2001 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s cassation appeal in the case. The sentence was subsequently reduced in view of an amnesty law. The applicant was released from prison after having completed the sentence on 18 August 2003. 11. According to the applicant, all his letters to and from the State authorities, non-governmental organisations as well private persons - namely his family, relatives, friends and legal counsel - were opened up and read in his absence while he was in the Šiauliai remand prison during the period from 12 March 1999 until 20 July 2001. The applicant states that a total of 362 of his letters had been opened and read. The applicant has submitted a letter addressed to his lawyer by the Šiauliai remand prison administration on 18 February 2004, attesting that during the period from 15 March 1999 to 20 July 2001 the applicant had sent letters to 241 addressees, including the State authorities, NGOs, the European Court of Human Rights, and various third persons. All of these letters were listed in detail by the prison administration, with reference to their date, addressee, and their number in the applicant’s file. 12. Article 22 of the Constitution guarantees the right to respect for one’s private life, family life and correspondence. According to Article 15 of the Detention on Remand Act 1996 and Rule 72 of the Remand Prisons Internal Rules 1996, which were applicable at the material time, remanded persons’ letters could be subject to censorship. Rule 75 of the Remand Prisons Internal Rules provides that the remand centre administration cannot open letters of detainees addressed to the European Court of Human Rights if those letters were given to the administration to be sent in a closed envelope. Rule 83 provides that the remand prison administration shall familiarise the detainee with a reply to his correspondence within three days following receipt of the letter addressed to the detainee. Therefore, all letters received by the detainees are not given to them and are kept in their files by the remand centre administration.",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The complaints raised in this application arise out of the Turkish military operations in northern Cyprus in July and August 1974 and the continuing division of the territory of Cyprus. These events gave rise to four applications by the Government of Cyprus against the respondent State, which have led to various findings of violations of the Convention. The history is set out in the Court’s judgment in Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, §§ 13-18, ECHR 2001IV; hereinafter “the fourth inter-State case”) and the Court sees no reason for repetition. 21. The facts are disputed by the parties. The Court notes that the summary of their versions of events given in the Chamber judgment have not been; these are in large part reproduced below, with the addition of some new information submitted by the parties and identified as such in the text. 22. The first applicant, an ironmonger, was born in 1947; he has been considered missing since 1974. His wife, the second applicant, was born in 1949 and resided in Lymbia. 23. In July 1974 the first applicant, responding to the declared general mobilisation, enlisted as a reservist in the 305 Reservists Battalion which had its headquarters in Dhali village. On 8 to 9 August 1974 the reserve soldiers of the 305 Reservists Battalion, among them the applicant, took up the manning of Cypriot outposts along the front line opposite the Turkish military forces which extended between Mia Milia and Koutsovendis. 24. On the morning of 14 August 1974, Turkish military forces, supported by tanks and air cover, launched an attack against the Cypriot area where the applicant and his battalion were serving. The Cypriot line of defence was broken and the Turkish military forces began advancing towards the area of Mia Milia; the Cypriot forces began retreating and dispersed in all directions. After a while the area was captured by the Turkish military forces and the applicant was trapped within. There has been no trace of the applicant since. 25. Mr Christakis Ioannou of Pano Dhikomo and now of Stavros Refugee Camp Strovolos, who had been a prisoner of the Turkish military forces and/or the Turkish authorities, stated that at Adana Prison in Turkey, where he had been taken on 31 August 1974, there were another forty persons in the same room for three to four days. Among them was the applicant. After the said period they were split up and he had not seen the applicant since. 26. The first applicant, a student, was born in 1954; he has been considered missing since 1974. His father, the second applicant, was born in 1907 and resided in Nicosia. 27. In July 1974 the first applicant was serving as a second lieutenant in the 1st Company of the 256 Infantry Battalion stationed at Xeros. On about 30 July 1974 the battalion moved to the Lapithos area. The soldiers were split up into various groups; the applicant’s group, consisting of ten men, was ordered to take up positions on the Lapithos heights. 28. On 5 August 1974 Turkish forces launched a strong attack from all sides against the Cypriot forces’ positions while other Turkish troops managed to encircle Lapithos. Owing to the Turkish superiority in men and weapons the Cypriot forces were ordered to retreat towards the centre of the village to the company base. The applicant arrived there with his men and was informed by the inhabitants that Lapithos was surrounded by Turkish troops. They hid their weapons in an orchard and put on civilian clothing. The same afternoon the applicant and others attempted unsuccessfully to break through the Turkish lines. They then returned to Lapithos where they spent the night. At about 9 a.m. on 6 August 1974 Turkish troops entered Lapithos and started extensive house-to-house searches. The applicant and his comrades were warned by the villagers and they dispersed in order to avoid capture. Since then, none of the members of the group has seen the applicant. 29. Nicos Th. Tampas of the 256 Infantry Battalion, also on the Lapithos heights on 5 August 1974, mentioned in a statement that at approximately 9 p.m. on 6 August 1974 he entered a warehouse in the village where he found the applicant looking after a wounded man. After talking with the applicant, he left. That was the last time that he saw the applicant. He was himself arrested by the Turks on 9 August 1974 in Lapithos, detained in various prisons in Cyprus and Turkey and released on 22 October 1974. 30. Christodoulos Panyi of Vatyli, now of Strovolos, in his statement declared that while he was a prisoner in Adana Prison he saw and recognised the applicant, whom he had previously met. 31. The first applicant, a student, was born in 1954; he has been considered missing since 1974. His father, the second applicant, was born in 1929 and resided in Nicosia. 32. In July 1973 the first applicant enlisted to do his national service. He was posted to the 70 Engineers Battalion. On 5 August 1974, a section of the battalion, including the applicant, was sent on a mission in the Lapithos and Karavas area (Kyrenia district). The men spent the night at Lapithos and intended to complete the mission the following morning. 33. At about 4.30 a.m. on 6 August 1974 the Turkish Army launched a fullscale attack from all sides in the Karavas and Lapithos area. The applicant’s group leader ordered his men to split up into three groups and to withdraw towards Vasilia (also in the Kyrenia district). The applicant was in one of the groups which intended to withdraw by following a route along the coast. 34. The men first reached the main NicosiaKyrenia road near the “Airkotissa” restaurant. While resting, they heard shouting and the group leader sent the applicant and another soldier to investigate. As they had not returned after about fifteen minutes the remainder of the group left for Panagra (also in the Kyrenia district). On their way, they were ambushed by Turkish soldiers and the remaining group dispersed. 35. Costas A. Sophocleous, of Nicosia, stated that, when he was a prisoner in Turkey from 30 July until 28 October 1974, he had met the applicant. They were in the same prison in Turkey and were subsequently transferred to Cyprus, at which point he had been released but not the applicant. 36. Alexandros Papamichael, of Limassol, stated that he recognised the first applicant from a photograph that was shown to him by the second applicant and he had been with him in Adana Prison. 37. Finally, the second applicant mentioned in a signed statement that he identified his missing son in a photograph published in Athinaiki, a Greek newspaper, on 28 September 1974. In this photograph Greek Cypriot prisoners were shown on a boat en route to Turkey. 38. The first applicant, a photographer, was born in 1953; he has been considered missing since 1974. His mother, the second applicant, was born in 1914 and resided in Nicosia. 39. On 20 July 1974 the first applicant enlisted as a reservist. He was posted to the 1st Company of the 301 Infantry Battalion. On 22 July the whole battalion was ordered to move on the following day to the area of Ayios Ermolaos. The 1st Company took up defensive positions at a height called “Kalambaki”, near the Turkish Cypriot village of Pileri. 40. At about 4.30 a.m. on 26 July 1974 the 1st Company came under attack from the Turkish Cypriot villages of KriniPileri. The Turkish military forces consisted of a paratroop battalion, twenty tanks and high-angle guns. They succeeded in breaking through the Cypriot lines and infiltrated the right flank of the 1st Company in order to encircle it. The commander ordered the company to regroup at the village of Sysklepos; from there they were ordered to regroup at Kontemenos, where they arrived at about 3 p.m. After a roll call they found out that six soldiers of the 1st Company were absent, including the applicant. The area in which the 1st Company had been initially stationed was captured by the Turkish military forces. 41. Mr Nicos Nicolaou of Strovolos, who was a prisoner at Adana in September 1974, stated that one day he heard a Turk calling the applicant’s name. He also saw the applicant whom he happened to know previously and noticed that he was lame in one leg. On 11 September 1974 Mr Nicolaou was taken to Antiyama Prison in Turkey and he had not seen the applicant since. 42. The first applicant, a student, was born in 1955; he has been considered missing since 1974. His mother, the second applicant, was born in 1935 and resided in Limassol. 43. In 1972 the first applicant enlisted in the National Guard to do his military service. 44. On 23 July 1974 the applicant’s father was informed by Andreas Komodromos that the applicant had left Synchari with the men of the Headquarters Company and had gone to Aglandjia. 45. On 24 July 1974 Nikiforos Kominis with seventeen soldiers, including the applicant, set out from Aglandjia in two vehicles to reconnoitre the ground of the Koutsovendis-Vounos area. Three buses were seen driving along a street from the direction of Vounos village. An officer by the name of Votas ordered three or four soldiers to search the buses. The buses were full of Turkish soldiers who started firing at the Greek Cypriot men. The applicant was wounded in the right hand and on the left side of his ribs. Mr Andreas Komodromos cleaned his wounds with water, loaded his gun and told him to go back. After that the applicant was not seen again by his unit. 46. According to the statement of Yiannis Melissis, who had been a prisoner of the Turks at Adana and Amasia in September 1974, he happened to meet the applicant during his captivity. They both stayed with others in cell no. 9 until 18 September. They had chatted together every day and became friends. On 18 September Yiannis Melissis was brought back to Cyprus and was released on 21 September 1974. The applicant had given him a letter to pass on to his father but he left it in his pocket when he changed his clothes. All the clothes belonging to the prisoners were burned. 47. The second applicant in her statement mentioned that she had recognised her son in a photograph that was published in the Greek newspaper Athinaiki on 28 September 1974 and showed Cypriot prisoners being transported to Turkey on a Turkish destroyer in July 1974. 48. The first applicant, a car mechanic, was born in 1951; he has been considered missing since 1974. His father, the second applicant, was born in 1921 and resided in Strovolos. 49. In July 1974, in response to the general mobilisation, the first applicant enlisted as a reserve sergeant in the Headquarters Company of the 251 Infantry Battalion. 50. On 20 July 1974, all the men of the Headquarters Company, including the applicant, were trying to prevent the Turkish landing which was taking place in the area of “Pikro Nero”, Kyrenia. At around 12 noon on 21 July the Turkish military forces which had landed, supported by tanks and air cover, attacked the Cypriot forces that were defending the area. Owing to the superiority of the Turkish military forces in men and weapons the 251 Infantry Battalion was ordered to retreat towards Trimithi village. The applicant was present during the regrouping of the battalion. Two hours after the regrouping the commander of the battalion led his men out of Trimithi village, reaching a ravine between the villages of Ayios Georghios and Templos where they took up battle positions. A number of commandos of the 33rd Battalion arrived in the same ravine. At around 3 p.m. on 22 July 1974, Turkish military forces surrounded the Cypriot forces in the ravine and opened fire. The commander ordered a counterattack intending to break the Turkish military forces’ lines and retreat towards Kyrenia. No trace of the applicant was found during the counter-attack and retreat. 51. On 4 September 1974 the Special News Bulletin – a daily communication by the Turkish Cypriot administration – published a photograph of Greek Cypriot prisoners of war under the caption “Greek Cypriot prisoners of war having their lunch. Yesterday they were visited by a representative of the Turkish Red Crescent”. In that photograph the first applicant was identified by the second applicant. 52. A former prisoner, Mr Efstathios Selefcou, of Elio, now at Eylenja, in a signed statement to the Cypriot police said that during his transportation from Cyprus to Turkey he saw and talked to the first applicant, whom he knew very well since they had attended the same secondary school. 53. The first applicant, a bank employee, was born in 1938 and lived at Yialousa; he has been considered missing since 1974. His wife, the second applicant, was born in 1938 and resided in Nicosia. 54. On 18 August 1974 about three or four saloon cars, a bus and two tanks, all full of Turkish and Turkish Cypriot soldiers, turned up at Yialousa and stopped near the police station. The soldiers got out and ordered everyone to assemble at the nearby coffee house. About thirty-five persons gathered there. A Turkish officer told them that from that time they would be under Turkish administration and ordered them to make a census of the Greek Cypriot inhabitants of the village from the age of 7 to 70 and that he would be back on the following day to collect the lists. On the following day, the same civilian and military vehicles (tanks) returned. A number of Turks got out, marched to the coffee house and asked for the lists. Another group of Turkish soldiers was carrying out a house-to-house search. They imposed a curfew and, having taken the lists, they took with them for questioning nine persons, including the first applicant. They put them on a bus and drove them outside the village in the direction of Famagusta. 55. On the same day, Yialousa was visited by United Nations men to whom the arrest of the nine Greek Cypriots was reported by their co-villagers. 56. According to the applicants, representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross (“the ICRC”) in Cyprus visited Pavlides Garage in the Turkish-occupied sector of Nicosia and on 28 August 1974 recorded the names of twenty Greek Cypriots held there, including the nine persons from Yialousa (they cited document EZY284D). Costas M. Kaniou, Sofronios Mantis and Ioannis D. Constantis also saw the said detainees at the Pavlides Garage, during the same period that they were detained there; they were released later. 57. On 27 August 1974 a group of Turkish Cypriot civilians came to Yialousa looking for Pentelis Pantelides, Loizos Pallaris, Michael Sergides and Christakis Panayides. Having found them, they led them to the Savings Bank. After having emptied two safes they ordered that the third one should be opened, but they were told that the keys were with the applicant. Subsequently they left, having shut and sealed the outside door. After ten to twelve days the same group looked for the same persons and went again to the bank building. They had the two keys for the safe, which the applicant always carried with him. Loizos Pallaris opened the safe. The keys were in a leather case which the applicant used to carry, but his personal keys had been removed. The Turkish Cypriots took the contents of the safe, sealed the gate and left. 58. The first applicant, a moulder, was born in 1955; he has been considered missing since 1974. His father, the second applicant, was born in 1928 and resided in Strovolos. 59. In 1974 the first applicant was doing his national service in the 70 Engineers Battalion stationed in Nicosia. On 5 August 1974 a section of the battalion, including the applicant, was sent on a mission in the Karavas and Lapithos area. The men spent the night at Lapithos and intended to complete their mission the following morning. At about 4.30 a.m. on 6 August 1974 the Turkish military forces launched a fullscale attack from all sides in the area of Karavas and Lapithos. The commander ordered his men to split up into three groups, withdraw towards Vasilia and meet there. On their way they were ambushed by the Turkish military forces and in the confusion dispersed. 60. Later Mr Costas Themistocleous of Omorphita, now of Nicosia, who was a prisoner at Adana Prison, saw there the applicant, whom he had known from his childhood; this was on or about 17 October 1974, while he was about to return to Cyprus. They did not speak to each other but waved. 61. The first applicant was born in 1947; he has been considered missing since 1974. His wife, the second applicant, was born in 1949 and resided in Limassol. 62. On 20 July 1974, following the general mobilisation, the first applicant enlisted as a reservist in the 399 Infantry Battalion. He was put in the Support Company. On 22 July the battalion moved to the Mia Milia area to reinforce the Greek Cypriot forces and to man outposts on the front line. 63. On the morning of 14 August 1974 Turkish military forces, supported by tanks and air cover, launched a heavy attack against the Greek Cypriot forces in the area, where the applicant was with his battalion. Owing to the superiority of the Turkish military forces the Greek Cypriot defence line was broken, the Turkish military forces advanced towards the Mia Milia area, and the Greek Cypriot forces began to retreat. The area was, in a short period of time, occupied by the Turkish military forces and the applicant was trapped within. No trace of the applicant has been found since. 64. An ex-prisoner of war, Mr Costas Mena of Palaekythro, now at Korakou, stated that during his detention at Antiyama Prison in Turkey he had seen the applicant, who was detained in cell no. 9. On 18 October 1974 all the prisoners at Antiyama Prison were taken to Adana Prison. There they were all lined up in four rows. A Turkish military officer picked out some of the prisoners, including the applicant, who were taken away. Mr Mena had not seen the applicant since. 65. The respondent Government disputed that the applicants had been taken into captivity by the Turkish army during the military action in Cyprus in 1974. They considered that the inevitable conclusion from the information provided in the application forms was that all the alleged “missing persons”, except Savvas Hadjipanteli, were military personnel who died in action during the period July to August 1974. 66. The respondent Government noted that, since the introduction of these applications, files relating to the same “missing persons” had been submitted by the Government of Cyprus to the United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“the CMP”) in Cyprus during 1994 and 1995. In these files there were no assertions that these people had been seen in any of the prisons in Turkey. The names of the alleged witnesses listed in applications nos. 16064/90 (Christakis Ioannou), 16065/90 (Christodoulos Panyi), 16066/90 (Costas A. Sophocleous), 16068/90 (Nicos Nicolaou), 16069/90 (Yiannis Melissis), 16070/90 (Efstathios Selefcou), 16072/90 (Costas Themistocleous) and 16073/90 (Costas Mena) were not cited in support. The alleged sightings were therefore without foundation. 67. As regards Savvas Hadjipanteli (no. 16071/90), who was a civilian, the respondent Government noted that the ICRC had visited the Pavlides Garage where he had allegedly been held but his name, contrary to the applicants’ assertion, did not appear in the list of Greek Cypriots held. In any event, it was a transit centre where people were not held for more than a few days before being released or moved elsewhere. In the file submitted to the CMP, there was only a reference to witnesses seeing the key case which he was alleged to always carry on his person. The materials of the ICRC, who paid regular visits to prisoners and internees in Turkey, also showed that none of the alleged missing persons had been brought to Turkey or detained. All prisoners that had been taken to Turkey were repatriated between 16 September 1974 and 28 October 1974 and lists of those concerned had been handed over to the Greek Cypriot authorities. 68. As concerned the alleged identification of the missing persons in photographs, the Government pointed out that a scientific investigation of certain published photographs and documentary film had been carried out by Professor Pierre A. Margot of the Institute of Forensic Science and Criminology of the Law Faculty of the University of Lausanne at the request of the third member of the CMP. This had shown that it was extremely dubious that anyone could be identified from these documents and that any alleged identification by relatives was unreliable given the quality of the material and their emotional feelings. 69. The Government of Cyprus submitted that the first applicants went missing in areas under the control of the Turkish forces. 70. These two applicants had been brought with their units to the area of Mia Milia to man Cypriot outposts along the front line. On 14 August 1974 Turkish armed forces launched the attack which gained them control over the whole of northern and eastern Cyprus by 16 August 1974. When the Turkish forces broke through the Cypriot line of defence and advanced on Mia Milia, the Cypriot forces retreated and dispersed in all directions. The Turkish forces rapidly gained control of the entire surrounding area. Many Greek Cypriot soldiers, including the two applicants, were hemmed in and completely surrounded. They could not have escaped as the intervening Government would have known of their fate. 71. This applicant was in charge of the soldiers who were defending Lapithos. After the Turkish forces encircled Lapithos, the Greek Cypriot forces were ordered to retreat. The applicant’s group put on civilian clothing and unsuccessfully tried to break out of the village. When the Turkish forces entered the village the next morning, the applicant’s group dispersed to avoid capture. At about 9 p.m. on 6 August 1974, the applicant was seen by Nicos Th. Tampas in a warehouse tending a soldier with a head injury. Mr Tampas was later captured and detained. His was the last reported sighting of the first applicant. It was most likely that the first applicant had remained with the injured man and was taken into detention by the Turkish forces who were in control of the entire area. Only one man was known to have escaped from the village and he, unlike the first applicant, had local knowledge of the terrain. 72. Under attack from the Turkish army, the first applicant’s unit was ordered to split into three groups and withdraw westwards. The applicant’s group reached the Nicosia-Kyrenia road, 200 metres from the “Airkotissa” restaurant. The applicant and another man were sent to investigate shouting coming from the restaurant. After fifteen minutes when they did not return, the group left for Panagra. At the time that the applicant and the other soldier were sent to the restaurant, there were Turkish forces in the area. The most plausible explanation for the two men not returning, in the absence of any sound of fighting or shooting, was that they had been detained, either to prevent them giving away the Turkish positions, for information or as prisoners of war. 73. On 26 July 1974 the first applicant was discovered to be missing from his unit at roll call after they had broken through encircling Turkish forces. The area in which his unit had been stationed was captured by Turkish forces. Whatever happened to the applicant afterwards occurred in an area controlled by the Turkish forces. 74. This applicant was seen wounded in his right hand and on the left side of his ribcage after a clash between Greek Cypriot forces and three buses full of Turkish soldiers coming from Vounos village. His wounds were cleaned by a witness named Komodromos and he was told to make his way uphill with two other men, one of whom was also injured, to the monastery where the Greek Cypriot forces were. The other two men were discovered dead two days later when the Turkish forces withdrew. It was clear that the applicant had either been found dead by the Turkish forces or, as was more likely, found and detained in an injured condition. 75. This applicant was among those attempting to prevent the invasion of Kyrenia. Some individuals were identified as killed in the operation; the applicant was not among them. The intervening Government had no evidence that this applicant was dead. It had to be assumed that the applicant had been detained alive. 76. This was further corroborated by the photograph published in the Special News Bulletin, issued daily by the Turkish Cypriot administration, on 4 September 1974, of Greek Cypriot prisoners of war having their lunch. The first applicant was identified at the time by his father, the second applicant. 77. In their observations before the Grand Chamber, the intervening Government provided a copy of a statement dated 31 July 1976 by Efstathios Selefcou taken by a police officer which stated that while being carried as a prisoner on a ship from Cyprus to Turkey he had seen and spoken briefly to Eleftherios Thoma, whom he knew from school. They also provided a copy of the ICRC Central Tracing Agency sheet (ref. no. EZG 14023/2) according to which Thoma had been sighted in a Turkish army hospital in Mintzeli in mid-October 1974. The intervening Government explained that they had not provided this information to the CMP as it had no mandate to investigate outside the territory of Cyprus and a policy decision had been taken when submitting documents to the CMP on 7 June 1994 not to antagonise Turkey whose cooperation was necessary if the CMP was to begin effective operation. 78. By 16 August 1974 Turkish forces were in control of northern and eastern Cyprus, including the Karpas peninsula where the first applicant worked as general cashier in the Savings Bank in Yialousa. On 18 August Turkish and Turkish Cypriot soldiers arrived in the village and a Turkish officer ordered a census of the Greek Cypriots between 7 and 70 years of age. The next day, the lists were handed over and Turkish soldiers carried out searches. They left, taking with them on a bus, nine individuals, including the first applicant. This was reported by fellow villagers. 79. Turkish Cypriots came to the village in the circumstances reported by the applicants (see paragraphs 54-57 above). They had the two keys for a safe, which the first applicant always carried with him. It was highly probable that the Turkish Cypriots had obtained the keys by informing those holding the first applicant, showing that he was alive and in detention for at least nine days. There was some evidence that he was detained after those nine days, at least until 28 August 1974, at Pavlides Garage. 80. The list of persons seen by the ICRC detained at Pavlides Garage on 28 August 1974 included Savvis Kalli, which was the name under which this first applicant had been recorded (the first name being misspelled and the surname of his father (Kallis), as appearing on the first applicant’s identity card, also being misspelled). 81. An affidavit dated 6 November 2007 by Lakis N. Christolou, a lawyer of the firm representing the applicants in this application, was submitted to the Grand Chamber. It stated that the son of the missing man, Mr Georgios Hadjipanteli, recounted that at the end of 2005 he had met a Turkish Cypriot writer who had informed him that, while investigating disappearances, she had discovered evidence indicating that the nine missing persons from Yialousa had been buried near the Turkish Cypriot village of Galatia. When the son conveyed this information to the CMP he was informed that the inhabitants of Galatia had already given information to the CMP about the execution and burial of Greek Cypriot prisoners near their village. 82. This first applicant withdrew with his section from Lapithos towards Vasilia. They were ambushed by Turkish military forces and dispersed. There has been no news of the applicant since. The intervening Government had no knowledge of the first applicant, which meant that he had not escaped. Nor was there any evidence that he was killed in the ambush. It was more than likely that he had been detained by the Turkish armed forces. 83. In 2007, in the context of the activity of the CMP (see paragraphs 86-88 below), human remains were exhumed from a mass grave near the Turkish Cypriot village of Galatia in the Karpas area. After anthropological and genetic analyses, the remains of Savvas Hadjipanteli (named as the first applicant in application no. 16071/90) were identified, along with the remains of the other eight missing persons from Yialousa village and two other missing Greek Cypriots. The bodies of the nine missing persons from Yialousa were lined up next to each other in the grave, with two other bodies on top close to the ground surface. The forensic report dated 13 November 2007 detailed the process of exhumation and noted that it appeared to be a primary and synchronous burial site as the condition of the bodies indicated that they were buried while soft tissue was still present and placed in direct contact with each other. According to the report, the main object of the analysis of the human remains was their identification. 84. Several bullets from firearms were found in the grave. In regard to Savvas Hadjipanteli, the medical certificate for the cause of death, signed by a doctor on 12 July 2007, indicated bullet wounds to the skull and right arm and a wound to the right thigh. His family was notified and a religious funeral took place on 14 July 2007. 85. The CMP was officially set up in 1981. The following paragraphs are taken from the Commission’s Report in the fourth inter-State case (paragraphs 181-91): “181. ... According to its terms of reference, it ‘shall only look into cases of persons reported missing in the intercommunal fighting as well as in the events of July 1974 and afterwards’. Its tasks have been circumscribed as follows: ‘to draw up comprehensive lists of missing persons of both communities, specifying as appropriate whether they are alive or dead, and in the latter case approximate time of the deaths’. It was further specified that ‘the committee will not attempt to attribute responsibility for the deaths of any missing persons or make findings as to the cause of such deaths’ and that ‘no disinterment will take place under the aegis of this committee. The committee may refer requests for disinterment to the ICRC for processing under its customary procedures’. ‘All parties concerned’ are required to cooperate with the committee to ensure access throughout the island for its investigative work. Nothing is provided as regards investigations in mainland Turkey or concerning the Turkish armed forces in Cyprus. 182. The CMP consists of three members, one ‘humanitarian person’ being appointed by the Greek Cypriot side and one by the Turkish Cypriot side and the third member being an ‘official selected by the ICRC ... with the agreement of both sides and appointed by the Secretary-General of the United Nations’. 183. The CMP has no permanent chairman, the presidency rotating on a monthly basis between all three members. Decisions are to be taken by consensus to the extent possible. According to the procedural rules agreed upon in 1984, the procedure is to be conducted as follows: ‘1. Individual or collective cases will be presented to the CMP with all possible information. The CMP will refer each case to the side on whose territory the missing person disappeared; this side will undertake a complete research and present to the CMP a written report. It is the duty of the CMP members appointed by each side, or their assistants, to follow the enquiries undertaken on the territory of their side; the third member and/or his assistants will be fully admitted to participate in the enquiries. 2. The CMP will make case decisions on the basis of the elements furnished by both sides and by the Central Tracing Agency of the ICRC: presumed alive, dead, disappeared without visible or other traceable signs. 3. If the CMP is unable to reach a conclusion on the basis of the information presented, a supplementary investigation will be undertaken at the request of a CMP member. The third CMP member and/or his assistants will participate in each supplementary investigation, or, as the case may be, investigators recruited by the CMP with the agreement of both sides.’ 184. The 1984 rules state as ‘guiding principles’ that ‘investigations will be conducted in the sole interest of the families concerned and must therefore convince them. Every possible means will be used to trace the fate of the missing persons’. The families of missing persons may address communications to the committee which will be passed on to its appropriate member. That member will eventually provide the family with ‘final information as to the fate of a particular missing person’, but no interim information must be given by any member of the committee to the family of a missing person during the discussion of a particular case. 185. The committee’s entire proceedings and findings are strictly confidential, but it can issue public statements or reports without prejudice to this rule. According to the 1984 procedural rules, a press release will be issued at the close of a meeting or series of meetings and occasional progress reports will also be published. Individual members may make additional statements to the press or the media, provided they comply with the rule of confidentiality, avoid criticism or contradiction to the joint statement and any kind of propaganda. 186. Due to the strict confidentiality of the CMP’s procedure, no detailed information about the progress and results of its work is available. However, from the relevant sections of the regular progress reports on the UN Operation in Cyprus submitted by the UN Secretary-General to the Security Council it appears that the committee’s work started in May 1984 with a limited, equal number of cases on both sides (Doc. S/16596, of 1.6.1984, para. 51); that by 1986 an advanced stage had been reached in the investigation of the initial 168 individual cases, supplementary investigations being started in 40 cases in which reports had been submitted (Doc. S/18102/Add. 1, of 11 June 1986, para. 15); and that, while no difficulties were encountered as regards the organisation of interviews or visits in the field, real difficulties then arose by the lapse of time and, even more importantly, lack of cooperation by the witnesses. 187. This prompted the committee to issue a lengthy press release on 11 April 1990 (Doc. S/21340/Annex). There the committee stated that it considered the cooperation of the witnesses as absolutely fundamental, but that the witnesses were often reluctant, unwilling or unable to give full information as to their knowledge about the disappearance of a missing person. However, the committee could not compel a witness to talk. The explanation of the witnesses’ reluctance to testify was that they were afraid of incriminating themselves or others in disappearances, and this despite the witnesses being told by the committee that the information given would be kept strictly confidential and being reassured that they would ‘not be subject to any form of police or judicial prosecution’. The committee appealed to the parties concerned to encourage the witnesses to give the very fullest information in their knowledge. It further stated: ‘In order to further allay the fears of the witnesses, the committee, so as to give the strongest guarantees to the witnesses, is examining measures that could be taken to ensure that they would be immune from possible judicial and/or police proceedings solely in connection with the issue of missing persons and for any statement, written or oral, made for the committee in the pursuit of activities within its mandate.’ 188. In the same press release, the committee pointed out that it considered as legitimate the desire of the families to obtain identifiable remains of missing persons. However, despite systematic enquiries on burial places of missing persons, on both sides, it had not been successful in this respect. It recalled that according to its terms of reference it could not itself order disinterments. Moreover, while there was access to all evidence available, the committee had not reached the stage of finding a common denominator for the appreciation of the value of this evidence. Finally, the committee stated that it was considering the possibility of requesting that the two sides furnish it with basic information concerning the files of all missing persons, so as to allow it to have a global view of the whole problem. 189. In December 1990, the UN Secretary-General wrote a letter to the leaders of both sides observing that so far the committee had been given details on only about 15% of the cases and urging them to submit all cases. He further emphasised the importance of reaching consensus on the criteria that both sides would be ready to apply in their respective investigations. Moreover, the committee should consider modalities for sharing with affected families any meaningful information available (Doc. S/24050, of 31 May 1992, para. 38). On 4 October 1993, in a further letter to the leaders of both communities the UN Secretary-General noted that no improvement had been made and that the international community would not understand that the committee, nine years after it had become operational, remained unable to function effectively. Only 210 cases had been submitted by the Greek Cypriot side and only 318 by the Turkish Cypriot side. He again urged both sides to submit all cases without further delay and the committee to reach a consensus on the criteria for concluding its investigations (Doc. S/26777, of 22 November 1993, paras. 88-90). 190. On 17 May 1995 the UN Secretary-General, on the basis of a report of the CMP’s third member and proposals by both sides, put forward compromise proposals on criteria for concluding the investigations (Doc. S/1995/488, of 15 June 1995, para. 47), which were subsequently accepted by both sides (Doc. S/1995/1020, of 10 December 1995, para. 33). By December 1995, the Greek Cypriot side submitted all their case files (1493). However, the committee’s third member withdrew in March 1996 and the UN Secretary-General made it a condition for appointing a new one that certain outstanding questions, including classification of cases, sequence of investigations, priorities and expeditious collection of information on cases without known witnesses, be settled beforehand (Doc. S/1996/411, of 7 June 1996, para. 31). After being repeatedly urged to resolve these issues (Doc. S/1997/437, of 5 June 1997, paras. 24-25), both parties eventually came to an agreement on 31 July 1997 on the exchange of information on the location of graves of missing persons and return of their remains. They also requested the appointment of a new third member of the CMP (Doc. S/1997/962, of 4 December 1997, paras. 21 and 29-31). However, by June 1998, no progress had been made towards the implementation of this agreement. The UN Secretary-General noted in this context that the Turkish Cypriot side had claimed that victims of the coup d’état against Archbishop Makarios in 1974 were among the persons listed as missing and that this position deviated from the agreement (Doc. S/1998/488, of 10 June 1998, para. 23). 191. A new third member of the CMP had, by the time of the Commission’s report, been appointed (ibid. para. 24). The committee has not completed its investigations and accordingly the families of the missing persons have not been informed of the latter’s fate.” 86. From August 2006 the CMP began a substantial exhumation project on identified burial sites with a view to identifying the remains of bodies and ensuring their return to their families. A special unit to provide information to families was also set up. 87. According to the information provided by the respondent Government, 430 sets of remains had been located; 275 remains had been submitted for analysis and identification by the anthropological laboratory; since June 2007, 105 bodies had been identified (76 Greek Cypriots, 29 Turkish Cypriots); by 13 March 2008, 84 files of missing persons had been closed; by the date of the hearing, 5% of missing persons had been identified and their remains returned to their relatives for burial; by 10 September 2008, 180 sites had been visited by bi-communal teams (155 in the north, 25 in the south). 88. In the ongoing monitoring process concerning Cyprus v. Turkey ([GC], no. 25781/94, ECHR 2001IV), the Committee of Ministers looked at the question of missing persons and, inter alia: “2. considered that it was crucial that the current work of the CMP be carried out under the best possible conditions and without delay; 3. in consequence, while reaffirming that the execution of the judgment requires effective investigations, notes that these should not jeopardise the CMP’s mission; 4. considered that the sequence of measures to be taken within the framework of the effective investigations, and carrying out of the work of the CMP should take into consideration these two essential aims; 5. underlined in any event the urgent need for Turkish authorities to take concrete measures having in mind the effective investigations required by the judgment, in particular relating to the CMP’s access to all relevant information and places; 6. in that context, underlined, moreover the importance of preserving all the information obtained during the Programme of Exhumation and Identification carried out by the CMP; ...” 89. The Declaration provides, inter alia: “1. An act of enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity. It is condemned as a denial of the purposes of the Charter of the United Nations and as a grave and flagrant violation of the human rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and reaffirmed and developed in international instruments in this field. 2. Any act of enforced disappearance places the persons subjected thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicts severe suffering on them and their families. It constitutes a violation of the rules of international law guaranteeing, inter alia, the right to recognition as a person before the law, the right to liberty and security of the person and the right not to be subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the right to life.” “1. No State shall practise, permit or tolerate enforced disappearances. 2. States shall act at the national and regional levels and in cooperation with the United Nations to contribute by all means to the prevention and eradication of enforced disappearance.” “Each State shall take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent and terminate acts of enforced disappearance in any territory under its jurisdiction.” “1. Acts constituting enforced disappearance shall be considered a continuing offence as long as the perpetrators continue to conceal the fate and the whereabouts of persons who have disappeared and these facts remained unclarified. 2. When the remedies provided for in Article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are no longer effective, the statute of limitations relating to acts of enforced disappearance shall be suspended until these remedies are re-established. 3. Statutes of limitations, where they exist, relating to acts of disappearance shall be substantial and commensurate with the extreme seriousness of the offence.” “The victims of acts of enforced disappearance and their family shall obtain redress and shall have the right to adequate compensation, including the means for as complete a rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of enforced disappearance, their dependents shall also be entitled to compensation.” 90. The United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance has issued, inter alia, the following General Comments on the above Declaration: “General Comment on Article 17 of the Declaration (E/CN.4/2001/68/18 December 2000) ... 27. Article 17 establishes fundamental principles intended to clarify the nature of enforced disappearances and their criminal consequences. The sense and general purpose of the Article is to ensure conditions such that those responsible for acts constituting enforced disappearance are brought to justice within a restrictive approach to statutory limitations. ... 28. The definition of ‘continuing offence’ (para. 1) is of crucial importance for establishing the responsibilities of the State authorities. Moreover, this Article imposes very restrictive conditions. The Article is intended to prevent perpetrators of those criminal acts from taking advantage of statutes of limitations. ...” “General Comment on Article 19 of the Declaration (5/CN.4/1998/43, 12 January 1998) 72. Article 19 also explicitly mentions the right of victims and their family to ‘adequate compensation’. States are, therefore, under an obligation to adopt legislative and other measures in order to enable the victims to claim compensation before the courts or special administrative bodies empowered to grant compensation. In addition to the victims who survived the disappearance, their families are also entitled to compensation for the suffering during the time of disappearance and in the event of the death of the victim, his or her dependants are entitled to compensation. 73. Compensation shall be ‘adequate’ i.e. proportionate to the gravity of the human rights violation (e.g. the period of disappearance, the conditions of detention, etc.) and to the suffering of the victim and the family. Monetary compensation shall be granted for any damage resulting from an enforced disappearance such as physical or mental harm, lost opportunities, material damages and loss of earnings, harm to reputation and costs required for legal or expert assistance. Civil claims for compensation shall not be limited by amnesty laws, made subject to statutes of limitation or made dependent on penal sanctions imposed on the perpetrators. 74. The right to adequate compensation for acts of enforced disappearance under Article 19 shall be distinguished from the right to compensation for arbitrary executions. In other words, the right of compensation in relation to an act of enforced disappearance shall not be made conditional on the death of the victim. ‘In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of enforced disappearance’, the dependants are, however, entitled to additional compensation by virtue of the last sentence of Article 19. If the death of the victim cannot be established by means of exhumation or similar forms of evidence, States have an obligation to provide for appropriate legal procedures leading to the presumption of death or a similar legal status of the victim which entitles the dependants to exercise their right to compensation. ... As a general principle, no victim of enforced disappearance shall be presumed dead over the objections of the family.” 91. This Convention provides, inter alia: “1. No one shall be subjected to enforced disappearance. 2. No exceptional circumstances whatsoever, whether a state of war or a threat of war, internal political instability or any other public emergency, may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance.” “For the purposes of this Convention, ‘enforced disappearance’ is considered to be the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which place such a person outside the protection of the law.” “Each State Party shall take appropriate measures to investigate acts defined in Article 2 committed by persons or groups of persons acting without the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State and to bring those responsible to justice.” “Each State Party shall take the necessary measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an offence under its criminal law.” “The widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance constitutes a crime against humanity as defined in applicable international law and shall attract the consequences provided for under such applicable international law.” “Without prejudice to Article 5, 1. A State Party which applies a statute of limitations in respect of enforced disappearance shall take the necessary measures to ensure that the term of limitation for criminal proceedings: (a) Is of long duration and is proportionate to the extreme seriousness of this offence; (b) Commences from the moment when the offence of enforced disappearance ceases, taking into account its continuous nature. 2. Each State Party shall guarantee the right of victims of enforced disappearance to an effective remedy during the term of limitation.” 92. This Convention provides, inter alia: “The States Parties to this Convention undertake: a. Not to practice, permit, or tolerate the forced disappearance of persons, even in states of emergency or suspension of individual guarantees; b. To punish within their jurisdictions, those persons who commit or attempt to commit the crime of forced disappearance of persons and their accomplices and accessories; c. To cooperate with one another in helping to prevent, punish, and eliminate the forced disappearance of persons; d. To take legislative, administrative, judicial, and any other measures necessary to comply with the commitments undertaken in this Convention.” “For the purposes of this Convention, forced disappearance is considered to be the act of depriving a person or persons of his or their freedom, in whatever way, perpetrated by agents of the State or by persons or groups of persons acting with the authorisation, support, or acquiescence of the State, followed by an absence of information or a refusal to acknowledge that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the whereabouts of that person, thereby impeding his or her recourse to the applicable legal remedies and procedural guarantees.” “The States Parties undertake to adopt, in accordance with their constitutional procedures, the legislative measures that may be needed to define the forced disappearance of persons as an offense and to impose an appropriate punishment commensurate with its extreme gravity. This offense shall be deemed continuous or permanent as long as the fate or whereabouts of the victim has not been determined ...” 94. In Blake v. Guatemala, the IACHR had to deal with the ratione temporis exception raised by the government in that case, since the disappearance itself had taken place before the critical date (acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction in 1987). The court considered that forced disappearances implied the violation of various human rights and that the effects of such infringements – even though some may have been completed – “may be prolonged continuously or permanently until such time as the victim’s fate or whereabouts are established” (see Blake, 2 July 1996, preliminary objections, § 39). 95. Mr Blake’s fate or whereabouts were not known to his family until 14 June 1992, after the date on which Guatemala accepted the jurisdiction of the court. This led to the IACHR declaring itself competent ratione temporis to examine the “effects and actions” subsequent to the critical date. However, it accepted the government’s preliminary objection as regards the deprivation of Mr Blake’s liberty and his murder, which had been completed before the critical date and could not be considered per se to be continuous. 96. In its judgment on the merits (24 January 1998, p. 54), the IACHR considered the disappearance as marking the beginning of a “continuing situation”. It proceeded to examine the complaint under Article 8 in relation to Article 1 § 1 and declared that Guatemala had violated the right of Mr Blake’s relatives to have his disappearance and death effectively investigated, to have those responsible prosecuted and punished where appropriate, and to be compensated, notwithstanding the lack of temporal competence to deal with the substantive complaints. 97. The IACHR came to a similar conclusion in cases of disappearances in which the victim’s whereabouts had never been established. In Serrano- Cruz Sisters v. El Salvador (judgment of 23 November 2004, preliminary objections), the court found that it had no competence to examine, under Articles 4, 5 and 7 (right to personal liberty), the disappearances of the sisters as such, since they had allegedly taken place thirteen years before El Salvador had accepted the contentious jurisdiction of the court. It came to the same conclusion as regards the procedural violations invoked under Article 4 by the Inter-American Commission, since they were linked to the alleged forced disappearance (§ 95). However, the IACHR considered that all the facts that occurred following the critical date and which referred to Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention (filing of a petition for habeas corpus, criminal proceedings), were not excluded by the temporal limitation established by the State, since they constituted “independent facts” or “specific and autonomous violations concerning denial of justice” (§ 85). On the merits, it declared that the State had violated Articles 8 and 25 of the Convention, to the detriment of both sisters and their next of kin (judgment of 1 March 2005). 98. In a more recent judgment, Heliodoro Portugal v. Panama of 12 August 2008, the San José Court made a clear distinction between forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings for the purposes of its jurisdiction ratione temporis. The case concerned the forced disappearance in 1970 (twenty years before Panama accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the court) of Heliodoro Portugal, whose remains were found in 2000. It considered that the victim should be presumed dead before the date of acceptance of the court’s jurisdiction (9 May 1990), with regard to the fact that twenty years had elapsed since his disappearance. It characterised the extrajudicial killing as an instantaneous act and accepted the government’s preliminary exception as regards the right to life (Article 4). However, with regard to the forced disappearance as such, it applied its previous case-law and found that it was a permanent or continuous violation, since it had been prolonged after the critical date until the victim’s remains were found in 2000. It was competent to examine the following violations arising out of the disappearance: the deprivation of liberty of the victim (Article 7), the violation of the relatives’ right to humane treatment (Article 5), the non-compliance with the obligation to investigate into the alleged disappearance, the failure to incriminate forced disappearances and tortures in domestic law and the failure to investigate and punish acts of torture. On the merits, the IACHR went on to find a violation of the right to liberty (Article 7) and a violation of Articles 1 and 2 of the Inter-American Convention on Forced Disappearance of Persons with regard to the deceased. It further found a breach of Articles 5 (right to humane treatment), 8 and 25 in respect of his relatives. 99. As regards forced disappearances, the HRC recognised “the degree of suffering involved in being held indefinitely without contact with the outside world” and held that they constituted “cruel and inhuman treatment” contrary to Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“the Covenant”) with regard to the disappeared. Disappearances often resulted in breaches of the right to life, embodied in Article 6 of the Covenant. In General Comment No. 6 on the right to life, the HRC stated: “States Parties should also take specific and effective measures to prevent the disappearance of individuals, something which unfortunately has become all too frequent and leads too often to arbitrary deprivation of life. Furthermore, States should establish effective facilities and procedures to investigate thoroughly cases of missing and disappeared persons in circumstances which may involve a violation of the right to life.” 100. In a number of cases, the HRC has found that a breach of Article 6 of the Covenant has occurred, but has been unable to make a final decision in that regard in the absence of confirmation of death. Disappearances may also lead to violations of Articles 9 (right to liberty and security of person), 10 (right of all persons deprived of their liberty to be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person) and 7 with regard to the relatives of the disappeared, in view of the stress, anguish and uncertainty caused by the disappearance. 101. The positive obligation to investigate disappearances (mentioned in the General Comment on the right to life) may also be breached in this type of case; in these situations there may be a breach of Article 2 § 3 (which enshrines the right to an effective remedy) in conjunction with Article 6. The HRC, in General Comment No. 31 on Article 2 §§ 2 and 3 of the Covenant, emphasised that the failure to investigate in respect of grave violations such as enforced disappearances or torture, as well as the failure to bring to justice perpetrators of such violations, could give rise to a separate breach of the Covenant. The Committee was thus empowered to find a violation of Articles 6, 7 and 9 read in conjunction with Article 2 § 3 of the Covenant. 102. However, when the disappearance occurred before the date that the Covenant or the Optional Protocol entered into force for a State, the approach of the HRC to whether it has temporal jurisdiction has evolved over recent years. 103. In the cases of missing persons in Argentina (S.E. v. Argentina, 4 April 1990), the Committee had found that Article 2 § 3 of the Covenant could not be violated by a State Party in the absence of jurisdiction over a substantive violation. In Maria Otilia Vargas v. Chile, 26 July 1999, the HRC declared the communication inadmissible ratione temporis in respect of the author’s son, whose body had never been recovered since his death in 1973. The Committee held that the Supreme Court’s judgment of 1995 rejecting the author’s complaint as regards the application of the 1978 amnesty decree could not be regarded as a new event that could affect the rights of a person who was killed in 1973, prior to the international entry into force of the Covenant and the entry into force of the Optional Protocol for Chile. 104. In Sarma v. Sri Lanka, 16 July 2003, the author alleged that his son had been removed by members of the military in June 1990 and was last seen in October 1991. Sri Lanka became a party to the Optional Protocol in October 1997 with a declaration limiting the Committee’s competence to facts arising after this date. The Committee found that although the initial abduction occurred outside their temporal jurisdiction “the alleged violations of the Covenant, if confirmed on the merits, may have occurred or continued after the entry into force of the Optional Protocol”. The Committee went on to find a violation of Articles 7 and 9 with regard to the son and Article 7 with regard to the author and his wife due to their anguish and stress at not knowing their son’s whereabouts. The HRC also emphasised that the State had a duty under Article 2 § 3 “to provide the author and his family with an effective remedy, including a thorough and effective investigation into the disappearance and fate of the author’s son ...” which implied that the State might have an obligation to investigate matters which had occurred before the entry into force of the Optional Protocol. Finally, it refrained from finding a violation of Article 6, since the author had not abandoned hope for his son’s reappearance. 105. However, in Yurich v. Chile, 2 November 2005, the Committee, although describing enforced disappearance as a continuing act, noted that the original acts of arrest and abduction, as well as the refusal to give information about the deprivation of freedom, had occurred before the entry into force of the Covenant for Chile. The HRC further considered that the author had made no reference to any action of the State after the crucial date (entry into force of the Optional Protocol) that would constitute “a confirmation of the enforced disappearance”. For these reasons, it declared the application inadmissible. 106. More recently in Mariam Sankara et al. v. Burkina Faso, 28 March 2006 (see Appendix III, p. 52), the HRC applied this act of confirmation approach, and also changed its analysis in considering a failure to investigate a death which had taken place prior to the critical date. Although it found that it had no jurisdiction ratione temporis over the death of Mr Sankara, it went on to consider the subsequent proceedings and failure to correct his death warrant (which stated the cause of death as natural) and their effect on Mr Sankara’s wife and two children. It found that there had been a failure to conduct an inquiry into Mr Sankara’s death, to prosecute those responsible and to conclude legal proceedings begun by the author to remedy this situation. It concluded that the proceedings had been prolonged at the fault of the authorities, the delay continuing after the entry into force of the Covenant and Optional Protocol. The authors were therefore affected by the authorities’ failures after this entry into force, and that gave the Committee with jurisdiction ratione temporis over the Article 7 claim. 107. On the merits, the Committee went on to find that “the refusal to conduct an investigation into the death of Thomas Sankara, the lack of official recognition of his place of burial and the failure to correct the death certificate constitute inhuman treatment of Ms. Sankara and her sons, in breach of Article 7 of the Covenant”.","['2', '3', '5']",[],[],['5'],[],[],1

CROATIA,1,Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion);Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award,Georg Ress,"7. On 19 October 1992 the applicant lent to MJB, a company in Zagreb, 10,000 German marks (DEM) for a period of three months at a rate of interest of 27%. On 23 November 1992 she lent to ZIP, a company in Zagreb, DEM 20,390 for a period of one month at a rate of interest of 20%. 8. As the said companies failed to repay the loans, the applicant instituted proceedings against ZIP and MJB in the Zagreb Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Zagrebu). 9. The proceedings against ZIP and its alleged owner Ž.M. commenced on 29 March 1995 when the applicant, together with thirty-nine other plaintiffs, filed an action for repayment of their loans. 10. On 17 May 1995 the court asked the applicant’s counsel to provide the address of the second defendant. On 23 May 1995 the applicant’s counsel submitted the address concerned. 11. A hearing was scheduled for 4 October 1995 but it was adjourned since the defendants failed to appear. It turned out that the defendants had not received notice of the date of the hearing as the address indicated was incorrect. The court asked the applicant’s counsel to submit the defendants’ correct address within thirty days. 12. The next hearing was scheduled for 24 January 1996. However, it appears that in the meantime ZIP had ceased to exist and, as Ž.M.’s address remained unknown, the court ordered the applicant’s counsel to request the Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb) to appoint a legal representative for Ž.M. 13. On 20 June 1996 the applicant’s counsel informed the court that the Zagreb Social Welfare Centre had, by its decision of 11 March 1996, appointed a legal representative for Ž.M. 14. On 13 September 1996 the court asked the applicant’s counsel to submit within thirty days a certificate from the registry of the Zagreb Commercial Court (Trgovački sud u Zagrebu) concerning the legal status of ZIP. 15. The next hearing, scheduled for 2 December 1999, was also adjourned due to the absence of the defendants. It turned out again that ZIP and Ž.M. had not received notice of the hearing date as the address indicated was incorrect. The court invited the applicant’s counsel to inform it within thirty days whether ZIP had in fact ceased to exist. 16. According to the Government, during the next hearing on 7 June 2000, the court decided upon the parties’ application to return the proceedings to the status quo ante (zahtjev za povrat u prijašnje stanje). Due to the absence of ZIP the hearing was adjourned to 17 October 2000. It appears that the proceedings are still pending before the Zagreb Municipal Court. 17. The proceedings against MJB and its alleged owner B.J. commenced on 30 March 1995 when the applicant, together with thirty other plaintiffs, filed an action for repayment of their loans with the Zagreb Municipal Court. 18. The court asked the applicant’s counsel to provide the address of B.J. On 25 August 1995 the applicant’s counsel informed the court of B.J.’s address. 19. The hearing scheduled for 2 October 1995 was adjourned due to the absence of the defendants. It turned out that MJB was no longer at its previous address and that B.J. was in detention on remand. The applicant’s counsel informed the court that B.J. had been released from detention and requested that the notices for the next hearing be sent to the defendants at the same addresses as before. 20. The hearing on 27 November 1995 was again adjourned due to the defendants’ absence. It appears that MJB had in the meantime ceased to exist and that B.J. had changed her address. The court invited the applicant’s counsel to inform it within thirty days whether MJB had in fact ceased to exist and of the correct address of B.J. 21. On 7 December 1995 the applicant’s counsel informed the court of the defendants’ addresses. 22. The next hearing, on 14 February 1996, was also adjourned due to the defendants’ absence for the same reasons as before, that is that MJB had ceased to exist and that B.J. had changed address. The court decided to look into the criminal case file no. KO-1574/93 in the same court, where criminal proceedings had been instituted against B.J., in order to obtain her proper address. Through that the court found her address. 23. By order of 11 September 1996 the applicant’s counsel was requested to furnish the court with a certificate from the registry of the Zagreb Commercial Court regarding the legal status of MJB. 24. On 20 September 1996 the applicant’s counsel submitted the requested document. 25. The next hearing, scheduled for 7 November 1997, was adjourned due to the defendants’ absence. The documents indicate that they had not received the notice of the hearing date. 26. The next hearing, scheduled for 26 January 1998, was adjourned for the same reason. The court invited the applicant’s counsel to submit B.J.’s correct address within sixty days. 27. On 6 February 1998 the applicant’s counsel informed the court that in the police registry B.J.’s address was the same as before. He proposed that a legal representative be appointed for B.J. 28. On 13 February 1998 the court ordered the applicant’s counsel to request the Social Welfare Centre to appoint a legal representative for B.J. 29. On 2 April 1998 the applicant’s counsel informed the court that the Zagreb Social Welfare Centre had, by its decision of 26 March 1998, appointed a legal representative for B.J. 30. According to the Government, during the next hearing, on 2 July 1998, the court issued a default judgment (presuda zbog izostanka) against B.J. The available documents show that MJB had ceased to exist. 31. On 22 July 1998 the court sent a letter to the Zagreb Commercial Court asking for a certificate regarding the legal status of MJB. On 24 September 1998 the court received a letter from the Zagreb Commercial Court with a certificate that wrongly contained information about another firm, instead of MJB. 32. On 13 April 2000 the court again sent a letter to the Zagreb Commercial Court asking whether MJB still existed. On the same day the court also requested the applicant’s counsel to submit the same information. It appears that the case is still pending before the Zagreb Municipal Court. 33. The relevant part of the Constitutional Act on the Constitutional Court (“the Constitutional Court Act” – Ustavni zakon o Ustavnom sudu), which came into force on 24 September 1999, reads as follows: “The Constitutional Court may, exceptionally, examine a constitutional complaint prior to exhaustion of other available remedies, if it is satisfied that a contested act, or failure to act within a reasonable time, grossly violates a party’s constitutional rights and freedoms and that, if it does not act, a party will risk serious and irreparable consequences.”","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
85,001-80502,ENG,MDA,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF MAZEPA v. MOLDOVA,4,Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13;Violation of P1-1,Nicolas Bratza,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Chişinău. She is a second degree invalid. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. The applicant owns part of a house in which her neighbour (V.) owns another part. V. re-constructed her part of the house without the prior agreement of the applicant and the applicant's part of the house was seriously damaged as a result. 8. On 11 February 1998 the applicant initiated court proceedings claiming damages from V. Relying on an expert's assessment of the damage caused to the applicant's house, on 27 May 1999 the Buiucani District Court awarded her 12,635 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of 1,054 euros (EUR) at the time). No appeal was made and the judgment became final and enforceable 15 days later. 9. According to the applicant, she wrote to various State authorities requesting the enforcement of the award but it was not enforced. On 10 July 2000 she informed the Buiucani District Court that the judgment of 27 May 1999 had not been enforced and asked it to change the manner of enforcing the judgment by transferring V.'s part of the house to the applicant. She emphasised that her own part of the house had been severely damaged and that the damage had been aggravated with the passage of time, causing a real threat to her life. The applicant relied, inter alia, on Article 359 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see paragraph 24 below). 10. On 13 April 2001 the Buiucani District Court accepted the claim. The new enforcement warrant was submitted to the court on 4 July 2001, following which the bailiff requested V. to comply with the judgment. 11. The applicant also requested the Supreme Court of Justice to transfer the examination of her cases against V., including the enforcement of the judgment of 27 May 1999, to another court in view of the inactivity of the Buiucani District Court. On 7 February 2001 the Supreme Court of Justice rejected that request as unfounded. 12. On 7 May 2001 the Buiucani District Court adopted an additional judgment, awarding the applicant damages (MDL 6,558) against V. for the late enforcement of the judgment of 27 May 1999. V. appealed. On 12 September 2001 the Chişinău Regional Court quashed that judgment and ordered a full re-hearing. 13. On 11 January 2002 the bailiff organised an auction for the sale of the part of the house belonging to V. but nobody offered the minimum asking price set. He then proposed that the court accept the applicant's request to be given title to that part of the house on account of V.'s debt to her. 14. On 29 January 2002 the District Court accepted that request. 15. In parallel to all the proceedings mentioned above, the applicant initiated administrative proceedings for the annulment of a municipality's decision adopted in 1996 confirming the lawfulness of V.'s re-construction of the house. On 17 November 1999 the Buiucani District Court accepted that request and on 5 July 2000 the Chişinău Regional Court upheld that judgment. On 28 September 2000 the Court of Appeal quashed the two judgments and adopted a new one, rejecting the applicant's claims. 16. V. lodged a request for the revision of judgments of 27 May 1999 and 29 January 2002 because the expert report on the damage had been signed by an expert lacking the required training and the District Court had based its judgment of 27 May 1999 on that report. The report stated the level of training of its author, who was registered by the Chamber of Commerce as that of a 1st (highest) degree expert with 23 years' work experience. On 25 April 2001 the Buiucani District Court rejected V.'s request. 17. On 25 April 2002 the Chişinău Regional Court accepted V.'s request and quashed the judgment of 27 May 1999 and the decision of 13 April 2001 (see paragraphs 8 and 10 above), ordering a full re-examination of the case in view of the expert's lack of adequate training. The court accepted V.'s claim that she had only found out about the expert's lack of training in December 2000 and had thus not exceeded the three-month time-limit for lodging the revision request. The applicant informed the Court about the quashing in a letter of 3 March 2003. 18. On 12 November 2002 the Buiucani District Court ordered an expert report to be made. On an unspecified date in 2003 the Republican Centre for Research and Regulation of Constructions (“CERCON”, a State institution) submitted its report to the court. It confirmed that, following the reconstruction of V.'s part of the house in serious violation of building regulations, the applicant's part of the house had suffered a major deterioration and had become uninhabitable. New cracks appeared in the wall after a repair, which meant that the process had not yet stabilised. A part of V.'s house created a particular danger during earthquakes and the applicant's house had lost all of its resistance to earthquakes. CERCON assessed the damage caused to the applicant's house at MDL 109,920 (EUR 7,266). 19. According to a statement by the judge in charge of the applicant's case regarding the proceedings after the revision of 25 April 2002, the hearings had to be adjourned (by one month on each occasion) due mainly to the applicant's representative's absence on the following dates: 1 September 2003 (the first hearing in the re-opened proceedings), 7 November 2003, 8 December 2003, 17 February 2005, 17 March 2005, 9 June 2005 and 25 August 2005. 20. Three more one-month adjournments had to be ordered at V.'s request: on 6 October 2003, 9 December 2004 and 30 January 2006. 21. On 5 February 2004 the applicant requested a new expert report to be drawn up in respect of the damage caused to her part of the house. V. supported this request. On 9 February 2004 the questions for the experts were formulated and on 20 February 2004 the court ordered the parties to bear equally the experts' costs. The expert report was sent to the court by the Republican Institute for Judicial Expertise and Criminalistics (“IREJC”, a State institution) on 8 November 2004, following a visit to the applicant's part of the house on 26 October 2004. The report largely confirmed the findings of the two previous expert reports and assessed the damage caused to the applicant's house at MDL 125,174 (EUR 7,784). It also found that the process of the deformation of the house had not yet stopped and new cracks had appeared after minor repairs had been undertaken. On 15 April 2005 the court accepted V.'s objections to the expert report and ordered a new report to be drawn up by IREJC. On 13 May 2005 IREJC sent the case file back to the court without drawing up the report. On 19 May 2005 the experts charged with drawing up the report were summoned, but they failed to appear on 5 July 2005. On 29 November 2005 V. requested another expert report. On 6 December 2005 the court sent IREJC a request for a new expert report, but on 19 December 2005 the IREJC returned the case file since V. had failed to pay IREJC its costs, as ordered by the court. The applicant stated that she did not want another report since the previous one had confirmed her position. On 30 January 2006 the court ordered the parties to each bear IREJC's costs and ordered a new report to be drawn up. In their observations of September 2006 the Government informed the Court that IREJC had not yet drawn up its report and asked for permission to submit it to the Court when it was ready. No such report has been submitted to date. 22. The proceedings are still pending before the Buiucani District Court. 23. The relevant domestic law has been set out in Prodan v. Moldova (no. 49806/99, ECHR 2004III (extracts)). 24. In addition, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, applicable at the relevant time, read as follows: “Article 5. Examination of civil actions by the court. The court shall begin the examination of a civil case: ... 3) at the request of the natural or legal person who asks for the protection of his or its rights or interests protected by law; ... TITLE FIVE EXECUTION OF COURT JUDGMENTS Article 336. Court judgments and decisions of other authorities, which shall be executed.

LITHUANIA,1,Violation of Art. 5-1;Violation of Art. 5-4;Violation of Art. 6-2;Pecuniary damage - request rejected;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award,Nicolas Bratza,"7. The applicant was the Minister of Defence and a Member of the Seimas (Parliament) from 1996 to 2000. 8. On 12 August 1997 the applicant was apprehended in a hotel lobby by the security intelligence and the prosecuting authorities while accepting an envelope containing 15,000 United States dollars (USD) from KK. The latter, a senior executive of a troubled oil company (hereinafter referred to as “the company”), had previously informed the intelligence authorities that the applicant had requested 300,000 USD for his assistance in obtaining the discontinuance of criminal proceedings concerning the company’s vast debts. For slightly more than an hour the applicant was questioned in the hotel lobby. His explanations were recorded and he was allowed to leave the hotel. 9. On 14 August 1997 the Prosecutor General requested the Seimas to permit the institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 19 August 1997 the Seimas agreed. On 20 August 1997 criminal proceedings were instituted. On 14 October 1997 the applicant was charged with attempting to cheat (obtaining property by deception). 10. On 20 October 1997 the Prosecutor General applied to the Seimas for permission to detain the applicant on remand. On 28 October 1997 permission was given. On the same day a prosecutor requested the Vilnius City Second District Court to order the applicant’s detention on remand. Also that day the applicant was brought before a judge of the Vilnius City Second District Court who issued a warrant for the applicant’s arrest on the grounds that he might obstruct the establishment of the truth in the case, inter alia, by exploiting the media and influencing witnesses. The applicant was duly detained. 11. On 30 October 1997 the judge extended the term of the applicant’s detention on remand until 30 November 1997 in the presence of the parties for the same reasons as before. On 3, 5 and 7 November 1997 the applicant appealed against his detention on remand. He requested a hearing. On 11 November 1997 a judge of the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal without hearing the parties. 12. From 27 November 1997 to 5 December 1997 the applicant and his counsel had access to the case-file. On 5 December 1997 the applicant requested the prosecutor to discontinue the proceedings. On a number of occasions he also requested the prosecutor to vary the remand. These requests were rejected. 13. On 8 December 1997 a judge of the Vilnius City Second District Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention on remand until 31 December 1997. On 9 December 1997 the applicant appealed. On 11 December 1997 the Regional Court informed him that no appeal lay against that decision. 14. On 29 December 1997 the Prosecutor General confirmed the bill of indictment, which was transmitted to the Vilnius Regional Court. 15. From 1 to 5 January 1998 the applicant submitted numerous applications to courts, the prison administration, the Ombudsman and the Seimas, alleging that his detention had been unlawful. On 7 January 1998 the Ombudsman concluded that from 31 December 1997 the applicant had been held in detention unlawfully. 16. On 8 January 1998 the Vilnius Regional Court committed the applicant for trial. The court also decided that the applicant’s detention on remand “shall remain unchanged”. No term for that detention was specified. 17. On 23 March 1998 the Vilnius Regional Court adjourned the case and ordered the prosecuting authorities to submit new evidence. In the same decision the court also decided that the applicant’s detention on remand “shall remain unchanged”. No term or grounds for this were specified. The applicant’s counsel was present at the hearing. On 24 March 1998 the applicant appealed against the decision. On 12 May 1998 the applicant submitted a further appeal against the decision of 23 March 1998. 18. On 21 May 1998 the Court of Appeal dismissed this appeal in so far as it concerned the decision to require the prosecution to submit new evidence. The Court of Appeal held that no appeal lay against the decision of 23 March 1998 in so far as it concerned the applicant’s detention. The applicant and his counsel were present at the appellate hearing. 19. On 1 July 1998 the trial before the Vilnius Regional Court was resumed. On 13 July 1998 the Vilnius Regional Court extended the term of the applicant’s detention until 17 August 1998. On 23 July 1998 the detention was extended until 30 November 1998. The court referred to the strength of the evidence in the case-file and the likelihood of the applicant influencing witnesses, warranting his further remand in custody. Defence counsel was present at the hearings. The applicant’s appeals against the decisions of 13 and 23 July 1998 were dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 21 July and 12 August 1998 respectively. The applicant’s counsel had been present at the appellate hearings. 20. On 5 and 19 February, 1 July, 21 October and 3 November 1998, the Vilnius Regional Court rejected the applicant’s requests to lift the remand in custody. His defence counsel was present at the hearings. 21. On 18 November 1998 the Vilnius Regional Court found the applicant guilty of attempting to obtain property by deception. The court rejected the applicant’s defence that he had been incited to commit an offence as a result of the conspiracy between KK and the security intelligence authorities. The court found that the applicant had himself requested KK to contact him, and that the applicant had demanded money in return for him using his authority over certain prosecutors with a view to discontinuing the criminal case involving KK’s indebted company. The Regional Court found that the applicant had thereby intended to cheat. The applicant was sentenced to five years and six months’ imprisonment and fined 50,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL). Half of his property was confiscated. The applicant and his counsel were present before the first instance court. 22. The applicant appealed. On 17 February 1999 the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal, finding no procedural irregularities regarding the investigation and trial. The applicant and his counsel were present at the appellate hearing. 23. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal. On 11 May 1999 the Supreme Court rejected it, finding that the lower courts had properly decided the case. The court mentioned inter alia that it had no competence to examine the applicant’s allegations about the unlawfulness of his detention on remand. The applicant and his counsel were present before the Supreme Court. 24. On an unspecified date, an impeachment procedure was initiated against the applicant in the Seimas. On 15 June 1999 the Seimas refused to impeach the applicant or annul his mandate as a Member of Parliament (“MP”). 25. On 17 March 2000 the Vilnius City Third District Court ordered the applicant’s release on licence. He was released on 20 March 2000. <Translations are given> 26. On 14 August 1997 an article entitled “MP’s whitewash looks hogwash, says prosecutor” was published in the biggest national daily “Lietuvos Rytas”: “The Prosecutor General confirmed that [he had] enough sound evidence of the guilt of A. Butkevičius.” 27. On 15 August 1997 an article entitled “The Chairman of the Seimas does not doubt A. Butkevičius’s guilt” was published in “Lietuvos Rytas”: “When asked whether or not he doubts that A. Butkevičius accepted a bribe, the Chairman of the Seimas said: ‘on the basis of the material in my possession I entertain no doubt.’” 28. The Prosecutor General was quoted in an article entitled “A. Butkevičius prepares for battle and prison” of 16 August 1997 in the daily “Respublika”: “I qualify the offence as an attempt to cheat ... .” 29. The Chairman of the Seimas, quoted in an article entitled “A. Butkevičius will be prosecuted” of 20 August 1997 in “Lietuvos Rytas”: “One or two facts were and are convincing. [The applicant] took the money while promising criminal services.” 30. The Chairman of the Seimas, in an article entitled “A. Butkevičius’s lawyers tag the bribery case as political” of 6 October 1998 in “Lietuvos Rytas”, was quoted as saying that “the Centre and the New Union [parties] co-ordinate the defence of the bribetaker” and that these parties try to protract the proceedings and artificially “victimise” the applicant. 31. The Code of Criminal Procedure (Baudžiamojo proceso kodeksas): “No one shall be arrested or detained save by virtue of a decision of a court or judge.” Article 52 § 2 and 58 § 2 of the Code provide that the accused and their counsel have the right to submit requests and appeal against acts and decisions of an interrogator, investigator, prosecutor or court. “Detention on remand shall be used only ... in cases where a statutory penalty of at least one year’s imprisonment is envisaged. ... . The grounds for detention on remand shall be the reasoned suspicion that the accused will: (1) abscond from the investigation and trial; (2) obstruct the determination of the truth in the case [influence other parties or destroy evidence]; (3) commit new offences ... whilst suspected of having committed crimes provided in Articles ... [274, cheating] of the Criminal Code ... .” “... the arrested person shall be brought before a judge within not more than 48 hours ... . The judge must hear the person as to the grounds of the arrest. The prosecutor and counsel for the arrested person may take part in the inquiry. After having questioned the arrested person, the judge may maintain the arrest order by designating the specific term of detention, or vary or revoke the remand ... . After the case has been transmitted to the court ... [it] can order, vary or revoke the detention on remand.” The amended Article 104-1 (in force since 24 June 1998) provides that the prosecutor and defence counsel must take part in the first judicial inquiry of the arrested person, unless the judge decides otherwise. The amended provision also provides that the court should extend the detention on remand before its expiry. “For the purpose of extending the term of detention on remand, a judge ... must convene a hearing to which defence counsel and a prosecutor and, if necessary, the detainee shall be called. The judge decides whether or not to extend the term of detention on remand. ... .” The Code in force since 24 June 1998 makes obligatory the attendance of the detainee at the remand hearings. “An arrested person or his counsel shall have the right during the pre-trial investigation to lodge [with an appellate court] an appeal against the arrest. ... . With a view to examining the appeal, there may be convened a hearing to which the arrested person and his counsel or only counsel shall be called. The presence of a prosecutor is obligatory at such a hearing. The decision taken by the judge at appellate instance is final and cannot be the subject of a cassation appeal. A further appeal shall be determined when examining the extension of the term of the detention on remand.” The present Article 109-1 (in force since 24 June 1998) now provides for an appeal to a higher court and a hearing against a decision ordering or extending the term of detention both at the stage of pre-trial investigation and trial, in the presence of the detainee and his counsel, or only his counsel. “The period when the accused and his counsel have access to the case-file is not counted towards the overall term of pre-trial investigation and detention. Where there are several accused persons, the period during which all the accused and their counsel have access to the case-file is not counted towards the overall term of pre-trial investigation and detention.” Since 24 June 1998 this period is no longer relevant for remand decisions. “A judge individually or a court in a directions hearing, in deciding whether to commit the accused for trial, shall determine: ... 11) whether the remand has been selected appropriately; ... .” “After having decided that there is a sufficient basis to commit the accused for trial, a judge individually or a court in a directions hearing shall determine: ... 2) the remand in respect of the accused; ... .” “The defendant has the right to: ... ; 3) submit requests; ... 11) appeal against the judgment and decisions of a court.” “In the course of the trial, a court may decide to order, vary or revoke a remand in respect of the defendant.” “Decisions of courts ... ordering, varying or revoking a remand ... cannot be the subject of appeal ... .” Pursuant to the general provision of Article 399, a first instance decision was not effective pending the time-limit for an appeal against that decision or during the appeal proceedings. Only those decisions against which no appeal was possible, including remand decisions under the former Article 372 § 4, became effective and were executed on the date when they were taken. The present Article 104-3 § 3 (version in force from 21 December 1999) specifies that all decisions of detention on remand become effective and are executed on the date when they are taken, regardless of the fact that an appeal is possible against any such decision under the amended Article 109-1 (since 24 June 1998, see above). 32. Article 31 § 1 of the Constitution reads: “A person shall be considered innocent until proved guilty in accordance with the law by a final judgment of the court.” Article 11 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides: “No one shall be declared guilty of having committed an offence or punished by a criminal penalty save by a court judgment in accordance with the law.”","['5', '6']","['5-1', '5-4', '6-2']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Sancraiu de Mureş. 6. In 1953 the applicant was called up for military service. However, because of his father’s opposition to the collectivisation of farmland, he was not allowed to undergo military training. Instead, he was assigned to a number of military units, including the Vatra Dornei unit, as a building worker. His military service ended in 1955. 7. In 1961 the Labour Department, an administrative body grouping together the military units specially created for conscripts who were barred from military training, was abolished. 8. Law no. 309 of 22 May 2002 (“Law no. 309-2002”) recognised as forced labour the work performed in the military units coming under the authority of the Labour Department, and provided for compensatory measures including a monthly allowance, free medical treatment and exemption from the television licence fee. 9. On 22 August 2002 the applicant applied to the county pensions and social insurance fund (“the county fund”), claiming the benefits available under Law no. 309-2002. In a decision of 19 December 2002 the county fund refused the application on the ground that the applicant had not performed his military service in a military unit coming under the authority of the Labour Department. 10. On 5 May 2003 the applicant brought proceedings against the county fund before the Targu Mureş Court of Appeal, seeking to have the decision of 19 December 2002 set aside and to be recognised as having performed forced labour during his military service. 11. In a judgment of 2 June 2003 the Court of Appeal found in the applicant’s favour and ordered the county fund to issue a new decision awarding him the benefits provided for by Law no. 309-2002. On the basis of the entries in the applicant’s military service record book, the Court of Appeal concluded that he had worked on various building projects with the Vatra Dornei military unit and had been discharged from service as an “untrained combat soldier”. 12. The county fund appealed to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (“the HCCJ”). 13. At the applicant’s request, the HCCJ referred to the Constitutional Court an objection raised by the applicant as to the constitutionality of Article 1 of Law no. 309-2002. The applicant alleged that, in making a distinction between persons who had performed the same kind of forced labour during their military service, the provision in question was in breach of Article 16 of the Constitution and of the European Convention on Human Rights. He considered this difference in treatment to be unjustified since it was based solely on the hierarchical structure to which the conscript’s military unit had belonged. 14. The Constitutional Court dismissed the objection in a judgment of 1 April 2004, which included the following passage: “The definition of the categories of persons who are eligible for certain measures in compensation for the duress and hardship they underwent in the past ... is a matter for the legislature alone, provided that no privileges or discrimination are engendered between persons belonging to the same category and in identical situations. Article 1 of Law no. 309-2002 does not give rise to any privileges or discrimination contrary to Article 16 of the Constitution.” 15. In a judgment of 8 June 2004 in which it found in favour of the county fund, the HCCJ quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal and remitted the case for further preparation, with a view to determining whether the Vatra Dornei military unit had been attached to the Labour Department. 16. In a letter of 1 November 2004 in reply to a request for information made by the Court of Appeal, the Piteşti military unit, which kept the army archives, stated that the Vatra Dornei military unit did not feature on the list of units attached to the Labour Department. It added that, in accordance with the rules on the implementation of Law no. 3092002, the list had been drawn up by the National Pensions and Social Insurance Fund, which had made it available to the military unit as a “working tool”. 17. On 3 November 2004 the national archives of the Ministry of the Interior and Administrative Affairs informed the Court of Appeal that the Vatra Dornei military unit had not been attached to the Labour Department. 18. On the basis of the information provided by the Piteşti military unit and the national archives, and taking the view that Law no. 309-2002 applied only to conscripts who had worked in military units coming under the authority of the Labour Department, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s claims in a judgment of 8 November 2004. 19. The applicant appealed to the HCCJ. In his submission, the Piteşti military unit, by confining itself to reproducing the information contained in the list drawn up by the National Pensions and Social Insurance Fund and omitting to check the recruitment file, which contained proof of the work carried out, had not adequately replied to the request for information from the Court of Appeal. 20. The applicant further contested the distinction made by the Law between those conscripts who had performed forced labour in military units answerable to the Labour Department and other conscripts who, although they had performed the same kind of work, were not entitled to benefits under the Law solely because their military units had not come under the authority of the Labour Department. He argued that, in any event, the HCCJ, in a judgment of 21 January 2004, had recognised a former conscript in a similar situation to his own as being covered by the provisions of Law no. 309-2002. 21. In a final judgment of 13 May 2005, the HCCJ dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the following grounds: “In accordance with Law no. 309-2002, persons who performed their military service between 1950 and 1961 in the work brigades under the authority of the Labour Department are covered by the provisions of that Law. It follows that the decisive criterion for eligibility under the Law is not the kind of work performed within the military unit, for example building work, but whether or not the unit in question came under the authority of the Labour Department, within which work brigades were established. As a result, given the information provided by the Piteşti military unit in its letter stating that the unit to which the applicant belonged was not on the list of units answerable to the Labour Department, the Court of Appeal was correct in ruling that the conditions for application of the Law were not met in the instant case and in dismissing the appeal accordingly.” “Any Romanian citizen who performed military service between 1950 and 1961 in the work brigades coming under the authority of the Labour Department shall be covered by the provisions of this Law.” “The persons referred to in Article 1 shall be entitled to a monthly allowance ...” “The persons referred to in Article 1 ... shall also be entitled to ...: – free medical treatment and medicines ...; – exemption from the television licence fee ...” “(2) The benefits referred to in the preceding sections shall be awarded on request, regard being had to the entries in the individual’s military service record book or certificates issued by the county military headquarters or the Piteşti military unit. (3) Requests for these benefits shall be addressed to the county pensions and social insurance funds.” “For the purposes of the award of the benefits provided for by this Law, the National Pensions and Social Insurance Fund may request the national archives ... to compile, on the basis of the documents at its disposal, a list of the work brigades under the authority of the Labour Department.” 22. In a case similar to the present one, a former conscript who had performed forced labour in a military unit which did not come under the authority of the Labour Department claimed eligibility under the provisions of Law no. 309-2002. When the county pension fund dismissed his claim on the ground that the Law applied only to conscripts in the work brigades, he appealed to the Court of Appeal, which found in his favour. 23. Following an appeal by the county fund, the HCCJ upheld the Court of Appeal judgment on the following grounds: “As the fact that the claimant was subjected to forced labour is not in dispute ..., there is no justification for withholding the benefits in question. To do so would be to create an inequitable situation, denying compensation to persons who performed military service in identical conditions and who, for purely formal reasons relating solely to the hierarchical structure to which their military units belonged, would thus be subjected to different treatment of a clearly discriminatory nature.” 24. In a number of other judgments, including those of 4 November 2003, 21 January, 2 June and 14 December 2004, 11 and 19 January, 7, 14, 18, 22 and 28 February, 1, 8, 14 and 28 March and 24 May 2005, and 24 May and 6 June 2006, the HCCJ delivered rulings to the same effect as that referred to above. 25. However, in other judgments, and in particular those delivered on 13 and 28 November 2003, 11 March and 15, 22 and 29 April 2004, 11 and 18 January, 1, 17 and 21 February, 1, 10 and 28 March, 13 and 23 May and 14 November 2005, and 12 and 13 April and 25 May 2006, it ruled to the opposite effect, holding that conscripts who had not performed their military service in a military unit coming under the authority of the Labour Department were not covered by the provisions of Law no. 309-2002.","['14', '6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Rostov-on-Don. 7. The applicant served in the military. By a judgment of 18 October 2002 the Military Court of the Vladikavkaz Garrison declared unlawful the refusal of the commander of military unit 66156 to pay the applicant additional monthly combat allowance, obliged the head of the finance department of the North Caucasus Military Circuit to allocate funds for such payment and recovered in the applicant’s favour the allowance arrears in the amount of 58,900 Russian roubles (RUB). By another judgment of 17 December 2002 the same court delivered a similar judgment and recovered additionally RUB 121,600 in favour of the applicant. 8. On 18 August 2005 the regional office of the Federal Treasury returned the writs of execution to the applicant on the ground that the military unit did not have an account there. The writs of execution were also returned by the main office of the Federal Treasury on 28 September 2005. In their letter of the same date the Federal Treasury suggested that the applicant submit the writs of execution to the bailiff service. It is not clear from the parties’ submissions whether the applicant has done so. 9. The judgments remain unenforced to date.","['6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1979 and is currently detained in the Ankara Prison 5. On 23 May 1999 at about 3 p.m. the applicant, who was working for a newspaper called Kurtuluş, was taken into police custody in the district of Almus in the province of Tokat by police officers on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the DHKP/C (Revolutionary People’s Liberation Party-Front). At about 5 p.m. she was taken to the Almus State Hospital, where a medical report was issued. In the report, the presence of a 0.5 x 1 cm. abrasion under the right eye was noted. It was stated that this abrasion had probably been caused as a result of an irritation. The medical report further indicated that there were no signs of ill-treatment on her body. 6. On the same day, the applicant was transferred to the province of Tokat to be interrogated by the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Tokat Security Directorate. Before being taken to the Security Directorate Building, at about 7.45 p.m. the applicant was sent to the Tokat State Hospital for a medical examination. The medical report indicated the presence of a hyperaemia under the right eye and an abrasion on the right side of the nose. Thereafter at about 8.10 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological examination with a request to establish her virginity status. As she did not give her consent, the applicant did not undergo a gynaecological examination. At 9 p.m. the applicant was taken once again to the Tokat State Hospital, this time for a rectal examination. As the applicant refused to be examined, no rectal examination was performed. 7. On 30 May 1999 before being released from custody, the applicant was taken to the Tokat Maternal Hospital for a gynaecological and rectal examination. As she did not give her consent, the doctors did not perform the examinations. Subsequently, she was taken to the Tokat State Hospital, where she was examined by a doctor. According to the doctor’s report, no signs of ill-treatment were observed on the applicant’s body. 8. On 30 May 1999 the applicant was brought before the Tokat public prosecutor. Before the public prosecutor, she denied the allegations against her and maintained that her police statement, dated 29 May 1999, had been taken under duress. She stated that she had been hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and Palestinian hanging. 9. The same day the applicant was further brought before the investigating judge at the Tokat Magistrate’s Court where she repeated her statement taken by the prosecutor. The investigating judge decided to place her in detention on remand on account of the evidence in the file and the nature of the offences against her. 10. On 31 May 1999 the Tokat public prosecutor declined jurisdiction and transferred the case to the public prosecutor at the Ankara State Security Court. 11. In an indictment dated 15 June 1999, the Ankara State Security Court Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicant and accused her of being a member of an illegal organisation. 12. On 12 August 1999 the applicant sent a letter to the court and retracted her statement made to the police, alleging that it was taken under duress. In this letter, she explained in detail the various forms of ill-treatments she had been allegedly subjected to in custody. In particular, she maintained that during her police custody she had been stripped naked, threatened with rape, beaten, hosed with cold water, subjected to electric shocks and hung from her arms. 13. On 11 July 2000 the Ankara State Security Court found that the applicant had been continuously working for the said illegal organisation. It therefore found the applicant guilty as charged under Article 168 of the Criminal Code and sentenced her to twelve years six months’ imprisonment. 14. On 4 April 2001 the applicant submitted her appeal petition to the Court of Cassation. While challenging the decision of the first-instance court, she particularly referred to her ill-treatment under custody. She also stated that she had been taken to the hospital on two occasions during her police custody to undergo a gynaecological examination. She alleged that this treatment constituted degrading treatment. 15. On 25 April 2001 the Court of Cassation, upholding the Ankara State Security Court’s reasoning and assessment of evidence, rejected the applicant’s appeal.",['13'],[],[],['3'],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in the city of Kharkiv. 6. In 1998 the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. Since then the applicant has undergone outpatient treatment at the City Psychoneurological Healthcare Centre no. 3 (hereafter “the Healthcare Centre”). 7. In March 2001 the applicant was convicted of theft and hooliganism and sentenced to one and a half year’s imprisonment suspended on probation. 8. On 12 April 2002 the applicant was arrested and taken into police custody at the Kominternovskyy District Police Station on suspicion of hooliganism and theft. 9. On 15 April 2002 the police investigator assigned to the applicant’s case charged him with hooliganism and theft. On the same day, considering that there were serious suspicions against the applicant, that he had a previous conviction for similar offences and was on probation and that there was a serious risk that the applicant would commit further offences or escape trial, the judge of the Kominternovskyy District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Kominternovskyy Court”) ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. 10. On that same date the applicant was examined at the City Hospital no. 13. He was found to be suffering from schizophrenia but fit for detention on remand. 11. On 16 April 2002 the applicant was brought to the Kharkiv Regional Pre-trial Detention Centre SIZO no. 27 (hereafter “the SIZO”) from the police station. On his admission the applicant was received by the SIZO medical department for observation and assessment. The prison psychiatrist diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia, but certified him fit for detention at the SIZO. 12. The applicant was admitted to a psychiatric ward of the medical wing of the SIZO. On 17 and 25 April 2002 he was visited by a prison therapist who prescribed him cardiovascular and systemic medication. 13. On 30 April 2002 the investigator asked the Healthcare Centre for information on whether the applicant had been known to be suffering from a mental disease. On 5 May 2002 the Healthcare Centre confirmed that the applicant had been under psychiatric treatment for schizophrenia since 1998. Relying on this information, on 13 May 2002, the investigator ordered an inpatient forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant to determine his sanity at the time of the offence. 14. The applicant was transferred to the Psychiatric Hospital no. 15 (hereafter “the Hospital”), where he was examined from 17 to 29 May 2002. On the latter date forensic experts drew up a report, which included the following findings: “...Psychiatric status The patient is available for verbal contact. However such contact is highly formal. Mimics and movements are spontaneous and incongruous. He cannot understand or appreciate the purpose of the examination or the situation in general. The patient is restless, euphoric, fidgety, talkative but incoherent in his speech. .... The patient ... roars with laughter and grimaces, sticking his tongue out. ... Sometimes he starts asking in a whisper whether he will be released, but having received the answer, asks the same question again. ... If asked about his experience after the arrest, the patient becomes restless, somewhat confused, the expression on his face becomes blank. ... His memory and intelligence cannot be tested for lack of productive contact... Sometimes he becomes tense, restless and quarrelsome.... Conclusion 1. Mr Kucheruk currently shows symptoms of acute personality disorder in the form of a reactive state of mind. 2. It is at present impossible to determine the question of his sanity at the time of the offences on account of the complexity of the clinical manifestations of his reactive state of mind, which could also point to another mental illness. 3. Mr Kucheruk’s mental state requires compulsory inpatient psychiatric treatment.” 15. In early June 2002 the applicant was transferred back to the SIZO. On 6 June 2002 he was examined by the prison psychiatrist. No medication was prescribed on that occasion. 16. On 12 June 2002 the investigator requested compulsory psychiatric treatment for the applicant. On the same date the applicant’s case-file was sent to the Kominternovskyy District Prosecutor’s Office for approval. On 14 June 2002 the investigator’s request and the case-file were received by the Kominternovskyy Court. 17. On 5 July 2002 the Kominternovskyy Court, following an adversarial trial in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer, found him guilty of theft and hooliganism as charged. Referring to the experts’ report of 29 May 2002, the court found that the applicant’s acute personality disorder made it impossible at that stage to determine his sanity at the time of the offences and, consequently, to consider the question of punishment. The Kominternovskyy Court made an order under Article 421 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereafter the CCrP) committing the applicant for compulsory psychiatric treatment and suspended the criminal proceedings against him pending his recovery. The court also specified that: “Mr Kucheruk’s preventive detention on remand is to be revoked upon his admission to the psychiatric establishment. The judgment may be appealed against to the Kharkov Regional Court of Appeal within fifteen days from its delivery.” 18. On 10 July 2002 the court order of 5 July 2002 was sent to the SIZO for implementation. 19. In the meantime, the applicant, who was held in an ordinary cell, started to show signs of personality disorder. At the subsequent inquiry the inmates with whom he shared a cell stated that the applicant had acted in a strange way, mumbling incoherently, suddenly yelling at them or starting a fight. On 2 July 2002 the applicant assaulted one of his cellmates. On the same day he was transferred to the medical wing of the SIZO, where he shared a cell with other prisoners. 20. From 2 July 2002 onwards each new duty shift of the SIZO guards was regularly informed of the possibility of violent outbursts on the applicant’s part, and of the threat he posed to other detainees, the SIZO staff and himself. 21. On 3 July 2002 the prison psychiatrist examined the applicant, diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia and catatonic stupor and prescribed tranquilisers, analeptics (drugs that stimulate the central nervous system) and systemic drugs. On 4 July 2002 the psychiatrist found that the applicant had recovered from the catatonic stupor, and prescribed a change in his medication. 22. On 8 July 2002 the applicant became particularly agitated, moving erratically around the cell, waving his arms, bumping into the furniture and swearing at prison guards. At 7.00 a.m. three prison guards on duty were called by the medical wing staff to deal with the applicant. Through the peephole they observed his erratic movements and, having classified them as an “outrage” (буйство) within the meaning of section 18 of the Law “on Detention on Remand”, ordered the applicant to stand still, face the wall and put his hands behind his back. When the applicant failed to comply, the guards warned him that they were about to use force and entered the cell. The guards beat the applicant with truncheons, forced him to the floor and handcuffed him. Although a prison paramedic was called to attend to the applicant soon after the incident, there is no information that he received any treatment or medication for the injuries sustained during the struggle to restrain him. 23. In a report dated 8 July 2002 and amended, it would appear, on 15 July 2002, the three prison guards and the paramedic involved in the incident informed the Governor of the SIZO about the circumstances of the use of special police equipment (truncheons and handcuffs). In different handwriting it was added that the handcuffs were applied at 7.00 a.m. on 8 July 2002 and removed at 6.45 a.m. on 15 July 2002. At the bottom of the page, below the signatures of the officers and the paramedic, it is indicated that “distinct traces of the use of [truncheons and handcuffs] were found” and that “no other injuries ... could be detected”. These notes were signed by a certain Kh., apparently a prison doctor or paramedic, and dated 15 July 2002. 24. On 8 July 2002 the Governor ordered the applicant to be confined to a disciplinary cell for ten days for “serious breach of prison rules”. Before his transfer the applicant was examined by two prison officers and a doctor, who indicated in their report that his shoulders and buttocks bore traces of injuries inflicted by truncheons. They concluded, however, that the applicant was fit to be detained in the disciplinary cell. 25. Whilst in the disciplinary cell the applicant was locked up for about twenty-three hours each day. Although the disciplinary cell was visited each day by a physician and psychiatrist, no treatment or medication was administered to him as, according to the medical records, he refused to accept them. The entries made by the prison physician in the applicant’s medical record for 10, 12 and 16 July 2002 state: “10 July 2002 ... [the applicant] lurched towards me, stretching out his handcuffed hands... 12 July 2002 ... [the applicant] was moving quickly around the cell, bending down and trying to pull his legs between his handcuffed hands... banging his head against the wall trying to free himself from the handcuffs ... 16 July 2002 ... [the applicant] is trying to remove the handcuffs, rolling on the floor”. 26. The applicant’s detention in the disciplinary cell continued until his discharge from the SIZO on 17 July 2002. 27. On 17 July 2002 the applicant was transferred to the Hospital for compulsory treatment pursuant to the Kominternovskyy Court’s judgment of 5 July 2002. 28. On 27 January 2003, following a fresh assessment of the applicant’s mental condition, the psychiatric commission of the Hospital recommended that his psychiatric treatment should continue. 29. On 28 February 2003, having regard to the experts’ report of 29 May 2002 and the oral submissions of the doctor in attendance at the Hospital, the Kominternovskyy Court allowed the petition of the chief psychiatrist of the Hospital and ordered an extension of the applicant’s compulsory psychiatric treatment pending his recovery. 30. On 2 April 2003 the applicant’s mother filed a petition with the Moskovskyy District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Moskovskyy Court”) under Article 256 of the Code of Civil Procedure (hereafter “the CCivP”) seeking to have her son declared incapable by reason of mental disorder. 31. On 26 May 2003 the psychiatric commission of the Hospital recommended that the applicant’s compulsory treatment be discontinued. 32. On 28 May 2003 the Moskovskyy Court ordered a forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant under Article 258 of the CCivP in order to determine his sanity. 33. On 7 July 2003 the Kominternovskyy Court lifted the compulsory treatment order. It also indicated that criminal proceedings against the applicant should be resumed and a forensic psychiatric examination ordered to determine his sanity at the time of the offence. 34. On 1 August 2003 the pre-trial investigation against the applicant was resumed. 35. On 4 August 2003 the Hospital received the Kominternovskyy Court’s ruling of 7 July 2003. 36. On 5 August 2003 the investigator requested the Kominternovskyy Court to authorise the applicant’s inpatient psychiatric examination under Article 205 of the CCrP, which request was granted on 6 August 2003. 37. Both forensic examinations ordered by the Moskovskyy and Kominternovskyy Courts were completed on 1 September 2003. The psychiatric experts concluded that the applicant’s mental disorder prevented him from understanding the consequences of his actions and controlling his behaviour. 38. On 2 September 2003 the applicant was discharged from the Hospital and handed over to his mother. 39. On 4 November 2003 the Kominternovskyy Court terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant in view of his lack of criminal liability. 40. On 11 November 2003 the Moskovskyy Court allowed the mother’s petition and declared the applicant legally incapacitated. 41. Upon the applicant’s admission to the Hospital on 17 July 2002 his mother was informed of his whereabouts. Ms Kucheruk stated that when she visited him the following day she saw that he was badly injured and could hardly move or talk. The only words he allegedly managed to utter were “[they] beat [me] severely” (cильно били). 42. On 25 July 2002 the applicant’s mother filed a criminal complaint against the prison guards for ill-treatment of her son. 43. On 2 August 2002 the applicant’s mother and a human rights activist from a local non-governmental organisation visited the applicant in his ward. They drew up a document attesting that the applicant had an injury on his head behind the left ear, several bruises on the face and forehead and deep cuts around his wrists. 44. On an unspecified date the Governor of the SIZO opened a criminal investigation into the applicant’s mother’s complaint. On 19 and 20 August 2002 written statements were taken from two of the inmates who had shared an ordinary cell with the applicant, from his four cellmates in the medical wing who witnessed the incident of 8 July 2002, from three prison guards involved in that incident and from a prison paramedic. The inmates and the prison guards briefly outlined the events of 2-8 July 2002 as they are described above in paragraphs 19 and 22. The paramedic wrote that he had been called to attend to the applicant after the latter had been immobilised by the guards. He had observed truncheon marks on the applicant’s shoulder blades and buttocks and marks on his wrists made by handcuffs. 45. As part of the inquiry, on 14 August 2002 the Governor of the SIZO ordered that medical evidence be obtained. On the same day the applicant was examined by an expert from the Kharkiv Forensic Medicine Institute. The expert’s report stated the following: “Examination Mr Kucheruk has a 2.5x0.5 cm oblong abrasion with a thick scab on the outer part of his right wrist. The wound is horizontal. Similar abrasions are observed on the inner part of the right wrist and the outer and inner parts of the left wrist, as well as on the left elbow, the right occipital area and the inner-rear and frontal parts of the left thigh. These injuries measure from 1x0.2 cm. to 5.5x0.3 cm. ... Conclusion 1. According to the medical documents provided [by the Governor of the SIZO] it is established that Mr Kucheruk bore bruises and abrasions which had been inflicted by blunt solid objects. When Mr Kucheruk was examined on 14.08.2002 he had abrasions on his head, right foot, arms and left thigh. He also had bruises on the left eye and the left shoulder. All these injuries were inflicted by blunt solid objects. The bruises were three to five days old and the abrasions seven to ten days old... 2. Having regard to the description of the injuries in medical documents [drawn up by the SIZO staff], as well as the entries for 8 and 15 July 2002, where the injuries are not described at all, and the nature of the injuries (indicating the use of truncheons and handcuffs), it is impossible to draw any conclusions about the time of the injuries. 4. Mr Kucheruk’s injuries could have been inflicted by special equipment (truncheons and handcuffs).” 46. On 21 August 2002 the Governor of the SIZO decided not to bring criminal proceedings against the guards involved in the incident, finding no wrongdoing on their part. He relied in this conclusion on the written statements made by the inmates and prison officers and the forensic report of 14 August 2002. On an unknown date the prison supervision department of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office confirmed this decision. 47. On 4 September 2002 the applicant’s mother received a letter from the Governor of the SIZO in which he informed her that no criminal investigation in respect of the accused prison officers was to be opened, without, however, indicating the date of the relevant decision or providing a copy. In his letter the Governor also expressed the opinion that the truncheons and handcuffs had been used by the guards in accordance with the relevant regulations, to protect the SIZO staff and the applicant himself from his uncontrolled and aggressive behaviour. 48. On 26 December 2002 the Kharkiv Regional Prison Department (hereafter “the Department”) informed the applicant’s mother that an additional internal inquiry, undertaken, apparently, on her request, had revealed no wrongdoing on the part of the SIZO guards. 49. By a letter of 16 January 2003 the Head of the Department informed the applicant’s mother that her further complaints were unsubstantiated. He referred in this connection to the inquiry carried out by the Governor of the SIZO, which had culminated in his decision of 21 August 2002. This was the first mention of the date of the Governor’s decision in any official correspondence with the applicant’s mother. On 8 February 2003 she requested a copy of the final report and access to the case-file. On 25 February 2003 the Head of the Department rejected this request. On 27 March 2003 he rejected her second request for access to the file. 50. On 31 March 2003 the applicant’s mother challenged the Governor’s decision of 21 August 2002 before a court. On 27 May 2003 the Zhovtnevy District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Zhovtnevy Court”), having heard the prosecutor, rejected her complaint as unsubstantiated. The applicant’s mother appealed. 51. In the course of the appeal proceedings, on 14 August 2003, the applicant’s lawyer was, for the first time, given access to the case-file. 52. On 18 November 2003 the Kharkiv Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of the Zhovtnevy Court on the grounds that it had been taken in the complainant’s absence, and remitted the case for fresh consideration. 53. On 24 December 2003 the Zhovtnevy Court found, without giving any details, that the inquiry was flawed. It reopened the case and handed it to the Governor of the SIZO for further investigation. 54. On 4 March 2004 the Governor, referring to the same evidence as before, discontinued the criminal proceedings again. His final report indicated, inter alia, that: “...Mr Kucheruk arrived at the [SIZO] with a medical certificate, issued by the city hospital no. 13 on 15 April 2002, according to which he was fit to be detained in a SIZO. ... On the basis of this information Mr Kucheruk was placed in a psychiatric ward of the medical wing. On 16 April 2002 Mr Kucheruk was examined by [the prison psychiatrist] who diagnosed him as suffering from schizophrenia. At the time of the examination his mental condition was satisfactory and he did not need any active treatment.” As to the applicant’s conduct after the incident of 2 July 2002 and his transfer from the ordinary cell to the medical wing, the Governor stated that: “On 3 July 2002 Mr Kucheruk was examined by [the prison psychiatrist], who found him suffering from schizophrenia and catatonic stupor and prescribed the relevant medication. On 4 July 2002 the patient recovered from the catatonic stupor ... but continued to have tense relations with his cellmates. Accordingly, based on general information about Mr Kucheruk’s behaviour, the officers on duty were warned daily about his possible violent outbursts against his cellmates or the SIZO staff.” The report of 4 March 2004 further states that, following the incident of 8 July 2002, the applicant was placed in the disciplinary cell for serious breach of prison rules. Having regard to the applicant’s mental condition, the paramedic who examined him after the incident had recommended keeping him handcuffed. As regards the time of the applicant’s discharge to the Hospital, the Governor indicated that: “The [Kominternovskyy Court’s judgment of 5 July 2002] did not contain any provision for immediate execution. It set out a fifteen-day time limit for appeal; therefore the term provided by Article 404 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for execution of this judgment was complied with as the applicant was transferred to the [Hospital] on 17 July 2002.” 55. On 1 October 2004 the Zhovtnevy Court, acting on a complaint lodged by the applicant’s lawyer, quashed that decision and ordered further investigations, pointing out the following irregularities: failure to take account of the submissions of the applicant’s mother concerning the applicant’s state of health in July-August 2002; failure to measure the lawfulness and reasonableness of the guards’ conduct against the legal principle prohibiting degrading treatment; failure to determine whether the applicant’s misbehaviour constituted a breach of prison rules that warranted his placement in a disciplinary cell; failure to consider the proportionality of the force used; the fact that the investigation was conducted by the Governor of the SIZO, a person whose impartiality was highly doubtful. 56. The case-file was transmitted to the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office for additional investigations. In a final report of 1 November 2004 a prosecutor of the prison supervision department of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office came to a similar conclusion to that reached by the Governor of the SIZO, that the applicant was fit for detention in the SIZO and the prison officers concerned acted properly on the basis of the orders they were given and the relevant regulations. The prosecutor referred to the evidence collected by the Governor’s investigation and the statements of the prison psychiatrist that certain drugs should normally be used to pacify mentally ill patients, and when no drugs were available, special equipment could be used to immobilise such patients. The prosecutor further agreed with the Governor’s finding that the applicant’s conduct constituted a flagrant violation of prison rules and warranted his detention in the disciplinary cell. The applicant’s mother appealed. 57. On 30 July 2005 the Chervonozavodskyy District Court of Kharkiv (hereafter “the Chervonozavodskyy Court”) quashed that report and ordered further investigations as the authorities had failed to follow the instructions of the Zhovtnevy Court. 58. On 6 September 2005 a senior prosecutor of the prison supervision department of the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office, following additional investigation, decided not to bring any charges against the prison officials. His final report repeated, in substance, the findings in the report of 1 November 2004 that the applicant had been fit to be detained in the SIZO and that there had been no wrongdoing on the part of the prison authorities. The senior prosecutor stated, inter alia, that the applicant’s detention after 12 June 2002 had been based on a letter from the Head of the Investigative Department of the Kominternovskyy District Police Station that the applicant’s case-file had been sent to the Kominternovskyy District Prosecutor’s Office for approval. As to the applicant’s ten-day confinement in the disciplinary cell, he considered that “the severity of the punishment imposed was fully in keeping with the nature of the offence committed”. He further considered that the applicant had been held in the SIZO until 17 July 2002 because of the fifteen-day time-limit for entry into force of the judgment of 5 July 2002. Although the forensic report of 14 August 2002 recorded the use of handcuffs by the prison guards, the investigation did not establish whether or not, between 8 and 15 July 2002, the applicant was handcuffed all the time. The senior prosecutor concluded that there was no evidence that the prison officers had acted in bad faith or in violation of the relevant laws and regulations when restraining the applicant with truncheons and handcuffs, putting him in a disciplinary cell and holding him in the SIZO until 17 July 2002. 59. On 28 October 2005 the applicant’s mother challenged that report before the Chervonozavodskyy Court, where the proceedings are still pending. 60. The relevant extracts from the Constitution read as follows: “Article 28 Everyone has the right to respect for his or her dignity. No one shall be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that violates his or her dignity. ... Article 29 Every person has the right to freedom and personal inviolability. No one shall be arrested or held in custody other than pursuant to a substantiated court decision and only on the grounds and in accordance with the procedure established by law...” 61. The text of Article 19 and Articles 92 and 94-96 of the Criminal Code of 5 April 2001 can be found in the Court’s judgment in the case of Gorshkov v. Ukraine (no. 67531/01, § 28, 8 November 2005). 62. Article 365 of the Code provides: “Excess of authority or official powers, that is the wilful commission by an official of acts which patently exceed the rights and powers vested in him or her and which cause any significant damage to the legally protected rights and interests of individual citizens, state and public interests or those of legal entities shall be punishable ....” 63. Article 367 of the Code prescribes liability for official negligence: “Neglect of official duty, that is failure to perform, or improper performance, by an official of his or her official duties due to negligence, where it causes any significant damage to the legally protected rights and interests of individual citizens, state and public interests or those of legal entities, shall be punishable ...” 64. The relevant provisions of the CCrP regulating the conduct of pretrial investigation proceedings are summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Sergey Shevchenko v. Ukraine (no. 32478/02, §§ 38 and 39, 4 April 2006), 65. Article 101 enumerates the bodies responsible for inquiries. Normally these functions are discharged by the police. However, paragraph 5 of Article 101 also vests this power in the governors of prisons and pre-trial detention centres, who conduct inquiries into offences committed by prison officials involving infringements of prison rules. 66. Articles 148 (purpose of and grounds for taking preventive measures), 149 (list of preventive measures), 150 (circumstances that should be taken into account in choosing a preventive measure) and 156 (time-limits for holding in custody) of the CCrP are to be found in the Nevmerzhitsky v. Ukraine judgment (no. 54825/00, § 53, ECHR 2005). 67. Article 155 of the CCrP insofar as relevant provides as follows: “Detention on remand as a preventive measure shall be applied in cases concerning offences for which the law envisages a penalty of more than three years’ imprisonment... Persons against whom a detention on remand order is issued shall be held in pre-trial detention centres.” 68. Article 237 of the CCrP insofar as relevant provides: “In a case received from the prosecutor [with the bill of indictment], the judge in a preliminary hearing shall resolve the following questions: ...4) whether there are any reasons to change, terminate or apply a preventive measure.” 69. Article 241 of the CCrP reads as follows: “A preparatory hearing shall be held within 10 days or, in complex cases, 30 days of receipt of the case-file by the court.” 70. Article 205 of the CCrP provides: “If forensic medical or psychiatric examination necessitates long-term monitoring or assessment of the suspect, the court, on the investigator’s request and with the prosecutor’s authorisation, may order the suspect’s commitment to the relevant medical institution.” 71. Article 347 of the CCrP provides: “An appeal may be lodged against: ...2) a court order concerning the application of ... compulsory medical treatment.” 72. According to Article 349 of the CCrP: “An appeal against a judgment, ruling or order of a first instance court ... may be filed within fifteen days of its adoption...” 73. Article 402 of the CCrP reads as follows: “The court order or ruling shall become final and enforceable upon the expiry of the time-limit for appeal.” 74. Articles 416 (Grounds for the application of measures of compulsory medical treatment) and 422 (Termination or modification of the applicable compulsory measures of medical treatment) of the CCrP are set out in the Gorshkov judgment (cited above, § 31). 75. Article 424 provides as follows: “An appeal or cassation appeal or an appellate or cassation petition by the prosecutor (апеляційне чи касаційне подання прокурора) against a ruling or resolution adopted by a judge or a court in the manner laid down by this Chapter, shall be entered in the ordinary manner.” 76. According to Article 417 of the CCrP: “Pre-trial investigation in cases concerning illegal acts committed by persons who are not criminally responsible or who bear only limited criminal responsibility, as well as in cases concerning offences committed by persons who become mentally ill after the events in question but before the imposition of the sentence, shall be conducted by the investigating authorities pursuant to the rules set out in Articles 111-130 and 148222 of the present Code. Following the completion of the pre-trial investigation, if the alleged offender is found to have no, or limited, criminal responsibility, the investigator shall draw up a ruling requesting the court to commit the person for compulsory medical treatment ... This ruling shall be sent to the prosecutor.” 77. Article 418 of the CCrP reads as follows: “Having received a case with the ruling under Article 417 of this Code, the prosecutor: 1) if he agrees with the ruling, shall confirm it and transmit the case to the court; 2) if he finds that the ... collected evidence is insufficient to reach a conclusion as to the mental condition of the accused or that the collected evidence is insufficient to prove that the illegal act was committed by the person concerned, shall return the case-file to the investigator with written instructions for further inquires.” 78. Article 419 of the CCrP insofar as relevant provides: “If the judge or the president of the relevant court who received the case-file with the request for compulsory medical treatment agrees with the investigator’s ruling, he or she shall send the case directly for trial. The trial in such cases shall be held in open hearing, with the obligatory participation of the prosecutor and defence lawyer, in accordance with rules laid down in Chapters 25 and 26 [Articles 283-317] of this Code.” 79. According to Article 421 of the CCrP: “When it is established that a [mentally ill] person has committed an illegal act or a person became mentally ill after committing an offence ... the court shall commit him or her for compulsory medical measures, indicating exactly what measure should be applied.” 80. Article 221 of the CCivP provides in its relevant part: “The court must suspend its examination of a case if ...it is impossible to hear the case before other civil, criminal or administrative proceedings have been terminated.” 81. Article 256 of the CCivP provides that close relatives of a mentally ill person, associations, a prosecutor or a local board of tutorship may apply to the court with a view to declaring that person incapable by reason of mental disorder. 82. According to Article 257 of the CCivP a petition filed under Article 256 should include evidence of the mental disorder which prevents the person concerned from understanding his or her actions and conducting his or her affairs. 83. Article 258 of the CCivP empowers the court to order forensic psychiatric examination of the person concerned. In exceptional cases, when the person overtly avoids examination, the court may order his or her compulsory psychiatric examination. 84. Section 8 of the Act provides that: “Detained persons shall be held in ordinary cells. In exceptional circumstances ... and for medical reasons, following a reasoned decision of the relevant investigating authority or governor of the relevant pre-trial detention facility, a detainee may be placed in solitary confinement.” 85. Section 18 of the Act sets out rules governing the use of force by prison guards. Officers in pre-trial detention facilities are entitled to use physical force, police equipment and firearms against the inmates. The use of force should be preceded by a warning if the circumstances so allow. If the use of force cannot be avoided, it should not exceed the level necessary for fulfilment by the officers of their duties and should be carried out so as to inflict as little injury as possible. Prison officers are entitled to use force and special equipment, including unarmed combat, handcuffs, truncheons etc., with a view to putting an end to physical resistance, violence, outrage (буйство) and opposition to the lawful directions of the administration of the detention facility when other means of achieving a legitimate objective prove ineffective. Special police equipment and firearms must not be used on women with visible signs of pregnancy, elderly persons, persons with visible signs of invalidity or underage persons, except in the event of an assault by a group of these persons which is dangerous for the lives of the prison officers or others. 86. A governor has the power to place a prisoner in a disciplinary cell where this is necessary to put an end to physical resistance, violence, outrage and opposition to the lawful directions of the administration. 87. The choice of the means to be used and the time and intensity of their use depends on the circumstances, the nature of the wrongdoing and the personal characteristics of the perpetrator. 88. An officer who uses force or special equipment must immediately report it to his direct supervisor and the relevant prosecutor. All persons against whom the above means have been used should be immediately examined by a medical practitioner. 89. The relevant provisions of the Act are quoted in the case of Gorshkov (cited above, § 30). 90. Paragraph 4 of the Resolution enumerates the cases when special means may be used, including when they are necessary for putting an end to resistance to police officers or other persons carrying out official public order duties. 91. Paragraph 6 of the Resolution provides that decisions to use special means must be taken by an official responsible for maintening public order or by the head of the particular operation. A person taking such a decision must immediately inform his or her superiors in writing. 92. Paragraph 7 of the Resolution obliges the police officers who applied the special means to ensure immediate medical assistance to the victims. 93. Paragraph 14 of the Resolution prohibits the application of rubber truncheons to the head, neck, collar area, stomach and genitalia. 94. According to Paragraph 2.5 of Decree no. 346/877 psychiatric establishments are obliged to inform the relevant local police department of the imminent release of mentally ill persons. 95. The relevant extracts from Decree no. 397 of the Ministry of Health of 8 August 2001 on the procedure for applying compulsory measures of medical treatment in psychiatric hospitals to persons who have mental illnesses and who have committed socially dangerous acts (approved by the Supreme Court of Ukraine, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the General Prosecution Service) are set out in Gorshkov (cited above, § 32). 96. The relevant extracts from the Instruction on the procedure for applying measures of compulsory medical treatment to persons of unsound mind who have committed socially dangerous acts (adopted by Decree No. 397 of the Ministry of Health) are also quoted in the case of Gorshkov (cited above, § 33). 97. According to Section 8 of the Resolution, force, as an element of excess of power, can be both physical and psychological. Physical force may involve, inter alia, unlawful deprivation of liberty and inflicting blows. 98. Section 9 of the Resolution provides that illegal actions constituting an excess of power fall within the scope of criminal law when they are “painful or abusive”, and the Supreme Court has declared that such actions are to be interpreted as “painful or abusive” when they inflict physical pain or moral suffering on the victim. These actions can involve, inter alia, the unlawful use of special police equipment such as truncheons and handcuffs. 99. The 1983 Resolution was valid at the material time. In 2005 it was replaced by Resolution no. 7 of 3 June 2005. 100. In both Resolutions (1983 and 2005 - Sections 9 and 15 respectively) the Supreme Court, interpreting domestic law regulating the types of compulsory measures of a medical character, stated that a court which orders compulsory treatment of a person against whom a preventive measure had been taken should simultaneously order the discontinuation of the preventive measure from the moment of the person’s admission to a psychiatric institution. 101. The relevant provisions of the first and second annual reports are set out in the Nevmerzhitsky judgment (cited above, §§ 60 and 61). 102. The relevant extracts from Committee of Ministers Recommendation No. R (87) 3 on the European Prison Rules (adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 12 February 1987 at the 404th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies) read as follows: “Medical services 26. 1. At every institution there shall be available the services of at least one qualified general practitioner. The medical services should be organised in close relation with the general heath administration of the community or nation. They shall include a psychiatric service for the diagnosis and, in proper cases, the treatment of states of mental abnormality. 2. Sick prisoners who require specialist treatment shall be transferred to specialised institutions or to civil hospitals. Where hospital facilities are provided in an institution, their equipment, furnishings and pharmaceutical supplies shall be suitable for the medical care and treatment of sick prisoners, and there shall be staff of suitably trained officers. 30. 1. The medical officer shall have the care of the physical and mental health of the prisoners and shall see, under the conditions and with a frequency consistent with hospital standards, all sick prisoners, all who report illness or injury and any prisoner to whom attention is specially directed. 2. The medical officer shall report to the director whenever it is considered that a prisoner’s physical or mental health has been or will be adversely affected by continued imprisonment or by any condition of imprisonment. Discipline and punishment 38. 1. Punishment by disciplinary confinement and any other punishment which might have an adverse effect on the physical or mental health of the prisoner shall only be imposed if the medical officer, after examination, certifies in writing that the prisoner is fit to sustain it. Instruments of restraint 39. The use of chains and irons shall be prohibited. Handcuffs, restraint-jackets and other body restraints shall never be applied as a punishment. They shall not be used except in the following circumstances: a. if necessary, as a precaution against escape during a transfer, provided that they shall be removed when the prisoner appears before a judicial or administrative authority unless that authority decides otherwise; b. on medical grounds, by direction and under the supervision of the medical officer; c. by order of the director, if other methods of control fail, in order to protect a prisoner from self-injury, injury to others or to prevent serious damage to property; in such instances the director shall at once consult the medical officer and report to the higher administrative authority. 40. The patterns and manner of use of the instruments of restraint authorised in the preceding paragraph shall be decided by law or regulation. Such instruments must not be applied for any longer time than is strictly necessary. Insane and mentally abnormal prisoners 100. 1. Persons who are found to be insane should not be detained in prisons and arrangements shall be made to remove them to appropriate establishments for the mentally ill as soon as possible. 2. Specialised institutions or sections under medical management should be available for the observation and treatment of prisoners suffering gravely from any other mental disease or abnormality. 3. The medical or psychiatric service of the penal institutions shall provide for the psychiatric treatment of all prisoners who are in need of such treatment.” 103. The relevant extracts from the CPT Report [CPT/Inf (2004) 34] on a visit to Ukraine from 10 to 26 September 2000 read as follows: “The CPT would point out that all mentally ill prisoners, including those serving life sentences, should be cared for and receive treatment in a hospital facility adequately equipped and with qualified staff. Forcing such prisoners to stay in prison, where they cannot receive appropriate treatment for lack of suitable facilities or because such a facility refuses to accept them, is an unacceptable state of affairs. The transfer of mentally ill prisoners to an appropriate psychiatric facility should be considered a high priority.”","['3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4']",[],['5'],['5-1'],[],1

The applicants were born in 1973 and 1978 respectively. The first applicant resides in Turkey whereas the second applicant lives in Sweden. 5. The applicants, refugees under the mandate of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), arrived in Turkey on an unspecified date. They were arrested by security forces and, as they had entered Turkish territory illegally, were deported back to Iraq on 17 June 2008. 6. The applicants immediately re-entered Turkey. 7. On 21 June 2008 they were arrested by road checkpoint gendarmerie officers from the Gökyazı gendarme station, in Muş, as their passports were found to be false. 8. The applicants were subsequently placed in the police headquarters in the Hasköy district of Muş. 9. On 30 June 2008 the applicants lodged an application with the Court and requested not to be deported to Iran or Iraq (application no. 30471/08). On the same day the President of the Chamber to which the case was allocated decided, in the interests of the parties and the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court, to indicate to the Government of Turkey, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicants should not be deported to Iran or Iraq until 4 August 2008. On 22 July 2008 the President of the Chamber decided to extend until further notice the interim measure indicated under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. 10. Between 21 June and 26 September 2008 the applicants were detained at the Hasköy police headquarters. On the latter date the applicants were transferred to the Kırklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre, where they were held until 26 October 2009. 11. The applicants submitted that the detention facility where they were held was in the basement of the building. Therefore, it was damp and received insufficient natural light. The facility measured 70 square metres in total and consisted of three open rooms. The rooms measured 1216 square metres. There was one bathroom and a hallway, where there were two beds. There were eight and four bunk beds in the first and the second rooms respectively. The third room was empty. 12. For the first five weeks of the detention the applicants were held with eighty-three other detainees. From the sixth to the tenth week of their detention the number of detainees dropped to thirty-one. During the final two weeks those remaining were also deported. At the end of their detention in Hasköy the applicants were alone in the facility. 13. The mattresses and blankets were dirty and infested with lice. No pillows or bedding were provided. During the first weeks of their detention, the applicants had to sleep on the floor without mattresses, with blankets only, due to the overcrowding. The facility did not have showers or hot water. The applicants were taken to a public bathhouse only twice during the three months that they spent in that facility. Nor were they provided with towels, toilet paper, toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving items or shampoo. The toilets were very dirty and were never cleaned. Nor did the administration provide proper cleaning material to the detainees for them to do the cleaning. The facility was infected with cockroaches and mosquitoes. As a result of the poor detention conditions, the applicants suffered from dermatological diseases and infections. They were taken to a doctor for the skin problems, but they were never given the prescribed medication. They were ill as a result of water contamination at the beginning of their detention in Hasköy. Furthermore, the first applicant suffered from arthritis and the second applicant had back problems. They did not receive any medical check-ups for their health problems. The applicants were provided with meals twice a day. The meals consisted of soup and an insufficient amount of bread. They were not given any drinkable water. They were also not provided with clothing. Therefore, they had to wear the same clothes for three months. 14. The detention facility did not have any provision for indoor or outdoor activities. The applicants were taken out only when they were forced to do work, such as collecting rubbish, watering the lawn, sweeping the floors and the stairs, or loading and unloading, for which they were never paid. 15. Finally, throughout their detention in the Hasköy police headquarters, the applicants were not allowed to make or receive telephone calls. Nor could they have visits, except for one visit from a UNHCR officer. At the request of the UNHCR Ankara office, a lawyer went to the Hasköy police headquarters to visit the applicants. He was however not allowed to meet the applicants. 16. The applicants submitted several written complaints regarding the conditions of their detention. However, the authorities refused to accept the letters containing their complaints. 17. The Government submitted that the applicants were held in the Hasköy police headquarters building between 21 June and 26 September 2008 on a temporary basis while awaiting transfer to a foreigners' admission and accommodation centre. The Government noted that during the period in question a total of ninety-six foreigners stayed in the facility. However, no more than forty-two persons were detained at any given time. Besides, between 2 August and 26 September 2008 the applicants were held alone. 18. The Government further submitted that a foreigners' guesthouse had been constructed in Hasköy subsequent to the applicants' transfer to Kırklareli foreigners' admission and accommodation centre. According to the Government's submissions, in this new facility the food is provided three times a day by the centre administration. Although there is no health clinic within the facility, the detainees are provided with adequate medical assistance in the nearby clinics and State hospitals. They are allowed to go into the open air and can exercise in the garden of the facility, where they are served their meals and play football with the staff working at the centre. The Government contended that lavatories, toilets and bathrooms were provided in the centre and the immigrants were sent to the Turkish bath periodically. They finally noted that the applicants could contact the outside world by telephone and internet. 19. In their submissions dated 12 October 2009 the applicants complained about the conditions of detention in the Kırklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre. They complained in particular about the quality of food and water, insufficient medical support, unsatisfactory sanitary facilities, their inability to take exercise and the increase in the number of detainees held in the Kırklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre. In support of their allegations the applicants submitted a number of photos, including four photos which were taken on 11 October 2009 and which allegedly showed the back and legs of the first applicant who claimed to be suffering from a skin rash. 20. The Government submitted that the application concerned the conditions of detention at the Hasköy police headquarters and not those in the Kırklareli Foreigners' Admission and Accommodation Centre. They therefore requested the Court not to examine the application in so far as it concerned complaints regarding the detention conditions at the Kırklareli Centre. 21. A description of the relevant law can be found in the judgments of Z.N.S. v. Turkey (no. 21896/08, §§ 34-35, 19 January 2010) and Charahili v. Turkey (no. 46605/07, § 48, 13 April 2010).",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants are pensioners who live in the Moscow Region. Before retirement they used to work in hazardous industry. They had a dispute with a pension authority about the scope of their privileged pensions and appealed to the Region’s district and town courts. 6. In March–November 2006 the courts held for the applicants and ordered the pension authority to recalculate the pensions. The courts based their finding on the Law on Labour Pensions. In May 2006–February 2007 these judgments became binding and were executed. 7. On the pension authority’s request, in October 2007–March 2008 the district and town courts quashed their judgments due to discovery of new circumstances. The courts found, in particular, that the judgments had ignored the interpretation of the Law on Labour Pensions given by the Supreme Court in December 2005 and March 2007. 8. The applicants’ cases were remitted for a rehearing and eventually dismissed.","['6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Vienna. 6. The applicant had been an employee of the embassy of the United States of America in Vienna since March 1978. From January 1981 onwards she had a contract of indefinite duration and worked as a photographer at the embassy. Following an accident in 1983 the competent authority issued a decision stating that she qualified for protection under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act (Invalideneinstellungsgesetz). Following a further accident, classified as work-related, the embassy dismissed her in September 1987. 7. Her dismissal was declared void by the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht) on the ground that it required the prior agreement of the competent authority under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act. The court dismissed the argument submitted by the United States that it lacked jurisdiction on account of the United States’ immunity. It found that, while foreign States enjoyed immunity with regard to acta iure imperii, they came within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts with regard to acta iure gestionis. The conclusion and performance of an employment contract fell within the latter category. The Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichthof) upheld that judgment on 21 November 1990, noting that the United States had not maintained the objection of State immunity in the further course of the proceedings. 8. As a result of the above proceedings, the applicant continued to have a valid employment contract with the United States embassy in Vienna. However, the latter refused to make use of her services. Instead, on 31 January 1991, they applied to the Vienna Committee for Disabled Persons requesting retroactive approval of the applicant’s dismissal or, alternatively, agreement to a future dismissal. The Committee refused to grant retroactive approval for the applicant’s dismissal of September 1987 but gave its approval for a future dismissal. The competent Federal Ministry upheld that decision. On 13 September 1994 the Administrative Court, ruling on a complaint by the applicant, set aside the decision to grant approval for the applicant’s future dismissal, finding that the authorities had failed to establish relevant facts and had not duly weighed the parties’ interests. The case was referred back to the Committee. On 16 January 1996 the United States withdrew its application, stating that it had always maintained that the application of the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act to employees of the embassy interfered with the country’s sovereignty. 9. Meanwhile, the applicant brought proceedings against the United States requesting payment of her salary. In a first set of proceedings, concerning salary payments up to June 1995, the United States unsuccessfully raised an objection of jurisdictional immunity. Subsequently, the United States paid the applicant salary arrears of 3.7 million Austrian schillings (approximately 269,000 euros (EUR)). On the occasion of the payment, the lawyer who had represented the United States in the proceedings informed the applicant by a letter dated 16 October 1996 that the payment did not imply any acceptance of the Austrian courts’ judgments and that the United States considered her employment contract to be terminated and would, if she raised any further claims, “make use of its diplomatic rights and immunities”. 10. Further proceedings relating to the payment of salary from July 1995 to August 1996 led to a final default judgment by the Vienna Labour and Social Court. However, the United States did not pay the amount awarded to the applicant. 11. The applicant also unsuccessfully brought proceedings against the United States claiming reimbursement of the social security contributions which she had been ordered to pay by the Austrian authorities and a part of which the employer was, under her employment contract, obliged to refund. In those proceedings the United States authorities refused to serve the summons to attend the hearing. The Austrian courts dismissed the applicant’s request for a judgment in default. Their position was upheld by the Supreme Court’s judgment of 11 June 2001 (see below, paragraph 28). 12. On 29 December 1998 the applicant brought an action against the United States of America before the Vienna Labour and Social Court, claiming salary payments from September 1996 onwards. The court scheduled a first hearing for 20 October 1999. 13. An attempt to serve the applicant’s action and the summons to the hearing on the United States through the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, under section 11(2) of the Service Act (Zustellgesetz), failed. According to the file a staff member of the Austrian embassy in Washington handed these documents over to a staff member of the United States Department of State. However, by letter of 25 January 2000 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Ministry of Justice, which in turn informed the Vienna Labour and Social Court, that the United States authorities had refused to serve the summons and had returned the documents at issue to the Austrian embassy in Washington. The letter was accompanied by a note from the United States Department of State informing the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the United States wished to assert its immunity in any case brought by the applicant. In a letter of 4 February 2000 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also informed the applicant accordingly. 14. On 18 February 2000 the Vienna Labour and Social Court dismissed the applicant’s request for a judgment in default, noting that it had been impossible to summon the defendant. An appeal by the applicant to the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) was unsuccessful. 15. The Supreme Court dismissed her appeal on points of law on 5 September 2001. Referring to its judgment of 11 June 2001 in a parallel case brought by the applicant (see paragraph 28 below), it noted that the summons had not been duly served on the defendant, namely the United States Department of Justice. Consequently, the conditions for giving a judgment in default were not fulfilled. 16. By a decision of 29 October 2001 the Vienna Labour and Social Court held that the applicant’s action and the summons to the hearing had not been served on account of the manifest refusal of the United States to comply with the request for service. It followed that further attempts to summon the defendant did not have any prospects of success. 17. Subsequently, the applicant requested that the summons be served by means of publication under Article 121 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung) or, alternatively, that it be served on a court-appointed representative (Curator) under Article 116 of the Code. 18. By decision of 25 April 2002 the Vienna Labour and Social Court appointed a lawyer, Dr G., to represent the United States of America. It noted that the foreign authorities had refused to serve the summonses in any of the proceedings brought by the applicant. In the court’s view the United States had wrongly relied on its alleged immunity. 19. On 18 November 2002 the Vienna Court of Appeal, following an appeal by Dr. G., quashed that decision. The relevant part of its decision reads as follows: “In acting on a request for service, the State to which the request is made is exercising sovereign powers. This applies even if the court documents in question are addressed to that State and the authority responsible for acting on the request for assistance (in this instance the Department of State) refuses to forward them to the authority empowered to represent the State in private-law proceedings (in this instance the Department of Justice). This is not a case of refusal to accept service (§ 20 of the Service Act) but rather a case of refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance. Such refusal is a sovereign right of the foreign State, against which a remedy can be sought only through diplomatic channels ... The Supreme Court endorsed this legal stance (8ObA 201/00t), stressing that, as international law currently stands, compliance or refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance is to be regarded as a sovereign act, irrespective of the subject-matter of the claim. The nature of the act is the defining factor. It is beyond doubt that the service of documents in court proceedings falls within the scope of so-called acta iure imperii and not acta iure gesionis, as a private individual cannot perform an act of this nature. Although negotiations have been in progress for some time on an international agreement concerning service of process on foreign States (which might make it sufficient for the action to be served on the country’s foreign ministry), no such agreement has to date been concluded, with the result that the issue remains unregulated by any treaty between Austria and the United States. In a commentary on this decision, which had been published in JBl 2002, 57, Hintersteininger observed, inter alia, that, while the restrictive theory of service of process applied by the Supreme Court might be appropriate for the purposes of avoiding disagreements between States, it was not a requirement under international law. The author concluded that section 11 of the Service Act – at least as currently applied to judicial proceedings instituted in Austria against foreign States – amounted to a “self-imposed shackle” as a result of which the standard of protection of individuals’ legal interests was subordinated to international-law considerations. Unless and until the Austrian courts saw fit to apply a different interpretation of the provision in question – the fact that the Supreme Court, in its 2001 ruling, continued to apply its case-law from 1963 indicated that this was unlikely – there was an urgent need for the legislature to enact amending legislation in order to provide a practical solution to the problem of service of process. Referring to Hintersteiniger’s international-law argument, the appellant raises the possibility of transmitting the action and an explanation of the legal circumstances, together with a translation into the country’s official language, to the US Department of State through diplomatic channels. In this case the defendant State would have no justification for returning the copy of the action at will; in the event of a refusal to accept service, it should be deemed to have received the request. This would make effective service possible and would remove the need to appoint a representative. The objection to this line of argument is that such a procedure – which from a general international-law perspective is possible – is incompatible with the applicable legal provisions in Austria. As clarified in 8 ObA 201/00t, the action has to be served on a competent body within the Department of Justice, which is the authority representing the United States in the present employment-related proceedings. It is not sufficient for the document to have somehow reached another authority which appears to be responsible for forwarding the request for service. Accordingly, it is incorrect to speak of a refusal to accept service if the document was never transmitted to the competent authority. In this connection the Supreme Court stressed that, conversely, it would not be sufficient, in order to institute legal proceedings, for an action against the Republic of Austria to be received by the Foreign Ministry if, for whatever reason, it was not forwarded to the Attorney-General’s Office as the competent authority representing the State in such matters. The first-instance court already acknowledged that a further request for service would have little prospect of success in view of the earlier comments of the US authorities. Nevertheless, the (definitive) refusal of the US Department of State to forward court documents concerning the appellant to the Department of Justice does not justify the appointment of a representative for the defendant in accordance with Article 116 of the Code of Civil Procedure. As the appellate court explained in detail in its decision 8 Ra 23/00t, cited above, service of process on a foreign State is (also) based on section 11(2) of the Service Act. Hence, for the purpose of performing it, recourse is to be had in any event to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the basis of this provision, which takes precedence, service via any means other than the diplomatic channels to which it refers – for instance, on a court-appointed representative – is ruled out. In view of the principle whereby a remedy against a refusal to comply with a request for legal assistance, which flows from the sovereign power of the foreign State, can be sought only through diplomatic channels (see SZ 36/26, EvBl 1963/210; for a critical perspective, see Schreuer, Die Durchsetzung zivilrechtlicher Ansprüche gegen ausländische Staaten, ÖJZ 1991, 41 et seq. [49]), the impugned decision lacks any legal basis.” 20. On 7 May 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant. It started by referring to its decision of 11 June 2001 (see paragraph 28 below) in a previous case brought by the applicant against the United States. It followed from that decision that the action brought by the applicant had to be served through diplomatic channels. It held that Article 121 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, although it concerned the service of summonses abroad, was not applicable in a case like the present one in which the person or legal entity to be summoned relied on their immunity. The applicant’s interpretation of the provision in question would undermine the concept of immunity. 21. Only section 11(2) of the Service Act was applicable. The applicant did not contest the fact that foreign States came within the scope of that provision as they enjoyed “privileges and immunities” under international law. In that context the Supreme Court went on to state as follows: “No agreement exists between Austria and the defendant concerning service of process from the perspective of State immunity from jurisdiction. In the absence of such agreement the generally recognised rules of international law (Article 9 of the Federal Constitution), together with section IX of the Introductory Act to the Austrian Jurisdictional Statute (EGJN) and the principles developed in this connection by the case-law and by legal commentators, must apply. On that basis it is unanimously agreed that foreign States enjoy immunity in the exercise of their sovereign powers and are to that extent exempt from the jurisdiction of the domestic courts (see, among other authorities, SZ 23/143; Herndl, JBl 1962, 15; JBl 1962, 43; Heß, JBl 1989, 285; ZfRV 1990, 300 [Seidl-Hohenveldern]; Schreuer, ÖJZ 1991, 41; Fischer, NZ 1991, 154; DRdA 1991/53 [Simotta]; Neuhold/Hummer/Schreuer, Österreichisches Handbuch des Völkerrechts Bd 1³ para. 834, 837; Seidl-Hohenveldern, Völkerrecht 9 paras. 1462 et seq.; Matscher, loc. cit, Art IX EGJN para. 2, 115 et seq., 196 et seq.; Mayr in Rechberger, ZPO² Art IX EGJN para. 3 et seq.). The service of process abroad, as a sovereign act, amounts – in the absence of an agreement between the States concerned governing the relevant procedure – to interference with the sovereign rights of the foreign State in question. For that reason it is a requirement in such cases to have recourse to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which maintains close contact with the milieu concerned and is competent to take account of the relevant international-law considerations (RV 162 BlgNR XV.GP 10), as the appellant correctly points out. However, contrary to her assertion, exclusive recourse to the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not merely recommended, but is required by statute (the mandatory “shall” in section 32(3) of the Jurisdictional Statute and section 11(2) of the Service Act). The service of documents by any other means would be in breach of the law (Walter/Mayer, op. cit., section 11 Service Act, footnote 15). Although Hintersteininger, in her commentary on 8 ObA 201/00t (JBl 2002, 57) concludes that the “restrictive theory of service of process” is appropriate for the purpose of avoiding international disagreements, she nevertheless calls on the legislature to amend section 11 of the Service Act, as she sees evidence of a “self-imposed shackling” at least in the way in which that provision is applied. The legislature has not taken any action to date. It should further be observed that the strict approach to diplomatic immunity can be traced back to the Jurisdictional Statute, according to which the violation of immunity renders the proceedings in question null and void, in a manner which cannot be remedied even by the parties (except by a waiver of immunity) (§ 42 JN; Ballon, op. cit., § 42 JN para. 3, 14 et seq.; Mayr, op. cit., § 42 JN para. 2, 7). Contrary to the appellant’s assertion, her request for the action to be served on the defendant by publication or by the appointment of a representative does not fall in the present case within the “classic scenario” under Article 121(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure, but is governed by the exception thereto and undermines the defendant’s claim to diplomatic immunity. Accordingly it is not possible, precisely in this case, to proceed on the basis of that provision. On the contrary – in so far as the proceedings against the defendant in Austria are concerned – exclusive recourse must be had to diplomatic channels, as reasoned by the Supreme Court in case 8 ObA 201/00t.” 22. The Supreme Court’s decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 3 July 2003. 23. In April 2002 the applicant reached pensionable age. She gave the United States embassy in Vienna notice of her intention to terminate her employment contract and applied to the competent Pensions Insurance Office for an old-age pension from 1 May 2002. 24. Subsequently, the applicant extended her claim in the above-mentioned proceedings to salary payments from September 1996 to April 2002. She requested again that the defendant be summoned to a hearing. In that context she referred to the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (see paragraphs 30 to 34 below), and argued that, according to Article 22, transmission of the documents to the United States Department of State through diplomatic channels would be sufficient to effect service. The summons was handed over to a staff member of the United States Department of State but was again returned to the Austrian embassy in Washington with the remark that the United States wished to assert its immunity in any case brought by the applicant. 25. On 17 July 2006 the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision refusing to give a default judgment. Referring to the Supreme Court’s case-law, it held that the refusal to serve a summons was an act of sovereign power. It noted, inter alia, that the Convention relied on by the applicant did not apply to proceedings which had been initiated before its entry into force and added that there were no rules of customary international law to indicate that States could not rely on immunity in the context of the service of a summons. No further appeal on points of law lay against this decision. 26. Section 11 of the Service Act (Zustellgesetz) deals with the service of official documents abroad and the service of official documents on foreign nationals and foreign States or international organisations enjoying privileges and immunities under international law. It provides as follows: “1. Service of process abroad shall be effected in accordance with existing international agreements or as provided for by the laws or other legal provisions of the State in which service is to be effected or by international custom, if necessary with the cooperation of the Austrian diplomatic authorities. 2. Service of process on foreign nationals or international organisations which enjoy international privileges and immunities shall be effected through the intermediary of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, irrespective of where their place of residence or headquarters is located.” 27. The relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure (Zivilprozeßordnung) read as follows: “In the case of persons on whom process can only be served by publication because their address is unknown, the court shall appoint a representative (Article 9), on application or of its own motion, if the persons concerned would have to perform a step in the proceedings as a result of being served with the documents, and in particular if the documents to be served contain a summons.” “1. In the case of service on persons outside the country who do not fall into the categories of recipients referred to in section 11(2) and (3) of the Service Act, the Federal Minister of Justice, in agreement with the Federal Chancellor, may order service to be effected by post, using the system of advice of receipt customarily used for international postal deliveries, to countries in which service in accordance with section 11(1) of the Service Act is not possible or gives rise to difficulties. 2. If no confirmation is received within a reasonable time that process has been served on an individual outside the country, the applicant party may request, depending on the circumstances, that service be effected by publication (section 25 of the Service Act) or by the appointment of a representative under Article 116. This shall also apply in cases where an unsuccessful attempt has been made to serve process abroad or where the request for service has no prospect of success owing to a manifest refusal by the authorities of the foreign State to comply with the request for legal assistance.” 28. In a judgment of 11 June 2001 (8ObA 201/00) in a related case concerning claims for reimbursement of social security contributions brought by the applicant against the United States (see paragraph 11 above), the Supreme Court held as follows: “The appellate court was correct in taking the view that, as international law currently stands, the decision to comply with or refuse a request for legal assistance is a sovereign act, irrespective of the subject-matter of the request. The nature of the act is the defining factor. It is beyond doubt that the service of documents in court proceedings falls within the scope of acta iure imperii and not acta iure gesionis, as a private individual cannot perform an act of this nature (Seidl-Hohenfeldern, Völkerrecht 317 et seq., esp. paras. 1472-79; Neuhold/Hummer/Schreuer, Österreichisches Handbuch des Völkerrechts3, para. 837). The criticism of the current legal situation raised by the appellant, relying on Schreuer (ÖJZ 1991, 41 et seq. [esp. 48 et seq.], does not alter the fact that, although negotiations have been in progress for some time on an international agreement concerning service of process on foreign States (which might make it sufficient for the action to be served on the country’s foreign ministry), no such agreement has to date been concluded, with the result that the issue remains unregulated by any treaty between Austria and the United States. It is not disputed that, under American Federal law, the United States is represented by the Department of Justice in matters which are to be regarded as acta iure gestionis (compare 9 ObA 244/90 = SZ 63/206 with further references concerning the employment contract between the claimant and the defendant). The action must therefore be served – as correctly requested by the appellant herself – on a body within that authority. It is not sufficient – as the appellant has claimed in the appeal proceedings – for the document to have somehow reached another authority which is meant to be responsible for forwarding the request for service (the Department of State (Foreign Ministry)). Conversely, it would not be sufficient, in order to institute legal proceedings, for an action against the Republic of Austria to be received by the Foreign Ministry if, for whatever reason, it was not forwarded to the Attorney-General’s Office, which is the competent authority in such matters.” 29. The 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”) entered into force on 11 June 1976 after its ratification by three States. It has been ratified by eight States (Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kindgom) and signed by one State (Portugal). On 11 June 1976 it entered into force in respect of Austria, which had ratified it on 10 July 1974. The relevant provisions read as follows: “1. A Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of a court of another Contracting State if the proceedings relate to a contract of employment between the State and an individual where the work has to be performed on the territory of the State of the forum. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where: a) the individual is a national of the employing State at the time when the proceedings are brought; b) at the time when the contract was entered into the individual was neither a national of the State of the forum nor habitually resident in that State; or c) the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing, unless, in accordance with the law of the State of the forum, the courts of that State have exclusive jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter. ... ” “1. In proceedings against a Contracting State in a court of another Contracting State, the following rules shall apply. 2. The competent authorities of the State of the forum shall transmit the original or a copy of the document by which the proceedings are instituted; a copy of any judgment given by default against a State which was defendant in the proceedings, through the diplomatic channel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the defendant State, for onward transmission, where appropriate, to the competent authority. These documents shall be accompanied, if necessary, by a translation into the official language, or one of the official languages, of the defendant State. 3. Service of the documents referred to in paragraph 2 is deemed to have been effected by their receipt by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ...” 30. State immunity from jurisdiction is governed by customary international law, the codification of which is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property of 2 December 2004 (“the 2004 Convention”). The principle is based on the distinction between acts of sovereignty or authority (acta jure imperii) and acts of commerce and administration (acta jure gestionis) (see Sabeh El Leil v. France [GC], no. 34869/05, §§ 18-23, 29 June 2011; see also Cudak v. Lithuania [GC], no. 15869/02, §§ 25-33, ECHR 2010). 31. The Convention was opened for signature on 17 January 2005 and has not yet entered into force. Austria signed the Convention on 17 January 2005 and ratified it on 14 September 2006. The United States has not ratified the 2004 Convention, but did not vote against it when it was adopted in the General Assembly of the United Nations. 32. The draft text of the Convention was prepared by the United Nations International Law Commission (ILC) which, in 1979, was given the task of codifying and gradually developing international law in matters of jurisdictional immunities of States and their property. It produced a number of drafts that were submitted to States for comment. The Draft Articles that were used as the basis for the text adopted in 2004 dated back to 1991. They were subsequently further revised by the Sixth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly. States were again given an opportunity to comment. 33. Article 11 (contracts of employment) of the 2004 Convention reads as follows: “1. Unless otherwise agreed between the States concerned, a State cannot invoke immunity from jurisdiction before a court of another State which is otherwise competent in a proceeding which relates to a contract of employment between the State and an individual for work performed or to be performed, in whole or in part, in the territory of that other State. 2. Paragraph 1 does not apply if: (a) the employee has been recruited to perform particular functions in the exercise of governmental authority; (b) the employee is: (i) a diplomatic agent, as defined in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961; (ii) a consular officer, as defined in the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations of 1963; (iii) a member of the diplomatic staff of a permanent mission to an international organization or of a special mission, or is recruited to represent a State at an international conference; or (iv) any other person enjoying diplomatic immunity; (c) the subject-matter of the proceeding is the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of an individual; (d) the subject-matter of the proceeding is the dismissal or termination of employment of an individual and, as determined by the head of State, the head of Government or the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the employer State, such a proceeding would interfere with the security interests of that State; (e) the employee is a national of the employer State at the time when the proceeding is instituted, unless this person has the permanent residence in the State of the forum; or (f) the employer State and the employee have otherwise agreed in writing, subject to any considerations of public policy conferring on the courts of the State of the forum exclusive jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter of the proceeding.” 34. Article 22 (Service of process) of the 2004 Convention reads as follows: “1. Service of process or writ or other document instituting a proceeding against a State shall be effected: (a) in accordance with any applicable international convention binding on the State of the forum and the State concerned; or (b) in accordance with any special arrangement for service between the claimant and the State concerned, if not precluded by the law of the State of forum; or (c) in the absence of such a convention or special arrangement: (i) by transmission through diplomatic channels to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State concerned; or (ii) by any other means accepted by the State concerned, if not precluded by the law of the State of forum. 2. Service of process referred to in paragraph (1) (c) (i) is deemed to have been effected by receipt of the documents by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. These documents shall be accompanied, if necessary, by a translation into the official language, or one of the official languages, of the State concerned. 4. Any State that enters an appearance on the merits in a proceeding instituted against it may not thereafter assert that service of process did not comply with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3.” 35. In the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property, adopted by the International Law Commission at its forty-third session in 1991, and submitted to the General Assembly at that session, Article 11 read as follows: “1. Unless otherwise agreed between the States concerned, a State cannot invoke immunity from jurisdiction before a court of another State which is otherwise competent in a proceeding which relates to a contract of employment between the State and an individual for work performed or to be performed, in whole or in part, in the territory of that other State. 2. Paragraph 1 does not apply if: (a) the employee has been recruited to perform functions closely related to the exercise of governmental authority; (b) the subject of the proceeding is the recruitment, renewal of employment or reinstatement of an individual; (c) the employee was neither a national nor a habitual resident of the State of the forum at the time when the contract of employment was concluded; (d) the employee is a national of the employer State at the time when the proceeding is instituted; or (e) the employer State and the employee have otherwise agreed in writing, subject to any considerations of public policy conferring on the courts of the State of the forum exclusive jurisdiction by reason of the subject-matter of the proceeding.” 36. In the commentary on the International Law Commission’s Draft Articles of 1991, it was stated that the rules formulated in Article 11 appeared to be consistent with the trend in legislative and treaty practice in a growing number of States (ILC Yearbook, 1991, Vol. II, Part 2, p. 44, § 14). 37. In the Draft Articles of 1991, Article 20 (service of process) read as follows: “1. Service of process or writ or other document instituting a proceeding against a State shall be effected: (a) in accordance with any applicable international convention binding on the State of the forum and the State concerned; or (b) in the absence of such a convention: (i) by transmission through diplomatic channels to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the State concerned; or (ii) by any other means accepted by the State concerned, if not precluded by the law of the State of forum. 2. Service of process referred to in paragraph 1 (b) (i) is deemed to have been effected by receipt of the documents by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. These documents shall be accompanied, if necessary, by a translation into the official language, or one of the official languages, of the State concerned. 4. Any State that enters an appearance on the merits in a proceeding instituted against it may not thereafter assert that service of process did not comply with the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 3.” 38. The International Law Commission’s commentary on that Article (ILC Yearbook, 1991, Vol. II, Part 2, p. 60, §§ 1-3), in so far as relevant in the present context, stated as follows: “(1) Article 20 relates to a large extent to the domestic rules of civil procedure of States. It takes into account the difficulties involved if States are called upon to modify their domestic rules on civil procedure. At the same time, it does not provide too liberal or generous a regime of service of process, which could result in an excessive number of judgments in default of appearance by the defendant State. The article therefore proposes a middle ground so as to protect the interests of the defendant State and those of the individual plaintiff. Paragraph 1 (2) Paragraph 1 is designed to indicate the normal ways in which service of process can be effected when a proceeding is instituted against a State. Three categories of means by which service of process is effected are provided: first, if an applicable international convention binding upon the State of the forum and the State concerned exists, service of process shall be effected in accordance with the procedures provided for in the convention. Then, in the absence of such a convention, service of process shall be effected either (a) by transmission through diplomatic channels or (b) by any other means accepted by the State concerned. Thus, among the three categories of the means of service of process provided under paragraph 1, an international convention binding both States is given priority over the other two categories. The variety of means available ensures the widest possible flexibility, while protecting the interests of the parties concerned. Paragraphs 2 and 3 (3) Since the time of service of process is decisive for practical purposes, it is further provided in paragraph 2 that, in the case of transmission through diplomatic channels or by registered mail, service of process is deemed to have been effected on the day of receipt of the documents by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Paragraph 3 further requires that the documents be accompanied, if necessary, by a translation into the official language, or one of the official languages of the State concerned. ...” In respect of Article 20 § 1 the commentary also gives numerous examples of relevant provisions in national legislation. In addition it refers to Article 16 §§ 1-3 of the European Convention on State Immunity. 39. During the drafting process the United States commented on Article 20 of the 1991 Draft Articles (which became Article 22 of the 2004 Convention). It did not object to the rules enshrined in Article 22 (1) (c) (i) and Article 22 (2).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Yaroslavl. 5. Between 1991 and 1998 the applicant worked as a senior accountant in the private company Gatchina. 6. On 2 July 1998 a local police investigator (Заволжский районный отдел внутренних дел г. Ярославля) initiated criminal proceedings on suspicion of misappropriation of the company's assets by some of its employees. 7. On 22 July 1998 an initial interview was held with the applicant in the presence of her counsel. 8. The applicant was formally charged on 24 July 1998. 9. On 22 July 1998 the applicant was remanded in custody pending the investigation. 10. On 24 and 31 July 1998 an investigator again questioned the applicant. 11. The applicant's repeated complaints concerning her detention were rejected by decision of the Frunzenskiy District Court of the city of Yaroslavl (Фрунзенский районный суд г. Ярославля) on 10 November 1998 and 13 January 1999. The decision of 10 November 1998 was upheld on appeal by the Yaroslavl Regional Court (“the Regional Court” – Ярославский областной суд) on 8 December 1998. 12. On 22 June 1999 the applicant was released on the ground that all the investigative measures had been concluded and on health grounds. The investigator imposed a measure of restraint on her in the form of an undertaking not to leave her place of residence. 13. It appears that while in detention the applicant also repeatedly complained that she was unfit for custody on medical grounds. By decisions dated 14 October 1998 and 1 June 1999 the investigator twice ordered a medical examination of the applicant. 14. The examinations took place between 23 October and 11 November 1998 and from 7 June to 1 July 1999 respectively, and found the applicant to be in good health. 15. On 13 January 1999 the investigator opened a new criminal case against the applicant, this time for alleged fraud. The two cases against the applicant were joined. 16. According to the Government, between 1 July 1999 and 29 March 2000 the applicant had access to the case file and availed herself of that opportunity on eight occasions. 17. By decision of 29 March 2000 the proceedings were suspended owing to the applicant's state of health. She underwent in-patient treatment in a hospital. 18. On 17 July 2000 the proceedings resumed. Over the next month the investigator brought similar charges against two other people and ordered a further medical examination of the applicant. 19. From 15 August 2000 the applicant and the other defendants in the case had access to the case file again. It appears that the other defendants and the applicant's counsel completed their study of the case by 20 and 27 November 2000 respectively. 20. As regards the applicant, she again underwent inpatient treatment between 16 August and 1 September 2000 and only started to familiarise herself with the case file on 9 October 2000. 21. On 27 November 2000 the investigator, fearing that the applicant might cause delays in the proceedings, set a deadline of 27 December 2000 for the applicant to familiarise herself with the case file. 22. In January 2001 the deadline was extended until 24 February 2001. 23. On 28 February 2001 the preliminary investigation of the applicant's case was concluded and the bill of indictment was prepared and signed by a local prosecutor. The applicant and two co-defendants were charged with fraud. 24. On 1 March 2001 the case was transferred to the Zavolzhskiy District Court of Yaroslavl (“the District Court” – Заволжский районный суд г. Ярославля) for trial. 25. On 26 April 2001 the applicant submitted to the court a number of documents allegedly confirming her innocence. In response and at the prosecutor's initiative, the court ordered the Centre for Forensic Examinations of the Russian Ministry of Justice to examine the documents with a view to verifying their authenticity. The court also stayed the proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the expert examinations. 26. On 27 June 2001 the Centre responded that it was impossible to carry out the expert examinations requested by the court. 27. On 23 August 2001 the court decided to examine the documents with the assistance of a different expert body, the North-Western Regional Centre for Forensic Examinations (“the Centre”). However, on 21 December 2001 the Centre informed the court that, owing to malfunctioning of technical equipment, no examination could take place. 28. Having consulted counsel for the defence, the court fixed 20 May 2002 as the date of the next hearing. It appears that the hearing of 20 May 2002 did not take place and that the proceedings were adjourned until 14 August 2002 and then until 27 November 2002. 29. On 27 November 2002 the proceedings resumed. 30. By decision of 6 December 2002, taken at the prosecutor's initiative, the court decided again to order an expert examination. However, on 6 May 2003 the Centre again refused and informed the court that no such examination was possible. According to the applicant, the Centre could not carry out that examination because the court had failed to furnish it with the necessary documents in time. 31. On 31 July 2003 the court for the third time requested the Centre to carry out the examination. By letter of 27 November 2003 the Centre acceded to the request but asked for further information. It appears that the necessary information was furnished. 32. The court received a completed expert report on 30 July 2004 and scheduled the next hearing for 30 November 2004. On that date the proceedings did not take place because of the judge's involvement in a different set of proceedings. The case was adjourned until 6 December 2004. The hearings of 6, 7 and 8 December did not take place owing to the failure of counsel for one of the defendants to attend. 33. The proceedings resumed on 9 December 2004 and lasted until 15 December 2004, when they were interrupted by the illness of a lay assessor. 34. The proceedings continued on 12 January 2005 and lasted, with interruptions, until 25 February 2005. On the latter date the court adjourned the hearing first until 14 March 2005 owing to the illness of counsel for one of the defendants and then until 14 April 2005, citing the involvement of counsel for the same defendant in different sets of proceedings. 35. The hearing of 19 April 2005 was adjourned with reference to the need to secure the attendance of some of the witnesses by force. 36. On 22 April 2005 the hearings did not take place as the applicant requested that an additional witness be summoned; on 25, 27 and 28 April 2005 the applicant's counsel and one of the defendants failed to appear. 37. On 3 and 11 May 2005 the prosecutor requested that the proceedings be adjourned, referring to a lack of time to prepare for the judicial pleadings stage. The requests were granted. 38. On 20 May 2005 the proceedings were adjourned at the applicant's request, as apparently her counsel was ill. 39. It appears that by judgment of 28 July 2005 the District Court convicted the applicant as charged. 40. The judgment was quashed on appeal by the Regional Court on 28 October 2005. The case was remitted for a fresh examination at first instance. 41. It appears that the case is currently pending before the trial court.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,3,Violation of Art. 8;Non-pecuniary damage - award,Anatoly Kovler;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger,"5. The applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Astrakhan. 6. On 5 September 2003 the applicant gave birth to a daughter out of wedlock. 7. On 11 November 2003 she lodged a claim with the Kirovskiy District Court of Astrakhan against Mr A., with whom she allegedly had been in a relationship since 2000, in order to establish paternity and obtain child maintenance. In the course of the proceedings the applicant was represented by a counsel. 8. On 15 December 2003 the court ordered a DNA test to be carried out. The blood samples were collected in Astrakhan and sent to a specialised institute in Moscow for a forensic genetic examination. According to the expert conclusion submitted on 19 March 2004, the probability that Mr A. was the father of the applicant’s daughter was 99.99%. 9. On 2 June 2004 the court heard the defendant’s representative, who contested the admissibility of the DNA test on account of procedural shortcomings, and the applicant, who insisted on its accuracy; and rejected the applicant’s claim in full. It found that the applicant had failed to support her allegations. With respect to the expert forensic report the court found as follows: “...Blood sampling for the expert report was entrusted to the Bureau of forensic-medical examinations in the Astrakhan Region... According to the Instruction on organisation and production of expert examinations in Bureaus of forensic medical examinations, blood samples must be packed individually... An envelope must be supplied, with identifying information (on the basis of an identity document) and signatures of a medical worker who took the blood samples and two medical workers who were present during this procedure... On the envelopes with the blood samples of Mr A., Ms Kalacheva and Ms K.D. [the applicant’s daughter] there are no data based on the identity documents of the above persons. Moreover, there are only two signatures on the envelopes, one of which belongs to a person who took the blood samples... Taking into account that the blood samples were collected with serious violations of the Instruction..., the court is critical of the expert conclusion, since it cannot exclude the possibility that the blood samples received by the experts were not those collected from the parties.” 10. The court found the other evidence submitted by the applicant, namely a photo showing her with the defendant and a badge in her name, issued by the hostel (where they allegedly met), insufficient to conclude that the defendant was her child’s father. 11. The applicant and her lawyer lodged an appeal against this judgment, claiming that the case should be sent to a fresh examination due to the court’s failure to respect the civil procedural law. On 29 June 2004 the Astrakhan Regional Court upheld the judgment of 2 June 2004. It mentioned that, under civil procedural law, an expert conclusion was not binding on the court, and that in the present case the DNA test, carried out in breach of the relevant procedure, was not corroborated by other evidence. 12. On 20 June 2005 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected an application for supervisory review lodged by the applicant’s lawyer. 13. Under Article 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation (“CCP”, in force as of 1 February 2003), rights and interests of minors are protected in court proceedings by their legal representatives – parents, adoptive parents or tutors. Under Article 49 of the Family Code of the Russian Federation of 29 December 1995 (Семейный кодекс РФ, in force as of 1 March 1996), if a child is born to parents who are not married to each other and there is no joint declaration or declaration by the child’s father, the paternity of the child shall be established in court proceedings on the application of either parent, or tutor, or a child in question upon reaching a full age. In such proceedings the court shall have regard to any evidence that establishes the child’s paternity with certainty. 14. Article 67 of the CCP provides that a court shall evaluate evidence in confidence, based upon a comprehensive, detailed and impartial review of all the evidence of the case. No evidence has a predetermined value. 15. An expert conclusion is not binding upon the court, and shall be evaluated by the court according to the rules stated in Article 67 of this Code. If the court disagrees with the expert conclusion, it shall explain its reasons in its decision (Article 86 § 3 of CCP). In case of doubt as to the accuracy or reasonableness of the expert conclusion, a court may order a second expert opinion to be prepared by other experts (Article 87 § 2 of CCP). 16. Resolution no. 9 of the Plenary Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 25 October 1996 on application by the courts of the Family Code of the Russian Federation to cases concerning paternity and maintenance provides that in order to establish paternity the court may, if necessary, order a forensic examination. Under Article 86 § 3 of the CCP, the experts’ conclusion regarding a child’s descent, including a DNA test, is evidence that must be weighed together with other evidence (Article 6).",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security;Violation of Article 13+2 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 2 - Right to life),Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;Elisabeth Steiner;Khanlar Hajiyev;Sverre Erik Jebens,"6. The applicants are Mr Aslan (also known as Lukman) Dzhabrailov, who was born in 1979, Ms Umkusu Dzhabrailova, who was born in 1949 and Ms Larisa Dzhabrailova, who was born in 1977. They live in Grozny, Chechnya. The first applicant is the brother of Valid (also spelled as Volid and also known as Lecha) Dzhabrailov, who was born in 1973; the second applicant is his mother and the third applicant is his sister. 7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8. At the material time the applicants and Valid Dzhabrailov lived at 104 Sovetskaya Street in the settlement of Pervomayskiy, in the Grozny district, Chechnya. At about 7 a.m. on 16 February 2003 (in the submitted documents the date was also referred to as 15 February 2003) the applicants and Valid Dzhabrailov were at home, when a group of armed masked men in camouflage uniforms arrived at their gate. The men arrived in a white GAZ car (“Газель”), a blue VAZ-2121 car (“Нива”), a khaki-coloured military UAZ car (“таблетка”) and a UAZ car. The men broke into the house and dispersed into different rooms. The intruders, who spoke unaccented Russian, neither identified themselves nor produced any documents. The applicants thought that they were Russian servicemen. 9. The intruders woke up the second and third applicants, lined them up against a wall and threatened to shoot them if they moved. After that the servicemen went into the room where the first applicant and Valid Dzhabrailov were sleeping. They woke them up, forced the brothers to the floor, handcuffed them and blindfolded Valid Dzhabrailov with the hood of his sweater. Then they took Valid and Aslan Dzhabrailov's passports, beat them, dragged them outside and forced them to the ground. When the second applicant asked the intruders where they were taking her sons, the servicemen told her that they were taking them to a local department of the interior (“в отдел”) for an identity check. After that they forced Valid and Aslan Dzhabrailov, who were already bleeding, into the military UAZ car and drove away to an unknown destination. While travelling in the car, the servicemen beat and kicked the brothers. 10. Upon arrival at the point of destination, the servicemen took Valid Dzhabrailov and the first applicant out of the car, put plastic bags over their heads and bound the bags with adhesive tape. The brothers did not know where they had been taken, but they could hear the sound of military vehicles and helicopters. The first applicant thought that they had arrived at the main base of the Russian military forces in Khankala, Chechnya. 11. After that Valid and Aslan Dzhabrailov were forced to crawl on their hands and knees into a basement where they were thrown on to a cement floor. The brothers were cold and bleeding. Some time later the abductors came into the cell. Valid Dzhabrailov asked them why they had been abducted. In response one of the servicemen gave him several blows to the head and in the stomach with his rifle butt. Valid Dzhabrailov fell unconscious and was dragged outside. After that the brothers were separated and placed into different cells. 12. The first applicant was taken into a small cell in a basement, measuring approximately 2 x 3 metres. The cell had an electric light, a bunk bed and no windows. From the cell he could hear his brother Valid Dzhabrailov being interrogated and screaming as a result of being beaten. 13. After a while two masked men in camouflage uniforms came into the applicant's cell. They asked him a number of questions, such as: whether he had ever laid any landmines and whether he had known any members of illegal armed groups in his village. They beat him with their fists, pistols and a heavy flashlight and kicked him with their heavy boots. The applicant was subjected to such interrogations and beatings several times. The men pressurised the applicant to confess to involvement in illegal armed groups. For two days of his detention in the basement the first applicant was not given any food or drink. 14. It appears that Valid Dzhabrailov was detained in the same building as the first applicant. Between 16 and 18 February 2003 he was subjected to interrogations and beatings. 15. On 18 February 2003 two officers took the first applicant out of the basement, put a plastic bag over his head, bound it and his hands with adhesive tape and pushed him into a military UAZ car. In the vehicle the first applicant felt someone's heavy, cold body on the floor. He realised that this was the body of his brother, Valid Dzhabrailov. 16. The two servicemen took the first applicant and the body of Valid Dzhabrailov to an abandoned building of a former chemical plant in the Zavodskoy district of Grozny. One of them shot the first applicant in the head; the applicant was not killed, but wounded, and he was able to pretend to be dead. 17. The servicemen carried the first applicant and Valid Dzhabrailov's body into a pit and placed them under a piece of a construction block. Then they laid explosives on the first applicant and placed Valid Dzhabrailov's body on top of them. After that they lit the fuse. Having done that, they got back in the car and drove away. 18. The first applicant managed to set himself free and extinguish the burning fuse. He threw the explosives away before they exploded. He ran out into the street and stopped the driver of a passing car who drove him home. 19. Upon returning home the first applicant did not immediately seek medical help; that came at a later stage. The first applicant obtained the following medical statements and submitted them to the Court: 1) Medical statement issued by a neuropathologist at the 3rd Grozny town hospital, dated 8 December 2003. The document stated that, as a result of a splinter wound to the head, Aslan Dzhabrailov was suffering from cephalgia (pain in the skull), asthenia and neurosis. 2) Medical statement issued by a neuropathologist at the 3rd Grozny town hospital, dated 31 August 2004. The document stated that, as a result of a tangential wound to the head received in 2003, Aslan Dzhabrailov was suffering from asthenia and neurosis. 3) Medical statement issued by a surgeon at the 3rd Grozny town hospital, dated 31 August 2004. The document stated that the applicant had undergone a medical examination of the tangential wound inflicted to his head in 2003. 20. On 18 February 2003 (in the submitted documents the date was also referred to as 17 February 2003) the applicants, their relatives and neighbours went to the Zavodskoy district of Grozny. They found Valid Dzhabrailov's body where it had been left by the first applicant and took it home. According to the witnesses, Ms L.M. and Ms A.M., the body showed traces of torture: it was black from the beatings; the wrists and ankles had been cut to the bone from the wearing of handcuffs and shackles; the palms and feet had been crushed and the head was hardly recognisable. They found a piece of metal wire on the neck but there was no trace of firearm wounds on the body. 21. Valid Dzhabrailov was buried soon afterwards before anyone had contacted medical institutions or law enforcement authorities. Two certificates were issued in connection with his death: the medical statement confirming Valid Dzhabrailov's death, dated 17 April 2003 and Valid Dzhabrailov's death certificate, stating that his death had occurred on 17 February 2003. 22. In support of their statements, the applicants submitted: an account by Ms L.M., dated 29 September 2003; an account by Ms A.M., dated 29 September 2003; an account by the first applicant, dated 29 October 2003; an account by the second applicant, dated 29 October 2003; an account by the third applicant, undated, and the three medical certificates, one dated 8 December 2003 and two dated 31 August 2004. 23. The Government did not challenge the facts as presented by the applicants. However, they pointed out that the investigation file contained neither a mention of the first applicant's beating in the car following the abduction nor his assertion that he had heard Valid Dzhabrailov screaming from being beaten while in detention. 24. Since 16 February 2003 the applicants have repeatedly applied in person and in writing to various public bodies, including the district department of the Ministry of the Interior (the ROVD) and prosecutors at various levels. They have been supported in their efforts by the NGO, SRJI. In their letters to the authorities the applicants referred to the events of 1618 February 2003 and asked for assistance and details of the investigation. Mostly, these enquiries have remained unanswered, or purely formal replies have been given in which the applicants' requests have been forwarded to various prosecutors' offices. The applicants submitted to the Court some of the letters sent to the authorities and their replies. These documents, as well as the documents submitted by the Government, are summarised below. 25. On 16 February 2003 the Grozny district prosecutor's office inspected the crime scene at the applicants' house. Nothing was collected from the scene. 26. On 17 February 2003 an officer of the Zavodskoy ROVD informed his superiors that at about 6 p.m. on that date the ROVD had received information about the discovery of Valid Dzhabrailov' body in an abandoned building on the premises of a chemical plant and of the first applicant with a gunshot wound in his head. The latter stated that he and his brother, Valid, had been abducted from their house at about 6 a.m. on 15 February 2003 by unidentified armed men in camouflage uniforms; that they had been detained in an unidentified place and then taken by the abductors to the chemical factory in a UAZ vehicle. 27. On 18 February 2003, under Article 126 § 2 of the Criminal Code (aggravated kidnapping), the Grozny district prosecutor's office instituted an investigation into the abduction of Valid and Aslan Dzhabrailov. The case file was given the number 42024 (in the submitted documents the number was also referred to as 42042 and 41026). 28. On 18 February 2003 the investigators examined the crime scene at the place where Valid Dzhabrailov's body had been discovered. The investigators inspected the body on the spot and drafted a report to this effect. As a result, it was established that Valid Dzhabrailov's skull, face, ribs and upper and lower limbs seemed intact; no metal wire was found on his neck. Nothing was collected from the scene. 29. On 18 February 2003 the Grozny town prosecutor's office instituted an investigation into the murder of Valid Dzhabrailov and the case file was given the number 30034. 30. On 19 February 2003 the first and third applicants were granted victim status in the criminal case concerning the abduction and were questioned. 31. During questioning on 19 February 2003 the third applicant stated that at about 7 a.m. on 16 February 2003 a group of military servicemen had arrived at their house in several vehicles and had broken in. They had been armed with automatic guns; their faces had been covered with masks. The intruders had woken up the first applicant and Valid Dzhabrailov, taken their passports and told the third applicant in Russian that they would check her brothers' identities and release them. After that the servicemen had pushed the brothers into a grey UAZ car and taken them away. On 18 February 2003 a woman had arrived at the applicants' house and told them that the first applicant and Valid Dzhabrailov had been in the Zavodskoy ROVD. The applicants had immediately informed the district police officer about it who had gone to Grozny and returned with the body of Valid Dzhabrailov and the first applicant. The body had had numerous injuries and the first applicant had received a gunshot wound to the head. The witness further stated that she had learnt from the first applicant that the brothers had been handcuffed and taken to a basement made of concrete box units. At some point later they had been separated and the first applicant had not seen Valid Dzhabrailov for about twenty-four hours. In the morning of 18 February 2003 a Russian-speaking man in a camouflage uniform had removed the handcuffs from the first applicant, bound his hands, put a sack over his head and bound it with adhesive tape. He had pushed the applicant into a UAZ vehicle beside a cold corpse; the first applicant had thought that it must have been the body of his brother, Valid. The car had been driven for about fifty minutes; then it had stopped and the first applicant had been taken out. He had been dragged about 10-15 metres away from the road; then he had been forced to the ground and shot in the head; he had pretended to be dead. After that they had put Valid Dzhabrailov's body on top of the applicant; then they had placed three pieces of trotyl between the brothers' bodies and lit them. One of the abductors had suggested to the other in Russian: “Lets wait until it explodes” but the other one had said that they'd better leave quickly. After that they had got back into the car and driven away. The first applicant had managed to extinguish the explosive device and made it to the road, where he had stopped a car which had taken him to the Zavodskoy ROVD. On 20 February 2004 the investigators again questioned the third applicant who provided a statement similar to the one given on 19 February 2003. She added that the abductors had told her that they had been taking Aslan and Valid Dzhabrailov to the Staropromyslovskiy ROVD for an identity check; that the abductors had been a group of about thirty men, five of whom had broken into their house. 32. During questioning on 19 February 2003 the first applicant stated that at about 7 a.m. on 16 February 2003 he and his brother, Valid, had been abducted from their home by a group of five armed military servicemen who had arrived in three grey UAZ vehicles, a white four-door “Niva” car and a white “Gazel” minivan. The abductors had blindfolded the brothers and pushed them into a UAZ vehicle. After that the abductors had driven for about fifty minutes and taken the brothers to a windowless basement, which measured approximately 5 x 7 metres and was divided into smaller cells. The first applicant had been taken to a cell with a wooden door where he had been kept for about thirty-six hours. In the evening of 17 February 2003 he had been taken outside by two armed servicemen in uniform, who had put a sack over his head and bound it with adhesive tape. Then they had pushed the applicant into a UAZ car, inside which was a cold corpse. The abductors had driven for about forty to fifty minutes. Then they had stopped, dragged the applicant out of the car and forced him to his knees against a wall. The corpse had been placed next to the applicant. After that the abductors had shot the applicant in the head; he had felt the pain but managed to pretend to be dead. Then the servicemen had placed an object between the applicant and the corpse and set it on fire, discussing whether it would be better to wait for the explosion or not. Next, the abductors had got back into the car and driven away. The applicant had pulled the sack off his head and seen that a pack of trotyl had been placed between him and the corpse of his brother, Valid. He had managed to extinguish the explosive device and throw it away. He had looked around and noticed that he had been taken to an abandoned building on the premises of a former chemical plant in Grozny. He had walked to the road, stopped a car and been driven to the Zavodskoy ROVD where he had informed the authorities about the events. 33. At a later date, on 3 March 2004 the investigators again questioned the first applicant whose second statement about the events of 1618 February 2003 was similar to the one given on 19 February 2003. In addition, he provided a more detailed description of the place of his detention and stated that the abductors had interrogated him and demanded that he confess to laying landmines; that they had beaten him with flashlights and rifle butts; that they had all been wearing uniforms and masks and had been armed with firearms and that one of them had been armed with a military “Makarov” pistol; that one of the abductors had addressed one of the men present during the interrogations in the basement as “Colonel” and that the latter had been wearing a specific reddish camouflage uniform with a peculiar blotted pattern and had been armed with a special sub-machine gun with a silencer; that the two men who had conducted the last interrogation of the applicant had not been wearing masks; that one of them was a large-built, fair-haired man with glasses, of about forty to forty-five years of age, whereas the other one had an Asian appearance, was about the same age and had a similar build to the first one; that these two men had taken the applicant to the premises of the former chemical plant where they had shot him in the head with a sub-machine gun, but the bullet had just grazed his head and he had managed to pretend to be dead; that the men had tried to blow up him and his brother's body; that after the abductors had left he had managed to stop an MAZ vehicle in which there had been two men who had driven him to a security lodge located in a yard with many garages; that three armed men in camouflage uniforms who had been present there had called the Zavodskoy ROVD via a portable radio and that about half an hour later a UAZ car had arrived and taken the applicant to the Zavodskoy ROVD. 34. On 19 February 2003 the investigators questioned the applicants' relative, Mr N.R., whose statement concerning the events of 16-18 February 2003 was similar to the ones given by the first and third applicants. 35. On 14 March 2003 the Grozny district prosecutor's office wrote to the Grozny district department of the Federal Security Service (the FSB) requesting information about the involvement of the first applicant in illegal armed groups. On 15 March 2003 the FSB replied that they had no such information. 36. On 14 March 2003 the Grozny town prosecutor's office joined the investigation in the criminal cases concerning the abduction and the killing. The joint criminal case was given the number 30034. 37. On 18 April 2003 the investigators informed the applicants that the investigation in the criminal case had been suspended for failure to identify the perpetrators. 38. On 3 February 2004 the Chechnya prosecutor's office informed the second applicant that her complaint about the killing of Valid Dzhabrailov had been examined and that on 3 February 2004 the investigation had been resumed. 39. On 2-3 March 2004 the Chechnya Bureau of Forensic Expert Evaluations conducted an expert evaluation of Valid Dzhabrailov's body based on the crime scene examination report of 17 February 2003. According to the expert's conclusions: “... The following injuries were found on Valid Dzhabrailov's body: - numerous extensive bruises of the body and the extremities; - circular abrasions on the wrist and ankle joints; 2. The injuries could have been caused by a number of impacts by a dull firm object (objects) two or three days prior to the death; 3. The corpse of V. Dzhabrailov was not examined; therefore, it is not possible to make further conclusions...” 40. On 6 March 2004 the Zavodskoy district prosecutor's office suspended the investigation in the criminal case for failure to identify the perpetrators and informed the applicants about it on 15 or 29 March 2004. 41. On 10 October 2004 the first applicant complained to the Zavodskoy district prosecutor's office that the investigation into Valid Dzhabrailov's murder had been ineffective, that there had been a lack of information about the progress of the investigation and that its suspension had been unjustified. 42. On 11 May 2005 the applicants' representatives wrote to the Grozny district prosecutor's office and the Grozny town prosecutor's office. They described in detail the circumstances of Valid and Aslan Dzhabrailov's abduction and their subsequent detention. In particular, they described the beatings and the ill-treatment to which the brothers had been subjected by the abductors and the abductors' attempt to kill the first applicant. They further complained that the investigations into the abduction and the murder had been ineffective and that there had been a lack of information about the progress of the proceedings, and asked to be provided with copies of a number of procedural decisions. 43. On 14 June 2005 the Zavodskoy district prosecutor's office informed the applicants that on an unspecified date the investigation into the abduction had been joined with the investigation into the murder and the joint criminal case had been given the number 30034. 44. On 21 July 2005 the applicants' representatives wrote to the Zavodskoy district prosecutor's office complaining that the investigation in the joint criminal case had been ineffective and that there had been a lack of information about the steps taken by the investigators. In particular, they pointed out that they had received no information as to whether an expert evaluation of the evidence discovered at the crime scene or a forensic examination of Valid Dzhabrailov's body had been carried out. They further asked that the first applicant be provided with access to the investigation file. 45. On 27 October 2005 and 25 June 2008 the decisions to suspend the investigation were overruled by the supervisory prosecutors for failure to take necessary investigative steps and the proceedings were resumed. 46. The applicants submitted that the authorities had failed to provide them with information concerning the investigation into the abduction and the subsequent killing of their close relative. 47. The Government submitted that the investigation in criminal case no. 30034 was still in progress. The perpetrators of the abduction and the killing had not been identified, but the domestic authorities were taking steps to have the crime resolved. The applicants had been duly informed of all decisions taken during the investigation. 48. Despite specific requests by the Court, the Government did not disclose most of the contents of criminal case no. 30034. They submitted copies of several documents and stated that the investigation was in progress and that disclosure of the documents would be in violation of Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because the file contained personal data concerning the witnesses or other participants in the criminal proceedings. 49. On 23 September 2005 (in the submitted documents the date was also referred to as 23 September 2003 and 11 October 2005) the first applicant complained to the Zavodskoy district court of Grozny. He described in detail the events of 16-18 February 2003, including the beatings to which he had been subjected by the abductors, and complained that the investigation in criminal case no. 30034 had been ineffective and that its suspension had been unjustified. The applicant sought a ruling obliging the authorities to resume the investigation and provide him with access to the investigation file. 50. On 28 October 2005 the Zavodskoy district court rejected the complaint stating that the investigation in the criminal case had been resumed on 27 October 2005. 51.

Pekkanen,"7. The applicant, who was born in Beirut (Lebanon) in 1958, is at present detained in Rennes Prison (Ille-et-Vilaine). In December 1990 he travelled to Lebanon, where he married a young Lebanese woman, who became his second wife. 8. On 21 June 1991 the body of a young woman was retrieved from the harbour mouth at Les Sables d’Olonne (Vendée). She had been gagged, her teeth had been broken and she had head wounds. The body bore the marks of strangulation, had burns on the chest and thighs and had been weighted down with a weight of about twenty kilograms. A post-mortem carried out the same day by Drs Nadau and Rocard revealed, inter alia, that the cause of death had been asphyxia and that the victim had received a blow to the head before she died. 9. On 25 June 1991 a murder inquiry was opened and the investigating judge ordered an expert report on the body. The report, by a Professor Rudler, was filed on 29 October 1991. 10. Having been unable to identify the body, the investigators circulated this information through Interpol. On 5 November 1991 the Interpol office in Beirut informed them that the applicant’s wife’s parents, who were worried because they had had no recent news of their daughter, had reported her disappearance to the Lebanese authorities. It was subsequently discovered that, by letters of 21 August 1991, the applicant had reported his wife’s disappearance to the municipal services of Nuaille (Maine-et-Loire) and the Vezins gendarmerie. When he was interviewed on 14 September 1991 by gendarmes belonging to that brigade he had stated that his wife had left him on 18 June 1991 to join her brother in Switzerland, taking with her some money and objects of value that she had stolen from him. On 4 October 1991 he had also filed a missing person report with the prefectoral authorities. 11. Tests carried out on the body identified the victim as the applicant’s wife. 12. The applicant was taken into police custody on 4 December 1991. When interviewed by the police conducting the inquiry he first asserted that on 18 June 1991 he had dropped his wife off at Angers station, where she had caught a train to Paris before travelling to Switzerland. He subsequently made, in substance, the following statement: on 19 June 1991, after a domestic quarrel, the applicant’s wife had attempted to take her own life by swallowing medicines and then dousing herself with household bleach, after which she had hanged herself with a clothes line; fearing the reactions of his wife’s family, Mr I.A. had cut down her body, pushed her tongue back into her mouth with a piece of cloth, wrapped the body in a sheet and blanket, tied and weighted it and then placed it in the boot of his car before driving to Les Sables d’Olonne, where, next day, after waiting for nightfall, he had thrown it into the sea. As the investigation proceeded, it revealed the inconsistencies of this version of events. For example, the applicant’s wife had not doused herself with bleach nor had she swallowed medicines; she had not been hanged but strangled; and it was before she died that the piece of cloth had been placed in her mouth and the burns found on her body and the injuries to her teeth had been caused. 13. On 6 December 1991 the Sables d’Olonne investigating judge charged Mr I.A. with murder and made a provisional order for his imprisonment, committing him to prison for three days. On 9 December 1991 the judge made an order for his detention on remand worded as follows: “… Whereas the constraints of judicial supervision are inadequate with regard to the functions set out in Article 137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure; Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused, and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that, as the case concerns a serious crime, and in the light of what the investigations conducted hitherto have revealed, public order has been disturbed, in particular by the circumstances of the discovery of the body; in that the accused belongs to a Lebanese community, so that he must be protected from the risk of revenge attacks by the victim’s family; and in that there is a need to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, as he may abscond to the Middle East at any time.” 14. On 10 December 1991 the investigating judge appointed a Professor Pannier and a Dr Bureau to produce an expert report on the lesions found on the victim’s body (their report was filed on 3 June 1992). On the same day, and again on 16 December 1991, the judge interviewed one of the applicant’s cousins, who had come to see him of his own accord. 15. On 19 December 1991 the investigating judge appointed a Professor Doutremepuich to produce an expert report on vaginal and anal swabs taken from the victim. 16. On 20 December 1991 the investigating judge held a reconstruction of the crime, which was attended, among others, by the doctor who had performed the post-mortem, who was appointed expert with the special task of verifying the compatibility of the versions of events given by the accused with the results of the post-mortem (his report was filed on 10 January 1992). On the same day the investigating judge questioned Mr I.A. 17. From 20 December 1991 to 12 February 1992, acting on instructions received on 18 December 1991, the Angers Regional Criminal Investigation Department (SRPJ) monitored the telephone line of a Mr V. and a Miss B., two of the applicant’s acquaintances. 18. On 7 January 1992 the investigating judge appointed Professor Doutremepuich to examine the rag that had been used to gag the applicant’s wife. On 8 January he appointed two psychologists, a Mrs Griffon and a Mr Troadec, to produce medico-psychological reports on the applicant and a Dr Pennec to produce a psychiatric report (the reports of the first two experts mentioned were filed on 2 April 1992, that of the third expert on 8 April 1992). 19. On 16 January 1992, acting on instructions received on 6 December 1991, a detective from the Angers SRPJ interviewed the applicant’s first wife. 20. The investigating judge took evidence from Mr I.A.’s cousin as a civil party on 29 January 1992. On 12 February he took evidence from the victim’s brother and sister-in-law – they had previously been interviewed on 5 February by the Angers SRPJ, acting on instructions of 20 December 1991; on 14 February and 6 March 1992 he confronted them with the applicant. 21. On 18 March 1992, acting on instructions of 6 March, the Angers SRPJ took a sample of hair from the body. 22. On 18 and 20 March 1992, acting on instructions of 20 December 1991, the Angers SRPJ took statements from Mr V. and Miss B., and from a woman with whom Mr I.A. had been carrying on a sexual relationship before his arrest. The latter declared in particular that the applicant had informed her of his intention of leaving France for Australia as soon as his house was sold. 23. On 31 March 1992 the investigating judge visited the scene of the crime. On 15 April 1992 he again interviewed the applicant’s cousin. On 30 April 1992 he took a statement from the applicant’s ex-wife. 24. On 21 May 1992 the investigating judge confronted the applicant’s cousin with Mr V. and Miss B., then interviewed Mr I.A., asking him in particular whether he wanted any special expert examinations of the victim’s body to be made. On the basis of instructions given the same day, Mr V. and Miss B. were again interviewed by the Angers SRPJ. On 26 May the investigating judge held a confrontation with the victim’s brother and sister-in-law. 25. On 29 May 1992 the judge refused an application for release lodged by Mr I.A. in an order worded as follows: “… Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused, and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that the offence gravely disturbed public order, being a serious crime; in that further inquiries are necessary; and in that it is necessary to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities on account of the fact that, being a Lebanese national, he is likely to flee the jurisdiction, a step which it seems he considered taking shortly before his arrest.” On appeal by the applicant, the Indictment Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld the above order in a judgment of 16 June 1992, on the following grounds: “Having regard to the penalty to which the accused would be liable if found guilty and the fact that he has family ties in Lebanon, it is to be feared that he might seek to evade justice by absconding to that country. It is obviously necessary to continue his detention to prevent him from doing so.” 26. On 10 June 1992 the investigating judge held a confrontation between the applicant and the three people he had interviewed on 21 May. 27. On the basis of instructions given on 17 June 1992, a witness was interviewed by the Angers SRPJ. 28. On 10 July 1992 the investigating judge confronted Mr I.A.’s cousin with his ex-wife. 29. On 14 September 1992 the investigating judge refused an application for release lodged by Mr I.A. on 9 September in an order worded as follows: “Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is the only way to preserve the evidence, and to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or the victim, in that the accused has shown particular duplicity in the organisation of his lies; in that he has colluded with third parties (ex-wife and friend); and in that new evidence has turned up during the investigation (discovery of allegedly stolen jewellery); Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused, and to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that public order has been disturbed in the extreme on account of the international, family implications to which the accused himself refers in his application; and in that the accused himself admits to living in fear ‘of our frequently barbaric and unjust customs’, his continued detention is the only way to ensure his protection and to avoid all risk of his absconding in the event of his release.” 30. On 16 October 1992 the accused was served with a copy of the expert report of Professor Pannier and Dr Bureau and was informed that he had fifteen days to submit observations or request an additional expert report or second opinion; he was then interviewed by the investigating judge. He was again questioned by the investigating judge on 28 October 1992. 31. By an order of 29 October 1992 the investigating judge appointed an expert to carry out “an inquiry into the accused’s personality, his financial circumstances, and his family and social background, and to provide any kind of information about his pattern of behaviour”. The report was filed on 14 January 1993. 32. By an order of 17 November 1992, which reproduced the wording of the order of 14 September 1992, the investigating judge refused an application for release lodged by the applicant. 33. On 25 November 1992 the investigating judge interviewed the applicant’s cousin. 34. On 4 December 1992 the judge extended for one year the applicant’s detention on remand, by means of the following order: “Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is the only way to prevent collusion between him and his accomplices, in that the circumstances of the victim’s death and the barbaric acts which she suffered remain obscure; in that it is necessary to try to ascertain the accused’s motives, in case this was not just a simple private problem but formed part of a much more general context with Lebanese links; and in that it is therefore possible that the accused did not act alone; Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused, and to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that the case file shows that there is a very serious risk of reprisals; in that the very special circumstances of the victim’s death (barbarity) have been partly responsible for a lasting disturbance of public opinion; and in that it is necessary, in view of the penalty to which the accused is liable, and his foreign origin, to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.” 35. On 8 December 1992 the investigating judge visited the scene of the crime. 36. On 13 January 1993 the investigating judge refused another application for release from the applicant, by an order drafted in the same terms as the order of 4 December 1992 (the only major difference being that it omitted to mention that detention was necessary for the protection of the accused). He also refused, on 5 March 1993, an application submitted on 2 March, on the ground that detention was the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities. 37. On 16 March 1993 the investigating judge asked a Dr Lavault to produce an additional expert report to verify whether the burns found on the victim’s body had been caused before death. On 24 March 1993 he served Mr I.A. with the conclusions of the expert report on the rag that had been used to gag the victim, informed him that he had fifteen days to submit observations or request an additional expert report or second opinion and then interviewed him. 38. By an order of 2 April 1993 the investigating judge refused a new application for release lodged by the applicant on the ground that detention was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities. More specifically, the order stated: “Whereas the offence seriously disturbed public order, since it involved the death of a young woman in particularly barbaric circumstances; and whereas this disturbance, which extends beyond French territory, both the victim and the offender being of Lebanese origin, has not ceased to this day; Whereas it is necessary to keep at the disposal of the judicial authorities a person whose life would be endangered by his release, given the indignation and distress that such a measure could not fail to provoke among the victim’s relatives, as they would not be able to understand or accept it, although they have hitherto placed their trust in French justice; And whereas, lastly, the investigation will in all probability be concluded when the inquiries currently in progress have been completed, and the transmission of the file to the public prosecutor’s office can be expected to take place by the end of June.” On appeal by Mr I.A., the Indictment Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld this order in a judgment of 21 April, on the following grounds: “Having regard to the penalty to which the accused would be liable if found guilty and the fact that he has family ties in Lebanon, it is to be feared that he might seek to evade justice by absconding to that country. It is obviously necessary to continue his detention to prevent him from doing so. It is also necessary for the purposes of the inquiries currently in progress, in particular to avoid all risk of collusion with witnesses and to prevent pressure being brought to bear on them, as [I.A.]’s conduct gives reason to fear.” 39. On 26 April 1993 the investigating judge appointed Mrs Griffon to conduct a medico-psychological and psychiatric examination of the applicant (her report was filed on 8 July 1993). 40. In the night of 4 to 5 May 1993 a burglary was carried out at the applicant’s home, at which official police seals had been placed. On 6 May the vehicle used to move the body, which had been stolen during the burglary, was found in the River Maine at Angers. 41. On 10 May 1993 the investigating judge refused an application for release submitted by the applicant on 5 May, by an order worded as follows: “Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that there is strong evidence that [I.A.] is guilty of murder; and in that it is necessary to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities and to forestall any risk of pressure being brought to bear on witnesses.” 42. On 28 May 1993 the investigating judge arranged a confrontation between the applicant, his cousin and one of the experts previously appointed (Dr Nadau); they discussed the question whether the lesions found on the victim’s body had been caused before death. 43. On 4 June 1993 the investigating judge refused an application for release lodged by Mr I.A. on 1 June, on the ground that his detention was the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence and to ensure that the accused would remain at the disposal of the judicial authorities. He did so again on 18 and 25 June 1993 by means of two orders worded as follows: “Whereas there is strong evidence that [I.A.] is guilty of murder; Whereas from the time of his wife’s death until his arrest he showed particular duplicity, attempting to set his family against the young woman’s family by making particularly serious false allegations; Whereas it is to be feared that [I.A.] will abscond to a country where he has family ties; Whereas it is necessary to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities; Whereas his detention on remand is also necessary in order to discover the truth, since [he] has continually employed stratagems designed to enable him to evade his responsibilities.” On 9 July 1993 the investigating judge refused another application for release, dated 5 July, on the ground that the applicant’s detention was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities. On 23 July he refused a further application from the applicant, by means of an order with exactly the same wording as those of 18 and 25 June. On 13 and 23 August, 3 and 14 September, 15 and 29 October and 5 November 1993 he refused applications lodged respectively on 9, 24 and 31 August, 9 September, 11 and 25 October and 2 November. These orders generally stated that Mr I.A.’s detention was the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses and was necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused and to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities. They also pointed out that there was “strong evidence” that Mr I.A. was “guilty of murder”, that “from the time of his wife’s death until his arrest” he had shown “particular duplicity”, that it was “to be feared that he [would] abscond to a country where he [had] family ties” and that it was therefore necessary “to ensure that he remained at the disposal of the judicial authorities so as not to create any risk of the inquiries needed to reveal the truth being impeded”. In a judgment of 23 November 1993 the Indictment Division of the Poitiers Court of Appeal upheld the order of 5 November, on the grounds that “regard being had to the penalty for the offence concerned, there [was] a strong risk that [I.A.] would abscond to his country of origin before he could be brought to trial” and that “his continued detention [was] the only way to guard against that risk”. 44. On 9 November 1993 a Mr A., one of the three people who had carried out the burglary of 4 May, was interviewed by the Angers SRPJ. He stated that the purpose of the burglary had been to remove evidence and take away Mr I.A.’s vehicle. On 22 November 1993, when he was questioned by the investigating judge about his relations with the people who had carried out the burglary at his home, the applicant denied any involvement. 45. On the same day the judge extended Mr I.A.’s detention on remand for one year by an order which stated: “The accused must be kept at the disposal of the judicial authorities, since the serious nature of the offence and the circumstances of the victim’s death have very gravely disturbed public order both in France and in Lebanon.” 46. A summary report drawn up by the Angers SRPJ and completed on 6 December 1993, concerning in particular the inquiries conducted after the burglary of 4 May, was communicated to the investigating judge. 47. On 7 December 1993 the investigating judge interviewed Mr A., who confirmed his statement of 9 November. 48. By two orders of 10 and 17 December 1993, which cited the same grounds as those of 13 and 23 August, 3 and 14 September, 15 and 29 October and 5 November 1993, the investigating judge refused applications for release lodged by the applicant on 6 and 13 December 1993. 49. On 7 and 21 January and 4 February 1994 the investigating judge refused applications for release lodged on 4, 18 and 31 January, by means of orders worded as follows: “Whereas the accused’s detention on remand is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, to protect the accused, and to ensure that the accused remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that there is strong evidence that [I.A.] is guilty of murder; in that from the time of his wife’s death until his arrest he showed particular duplicity; in that it is to be feared that he will abscond to a country where he has family ties; and in that it is therefore necessary to ensure that he remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities.” 50. The orders of 7 January and 4 February stated in addition: “The accused’s detention on remand is the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses.” The second of these did not refer to the need to “protect the accused”, but added that detention on remand was “the only way to preserve the evidence”. 51. On 7 February 1994 the investigating judge questioned Mr I.A. On the same day the Angers SRPJ interviewed a Mr B., one of the three people who had carried out the burglary of 4 May 1993. Subsequently, the police lost trace of him. 52. By orders of 14 and 22 February 1994 the investigating judge refused applications for release lodged on 9 and 17 February. These orders stated that the applicant’s detention on remand was the only way “to preserve evidence [and] prevent collusion between the accused and his accomplices” (order of 14 February) and “to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses” (order of 22 February). For the rest, they repeated the grounds cited in paragraph 49 above. 53. By three orders of 4, 11 and 18 March, the investigating judge refused applications for release lodged on 28 February and 7 and 14 March. The first and third of these orders stated that the applicant’s detention on remand was “the only way” to “preserve evidence” and to “prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses”; the second mentioned only the second of these grounds. For the rest, they repeated the grounds cited in paragraph 49 above, apart from the fact that the first two made no mention of the necessity of detention for the protection of the accused. 54. In the meantime, on 28 February 1994, an investigating judge from the Angers tribunal de grande instance had been appointed to investigate the case, since the investigation conducted up to that point had shown that the crime had been committed within the territorial jurisdiction of that court. On 4 March 1994 the new investigating judge asked for the file to be passed on to him. On 18 March 1994 the investigating judge who had handled the case until then relinquished his charge to the new judge. 55. On 6 June 1994 the new investigating judge questioned Mr I.A., who said that he wished to stand by his previous statements. 56. On 16 and 23 September 1994 the judge refused applications for release lodged by the applicant. The first of these orders was worded as follows: “Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is the only way to preserve evidence, and to prevent pressure being brought to bear on witnesses, in that the person under investigation stands accused of murdering his wife, which he denies; in that there is, however, evidence against him that must be examined; in that, moreover, it appears … from the file that he incited others to burgle his home with a view to the destruction of documents that could have been used as evidence; in that his release or placement under judicial supervision would not be, at the present stage of the investigation, conducive to discovery of the truth; Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, and to ensure that the person under investigation remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, in that there is strong evidence that [I.A.] is guilty of murder, an offence which, by its nature, causes a manifest and lasting disturbance of public order; in that the person under investigation has shown duplicity; and in that, having ties with a foreign country, it is to be feared that he would abscond if released.” The second order read as follows: “Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is the only way to preserve evidence, and to prevent collusion between the person under investigation and his accomplices, in that further inquiries are needed to uncover the full truth; in particular, light needs to be shed on the circumstances in which the burglary of the home of the person concerned – the scene of the crime – was organised and carried out; Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, and to prevent any repetition of the offence, in that, as the case file stands, there is strong evidence that the person concerned killed his wife; in that this is obviously an objectively serious offence which has accordingly caused a manifest and lasting disturbance of public order; in that the conduct of the person concerned during the investigation and the ties he has with a foreign country give reason to fear that he might seek to evade justice and his responsibilities; and in that the person concerned is already due to be examined on 11 October next.” 57. On 11 October 1994 the applicant was examined by the investigating judge. 58. On 18 October and 21 and 25 November 1994 the investigating judge refused applications for release of 13 October and 17 and 22 November by three orders drafted in exactly the same terms as the order of 23 September (apart from the reference to the examination of 11 October). 59. On 28 October 1994 the investigating judge instructed the director of the Angers SRPJ to find and interview a Mr F. and Mr B., two of the three people who had carried out the burglary of 4 May 1993. Mr F. was traced on 29 November 1994: he was in prison under the assumed identity of his own brother. 60. On 3 November 1994, acting on instructions of 24 October, the Cholet gendarmerie removed the official police seals from Mr I.A.’s house. 61. On 30 November 1994 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s detention on remand for one year, by an order which read: “Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is the only way to preserve evidence, and to prevent collusion between the person under investigation and his accomplices, in that further inquiries are needed to uncover the full truth; in particular, light needs to be shed on the circumstances in which the burglary of the home of the person concerned – the scene of the crime – was organised and carried out; and in that the police have been given instructions to try to apprehend the last of the men involved in the burglary; Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is necessary to ensure that the person under investigation remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities, and to preserve public order, in that, as the case file stands, and despite the denials of [I.A.], there is strong and consistent evidence that he killed his wife in particularly odious circumstances; in that this is obviously an objectively serious offence which has accordingly caused a manifest and lasting disturbance of public order; in that the conduct of the person under investigation during both the police inquiries and the judicial investigation and the ties he has kept with his country of origin give reason to fear that he might seek to evade justice and his criminal responsibility.” 62. On 2 December 1994 the investigating judge refused an application for release submitted on 28 November by an order written in the same terms as the order of 30 November. 63. On 5 January 1995 Mr I.A. again applied for release; this was refused by an order of 10 January 1995, on the same grounds as those set out in the orders of 30 November and 2 December 1994. The applicant appealed on 12 January 1995, relying in particular on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention; he complained of the length of the proceedings and argued that he could not be held responsible for this, since he had not requested any step likely to prolong the investigation, nor had he used any procedural remedies capable of suspending its progress. In response, the Indictment Division of the Angers Court of Appeal upheld the order in a judgment of 25 January 1995, holding: “… Although the killing of a woman by her husband is not generally a complex matter, it should be noted in the present case that this killing has been denied and presented as a suicide by hanging, just as the acts of torture and barbarity suffered by the victim during the days which preceded her death have been denied, but above all that the motive for this crime, without knowing which it is not possible to assess the perpetrator’s responsibility, has been carefully concealed. The silence constantly maintained by the person under investigation, the inertia he has shown in order to prevent the investigation moving rapidly forward and the need to conduct inquiries into the burglary committed at his home, in which one of his fellow prisoners participated, which was designed to destroy documents and the vehicle used to move the body, and which could have been carried out at the behest of [I.A.], obliged the investigating judge to order many expert opinions and to conduct inquiries which cannot be regarded as accessory in order to uncover the truth. These have been the cause of the protractedness of the proceedings and the detention of which [I.A.] complains. The risk that [I.A.] might bring pressure to bear on witnesses of the offences committed during the days which preceded the victim’s death, in concert with the accomplices he may well have had, and the risk that he might abscond to Lebanon or another country where he could be assisted by members of the large community of Lebanese emigrants make it essential for his detention to continue, since judicial supervision in this case is not a measure which can perform the functions set out in Article 137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” The applicant appealed on points of law against the above decision, relying on Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in particular. He submitted that his refusal to admit the offence which he stood accused of, and which he denied having committed, could not amount to inertia on his part; that the Court of Appeal had not explained how the need to conduct inquiries into the burglary carried out at his home prevented the investigation from proceeding in connection with the events which had led to his detention on remand; and that it had not given detailed reasons for its decision. In a judgment of 22 May 1995, the Court of Cassation dismissed this appeal. 64. In the meantime, on 18 January 1995, acting pursuant to the instructions of 28 October 1994 and further instructions given on 5 January 1995, the Angers SRPJ had interviewed Mr F., who had confirmed Mr A.’s statement to the effect that the burglary at the applicant’s home had been carried out at his behest with the aim of ensuring that certain documents disappeared. On 10 February 1995 the investigating judge had questioned Mr I.A. about the circumstances of the burglary; he had denied being behind it. On 24 March 1995 the judge had instructed the Metz gendarmerie by warrant to find out Mr A.’s address so that he could be served with a summons to appear before him at his chambers. The warrant had been returned on 6 April 1995 and the summons had been served on 5 May. On 31 May 1995 the investigating judge confronted the applicant with Mr A. and Mr F. All three confirmed their previous statements about the burglary. 65. On 29 June 1995 the investigating judge informed Mr I.A. that his case file was to be communicated to the public prosecutor in twenty days’ time, after which he would no longer be able to request additional investigative measures. On 19 July 1995 the applicant requested the investigating judge to order such measures; he asked for an international letter of request to be issued asking for inquiries to be conducted in Lebanon about the victim’s personality and an assessment made of whether she had suicidal tendencies. He also asked for three expert opinions to be ordered to describe the system of marriage and divorce in Lebanon and to explain the reasons why ethanol had been found in the victim’s body, the different nature of the strangulation marks found, what happened to the tongues of people who had been hanged or strangled and whether the position of the arms as he had described it was what would have been expected. By an order of 11 August 1995 the investigating judge refused these requests after noting their “particularly late” submission and the lack of justification for them. 66. On 19 July 1995 Mr I.A. had also applied to the Indictment Division asking it to declare the proceedings null and void. 67. On 26 July 1995 the investigating judge refused an application for release by an order worded as follows: “… Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is the only way to prevent pressure being brought to bear on the witnesses, the victim, in that, by his attitude throughout the investigation, the person under investigation has shown how determined he is to impede the discovery of the truth and in that it is to be feared that he might bring pressure to bear on witnesses of the offences committed during the days which preceded the victim’s death; Whereas the detention on remand of the person under investigation is necessary to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence, in that the person concerned is accused of a killing carried out in odious circumstances, which have disturbed public order in a particularly lasting manner; and in that [I.A.]’s conduct and ties outside France give reason to fear that he might seek to evade justice.” 68. On 31 July 1995 the investigating judge transferred the case file to the public prosecutor’s office. 69. On 4 August 1995 the investigating judge refused an application for release of 31 July, by an order written in exactly the same terms as the order of 26 July. 70. On 11 August 1995, in view of the application of 19 July in which Mr I.A. had asked the Indictment Division of the Angers Court of Appeal to declare the proceedings null and void, the investigating judge stayed the investigation pending the Indictment Division’s decision and ordered the case file to be transmitted to its president. 71. On the same day the investigating judge refused an application for release by an order written in the same terms as those of 26 July and 4 August. He refused further applications on 18 and 25 August, 1 and 29 September, 20 and 26 October and 3 and 10 November 1995. These orders reproduced the reasons set out in those of 26 July and 4 and 11 August and in addition expressly mentioned that detention on remand was “necessary to ensure that the person under investigation remain[ed] at the disposal of the judicial authorities”. The last three orders aded that, by his attitude “during both the police inquiries and the investigation”, the applicant had shown his determination to “mislead the investigators and witnesses about the facts”, that the risk of pressure being brought to bear also applied to witnesses of the events that had followed the victim’s death, that the disturbance to public order caused by the offence was “exceptional” and that Mr I.A.’s conduct and ties outside France gave reason to fear that he might seek to evade justice “as he [had] tried to evade his criminal responsibility”. 72. By a judgment of 15 November 1995 the Indictment Division of the Angers Court of Appeal noted that the proceedings were lawful and remitted the case to the investigating judge for further investigation. On 20 November 1995 the applicant appealed on points of law. 73. On 17 November 1995, by an order identical to those of 26 October and 3 and 10 November, the investigating judge refused an application for release submitted on 13 November. 74. The prosecution’s final submissions, calling for the file to be transmitted to the Principal Public Prosecutor, were filed on 21 November 1995 and the transmission order was made on 6 December 1995. 75. On 24 November and 1 and 6 December 1995, by orders which reproduced the reasons set out in those of 26 October and 3, 10 and 17 November, the investigating judge refused applications for release submitted by the applicant. On 8 December 1995 the applicant appealed to the Indictment Division of the Angers Court of Appeal against the order of 6 December. He complained of the length of his detention and the length of the proceedings. By a judgment of 20 December 1995 the Indictment Division dismissed the appeal, on the following grounds: “… [I.A.]’s lawyer cannot maintain that the investigation “has still not been closed” when the order for the file to be transmitted to the Principal Public Prosecutor was made on 6 December 1995, nor can he maintain that the Court of Cassation’s decision of 22 May 1995 dismissing his client’s appeal on points of law against the judgment of 25 January upholding an order refusing an application for release did not influence the speediness of the investigation, when he waited until 19 July before asking the investigating judge to take further steps and at the same time requested the Indictment Division to rule that the proceedings were null and void, since those applications, which do not appear to be really consistent with each other, necessarily caused some delay. … The killing of a woman by her husband is not generally a complex matter, but it should be observed in the present case, firstly, that the fact that the person under investigation has maintained a constant silence about the real circumstances of his wife’s death and the acts of torture and barbarity she suffered, the inertia he has shown in order to prevent the investigation moving rapidly forward and the need to conduct inquiries into the burglary committed at his home, in which one of his fellow prisoners participated, which was designed to destroy documents and the vehicle used to move the body, and which seems to have been carried out at the behest of [I.A.], obliged the investigating judge to order many expert opinions and to conduct inquiries which cannot be regarded as accessory in order to uncover the truth. Secondly, the applications and appeals lodged by [I.A.] have necessarily prolonged the proceedings and the detention whose length he complains of. As the preparatory investigation is now closed, [I.A.]’s detention on remand is necessary with a view to the definitive investigation of the facts to be conducted at his trial; to prevent him bringing pressure to bear on the witnesses of the offences committed during the days which preceded the victim’s death; to prevent him absconding to Lebanon or some other country and to guarantee that he appears in court to stand trial. As judicial supervision would not be adequate in the present case to perform the functions set out in Article 137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the impugned order is upheld.” 76. On 5 January 1996 the applicant again submitted an application for release to the Indictment Division of the Angers Court of Appeal, which dismissed it in a judgment of 17 January 1996, on the following grounds: “… Although the detention on remand he has undergone is abnormally long for a case in which a woman has been killed by her husband, as this court found in its previous judgment, the length of his detention is not attributable to any dysfunction of the judicial system but solely to the conduct of the person under investigation, who has maintained a constant silence about the real circumstances of his wife’s death and the acts of torture and barbarity she suffered, to the inertia he has shown in order to prevent the investigation moving forward and to the need to shed light on the burglary committed at his home, these inquiries and expert reports having been essential to make progress in discovering the truth in view of the attitude shown by the person under investigation. Lastly, the applications and appeals lodged by [I.A.] have necessarily prolonged the proceedings and the detention whose length he complains of. Regard being had to these circumstances, and to the judgment in the case of W. v. Switzerland delivered [by the European Court of Human Rights] on 26 January 1993, the period of time already spent in detention on remand has not exceeded the “reasonable time” prescribed by Article 5 § 3 of the [Convention]. As the Indictment Division is due to rule on 24 January 1996 on the charges to be brought against [I.A.], his detention on remand is necessary to prevent him bringing pressure to bear on the witnesses of the offences committed during the days which preceded the victim’s death, to prevent him absconding to Lebanon or some other country and to guarantee that he appears in court to stand trial. As judicial supervision would not be adequate in the present case to perform the functions set out in Article 137 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the impugned order is upheld.” 77. By a judgment of 24 January 1996, the Indictment Division committed the applicant for trial in the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court for murder and made an order for his delivery into custody. On the same day the applicant appealed to the Court of Cassation against this judgment. On 20 March 1996 the President of the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation ordered the continuation of the proceedings. On 25 June 1996 the Criminal Division dismissed the applicant’s appeals against the Indictment Division’s judgments of 15 November 1995 (see paragraph 72 above) and 24 January 1996. 78. At the criminal hearing on 11 December 1996 the Assize Court adjourned the case, in response to an application from the applicant, who objected to being tried in the absence of two witnesses (the victim’s sister-in-law and Mr B., one of the three people who had carried out the burglary of 4 May 1993) and an expert who had all been duly summoned. At the end of the hearing the applicant’s lawyer submitted an application for his release, which the court dismissed after retiring to deliberate. 79. By a judgment of 20 March 1997 the Assize Court sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment, with ineligibility for parole during the first eighteen years. 80. The applicant appealed on points of law against the judgment of 20 March 1997. By a judgment of 1 April 1998 the Criminal Division quashed the judgment of the Maine-et-Loire Assize Court and declared it null and void, on the ground that the Assize Court had misapplied Article 346 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when it ruled on an application by the applicant’s counsel for a note to be entered in the record by omitting to allow the latter or his client to address the court last. It remitted the case to the Loire-Atlantique Assize Court. 81. On 6 April 1998 the applicant lodged an application for release with the Indictment Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal. In a letter of 22 April, his lawyer informed the President of the Indictment Division that his client wished to withdraw the application. This was noted by the Indictment Division in a judgment of 23 April. 82. On 13 May 1998 Mr I.A. lodged a further application for release, which the Indictment Division of the Rennes Court of Appeal dismissed in a judgment of 28 May 1998, on the following grounds: “[I.A.] is liable to the penalty for a serious criminal offence. The evidence against him is particularly weighty, particularly in the light of what was revealed by examination of the victim’s body, which he admits getting rid of. The results contradicted the successive versions of events he gave during the investigation, which he took care to adapt and adjust to each new finding made as the inquiries progressed. Although his detention on remand has indeed lasted for a long time, its length is not attributable to any dysfunction of the judicial system, but is mainly due to the attitude shown by the accused, who, through his silence, his contradictions and his numerous applications (notably for relinquishment of jurisdiction by the investigating judge), has managed to impede the progress of the proceedings considerably and delay their outcome. In addition to the difficulties encountered in the course of the investigation, there was the need to find time for hearings in the Assize Court, and a new appeal, which was determined more than a year after it was lodged. In view of the particular, and indeed exceptional, circumstances, [I.A.]’s detention on remand has not exceeded the reasonable time prescribed by Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Moreover, the defendant has not provided sufficient guarantees that he will appear in court to stand trial. [I.A.] is of Lebanese origin. He asserts that he wishes to live in Rennes while waiting to appear in the Loire-Atlantique Assize Court. However, the court has reason to doubt that, particularly in the light of the severity of the penalty to which he is liable. It is to be feared that he will seek to evade justice. The risk of the defendant disappearing without trace seems considerable. In the light of all the above considerations, it must be ensured that [I.A.] remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities. These particular circumstances, deduced from the evidence in the case, establish that [I.A.]’s continued detention on remand remains justified with reference to the criteria exhaustively listed in Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure…” 83. Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides: “In cases involving serious crimes (matière criminelle) and lesser criminal offences (matière correctionnelle), if the sentence to which the person under investigation is liable is not less than one year’s imprisonment in the case of offences detected immediately after being committed, or two years' imprisonment in other cases, and if the constraints of judicial supervision are inadequate with regard to the functions set out in Article 137, the detention on remand may be ordered [or (Law no. 93-2 of 4 January 1993) ‘extended’]: 1. Where the detention on remand of the person under investigation is the sole means of preserving evidence or of preventing either pressure being brought to bear on witnesses or victims or collusion between persons under investigation and accomplices; [2. (Law no. 93-2 of 4 January 1993) Where this detention is necessary to protect the person concerned, to put an end to the offence or prevent its repetition, to ensure that the person concerned remains at the disposal of the judicial authorities or to preserve public order from the disturbance caused by the offence;] ...” 84. Detention on remand is imposed by means of an order which must set out the legal and factual grounds for the decision by reference to the provisions of Article 144 only. This order is notified orally to the accused, who receives a full copy of it upon signing the case file to acknowledge receipt (Article 145, first paragraph). The investigating judge gives his decision in chambers, after an adversarial hearing in the course of which he hears the submissions of the public prosecutor, then the observations of the person under investigation and, if appropriate, of his counsel (Article 145, fourth paragraph). 85. A person under investigation on suspicion of having committed a serious crime may not in principle be detained for more than one year. However, the investigating judge may, at the end of that period, extend detention for a period of not more than one year, by a decision given in accordance with the provisions of the first and fourth paragraphs of Article 145; that decision may be renewed in accordance with the same procedure until such time as the investigating judge makes the order terminating the investigation (Article 145-2). 86. An application for release may be submitted to the investigating judge at any time by the person detained or his lawyer subject to the obligations set out in Article 147; the person concerned is required to give an undertaking to attend immediately in person when a new step is taken in the proceedings if directed to do so and to keep the investigating judge informed of all his movements. The investigating judge immediately communicates the file to the public prosecutor so that the latter can make his submissions (Law no. 93-1013 of 24 August 1993 abolished the provision which required the investigating judge to inform civil parties that an application for release had been made). The investigating judge must in principle give his decision within five days of communicating the file by an order setting out the legal and factual grounds for the decision with reference to the provisions of Article 144. Where the above time-limit is not respected, the person detained may apply directly to the indictment division, which must reach a decision within twenty days, failing which the person detained is automatically released, unless verifications concerning his application have been ordered. Where release is granted, it may be accompanied by judicial supervision measures (Article 148). 87. Release may also be requested “in any event” by any person under investigation or defendant and at any time in the proceedings. Where application is made to a court of trial or appeal, the latter has the power to grant conditional release; before committal for trial in the assize court, and in between assize court sessions, that power belongs to the indictment division. In the event of an appeal on points of law, and until the Court of Cassation has given judgment, the decision on the application for release is given by the court which last tried the case on the merits. If the appeal on points of law has been lodged against an assize court judgment, the decision regarding detention is given by the indictment division (Article 148-1). The court which receives the application must in principle give judgment within ten days, if it is a court of trial, or twenty days, if it is a court of appeal. Failing that, detention on remand is terminated and the defendant, if not detained for another reason, is automatically released (Article 148-3). 88. An appeal against an order refusing release lies to the indictment division. It may be lodged by the person under investigation (Article 186) or by the Public Prosecutor or Principal Public Prosecutor (Article 185). Such an appeal does not have suspensive effect. In principle the indictment division must rule within fifteen days of the appeal, failing which the person concerned is automatically released (Article 194). 89. When dealing with an appeal on points of law against a judgment of the indictment division concerning detention on remand, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation must rule within three months of receiving the case file, failing which the person concerned is automatically released (Article 567-2).",['5'],['5-3'],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1971 and lives in Simferopol. 6. The applicant was born with congenital facial injury and was diagnosed with a “midline cranial cleft”. Between 1990 and 1997 she repeatedly underwent surgery in a clinic in the United States of America, following which her cranial disorders were mostly cured. However, owing to the extensive surgery, the applicant developed a mental illness. Since then she has needed regular supervision in the United States clinic. 7. In 2007 the applicant’s father applied to the Simferopol District Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea (“the District Court”), seeking to have her deprived of legal capacity on the ground that she suffered from serious mental illness. 8. Following a request by the District Court, on 5 June 2007 a forensic psychiatric expert issued an opinion stating that the applicant suffered from a chronic mental illness, namely paranoid schizophrenia, which prevented her from comprehending and controlling her actions. 9. On 10 July 2007 the District Court deprived the applicant of her legal capacity. The decision was not appealed against and became final. 10. On 21 November 2007 the applicant’s sister was assigned as the applicant’s guardian (опікун). 11. Gradually, the applicant’s mental health improved, so that on 3 April 2008 she took up a position at a local factory. 12. In 2009 the applicant’s guardian applied to the District Court for restoration of the applicant’s legal capacity. However, on 30 October 2009 the application was dismissed without being considered on the merits owing to the guardian’s repeated failure to appear in court. 13. On 1 November 2010 the applicant applied on her own to the District Court, seeking restoration of her legal capacity. She specified that Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which did not provide for the right for an incapacitated person to submit such an application, was not compatible with international legal standards and was discriminatory. 14. On 4 November 2010 the District Court returned the application to the applicant without considering it on the merits, noting that, by virtue of Article 121 § 3 and Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the applicant was not entitled to submit such an application. 15. On 12 January 2011 the court of appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 4 November 2010 noting that Article 241 § 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure did not provide the applicant with the right to lodge an application for restoration of her legal capacity. The District Court had therefore lawfully returned the application without considering it on the merits, as required by Article 121 § 3 of that Code. On 12 March 2011 the court of cassation dismissed as unfounded the applicant’s appeal on points of law. 16. Article 67 of the Code provides that a guardian is obliged to take measures for the protection of the civil rights and interests of the person who is under his or her guardianship. 17. Article 121 § 3 of the Code provides that a court cannot accept a claim for consideration on the merits if it has been submitted by a person deprived of legal capacity. 18. Article 241 § 4 of the Code provides that a court decision declaring a physical person entirely incapable may be quashed and the legal capacity of that person may be restored by another court decision provided that the person has been cured or his or her mental state has significantly improved. Such a decision is to be taken upon an application submitted by the guardian or the guardianship authority (орган опіки та піклування) and must be supported by relevant conclusions by a forensic psychiatric expert. 19. This Order requires the guardianship authorities, among other things, to supervise the activities of guardians and to take measures for the protection of the rights of persons who have been placed under guardianship.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
99,001-57913,ENG,GRC,CHAMBER,1994,CASE OF STRAN GREEK REFINERIES AND STRATIS ANDREADIS v. GREECE,2,"Preliminary objections rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies, estoppel);Violation of Art. 6-1;Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings",C. Russo;N. Valticos;R. Pekkanen,"6. Stran Greek Refineries (""Stran"") is a company currently in liquidation. Its registered address is in Athens and Mr Stratis Andreadis was its sole shareholder. 7. Under the terms of a contract concluded on 22 July 1972 with the Greek State, which at the time was governed by a military junta, Mr Andreadis undertook to construct a crude oil refinery in the Megara region, near Athens. The refinery was to be built, at an estimated cost of 76,000,000 US dollars, by a company which it was proposed to form, Stran Greek Refineries, of which the second applicant was to be the sole owner. All the latter’s rights and obligations were to be automatically transferred to the company upon its incorporation. The Government ratified the contract by Legislative Decree no. 1211/1972, published in the Official Gazette of 26 July 1972. Under Article 21 of the contract, the State undertook to purchase, not later than 31 December 1972, a plot of land in Megara suitable for the construction of the refinery. On 27 July 1972, by a Royal Decree (no. 450), issued pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 2687/1953 on ""the Investment and Protection of Capital Funds from Abroad"", the State authorised Mr Andreadis to import 58 million US dollars to finance the scheme. 8. However, the project stagnated because the State failed to fulfil its obligation. On 28 November 1973 the Ministers of Industry and Agriculture announced at a press conference in Megara the Government’s decision to return to the proprietors the land which had already been expropriated in accordance with Article 21 of the contract. The following day the Megara police ordered that the work should cease. In December 1973 Stran protested to the relevant authorities and sought permission to proceed with the work. On 27 February 1974 it even issued an extra-judicial summons inviting the State to ratify the purchase of the land in question, but the State refused to revoke the police order prohibiting the continuation of the work. 9. Once democracy had been restored, the Government took the view that the contract and Decree no. 450 were prejudicial to the national economy; they relied on Article 2 para. 5 of Law no. 141/1975 on the termination of preferential contracts (kharistikes symvasseis) concluded under the military regime (1967-74). This Law, which was enacted by special authorisation under the 1975 Constitution (Article 107 - see paragraph 24 below), possessed superior force. The applicants did not respond to a proposal addressed to them by the Minister for Co-ordination on 19 November 1975 inviting them to enter negotiations for the revision or termination of the contract. Accordingly, a ministerial committee on the economy terminated the contract on 14 October 1977. The applicants did not challenge this decision in the courts. 10. Prior to the termination of the contract, Stran had incurred expenditure in connection with the scheme. In particular, it had concluded contracts for the supply of goods and services with foreign and Greek undertakings and had taken out loans. A dispute then arose between Stran and the State. On 10 November 1978 Stran brought an action (anagnoristiki agogi) in the Athens Court of First Instance for a declaration that the State should pay it compensation in the amounts of 251,113,978 drachmas, 22,799,782 US dollars and 877,466 French francs. It argued that the State had been in breach of its obligations during the period of validity of the contract, in particular in so far as it had, since 27 November 1973, prohibited the continuation of work on the construction of the refinery at Megara and had not, since 9 February 1974, taken any steps to expropriate the land required for that construction. It also sought the return of a cheque for 240 million drachmas which it had lodged with the Ministry of the National Economy as security for the proper performance of the contract; it further claimed reimbursement of the commission and the fiscal stamp fee paid to the Commercial Bank of Greece. The State challenged the jurisdiction of the court. It contended that the dispute should be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 27 of the contract, the relevant paragraphs of which were worded as follows: ""1. Any difference, dispute or disagreement arising between the State and the Concessionaire as to the application of this Agreement and relative to the interpretation of the terms and conditions thereof and the extent of the rights and obligations deriving therefrom shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration by three arbitrators according to the following procedure, no other arbitration agreement being required. ... 9. The arbitration award shall be definite, final and irrevocable, and shall constitute an enforceable instrument requiring no further action for enforcement or any other formality. It shall be liable to no ordinary or extraordinary judicial remedies, nor shall it be subject to cancellation or suspension before ordinary courts of justice. The party failing to comply with the provisions of the arbitration award shall be obligated to make good any and all damage (damnum emergens or lucrum cessans) caused to the other party."" 11. In a preliminary decision (no. 13910/1979) of 29 September 1979, the Athens Court of First Instance rejected the State’s main submission. It held that the arbitration clause concerned solely the settlement of disputes arising from the performance of the contract and not the failure of one of the parties to perform the contract. It found further that the ministerial committee on the economy had terminated the contract in issue in its entirety (see paragraph 9 above) which had the effect of rendering the arbitration clause void as it was not an autonomous provision. In addition, the court dismissed the State’s argument that two of the conditions subsequent contained in the contract, namely the lodging of a cheque as security and the payment of the second part of the minimum capital, had not been satisfied. Finally, the court ordered additional investigative measures, including the hearing of five witnesses, in order to determine the existence and extent of the damage alleged by Stran. 12. On 12 June 1980 the State filed an arbitration petition and appointed an arbitrator. It requested the arbitration court to declare that all the claims for compensation against the Greek State lodged by Stran in the Athens Court of First Instance (see paragraph 10 above) were unfounded. In its memorial of 28 June 1980 Stran - which had appointed a professor of law at Athens University as arbitrator - maintained primarily that the arbitration court lacked jurisdiction and requested that the arbitration be stayed until the proceedings instituted on 10 November 1978 had been concluded; in the alternative and in order to rebut the State’s arguments on the merits, it referred the arbitrators to its pleadings in the Athens Court of First Instance. 13. The arbitration court was constituted on 3 July 1980; its president was chosen jointly by the two other arbitrators (Article 27 para. 3 of the contract). It made its award on 27 February 1984. It found that it had jurisdiction in that, in its view, the disputes arising from the total failure to perform the contract were also subject to arbitration, which was not restricted to those deriving from non-performance of individual clauses as had been argued by the State. The wording of the arbitration clause in Article 27 (see paragraph 10 above) was sufficiently general and clear to rule out such distinctions. On the merits, the arbitration court relied on the evidence adduced by the parties before the Athens Court of First Instance on 10 November 1978 (see paragraph 10 above). It found that responsibility for the losses sustained by Stran was shared - 70% for the State and 30% for the company. The latter had commenced work on land which had been the subject of a contested expropriation order and without first obtaining the necessary planning permission. It therefore held Stran’s claims to be well-founded in an amount not exceeding 116,273,442 drachmas, 16,054,165 US dollars and 614,627 French francs, plus interest at 6% from 10 November 1978; however, this reference to interest did not appear in the operative part of the decision. Finally, the court declared that the State was unlawfully retaining the cheque lodged as security (see paragraph 10 above). 14. On 24 July 1984 the applicant company sought an order from the Athens Court of First Instance requiring the State to return the security, but the court stayed the proceedings pending the conclusion of those instituted on 10 November 1978 (see paragraph 10 above). 15. On 2 May 1984 the State had asked the Athens Court of First Instance to set aside the arbitration award of 27 February 1984. It argued that the arbitration court had lacked jurisdiction to hear disputes arising from the contract in issue and Stran’s financial claims against the State. In the alternative, it affirmed that the contracting parties had intended to limit the jurisdiction of the arbitration court to disputes concerning the performance and interpretation of the clauses of the contract and the scope of the rights and duties deriving therefrom; its jurisdiction could not therefore extend to disputes relating to the total failure to perform the contract. It followed that the dispute in question was a matter for the ordinary civil courts, as the Athens Court of First Instance had recognised in its judgment no. 13910/1979. In the further alternative, the State argued that the arbitration court’s lack of jurisdiction was confirmed by the fact that Stran’s claims against it had become statute-barred following the termination of the contract. Finally, it stressed the declaratory nature of the action brought by Stran on 10 November 1978 (see paragraph 10 above). 16. In a judgment (no. 5526/1985) of 21 April 1985 the Athens court dismissed the State’s application, holding that the decision terminating the contract had not rendered the arbitration clause void. That clause continued to produce its effects in relation to disputes which had arisen during the period of validity of the contract. 17. On 19 December 1986 the applicant company withdrew its first action in the Athens Court of First Instance (see paragraph 9 above), but sought to pursue its action for the return of the cheque lodged as security (see paragraph 14 above). When this action was heard in the Athens Court of First Instance, on 6 February 1987, the State, relying on Article 294 of the Code of Civil Procedure, opposed the discontinuance of the first action. It maintained that the latter action would have resulted in a finding unfavourable to Stran and that the State thus had a legitimate interest in seeking a final decision. However, the court again stayed the proceedings (decision no. 2877/1987) on account of the appeal on points of law which was pending (see paragraph 19 below). 18. In a judgment (no. 9336/1986) of 4 November 1986, the Athens Court of Appeal, basing its decision on the same grounds, upheld the judgment of 21 April 1985. It ruled, inter alia: ""In modern Greek legislation the principle of the autonomy of an arbitration clause in relation to the contract prevails. The termination of the contract, for whatever reason, does not bring an end to the power of the arbitrators designated to hear disputes which have arisen during the period of validity of the contract ... The decision of the ministerial committee on the economy did not annul the arbitration clause contained in Article 27 of the contract and, accordingly, it does not preclude the arbitrators from examining the merits of the dispute."" 19. On 15 December 1986 the State appealed to the Court of Cassation. The hearing was initially set down for 4 May 1987, but on that date it was postponed to 1 June 1987 at the State’s request, on the ground that a draft law concerning the case in question was before Parliament. In reply to a question put by the European Court at the hearing on 19 April 1994, the applicants’ lawyer maintained that the Court of Cassation’s judge-rapporteur had sent his opinion, which had been favourable to the applicants’ arguments, to the parties before 4 May and this affirmation was not disputed by the Government. 20. On 22 May 1987 Parliament enacted Law no. 1701/1987 on ""the compulsory participation of the State in private undertakings ... and the redemption of shares"", which entered into force upon its publication in the Official Gazette of 25 May 1987. This Law dealt principally with the renegotiation of a concession for the prospecting for and extraction of oil and natural gas in an area of the Sea of Thrace. However, Article 12 of the Law was worded as follows: ""1. The true and lawful meaning of the provisions of Article 2 para. 1 of Law no. 141/1975 concerning the termination of contracts entered into between 21 April 1967 and 24 July 1974 is that, upon the termination of these contracts, all their terms, conditions and clauses, including the arbitration clause, are ipso jure repealed and the arbitration tribunal no longer has jurisdiction. 2. Arbitration awards covered by paragraph 1 shall no longer be valid or enforceable. 3. Any principal or ancillary claims against the Greek State, expressed either in foreign or local currency, which arise out of the contracts entered into between 21 April 1967 and 24 July 1974, ratified by statute and terminated by virtue of Law no. 141/1975, are now proclaimed time-barred. 4. Any court proceedings at whatever level pending at the time of the enactment of this statute, in respect of claims within the meaning of the preceding paragraph, are declared void."" 21. On 10 July 1987, after hearing the opinion of the judge-rapporteur calling for the appeal to be dismissed, the First Division of the Court of Cassation delivered its judgment (no. 1387/1987). It held that Article 12 was unconstitutional on the following grounds: ""... Not only does [Article 107] of the Constitution confer superior force on Law no. 141/1975, but it also prohibits subsequent amendments or additions thereto, or even authoritative interpretation thereof, in the form of ordinary legislation. The purpose of that superior force and of the provision in the Constitution requiring that a single law be enacted once and for all within three months of the entry into force of the Constitution was to ensure legislative stability and international confidence for investments in Greece. This opinion is based on the only possible meaning to be attributed to the expression ‘single law to be enacted once and for all’ and on the ease with which the said provision would be flouted if amendments, additions or authoritative interpretation of that law were allowed ... It follows that ... the provisions of Article 12 of Law no. 1701/1987 which purport to provide an authoritative interpretation of and to amend and supplement Article 2 para. 1 of Law no. 141/1975 and which were enacted after the expiry of the time-limit laid down in Article 107 para. 2 of the Constitution are contrary to that instrument. In accordance with Article 93 para. 4 of the Constitution the court is therefore precluded from applying them. The Division refuses to apply unconstitutional provisions and, pursuant to Article 563 para. 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, holds that it is bound to refer the case to the Court of Cassation sitting in plenary session ..."" 22. The hearing in the Court of Cassation sitting in plenary session opened on 19 November 1987, but as a result of the death of one of its members Stran sought a new hearing, which was held on 25 February 1988. The Court of Cassation delivered its judgment (no. 4/1989) on 16 March 1989. It observed, inter alia: ""... [The Constitution] provides for the enactment of ‘a single law to be enacted once and for all’ which by definition possesses superior force inasmuch as it may be neither supplemented nor amended by ordinary legislation ... However, the prohibition on supplementing or modifying the content of [such] laws does not mean that they may never be interpreted. The fact that they are sui generis, which gives them precedence over ordinary legislation, ... does not preclude their interpretation where the circumstances so require. The purpose of such interpretation is not to amend the substance of the law interpreted, but to clarify its original meaning and to resolve disputes that have arisen in connection with its application or which may do so in the future. [The need for such interpretation] will ultimately be determined by the court which will have to ascertain whether the meaning of the law interpreted actually gave rise to doubts justifying the intervention of the legislature ... Accordingly, the interpretation of Law no. 141/1975 is not contrary to the Constitution merely because it is a law of superior rank. It must nevertheless be determined, on the one hand, whether the interpretation was necessary in the specific case and, on the other, whether the non-interpretative provisions of this Law, which have a bearing on the solution of the case in issue, are contrary to the Constitution ... The wording [of Article 2 para. 5 of Law no. 141/1975] lacks clarity and creates doubt as to whether the arbitration clause survives the termination of the contract ... and as to the jurisdiction of the arbitration court. In the instant case doubt first arose in the course of the proceedings brought by [the applicants] in the ordinary civil court and again - following the preliminary decision of the Athens Court of First Instance - when those proceedings had been discontinued and recourse was had to arbitration, where diametrically opposed arguments were put forward ... Irrespective of those doubts, the main issue is the acceptance or rejection of the principle of the autonomous character of the arbitration clause and of its scope. For a long time this matter has been the subject of significant differences of opinion in international case-law and among legal writers. In some countries the principle of the survival of the clause to resolve disputes arising prior to the termination of contracts ... prevails. In other countries the dominant view is that termination of the contract entails the annulment of the clause and therefore the referral of all the disputes to the ordinary courts. In other countries again, the accepted view is that the autonomous character of the arbitration clause operates only in respect of certain types of dispute. It was therefore necessary to provide an interpretation of Law no. 141/1975 and that interpretation resolved the problem for the purposes of Greek law by opting for the annulment of arbitration clauses ... and the removal of jurisdiction from the arbitration court. The fact that the intervention of the legislature occurred ... five days before the hearing in the First Division of this Court and following a previous adjournment does not mean that it was not necessary and does not render it contrary to Article 26 paras. 1 and 3 and Articles 77 and 87 of the Constitution. The dispute in question provided the opportunity to resolve a problem which had already arisen. Consequently, it cannot be concluded that, in giving such an interpretation in this case, the legislature interfered with the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts and usurped that jurisdiction. It follows that, contrary to the finding of the First Division, Article 12 para. 1 of Law no. 1701/1987 is not in breach of the Constitution ..."" The Court of Cassation took the view that paragraph 2 of Article 12 was not unconstitutional as it essentially supplemented paragraph 1 and sought to deprive of effect any arbitration awards that were made after the termination of contracts and that would not have been made if the meaning of Law no. 141/1975 had been clarified in time. In addition, the court refused to examine the constitutionality of paragraph 3, finding that it had no bearing on the case before it. Finally, it held that the adoption of paragraph 4 shortly before the hearing purported to remove from the courts the possibility of determining the validity of the contested award. That provision therefore violated the principle of the separation of powers. 23. The Court of Cassation remitted the case to the First Division which, on 11 April 1990, quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 4 November 1986 (see paragraph 18 above) and declared void the arbitration award of 27 February 1984 (see paragraph 13 above). 24. The following provisions of the 1975 Constitution are relevant here: ""1. The authentic interpretation of the laws shall rest with the legislative power. 2. A law which is not truly interpretative shall enter into force only as of its publication."" ""The courts shall be bound not to apply laws, the contents of which are contrary to the Constitution."" ""1. Legislation of higher formal rank enacted before 21 April 1967 pertaining to the protection of foreign capital shall continue to possess such rank and shall be applicable to capital imported henceforth. 2. A single law to be enacted once and for all within three months of the date of the entry into force of this Constitution shall specify the terms and the procedure for the termination or revision of preferential administrative agreements or measures concluded or promulgated between 21 April 1967 and 23 July 1974 pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 2687/1953, in so far as such agreements or measures concern the investment of foreign capital ..."" According to legal writers, the reference in Article 107 of the Constitution to Legislative Decree no. 2687/1953 - which provides, inter alia, that arbitration is to constitute the sole means of resolving disputes concerning foreign investment - confers constitutional status on such arbitration (Introduction to Greek Law, edited by K.D. Kerameus and P.J. Kozyris, Deventer/Athens, Kluwer/Sakkoulas, 1988, p. 263). 25. The Code of Civil Procedure provides, inter alia, as follows: ""The plaintiff may withdraw the action without the consent of the defendant before the latter has filed pleadings on the merits of the case. He may not so withdraw at a later stage if the defendant objects to the withdrawal on the ground that he has a legitimate interest in the proceedings being concluded by a final decision."" ""The effect of the withdrawal of the action is that it shall be deemed never to have been brought ..."" The VIIth section of the Code of Civil Procedure (Articles 867-903) deals with arbitration. The relevant provisions are as follows: ""The arbitrator ... shall, unless stipulated otherwise in the arbitration clause, file the original of the arbitration award with the registry of the Court of First Instance within whose jurisdiction the decision was given ..."" ""1. The ordinary remedies do not lie against arbitration awards. 2. The arbitration agreement may specify an appeal against the arbitration award before different arbitrators ..., but it must at the same time define the conditions, the time-limit and the procedure to be followed for the exercise of such a remedy and for the decision thereon."" ""If the arbitration agreement does not specify the appeal provided for in Article 895 para. 2 or if the time-limit for filing such an appeal has expired, the arbitration award shall become final ..."" ""The arbitration award may be annulled, in whole or in part, only by judicial decision and on the following grounds: (1) where the arbitration agreement is void; (2) where it was made after the arbitration agreement had ceased to be valid; (3) where the arbitrators were designated in breach of the terms of the arbitration agreement or of the statutory provisions ...; (4) where the arbitrators exceeded the powers attributed to them under the arbitration agreement or by statute; (5) where the provisions of Articles 886 para. 2, 891 and 892 have been infringed; (6) where it is contrary to public policy and morality; (7) where it is incomprehensible or where it contains contradictory provisions; ..."" ""1. Enforcement may be effected solely pursuant to an enforceable decision. 2. The following decisions shall be enforceable: ... (b) arbitration awards; ..."" ""1. Enforcement may be effected solely on the basis of the copy of the enforceable decision bearing the stamp conferring authority to execute ... 2. Endorsement with the stamp conferring authority to execute shall be effected: ... (d) in respect of arbitration awards by the judge of the First Instance Court ...; ..."" 26. Law no. 141/1975, which was enacted pursuant to Article 107 para. 2 of the Constitution, made possible the revision or revocation of any administrative measure of ratification, issued between 21 April 1967 and 23 July 1974, and any contract concluded by the State during that period with a legal or a natural person and concerning the investments governed by Legislative Decree no. 2687/1953. Such measures or contracts were to be revised or terminated where they were incompatible with the Constitution or other laws or contrary to morality, and prejudicial to the interests of the State, consumers and the national economy. The contracts were to be terminated where it proved impossible to revise them in their entirety. Termination could be effected at the written request of the person concerned or unilaterally by the ministerial committee on the economy. Article 2 para. 5 of the Law described the consequences of termination in the following terms: ""Following the termination of a contract ... the special privileges and agreements shall cease to have effect and the undertaking or investment shall be subject to the ordinary laws governing ordinary undertakings and investments ...""",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
100,001-122239,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2013,VALCHEVA AND ABRASHEV v. BULGARIA,3,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant in the first application (no. 6194/11), Ms Polyana Ivanova Valcheva, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1945 and lives in Lovech. She is not legally represented. 2. The applicant in the second application (no. 34887/11), Mr Enyo Nikolov Abrashev, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1957 and lives in Stara Zagora. He is represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms S. Stefanova, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. 3. The respondent Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms I. StanchevaChinova, of the Ministry of Justice. 4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5. On 11 February 2004 the Lovech District Prosecutor’s Office, having been tipped off by Ms Valcheva, a member of the Lovech Bar, that her former de facto spouse had committed documentary fraud, asked the Lovech police to inquire into the matter. On 1 March 2004 the police proposed that criminal proceedings be brought against Ms Valcheva’s de facto spouse. 6. On 30 March 2004 the Lovech District Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal proceedings against him. In the following days it gathered evidence, heard eleven witnesses, including Ms Valcheva, and obtained a graphological expert report. 7. As the evidence led the investigator in charge of the case to believe that Ms Valcheva had forged an employment certificate to enable her de facto spouse to obtain a retirement pension, on 30 June 2004 he brought charges of documentary fraud against her. 8. On 7 July 2004 Ms Valcheva was allowed to inspect the case file, and on 15 July 2004 the investigator proposed that she be brought to trial. 9. On 22 July 2004 the Lovech District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Ms Valcheva and her de facto spouse, alleging that he had committed documentary fraud by using the employment certificate to obtain a retirement pension, and that she had consciously enabled him to commit that fraud by forging that certificate. 10. The Lovech District Court held a hearing on 20 October 2004. Noting that the alleged victim of the offence – the social security authorities – had not appeared, it decided to adjourn the case. 11. The next hearing took place on 15 December 2004. The social security authorities brought a civil claim against Ms Valcheva and her de facto spouse, seeking repayment, plus interest, of the amounts that the latter had obtained by way of a retirement pension. The president of the panel hearing the case recused himself, citing the fact that Ms Valcheva was a member of the Lovech Bar. On 21, 27, 29 and 30 December 2004 all other judges of the Lovech District Court also declined to sit in the case, citing the same reason. Accordingly, on 4 January 2005 the court’s president sent the case to the Supreme Court of Cassation for a decision to which other district court the case was to be transferred, and on 2 February 2005 the Supreme Court of Cassation chose the Pleven District Court. 12. The trial before the Pleven District Court was due to start on 14 June 2005. However, on that date the court found that it could not proceed with the case because the prosecution had not appeared, and decided to adjourn it. On 28 November 2005 the case was again adjourned because Ms Valcheva’s de facto spouse was ill and could not attend. 13. The trial started on 3 April 2006. The Pleven District Court heard eight witnesses and an expert and admitted an expert report. 14. On an unspecified date in 2006 the social security authorities withdrew their civil claim against Ms Valcheva’s de facto spouse because he had repaid the amounts that he had obtained by way of a retirement pension. At the next hearing, held on 26 September 2005, he entered into a plea agreement with the prosecution. After approving the agreement, the panel hearing the case recused themselves by reference to a rule of criminal procedure barring judges and lay judges from sitting in a case in which they had approved a plea agreement. 15. The case was then assigned to another panel, which held hearings on 12 January, 26 March, 16 May, 21 September and 5 December 2007. 16. A hearing listed for 29 February 2008 had to be postponed because it coincided with the annual plenary meeting of the Pleven District Court, and took place on 31 March 2008. The Pleven District Prosecutor’s Office asked the court to discontinue the trial and refer the case back to the Lovech District Prosecutor’s Office with a view to clarifying the charges against Ms Valcheva. The court, observing that the indictment did not clearly spell out the time, the place or the manner of commission of the offence alleged against her, acceded to the request. 17. On 7 May 2008 the Lovech District Prosecutor’s Office lodged an amended indictment against Ms Valcheva with the Lovech District Court. On 21 May 2008 the judge to whom the case had been assigned again withdrew, citing his earlier decision to withdraw from the case in 2005. Noting that the Supreme Court of Cassation had already determined which court should deal with the case, on 17 November 2008 the president of the Lovech District Court sent it to the Pleven District Court. 18. On 12 January 2009 the Pleven District Court set the case down for trial. It was due to take place on 23 April 2009 but was adjourned due to Ms Valcheva’s failure to appear without showing cause. The court fined her for that failure. She appealed the fine. 19. The trial was held on 30 November 2009 and 12 February 2010. On the lastmentioned date the Pleven District Court acquitted Ms Valcheva, finding that the charges against her had not been made out to the required criminal standard of proof. 20. The prosecution appealed. The Pleven Regional Court heard the appeal on 1 and 29 June 2010. In a final judgment of 7 July 2010, it fully upheld Ms Valcheva’s acquittal. 21. On 6 March 2002 the Stara Zagora Regional Prosecutor’s Office opened criminal proceedings against Mr Abrashev on suspicion that he had committed aggravated documentary fraud. 22. On 10 May 2002 Mr Abrashev was charged with attempting, with the help of an accomplice, to obtain a large sum of money by using a false promissory note. Mr Abrashev’s alleged accomplice was likewise charged the same day. 23. Having interviewed the two accused and a number of witnesses, and having obtained other evidence, including a graphological expert report, on 15 October 2002 the investigator in charge of the case proposed that Mr Abrashev and his alleged accomplice be brought to trial. 24. On 29 October 2002 the Stara Zagora Regional Prosecutor’s Office referred the case back to the investigator, citing a number of omissions in the investigation. The investigator objected to the referral, but on 21 November 2002 the Stara Zagora Regional Prosecutor’s Office dismissed his objections. 25. On 27 January 2003 the investigator ordered a financial expert report. The report was ready on 6 February 2003. On 24 March 2003 the investigator again proposed that Mr Abrashev be brought to trial. By contrast, this time he proposed that the charges against Mr Abrashev’s alleged accomplice be dropped for lack of sufficient evidence. 26. On 18 April 2003 the Stara Zagora Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided that the charges against Mr Abrashev’s alleged accomplice should be dropped and that Mr Abrashev should not be prosecuted for documentary fraud but simple fraud. It went on to note that the prosecution of simple frauds fell within the competence of the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office, and referred the case to that office. 27. On 13 May 2003 the investigator laid the amended charges against Mr Abrashev, accusing him of aggravated simple fraud, and on 4 June 2003 proposed that he be brought to trial. 28. On 13 June 2003 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office decided to discontinue the proceedings, considering that the charges against Mr Abrashev had not been made out and that the facts alleged against him did not constitute an offence. On an application by the victim of the alleged offence, on 11 July 2003 the Stara Zagora District Court set the discontinuance aside. 29. On 6 August 2003 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office again discontinued the proceedings. The victim of the alleged offence again sought judicial review. On 24 October 2003 the Stara Zagora District Court found that it could not examine the application, because the lawyer who had lodged it had not enclosed with it a power of attorney. The victim then asked the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office to vary its decision to discontinue the proceedings – as possible when it had not been reviewed by a court on the merits –, and on 18 November 2003 that office acceded to her request. Mr Abrashev appealed to the Stara Zagora Regional Prosecutor’s Office, but on 23 January 2004 that office upheld the lower office’s decision. Mr Abrashev appealed further, but on 17 February 2004 the Plovdiv Appellate Prosecutor’s Office also upheld the lower offices’ decisions. 30. On 15 June 2004 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office indicted Mr Abrashev, but on 9 November 2004 the Stara Zagora District Court referred the case back to it, citing defects in the indictment. 31. On 13 December 2004 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office again indicted Mr Abrashev. 32. This time the case proceeded to trial, which took place on 7 June, 6 July and 8 November 2005, and on 20 February, 13 April and 25 May 2006. The Stara Zagora District Court heard a number of witnesses and obtained an expert report. One trial sitting was adjourned because Mr Abrashev was ill and could not attend, and another was adjourned due to the absence of witnesses. On 25 May 2006 the Stara Zagora District Court acquitted Mr Abrashev. 33. On 31 May 2006 the victim of the alleged offence, who had taken part in the trial as a private prosecutor, appealed. The public prosecutor likewise appealed on 9 June 2006. Having heard the appeals on 8 November 2006, on 8 December 2006 the Stara Zagora Regional Court decided to quash the lower court’s judgment and to remit the case. 34. On 17 January 2007 the Stara Zagora District Court in turn decided to refer the case back to the prosecuting authorities, citing, inter alia, defects in the indictment. 35. On 26 March 2007 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office presented the amended charges to Mr Abrashev. On 30 May 2007 it indicted him. 36. On 31 July 2007 the Stara Zagora District Court, considering that the facts of which Mr Abrashev stood accused did not constitute an offence, decided to discontinue the proceedings against him. The public prosecutor and the private prosecutor both appealed. On 12 December 2007 the Stara Zagora Regional Court quashed the discontinuance, holding that it had been improper for the lower court to proceed in that manner, and remitted the case to a different formation. 37. On 4 March 2008 the Stara Zagora District Court once more referred the case back to the prosecution, citing defects in the indictment. 38. On 29 April 2008 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office again indicted Mr Abrashev. 39. The case proceeded to trial, which took place on 26 September, 12 November and 11 December 2008, and on 18 February, 19 March and 23 April 2009. One trial sitting was adjourned because Mr Abrashev’s counsel was busy elsewhere and could not attend. On 23 April 2009 the Stara Zagora District Court acquitted Mr Abrashev. 40. The public prosecutor and the private prosecutor both appealed. The first hearing before the Stara Zagora Regional Court, initially fixed for 14 October 2009, had to be postponed because counsel for Mr Abrashev was busy elsewhere. It took place on 28 October 2009. The second hearing was held on 2 December 2009. On 7 January 2010 the Stara Zagora Regional Court quashed the lower court’s judgment and referred the case back to the prosecuting authorities, citing their failure to specify the charges against Mr Abrashev. 41. In February 2010 the Stara Zagora District Prosecutor’s Office again indicted Mr Abrashev. 42. On 11 August 2010 the Stara Zagora District Court, considering that the facts of which Mr Abrashev stood accused did not constitute an offence, decided to discontinue the proceedings against him. The public prosecutor and the private prosecutor both appealed. Having heard the appeals on 20 October 2010, in a final decision of 6 January 2011 the Stara Zagora Regional Court upheld the lower court’s decision. 43. On 16 February 2011 the victim of the alleged offence asked the Chief Prosecutor to seek reopening of the proceedings. On 18 April 2011 the Chief Prosecutor requested the Supreme Court of Cassation to reopen the proceedings, citing flagrant breaches of the rules of procedure and the substantive law in the making of the Stara Zagora District Court’s ruling of 11 August 2010 and the Stara Zagora Regional Court’s ruling of 6 January 2011. The Supreme Court of Cassation heard the request on 18 May 2011. On 28 June 2011 it decided to reopen the case and refer it back to the Stara Zagora District Court for trial. 44. The Stara Zagora District Court held five hearings: on 17 October and 15 December 2011, and on 13 February, 2 April and 21 May 2012. At the last of those hearings it found Mr Abrashev not guilty. 45. The public prosecutor and the private prosecutor both appealed. A number of judges at the Stara Zagora Regional Court withdrew from sitting in the case because they had previously sat in it. The court heard the appeal on 14 November 2012 and, in a judgment of the same date, quashed Mr Abrashev’s acquittal, convicted him and sentenced him to nine months’ imprisonment, suspended. 46. Both Mr Abrashev and the private prosecutor appealed on points of law. The hearing before the Supreme Court of Cassation was initially listed for 28 January 2013, but was adjourned at the request of counsel for Mr Abrashev, and took place on 22 February 2013. In a final judgment of 4 March 2013, the Supreme Court of Cassation quashed the lower court’s judgment and acquitted Mr Abrashev. 47. A 2007 amendment to the 1991 Constitution added a new Article 132a, which envisaged the creation of an Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council. The Inspectorate, which consists of a Chief Inspector and ten inspectors, is tasked with checking the work of the judiciary without infringing the independence of judges, prosecutors or investigators (Article 132a § 6). It can act either of its own motion or pursuant to reports by private individuals, legal persons or State authorities (Article 132a § 7). It has the power to refer matters to the appropriate authorities, or make suggestions or reports to them (Article 132a § 9). Both the Chief Inspector and the inspectors are elected by Parliament by a majority of two thirds; the term of office of the Chief Inspector is five years and that of the inspectors is four years (Article 132a §§ 2 and 3). 48. The manner of election and dismissal of the inspectors is laid down in sections 4253 of the Judiciary Act 2007 (“the 2007 Act”). They must be lawyers having high professional and moral qualities (section 42(1)). The Chief Inspector must have at least fifteen years of professional experience, and the inspectors at least twelve years of professional experience (section 42(2) and (3)). They cannot engage in a number of activities – such as business or being member of a political party – that might prejudice their independence (section 43 read in conjunction with section 18(1)). They may be dismissed before the expiry of their term of office only if they resign, are finally convicted of a criminal offence, are unable to carry out their duties for more than one year, are deprived of the right to exercise as a lawyer, heavily or systematically breach their duties or commit acts which tarnish the prestige of the judiciary, or do not cease activities that they are prohibited from pursuing while in office (section 48(1)). The proposal for dismissal must be made by at least onefifth of the members of Parliament (section 48(2)). The remuneration of the Chief Inspector is equal to that of a section president of the Supreme Court of Cassation, and the remuneration of the inspectors is equal to that of a judge of that court (section 51). 49. On 6 April 2012 the Government laid before Parliament a bill for the amendment of the 2007 Act. The explanatory notes to the bill said the following: “Slow judicial proceedings lead to an enormous amount of judgments of the European Court of Human Rights against Bulgaria. In its judgments concerning the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time the European Court of Human Rights (‘the ECtHR’) emphasises the need for the introduction of an effective domestic remedy in respect of such breaches. With a view to securing the effective exercise of the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time, in its case-law the ECtHR points to the need to introduce a remedy capable of providing compensation for damage resulting from delays in proceedings (compensatory remedy). The systemic problem found by the ECtHR in relation to the excessive duration of criminal and civil cases in the Republic of Bulgaria calls for urgent legislative measures to introduce the remedies suggested by the European Court. With a view to the effective use of the available resources, it is expedient to give the power to find a breach and set compensation to an existing authority with similar competences. In view of the constitutional function of the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council to check the work of the judiciary (Article 132a § 6 of the Constitution) and more specifically its power under section 54(1)(2) of the Judiciary Act [2007] to check the processing of court, prosecutors’ and investigation cases and their completion within the prescribed time-limits, the bill envisages the creation of a special unit attached to the Inspectorate. That special unit will examine and decide complaints relating to breaches concerning the unreasonable length of completed civil, administrative and criminal cases, as well as discontinued pre-trial proceedings. An important premise for laying down the procedure in such a way is the Inspectorate’s constitutional obligation to carry out checks pursuant to reports by private individuals and legal persons (Article 132a § 7 of the Constitution). The right to complain is open to all persons who may suffer damage as a result of delays in proceedings: parties to judicial proceedings (civil, administrative and criminal) or persons subjected to the pre-trial phase of criminal proceedings (accused, victims and wronged legal persons). The envisaged procedure will be a light (simple) way of obtaining redress. The complainant will not have to produce evidence – it will be gathered by the checking panel of their own motion; no fees will be due; the proceedings will finish in six months with a settlement, which will ensure fast payment of the compensation. Since the proposed procedure envisages a light and fast mode of redress, there is a cap on the maximum amount of compensation. This cap conforms with the ECtHR’s case-law on the amount of compensation awarded in past cases. The transitional and concluding provisions allow the procedure to be applied in respect of complaints already lodged through the ECtHR. The compensatory remedy has to have retrospective effect, so as to be available to persons who have become victim of excessive length of proceedings even before the coming of the Act into force, including those who have lodged applications with the ECtHR, if that court has not yet ruled on the admissibility of those applications. The creation of an effective domestic remedy will ensure a drastic reduction of the number of applications to the ECtHR and will thus lead to less judgments finding a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.” 50. The bill underwent its first reading on 10 May 2012, and its second reading on 7 June 2012, when it was adopted. The Act was published in the State Gazette on 3 July 2012. It inserted a new Chapter 3a in the 2007 Act. The Chapter is entitled “Examination of applications against breaches of the right to examination and determination of the case within a reasonable time” and consists of twelve sections. The newly introduced provisions, the bulk of which came into force on 1 October 2012, read as follows: 60a. (1) This chapter applies to applications by individuals and legal persons against decisions, actions or omissions of judicial authorities which infringe their right to have their cases examined and decided within a reasonable time. (2) Applications under subsection 1 shall be lodged by individuals and legal persons who are: 1. parties to finished civil, administrative or criminal proceedings; 2. accused, victims or wronged legal persons in discontinued pretrial proceedings; (3) This chapter set out the manner of determining and paying compensation in line with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights not amounting to more than 10,000 levs. (4) Applications under subsection 1 shall be lodged within six months after the conclusion of the proceedings at issue with a final decision, though the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council to the Minister of Justice. (5) A special register shall be created for the applications, and it shall be published on the internet site of the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council. (6) No fees shall be due for the examination of applications under this chapter. 60b. (1) The application must be written in Bulgarian and set out: 1. for Bulgarian nationals – their names as featuring in the identification documents; uniform citizen number and address; telephone, fax and electronic address, if any; 2. for foreigners – their names as featuring in the identification documents; uniform foreigner number and address; telephone, fax and electronic address, if any; 3. the commercial firm of the trader or the name of the legal person, written in Bulgarian; the seat and the latest registered address and electronic address; 4. the decision, action or omission alleged to amount to a breach by the respective authority; 5. the authority to which the application is addressed; 6. the request for relief; 7. the applicant’s signature. (2) Applicants shall submit a declaration that they have not sought or obtained compensation in respect of the same breach in other proceedings. 60c. (1) Applications under section 60a(1) shall be examined by the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, which shall set up a special unit for this purpose. (2) The experts staffing the unit shall be lawyers who have at least five years of professional experience. Their remuneration shall be equal to that of a district court judge. (3) The chief inspector shall allocate incoming applications to panels consisting of one inspector and two experts, randomly selected, and one of the experts shall be appointed as rapporteur. (4) If the application does not meet the requirements of section 60b(1) or (2), the applicant shall be given notice to rectify the deficiencies within seven days of receiving the notice. (5) If the applicant does not rectify the deficiencies, the application and the supporting documents shall be returned. 60d. (1) The results of the examination shall be noted down in a record of findings. (2) That record shall be signed by the members of the panel and shall contain information about: 1. the time and place where and when it has been drawn up; 2. the applicant; 3. the panel which has examined the application; 4. the case in respect of which it is being drawn up; 5. the overall duration of the proceedings; the period of delay attributable to the competent authority; the period of delay attributable to actions or omissions of the complainant or his legal or procedural representative; (3) The record of findings shall also set out the view of the panel as to whether the time-limit under section 60a(4) has been met. 60e. The record of findings under section 60d shall be drawn up within four months of receipt of the application or the rectification of its deficiencies, as the case may be. The record, along with the application and all supporting documents, shall be sent immediately to the Minister of Justice. 60f. (1) Based on the findings of the panel, the Minister of Justice or a person authorised by him or her shall reject the application as unfounded if 1. the length of the proceedings has not exceeded a reasonable time; 2. the delay is due to actions or omissions of the applicant or his legal or procedural representative. (2) If the right of the applicant to have his or her case examined and decided within a reasonable time has been breached, the Minister of Justice or a person authorised by him or her shall fix the amount of compensation in line with the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights and shall propose the conclusion of a settlement with the applicant. 60g. The underlying circumstances shall be examined and the application shall be determined within six months of the application’s receipt. 60h. Compensation shall be paid on the basis of the concluded settlement. 60i. The funds required for the payment of sums under concluded settlements shall be covered by the republican budget. 60j. (1) Compensation due under this chapter shall be paid out of the budget of the Ministry of Justice. (2) Each quarter the Minister of Finance shall make available to the budget of the Ministry of Justice funds matching the compensations actually paid under subsection 1 during that quarter through a modification of the budgetary arrangements with the central State budget. 60k. Persons who have received compensation under this chapter may not seek compensation in respect of the same matter by way of civil proceedings. 60l. (1) Every quarter the chief inspector shall send to the Supreme Judicial Council information about breaches found, and Minister of Justice – about compensations paid out. (2) Every six months the Supreme Judicial Council shall analyse the reasons for the breaches and shall take measures to eliminate them. (3) The Supreme Judicial Council shall publish on its internet site the information under subsections 1 and 2. 51. Paragraphs 34 and 35 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the amending Act provide as follows: 34. (1) Within six months of the entry into force of Chapter 3a or of notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons who have lodged with the European Court of Human Rights applications concerning breaches of their right to have their cases examined and decided within a reasonable time may submit applications under Chapter 3a, except in cases where the Court has already given judgment on the merits of the application or has rejected the application as inadmissible. (2) Applications under subparagraph 1 shall be examined within eighteen months of their receipt. 35. To ensure the application of Chapter 3a in 2012 the Council of Ministers shall make available additional funds in the budgets of the Judiciary and the Ministry of Justice. 52. In a decision of 11 September 2012 that came into effect on 18 September 2012 (Постановление № 209 от 11 септември 2012 г. за одобряване на допълнителни бюджетни кредити по бюджета на съдебната власт и по бюджета на Министерството на правосъдието за 2012 г.), the Council of Ministers increased the budget of the judiciary with 300,000 Bulgarian levs earmarked for the creation, in the Inspectorate attached to the Supreme Judicial Council, of the special unit dealing with applications under Chapter 3a of the 2007 Act (point 1(1) of the decision). 53. In September 2012 the Inspectorate appointed a number of officials and assigned them to the special unit dealing with applications under Chapter 3a of the 2007 Act. On 1 October 2012 the Inspectorate published on its website an application form and a sample declaration under section 60b(2) of the 2007 Act (see paragraph 50 above). It later put on its website software allowing applicants to lodge applications electronically and track their progress online. 54. On 23 July 2012 the Government laid before Parliament a bill for the amendment of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”). The explanatory notes to the bill said the following: “An analysis of the judgments in which the European Court of Human Rights has found violations in respect of Bulgaria shows that there are repetitive violations due to the lack of an effective domestic remedy allowing those concerned to obtain redress. More specifically, there is a need to create a domestic remedy allowing those concerned to obtain compensation for damage resulting from a breach of the [Convention] made by the State or its authorities or officials. The Court’s finding that the law of the Republic of Bulgaria does not make provision for such a remedy calls for its creation through an expansion of the ambit of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act [1988]. This will overcome the prior approach – to provide for liability only in specific circumstances – which has led to many violation judgments of [the Court] against Bulgaria. For that purpose, it is proposed to make the following amendments and additions to the Act: ... 2. The proposal to insert a new section 2b seeks to broaden the ambit of the Act, so that it embrace also cases of ‘delayed justice’. Under the pilot judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Finger [cited above] (which concerns civil cases) and the joined cases of Dimitrov and Hamanov [cited above] (which concern criminal cases), which find breaches of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the Bulgarian authorities must, within twelve months (until 10 August 2012) put in place a mechanism to resolve the systemic problem concerning the ‘reasonable time’ of proceedings. The envisaged amendments create a mechanism for the compensation of damage. Individuals and legal persons whose right to have their cases examined and decided within a reasonable time been breached may bring claims under section 2b only if they have exhausted the administrative procedure for obtaining compensation under Chapter 3a of the Judiciary Act [2007] but have not reached a settlement. At the same time, in cases of separate breaches occurring in one and the same proceedings, the fact that a person has brought a claim in respect of one breach does not prevent him or her from seeking compensation in respect of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time in cases where the overall length of the proceedings has been excessive. 3. ... As regards claims for compensation in respect of breaches of the right to have one’s case examined and decided within a reasonable time, [the amendments] envisage that such claims, in view of their character and subject matter, shall be examined by the court having local jurisdiction in the place where the aggrieved person has his or her current address or its seat. 4. It is proposed to insert transitional provisions under which, within six months of the entry into force of the Act or of notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons whose applications to [that Court] have been rejected due to failure to exhaust the newly created domestic remedies, and whose proceedings are still pending before the national courts, may also bring claims for compensation under section 2b. In respect of proceedings which have already ended at the national level, within six months of the entry into force of the Act or of notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons whose applications to [that Court] have been rejected due to failure to exhaust the newly created domestic remedies may lodge applications for compensation under Chapter 3a of the Judiciary Act [2007]. Persons whose national pretrial or judicial proceedings have ended at the time when the Act comes into force, and less than six months have elapsed since the final decision, shall also have the right to lodge applications for compensation under Chapter 3a of the Judiciary Act [2007] within six months of the Act’s entry into force. The bill reflects the proposals of nongovernmental organisations, the European Court of Human Rights’ caselaw, and the recommendations of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers, and with it the Republic of Bulgaria shall fulfil its duties of State Party to the [Convention].” 55. The bill underwent its first reading on 26 September 2012 and its second reading on 28 November 2012, when it was adopted. The amending Act was published in the State Gazette on 11 December 2012 and came into force on 15 December 2012. It amended a number of provisions of the 1988 Act. In particular, it inserted a new section 2b, which is entitled “Liability of the judicial authorities for breaches of the right to have one’s case examined and decided within a reasonable time” and reads as follows: “1. The State shall be liable for damage caused to individuals or legal persons by breaches of the right to have one’s case examined and decided within a reasonable time, in accordance with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 2. Claims under subsection 1 shall be examined in the manner provided by the Code of Civil Procedure [2007], and the court shall take into account the overall duration and the subject matter of the proceedings, their factual and legal complexity, the conduct of the parties and their procedural or legal representatives, the conduct of the other participants in the proceedings and of the competent authorities, as well as other facts which have a bearing on the proper determination of the dispute. 3. The bringing of a claim for damages in respect of pending proceedings shall not preclude the bringing of a fresh claim after the proceedings have come to end.” 56. A new section 7(2) provides that claims for compensation under section 2b are to be brought in the court in whose region the aggrieved person has his or her current address or seat. 57. A new section 8(2) provides that individuals or legal persons may bring claims under section 2b(1) in respect of proceedings which have ended only if they have already exhausted the administrative procedure under Chapter 3a of the 2007 Act (see paragraph 50 above) but that procedure has not resulted in a settlement. 58. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the amending Act provide as follows: “8. (1) Within six months of the entry into force of this Act or of notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons whose applications to the European Court of Human Rights have been rejected due to failure to exhaust the newly created domestic remedies, and whose proceedings are still pending before the national courts, may also bring claims for compensation under section 2b. (2) Within six months of the entry into force of this Act or of notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons whose applications to the European Court of Human Rights have been rejected due to failure to exhaust the newly created domestic remedies, and whose proceedings at national level have already ended, may lodge applications for compensation under Chapter 3a of the [2007 Act]. 9. Persons whose national pretrial or judicial proceedings have ended at the time when this Act comes into force, and less than six months have elapsed since the final decision, shall also have the right to lodge applications for compensation under Chapter 3a of the [2007 Act] within six months of this Act’s entry into force.” 59. Section 4 of the 1988 Act provides that the State is liable for all pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage which is a direct and proximate result of the impugned act, action or omission. However, the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court have held that legal persons, such as commercial companies, cannot suffer nonpecuniary damage and are not entitled to compensation for such damage (see опр. № 271 от 19 март 2010 г. по гр. д. № 8/2010 г., ВКС, III г. о., and реш. № 7861 от 6 юни 2011 г. по адм. д. № 3689/2011 г., ВАС, III о.). 60. Section 9a(1) of the Act, which was inserted in April 2008 and came into force in May 2008, provides that the fee due in respect of cases under the Act is flat and is to be fixed in a tariff adopted by the Government. Under the Tariff of fees collected by the courts under the Code of Civil Procedure, as currently in force, the fee is BGN 10 in respect of firstinstance proceedings, BGN 5 in respect of appellate proceedings, and BGN 5 in respect of cassation proceedings. The fee is payable upfront (see опр. № 12420 от 4 октомври 2011 г. по адм. д. № 12302/2011 г., ВАС, III о.). 61. Section 10(2) of the Act, as worded after May 2008, provides that if the claim is rejected in full, the court must order the claimant to pay the costs of the proceedings. The claimant must also pay those costs if he or she withdraws the claim in its entirety. 62. Section 10(3) of the Act, which was also inserted in April 2008 and came into force in May 2008, provides that if a claim under the Act is allowed fully or in part, the court is to order the defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings and to reimburse the court fee paid by the claimant. The defendant must also pay the claimant the fee of one counsel, if the claimant had retained counsel, pro rata the allowed part of the claim. 63. In their caselaw under section 10(2) and (3), the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court have held that it is a lex specialis in relation to the general rules on costs in the Code of Civil Procedure, and that in the case of a partly rejected claim the defendant authority is not entitled to costs (see опр. № 12023 от 18 октомври 2010 г. по адм. д. № 11620/2010 г., ВАС, I о.; реш. № 785 от 2 март 2011 г. по гр. д. № 556/2010 г. ВКС, III г. о.; and опр. № 525 от 13 октомври 2011 г. по ч. гр. д. № 531/2011 г., ВКС, III г. о.). 64. Article 172 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, superseded on 1 March 2008 by Article 216 § 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007, which is couched in identical terms, provided that when on account of the character of the right in dispute the court’s ruling had to be the same in relation to all coclaimants or codefendants, they were regarded as mandatory coclaimants or codefendants (необходими другари) and the procedural steps taken by one of them produced effects in respect of all of them. 65. Article 519 of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007 provides as follows: “1. The enforcement of money claims against State bodies and municipalities is not allowed. 2. Money claims against State bodies and municipalities shall be paid out of funds allotted for that purpose in their budgets. For this purpose, the writ of execution shall be presented to the financial department of the [State] body in issue. If no funds have been allocated, the higher [State] body shall take the necessary measures to provide such funds at the latest in the next budget.” 66. In March 2010 the Ombudsman of the Republic challenged that provision before the Constitutional Court. He argued, inter alia, that it fell foul of several Articles of the 1991 Constitution, Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 22 April 2010 the Constitutional Court, noting that under Article 150 § 3 of the 1991 Constitution the Ombudsman was not entitled to seek from the Constitutional Court declarations that statutes are contrary to international treaties to which Bulgaria is party, declared the request admissible in so far as the allegations of unconstitutionality were concerned and inadmissible in so far as the allegations of lack of compliance with the Convention and its Protocol were concerned. In a judgment of 21 December 2010 (реш. № 15 от 21 декември 2010 г. по к. д. № 9/2010 г., обн. ДВ, бр. 5/2011 г.), the Constitutional Court refused to declare Article 519 unconstitutional in so far as it concerns State bodies, but declared it unconstitutional in so far as it concerns municipalities. 67. The Committee of Ministers examined the amendments to the 2007 and the 1988 Acts at its 1150th meeting, held on 2426 September 2012. Based on an information document drawn up by the Department for the Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (CM/Inf/DH(2012)27), the Committee adopted the following decision: “The Deputies 1. took note with interest of the revised action report submitted by the authorities on 30/07/2012 presenting the introduction of an administrative compensatory remedy in the field of excessive length of proceedings, as well as of a draft bill for the introduction of a judicial compensatory remedy in this field; 2. approved the assessment of the administrative remedy and of the draft judicial remedy contained in information document CM/Inf/DH(2012)27 and invited the Bulgarian authorities to provide clarifications as concerns outstanding questions identified in this information document; 3. invited the Bulgarian authorities to adopt rapidly the proposed judicial remedy and to amend the provision governing the retrospective effect of the administrative remedy in order to take into account the requirements of the Court in this respect; 4. decided to declassify information document CM/Inf/DH(2012)27; 5. decided to resume consideration of these cases, including the question of the measures aimed at reducing the length of the judicial proceedings, during one of their next Human Rights meetings and invited the authorities to provide additional information also on this question.” 68. The Committee of Ministers again examined the amendments at its 1157th meeting, held on 46 December 2012. Based on an information document drawn up by the Department for the Execution of Judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (CM/Inf/DH(2012)36), the Committee adopted the following decision: “The Deputies As regards the effective remedies required in this field: 1. recalled their decision adopted during their 1150th meeting (DH) (September 2012) according to which the administrative compensatory remedy recently adopted by the authorities and the judicial compensatory remedy proposed in the field of length of proceedings, taken together, seem capable of meeting the main requirements of the caselaw of the Court; 2. noted with satisfaction the adoption by the Bulgarian Parliament, on 28 November 2012, of the legislative amendments aimed at introducing the abovementioned judicial remedy; noted in this respect that according to the information submitted, the adopted provisions are identical to those already assessed by the Committee, except for those relating to the competent courts; invited the authorities to keep the Committee informed about the entry into force of the adopted provisions and to provide it with their translation; 3. noted with interest the explanations provided by the Bulgarian authorities in relation to some outstanding questions identified in Information document CM/Inf/DH(2012)27, in particular their intention to modify the provision governing the retrospective effect of the administrative remedy in order to ensure its compliance with the requirements of the Court in this respect; invited them to reply to the other outstanding questions contained in Information document CM/Inf/DH(2012)36, namely as concerns the functioning of the administrative compensatory remedy; ... 7. invited the authorities to reply to the other outstanding questions identified in Information document CM/Inf/DH(2012)36 and decided to declassify it.” 69. The information document forming the base for this decision (CM/Inf/DH(2012)36) was drawn up on 27 November 2012 and reads as follows: “... I. Compensatory remedies elaborated in response to the pilot judgments A. Presentation of the adopted administrative compensatory remedy 1. Positive aspects of the administrative compensatory remedy 1. The [2007] Act provides that applications for compensation in respect of excessive length of proceedings are to be addressed to the Minister of Justice through the Supreme Judicial Council’s Inspectorate. When examining these claims, the Minister (or a person authorised by him or her) is assisted by a panel made up of an Inspector and two experts working in a special unit of that Inspectorate. The timelimit for the examination of applications is six months. The procedure is free of charge for the claimants. 2. The applications are to be directed ‘against acts, actions or omissions of judicial authorities’, breaching the right to have a case heard and decided within a reasonable time. The authorities have indicated that this wording would not preclude the examination of applications concerning delays that do not stem from omissions by individual judges or judicial officers but, for instance, from an overburdening of the judicial system as a whole. 3. The criteria which must be taken into account when examining applications are the overall length of the proceedings, the delays attributable to the authorities, as well as the delays attributable to the applicant and his representative ([s]ection 60d(2)(5)). The merits of the application and the amount of compensation are to be determined in light of the Court’s caselaw. 4. The compensation is to be paid out of the budget of the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Finance must then restore to the budget of the Ministry of Justice the funds paid as compensation each quarter. Assessment: 5. The law governing the administrative remedy imposes on the authority competent to examine applications for compensation the obligation to take into account the overall length of the proceedings and the conduct of the parties and of the competent authorities, in line with the Court’s caselaw. The legal or factual complexity of the case and the stakes involved in the dispute are not mentioned explicitly, but the general reference to the Court’s case-law should be enough to cause them to be taken into account as well. The new provisions also seem to take into account the caselaw of the Court as to, inter alia, the promptness of the examination, the absence of charges for the introduction of a claim and the existence of specific budgetary provisions. In conclusion, this administrative remedy takes into account, to a very large extent, the criteria used by the Court for the assessment of the excessive length of proceedings. 2. Questions raised by the administrative compensatory remedy 6. The administrative remedy put in place raises a number of questions, namely: (a) the fact that it does not apply to proceedings which are pending, (b) the wording of the provision governing the retrospective effect of the remedy and (c) the compliance of the remedy with the institutional requirements of Article 13 of the Convention, (d) the compensation ceiling and (e) the payment of compensation. In this respect, it should be recalled that the Court has constantly indicated in its caselaw that even if a particular remedy does not fully satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies under domestic law may satisfy these requirements. Therefore, the questions raised by this remedy and its weaknesses may be examined also in the light of the judicial compensatory remedy adopted at first reading by the Bulgarian Parliament (for a detailed presentation of the judicial remedy, see paragraphs 2237 below). (a) Inapplicability of the administrative remedy to proceedings which are still pending 7. The administrative remedy provides that only parties to completed judicial and pre-trial proceedings are entitled to introduce applications for compensation within six months of the end of the proceedings in question. If the proceedings are still pending, the parties have to wait for them to end in order to submit a claim to the Minister of Justice, whatever the delays already accumulated. In contrast, it appears from the information presented by the Bulgarian authorities that the proposed judicial remedy for length of proceedings would also be applicable to proceedings which are still pending. Assessment: 8. It should be recalled that the Court has already held that the impossibility to use a remedy against the excessive length of proceedings which are still pending may render such a remedy ineffective. It should also be recalled that the pilot judgments require the introduction, within the timelimit set in the operative part of the judgments, of a remedy that fully complies with the Court’s caselaw. It thus appears that the introduction of just an administrative remedy with limited scope is not sufficient to ensure the full execution of the pilot judgments. This lacuna could, however, be overcome by the introduction, without delay, of a judicial remedy which fully complies with the requirements of the Court’s caselaw, as the Bulgarian authorities seem to have foreseen. (b) Wording of the provision governing the retrospective effect of the remedy 9. Paragraph 34(1) of the transitional provisions of the [2007 Act], which concerns the retrospective effect of the new remedy, is worded as follows (emphasis added): ‘Within six months of the entry into force of Chapter 3a or notification by the Registry of the European Court of Human Rights, persons who have lodged with the European Court of Human Rights applications concerning breaches of their right to have their cases examined and decided within a reasonable time may submit applications under Chapter 3a, except in cases where the Court has already given judgment on the merits of the application or has rejected the application as inadmissible.’ Assessment: 10. The current wording of paragraph 34 suggests that the new remedy will not be available to applicants whose applications are declared inadmissible by the Court, and this without making the distinction between the different grounds of inadmissibility. This provision should therefore be amended in order to indicate clearly that it will be available to persons whose applications, introduced before its adoption, are declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies. Thus, if the Court confirms the effectiveness of the new remedy or of the aggregate of new remedies, it will be able to declare inadmissible the applications pending before it for non-exhaustion of this remedy/these remedies and the applicants concerned will be able to introduce their applications for compensation at the domestic level. The authorities have indicated that this provision will be amended in the near future in order to ensure that applicants whose applications have been declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies will be able to use effectively this new remedy at the domestic level. Information is awaited on the timetable for the adoption of this amendment. (c) Compliance of the remedy with the institutional requirements of Article 13 of the Convention 11. The new provisions of the [2007] Act describe in considerable detail the procedure for the examination of applications for compensation for excessive length of proceedings. The relevant facts for the examination of a complaint concerning excessive length of proceedings are to be established by a panel of one Inspector from the Supreme Judicial Council’s Inspectorate and two experts working in a special unit of this Inspectorate. This panel communicates its findings to the Minister or to the person whom he or she has authorised to act on his or her behalf. 12. If the Minister of Justice or the person designated by him or her finds that the reasonable-time requirement has not been breached, he or she has to reject the application. If the Minister or the person designated by him or her finds, on the contrary, that the reasonable-time requirement has been breached, he or she has to fix the amount of compensation in line with the Court’s case-law and propose a settlement to the claimant. Claimants who have accepted the settlement and have obtained compensation under that procedure cannot claim compensation in judicial proceedings. 13. The [2007] Act does not contain specific provisions concerning a possible judicial review of the decisions rejecting applications or proposing a settlement. Assessment: 14. It should be recalled that the authority to which Article 13 refers does not need to be a judicial one for a remedy to be considered effective under the Court’s caselaw. However, the effectiveness of the remedy before that authority is assessed by reference to the guarantees that it affords (see, among other authorities, Leander [v.] Sweden, 26 March 1987, § 77, Series A No. 116). In particular, the decisionmaking body needs to have a ‘sufficiently independent standpoint’ (see, among other authorities, Silver and [O]thers [v.] the United Kingdom, 25 March 1983, § 116, Series A No. 61). It should also be noted that the Court requires in principle that the authority in charge of the implementation of a domestic remedy be able to come up with a ‘legally binding decision’, some element of enforceability being generally required (see, among other authorities, Leander, cited above, § 82). As said above, the caselaw also indicates that even if a single remedy does not fully satisfy the requirements of Article 13, the aggregate of remedies under domestic law may do so (see, among other authorities, Leander, cited above, § 77). 15. In the light of the information currently available, it is not clearly established whether the new administrative procedure under the [2007] Act can be regarded as providing alone the required ‘element of enforceability’ and sufficient ‘independence’. However, for the reasons set out below, if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay, the aggregate of remedies could in principle meet the institutional requirements of Article 13. 16. According to the authorities, the settlements proposed by the Minister of Justice should be considered as legally binding decisions, because under the [2007]Act, as amended, the Minister of Finance has to guarantee to the Ministry of Justice funds up to the amounts paid in compensation to claimants. However, a question remains whether the decision of the Minister of Justice taken on applications for compensation, whether positive or negative, can be considered to have itself a legally binding effect in cases in which no settlement has been concluded. In any event, according to the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act] (aiming at the introduction of a judicial remedy), unsuccessful claimants in the procedure before the Minister of Justice and claimants who have refused to conclude a settlement, will have the right to request compensation in the context of judicial proceedings (see paragraphs 29 and 30 below).Thus, it seems that – if the foreseen judicial remedy is adopted – in the absence of a settlement the claim could be resolved by a final and legally binding decision in the context of judicial proceedings. 17. As to the issue of independence of the decisionmaking body, it should be recalled that, in a case against the Czech Republic, the Court accepted that an administrative remedy was effective because the persons who were not satisfied with the decision of the Ministry of Justice on their applications for compensation could seek compensation in the context of judicial proceedings (see Vokurka [v.] the Czech Republic (dec.), No. 40552/02, § 60, 16 October 2007). Thus, if only an administrative remedy is introduced, the availability of judicial review of the decisions of the Minister of Justice may prove crucial for the remedy to meet the institutional requirements of the Court’s caselaw. By contrast, if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay as foreseen by the Bulgarian authorities, the aggregate of the two remedies could in principle meet the institutional requirements of Article 13, even in the absence of judicial review of the minister’s decisions. (d) Compensation ceiling 18. The [2007 Act] provides that compensation cannot exceed 10,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) (5,112.92 euros (EUR)). Assessment: 19. As concerns the abovementioned compensation ceiling, there may be situations in which that sum will fall short of the amounts awarded in compensation by the Court. That said sums of up to EUR 5 112.92 appear sufficient, in the light of the Court’s judgments against Bulgaria concerning length of proceedings, to compensate adequately the nonpecuniary damage arising in the majority of cases concerning excessive length of proceedings in Bulgaria. Moreover, if an effective judicial remedy is introduced without delay as foreseen by the Bulgarian authorities, the aggregate of newly introduced remedies would normally be sufficient to provide an adequate level of compensation in all situations, as the draft law concerning the introduction of judicial remedy does not provide for a compensation ceiling. (e) Timelimit and procedure for payment of compensation 20. The [2007] Act makes provision for a specific funding mechanism for the payment of compensations for excessive length of procedure (see paragraph 4 above). It does not seem to contain any specific provisions concerning the procedure for payment of compensation. In their reply to the questions identified in the memorandum CM/Inf/DH(2012)27 (see DHDD(2012)977), the authorities indicated that budgetary funds and other measures have been foreseen in order to avoid delays in the payment of compensation. Assessment: 21. The Court’s caselaw requires that payment should normally be made not later than six months after a judgment or a decision in that respect has become enforceable. Given the importance attached by the Court to this requirement, it seems useful to provide the Committee with detailed information on the payment procedure and on the timelimits in which the payments are made in practice. B. Presentation of the proposed judicial remedy 22. The following presentation is based on the translation of the draft bill for the amendment of the 1988 Act presented by the Bulgarian authorities on 30/07/2012 (see DHDD(2012)732). The judicial remedy adopted at first reading by the Bulgarian Parliament seems to comply in principle with the main requirements of the Court’s case-law in the field of compensatory remedies for excessive length of proceedings. However, some clarifications still seem necessary. (a) Scope of the remedy 23. Section 2b of the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act] provides that the State is responsible for damages caused to persons and legal entities through breaches, by the judicial authorities, of the right enshrined in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention to have their cases examined and resolved within a reasonable time. The claims have to be examined under the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court have to take into account the legal and factual complexity of the case, the conduct of the claimant, the conduct of the other parties and participants in the proceedings and the conduct of the competent authorities, the stakes involved in the dispute, as well as the overall length of the proceedings. The introduction of a claim for damages while the proceedings are still pending is not an obstacle to introducing a claim for damages after the end of these proceedings. The authorities have confirmed that the scope of the judicial remedy comprises the actions of the prosecutors and the investigating magistrates, as well as the actions of the police investigators (to which makes reference paragraph 9 of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act]). 24. As concerns the question of the applicability of the judicial remedy to the procedures concerning execution of court decisions, it should be noted that the majority of the execution proceedings in Bulgaria are conducted by private bailiffs whose civil responsibility can be engaged in a case of damage caused by their activity. As far as the public bailiffs are concerned, although their status is governed by the [2007] Act, they are not magistrates. Therefore, it is not clear whether their actions are covered or not by the scope of the proposed judicial remedy. Assessment: 25. The scope of the proposed judicial remedy seems to comply with the relevant requirements of the Court’s caselaw. The draft Section 2b refers to breaches of the reasonable time requirement attributable to the judicial authorities. Although this provision does not mention explicitly the delays caused by the police investigators, the Bulgarian authorities have indicated that the delays which have occurred at the stage of the preliminary investigation and are attributable to the police investigators will fall within the scope of the judicial remedy. It would be useful to clarify whether this is so also in respect of the actions of the public bailiffs responsible for the execution of a court decision. (b) Procedure according to which a claim should be examined: length and applicable court fees 26. The draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act] provides that claims will be examined under the rules of the Code of Civil Procedure [2007]. Under Bulgarian law, a civil dispute can be examined by three levels of jurisdiction. 27. Under the provisions of [s]ection 10 of the [1988 Act], a flatrate court fee is due to file a claim under the Act which is either BGN 10 for physical persons or BGN 25 for legal persons (EUR 5.12 or EUR 12.82). The claimants must pay all the costs incurred in the proceedings only if their claim has been entirely rejected or if they withdraw or waive their claim entirely. If the court decides in favour of the claim, in whole or in part, the defendant should be ordered to pay the costs relating to the proceedings, as well as the claimant’s court fees. If a claim is granted only in part, the claimant receives only partial reimbursement of the lawyer’s fees. The authorities have specified that according to domestic caselaw, if a claim is partially rejected, the claimant should not be required to pay the part of the lawyer’s fees incurred by the defendant. Assessment: 28. One of the principles set out in the pilot judgments is that a claim for compensation must be examined within a reasonable time. The Court suggested in this respect that ‘consideration may be given to subjecting the examination of such claims to special rules that differ from those governing ordinary claims for damages, to avert the risk that, if examined under the general rules of civil procedure, the remedy may not be sufficiently swift’. However, the introduction of such special rules was not set out as a requirement for the effectiveness of the future remedy or aggregate of remedies. Therefore, the absence of such special rules does not per se put into question the efficiency of the proposed judicial remedy. Moreover, the adopted administrative remedy, if correctly implemented, could provide swift redress to many potential claimants. 29. As concerns the requirement set out in the pilot judgments that the rules governing costs must not place an excessive burden on litigants where their claim is justified, it seems that, even if a claim has been partly rejected, successful claimants could not be required to pay costs relating to the proceedings and the part of the lawyer’s fees incurred by the defendant and that their court fees are to be reimbursed. (c) Need to exhaust the administrative remedy in some situations 30. Parties to completed judicial proceedings will need to exhaust the administrative remedy before introducing a judicial claim. According to [s]ection 8(2) of the draft bill for the amendment of the 1988 Act, the judicial remedy is not available to claimants who have concluded a settlement in the administrative procedure. Assessment: 31. As said above, one of the principles set out in the pilot judgments is that a claim for compensation must be examined within a reasonable time. It seems that the requirement for a certain category of claimants to exhaust the administrative remedy before introducing a judicial remedy will not have a considerable impact on the promptness of the compensation process as a whole, because it seems that the administrative phase could be very short (cf. the sixmonth’ timelimit for the examination of applications, paragraph 1 above). (d) Retrospective effect 32. Paragraph 8(2) of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act] provides that persons whose applications have been rejected by the Court on the ground of nonexhaustion of the newly introduced domestic remedies and who have been parties in completed judicial proceedings will be able to introduce administrative applications for compensation within six months of the entry into force of the amendments or within six months of the notification by the Registry of the Court. Under the same conditions, applicants to the Court who have seen their application rejected for nonexhaustion of the domestic remedies and who are parties in pending proceedings at the domestic level will be able to introduce judicial claims for compensation. 33. According to paragraph 9 of the transitional and final provisions of the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act], parties to proceedings which have been completed less than six months before the entry into force of the draft bill will also have access to the judicial remedy. Assessment: 34. The provisions concerning the scope of the retrospective effect of the proposed judicial remedy seem to comply with the recommendations given by the Court under Article 46 in the pilot judgments. (e) Timelimit and procedure for payment of compensation 35. Unlike the [2007] Act, the draft bill for the amendment of the [1988 Act] does not seem to provide for specific budgetary provisions concerning the payment of compensations for excessive length of proceedings. In their response to the questions identified in the memorandum CM/Inf/DH(2012)27 (see DHDD(2012)977), the authorities indicated that it is foreseen that the amendments to the [1988 Act] will be accompanied by the provision of budgetary funds to the institutions concerned. 36. It seems that according to the relevant budgetary rules, the payment of compensation granted in the event of successful claim against a court/the prosecution should be made out of the budget of the court in question/of the prosecution. Likewise, Article 250 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that persons who have financial claims against public institutions have to submit the writ of execution to the institution’s financial department in order to receive payment. Payments are made out of the funds earmarked for that purpose in the institution’s budget. If there are no funds available, a budgetary provision for this purpose should be made available the following year. Assessment: 37. As said above in paragraph 21, the Court’s caselaw requires that payment should normally be made not later than six months after a judgment or a decision in that respect has become enforceable. Given the importance attached by the Court to this requirement, it seems useful to provide the Committee, in due time, with information on the exact content of the budgetary provisions taken by the authorities in order to ensure the funding of compensations for excessive length of proceedings and on any other measure aimed at avoiding late payment of compensation. ... Conclusion 65. In the light of the information available, it seems that the administrative remedy which entered into force on [1 October 2012] represents a very positive step forward towards the execution of the pilot judgments of the Court. This remedy does not in itself comply with all the requirements of the Convention, but most of the outstanding questions could be addressed by the proposed judicial remedy in the field of excessive length of proceedings, if the latter is adopted without delay. Thus, it seems that the aggregate of these two remedies could in principle comply with the main requirements of the Court’s caselaw. Therefore, it seems useful to invite the Bulgarian authorities to adopt without delay the judicial remedy proposed and to encourage them to take the necessary measures in order to ensure for themselves that the new remedies will be applied in compliance with this case-law. Likewise, it seems useful to encourage the authorities to continue with their works regarding the introduction of a remedy which allows requesting the acceleration of the criminal proceedings. ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
101,001-67632,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,NORWOOD v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Mark Anthony Norwood, is a United Kingdom national who was born in 1962 and lives in a village near Oswestry, Shropshire. He was represented before the Court by Mr K. Lowry-Mullins, a lawyer practising in London. The applicant was a Regional Organiser for the British National Party (“BNP”: an extreme right wing political party). Between November 2001 and 9 January 2002 he displayed in the window of his first-floor flat a large poster (60 cm x 38 cm), supplied by the BNP, with a photograph of the Twin Towers in flame, the words “Islam out of Britain – Protect the British People” and a symbol of a crescent and star in a prohibition sign. The poster was removed by the police following a complaint from a member of the public. The following day a police officer contacted the applicant by telephone and invited him to come to the local police station for an interview. The applicant refused to attend. The applicant was then charged with an aggravated offence under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 (see below), of displaying, with hostility towards a racial or religious group, any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress by it. The applicant pleaded not guilty and argued, in his defence, that the poster referred to Islamic extremism and was not abusive or insulting, and that to convict him would infringe his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention. On 13 December 2002 he was convicted of the offence by District Judge Browning at Oswestry Magistrates' Court, and fined GBP 300. The applicant appealed to the High Court, which dismissed his appeal on 3 July 2003. Lord Justice Auld held that the poster was “a public expression of attack on all Muslims in this country, urging all who might read it that followers of the Islamic religion here should be removed from it and warning that their presence here was a threat or a danger to the British people”. The applicant was charged with the offence of causing alarm or distress contrary to section 5(1)(b) of the Public Order Act 1986, aggravated in the manner provided by sections 28 and 31 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended by section 39 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001). Section 5 of the 1986 Act provides: “(1) A person is guilty of an offence if he; ... (b) displays any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby. (2) An offence under this section may be committed in a public or a private place ... (3) It is a defence for the accused to prove – (a) that he had no reason to believe that there was any person within hearing or sight who was likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress, or (b) that he was inside a dwelling and had no reason to believe that the words or the behaviour used, or the writing, sign or other visible representation displayed would be heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling, or (c) that his conduct was reasonable”. The 1986 Act further provides, in section 6(4): “A person is guilty of an offence under section 5 only if he intends ... the writing, sign or other visible representation to be threatening, abusive or insulting, or is aware that it may be threatening, abusive or insulting ...” The 1998 Act, as amended, introduced a statutory aggravation to a number of offences, including section 5 of the 1986 Act, carrying with it higher maximum penalties. According to sections 28(1)(b) and 31(1)(c) of the 1998 Act, an offence under section 5 of the 1986 Act is “racially or religiously aggravated” if it is “motivated (wholly or partly) by hostility towards members of a racial or religious group based on their membership of that group”.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8. On 12 December 1991 the Supreme Court sentenced the applicant to 13 years’ imprisonment for aggravated murder. He served the sentence in the Rasų Prison in Vilnius. The applicant was released on licence on an unspecified date in 2002. 9. The applicant is the President of the organisation for prisoners’ mutual assistance and support “Freedom” (“Laisvė”). On 9 July 1999 the applicant signed a letter, on behalf of this organisation and certain other prisoners, complaining about the conditions of detention at Rasų Prison and about various allegedly unlawful acts of the prison administration. The complaint was addressed to 10 persons, five of whom were State officials and the five others representatives of the private media. According to the applicant, the complaint was not sent through the prison administration, but rather through an inmate who had been released from the prison, in order to avoid censorship. 10. On 20 July 1999 the Prison Department Director punished the applicant by prohibiting him from receiving a parcel during a personal visit, having found that the sending of the complaint of 9 July 1999 through channels other than the prison administration had breached Article 50 § 6 of the Prison Code. It was also established that the Prison Interim Rules (fifth addendum) prohibited a prisoner from using a personal computer, as had been the case with this letter. The Director held that the applicant could only send the complaint to the State authorities, not to other organisations or persons (Article 50 § 1). The Director further stated that Article 50 § 6 of the Prison Code prohibited complaints “on behalf of other prisoners”. 11. Upon the applicant’s appeal, on 8 December 1999 the Ombudsman established that the provisions of the Prison Code had not properly protected prisoners’ rights of association. The Ombudsman did not express her opinion as to the lawfulness of the penalty. 12. The applicant applied to the administrative courts, claiming that the penalty had been unlawful. On 6 March 2000 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court disallowed the claim for want of jurisdiction. 13. On 30 March 2000 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision on appeal. Upon the applicant’s further appeal, on 10 May 2000 the Court of Appeal quashed the lower court decisions. It held inter alia that the prison administration was part of the Executive, and that the administrative courts were consequently competent to examine the applicant’s action concerning its allegedly unlawful acts. 14. As the applicant subsequently submitted the claim in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Administrative Procedure, his action was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court on 29 May 2001, in the presence of the applicant, transported to the hearing directly from the prison. 15. The court rejected the action as unsubstantiated, finding that the penalty of 20 July 1999 had been lawful. It held inter alia: “Pursuant to Article 50 § 1 of the Prison Code, convicted persons are guaranteed the right to submit applications, proposals and complaints to the State authorities, public organisations and officials. When needed, the prison administration can attach their observations [thereto]. However, convicted persons are prevented from applying to these institutions through channels other than the prison administration (Article 50 § 6 of the Prison Code). The applicant admitted that the application [of 9 July 1999] was sent to 10 addressees illegally, through a person who had completed his sentence and had been released from the prison. The prison administration was therefore deprived of the right to submit their comments as to the issues set out in the application.” 16. On 11 July 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the judgment, holding inter alia: “The applicant’s claims that the [relevant] provisions of the Prison Code contradict the Constitution are unsubstantiated. The applicant must acknowledge that he has been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, and that his legal situation is different from that of persons who have not breached the law... . As appears from the case file, the applicant was punished [on 20 July 1999] not for corresponding with representatives of the media, but for a breach of the requirement under Article 50 of the Prison Code to conduct [such correspondence] through the prison administration. The same can be said regarding the applicant’s claims that, by way of the impugned penalty, he was punished for making criticisms, holding opinions or imparting information.” 17. Article 49 § 1 of the Prison Code, as then in force, stipulated that convicted prisoners were not restricted in the amount of their outgoing letters. The third paragraph of Article 49 required the prison administration to send a prisoner’s letter to the addressee within three days of receipt or its presentation by the prisoner. 18. Article 50 § 1 of the Prison Code applicable at the material time provided that convicted prisoners could send “proposals, applications and complaints to the State authorities, public organisations and officials.” The provision also entitled the prison administration to attach its own explanations in relation to such matters. 19. Until 25 June 1999, Article 50 § 2 of the Prison Code provided that convicted prisoners’ correspondence with the prosecutor could not be subject to censorship (cenzūra). Following a legislative amendment effective since 25 June 1999, convicted prisoners’ correspondence with the State authorities and the European Court of Human Rights could not be censored. 20. According to the then Article 50 §§ 5 and 6 of the Prison Code, convicted prisoners were not allowed to send “collective complaints and applications” or complain “on behalf of other convicts”. 21. Under Article 50 § 6 as then in force, convicted prisoners were not allowed to send proposals, applications and complaints addressed to the State authorities through channels other than the prison administration. 22. Rule 7.3.2 of the Prison Interim Rules, applicable at the material time, read as follows: “Proposals, applications and complaints [by a convicted person] raising questions within the competence of the prison administration shall not be sent to the addressee, but shall be examined on the spot. Having examined [such a] proposal, application, or complaint, a prison official shall write a report and ... include it in the convicted person’s prison file. Should there be disagreement, the proposal, application or complaint shall be sent to the addressee together with the report. If there is a repeated proposal, application or complaint with the same content, the prison administration will note its previous reply in the report ... If the authority, organisation or official addressed by the convicted person is not competent to decide the questions raised, the prison administration shall advise [the prisoner] to re-address the proposal, application or complaint. Should [the prisoner] refuse to do so, the proposal, application or complaint shall be sent to the addressee.” 23. The Prison Interim Rules (fifth addendum) applicable at the material time prohibited a detainee from using a computer. 24. The new Prison Code applicable since 18 July 2001 does not allow any screening of convicted prisoners’ correspondence with the State authorities and the European Court of Human rights. Under Article 41 of this Code, all other correspondence may be censored (cenzūruojama) on the basis of a decision by a competent authority (a prosecutor, prison director or court) taken on a case-by-case basis. 25. In its ruling of 24 March 2003, the Constitutional Court held that the domestic statutes were in breach of the Constitution insofar as they allowed unjustified censorship of prisoners’ correspondence. The Constitutional Court also held that specific grounds should have been indicated for any particular instance of censorship. 26. Certain other domestic provisions concerning the censorship of convicted prisoners’ correspondence have been summarised in the judgments of Valašinas v. Lithuania (no. 44558/98, 24.7.2001 §§ 94-97, ECHR 2001-VIII) and Puzinas (no. 1) v. Lithuania (no. 44800/98, 14.3.2002, §§ 15-17).",[],[],[],['8'],[],[],0
104,001-104811,ENG,GRC,ADMISSIBILITY,2011,ANASTASSAKOS AND OTHERS v. GREECE,4,Inadmissible,Flogaitis;George Nicolaou;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Spyridon Flogaitis,"The applicants, Mr Ioannis Anastassakos, Mr Spyridon Zavitsanos and Mr Stavros Leoussis are Greek nationals who were born in 1955, 1957 and 1944 respectively. They live in Athens. They are represented before the Court by Mr N. Alivizatos and Mr Y. Ktistakis, both lawyers practising in Athens. The Greek Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr M. Apessos, Senior Adviser at the State Legal Council, Mrs U. Patsopoulou, Adviser at the State Legal Council and Mrs S. Trekli, Legal Assistant at the State Legal Council. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants have a direct or indirect involvement in the operation of AGB, a company under Greek law, which specialises in providing television audience measurement services. In particular, the first applicant was the first managing director of AGB, currently holds 5% of that company’s shares and is the chairman of the board of directors. The second applicant has been the managing director of AGB since 2003. The third applicant was one of the co-founders of AGB and today holds 18% of the company’s shares. AGB was founded in 1987 and has remained the sole provider of TV audience data to the present day. The applicants state that it has been noticed worldwide that the relevant national markets prefer to share a common source of television audience data. This is due to the fact that commonly accepted television data in the context of national markets form a decisive parameter in the decision-making process, as regards advertising investment strategies. The applicants submit that Greece is a unique case in the field of terrestrial television broadcasting owing to the fact that, under the successive laws that have been enacted since 1989, when the State monopoly was abolished, there are today at least five private, fifty regional and sixty local television channels, none of which has a proper operating licence. It is submitted that in this context of institutional anarchy AGB’s role has become more crucial than in other countries. The applicants claim that, for this reason, AGB has occasionally been the target of campaigns in which its professionalism and reputation have been attacked. In 2002 a high-ranking executive of Alpha TV drafted and made public a report on AGB’s activities suggesting that AGB and its executives had committed irregularities with regard to the choice of sample and the subsequent processing of television data. The Television Audience Measurement Committee, an independent committee created by virtue of section 11(4) of Law no. 2328/1995, conducted a special investigation and cleared AGB of all charges. In autumn 2004 Alpha TV, which at the time was allegedly facing major financial difficulties and low ratings, again drew attention to the above-mentioned report. The latter gained widespread publicity, and on 14 December 2004 a preliminary examination was ordered in respect of AGB’s managers by the Athens Public Prosecutor’s Office. In February 2006 all three applicants were summoned to the prosecutor’s office to answer rather general questions, without being bound by oath (ανομωτί). On 30 March 2006 the public prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings against the applicants for the concurrent offences of fraud, fraud committed against the State and filing of false statements before an administrative authority. On the same date, the case file was transmitted to the investigating judge. The applicants submit that, on 30 March 2006, during the regular off-the-record meeting of the senior prosecuting authority with the media held on the premises of the Court of Cassation, journalists were briefed that criminal proceedings were to be initiated against the three applicants in relation to AGB’s alleged irregularities. Long excerpts and explicit details about the allegations were read from the unofficial prosecutor’s report (πόρισμα). This report is only an internal document and Greek law does not provide for such a report. It is only by way of a working practice that such reports are drafted by the prosecutor in charge as an informal description and assessment of the facts for the sole purpose of briefing the supervising prosecutor on the case. Moreover, the accused had not yet been notified of the report, and therefore the applicants had no official knowledge of its content. On the same day, M.T., a journalist hosting a popular television show, Η Ζούγκλα (“The Jungle”), appeared before a large panel of guests, holding a copy of the prosecutor’s confidential report. While showing the report on camera with frequent close-ups, he went on to read out extensive parts of it. Quoting selected extracts from the report, he stated that AGB was an integral part of a “network of conspiracy” and the “real centre of power” in Greece, both at political and at economic level. Other guests participating in the panel stated that AGB not only built or destroyed TV careers but also distributed millions and constituted a “spider’s web” and a “fraudulent trap”. The following day’s newspapers contained extensive articles on the case. Three Athens dailies quoted parts of the prosecutor’s confidential report, and one of them published photographs of the first two applicants and another three pages of the original report. The story caused such interest throughout Greece that, on the evening of 31 March 2006, the first and third applicants were forced to answer pressing questions by journalists live on two of the most popular evening television broadcasts. The applicants submit that both their private and professional lives have dramatically changed. After the disclosure of the prosecutor’s report and the ensuing publicity, they are allegedly looked upon with distrust and disapproval and are in a state of uncertainty as to their future careers. They state that the impact on their private lives has also been considerable. In particular, the first applicant started receiving anonymous hostile telephone calls and letters, which forced him to seek protection for his premises from private security guards. After the television reports, the first and second applicants’ children started using their mothers’ maiden name at school, so as to avoid further abuse. The second applicant, having already had health problems with his vocal cords, suffered a relapse, which required a second operation, after the above-mentioned events took place. On 26 June 2009 the Indictment Division of the Athens Court of Appeal dismissed all the charges against the applicants (decision no. 1294/2009). It stated, inter alia, that there were no grounds to commit the applicants for trial. 1. The relevant provisions of the Constitution provide as follows: “1. All persons are entitled to information, as specified by law. Restrictions to this right may be imposed by law only in so far as they are absolutely necessary and justified for reasons of national security, combating crime or protecting the rights and interests of third parties. 2. All persons are entitled to participate in the Information Society. Facilitation of access to electronically processed information, as well as of the production, exchange and diffusion thereof, constitutes an obligation of the State, always in observance of the guarantees of Articles 9, 9A and 19.” “Actions against judicial officers for miscarriage of justice shall be tried, as specified by law, by a special court composed of the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, as President, and one councillor of the Supreme Administrative Court, one Supreme Civil and Criminal Court judge, one councillor of the Court of Auditors, two law professors of the law schools of the country’s universities and two lawyers from among the members of the Supreme Disciplinary Council for lawyers, as members, all of whom shall be chosen by lot. In each case, the member of the special court who belongs to the judicial body or branch the actions or omissions of an officer of which the court is called upon to judge shall be exempted. In the case of an action against a member of the Supreme Administrative Court or an officer of the ordinary administrative courts, the special court shall be presided over by the President of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court. No permission shall be required to institute an action for miscarriage of justice.” 2. The following provisions of the Introductory Law (Εισαγωγικός Νόμος) to the Civil Code (Law no. 2783/41) are relevant: “The State shall be liable in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Code concerning legal persons, for acts or omissions of its organs regarding private-law relations or State assets.” “The State shall be under a duty to make good any damage caused by the unlawful acts or omissions of its organs in the exercise of public authority, except where the unlawful act or omission is in breach of an existing provision but is intended to serve the public interest. The person responsible shall be jointly and severally liable, without prejudice to the special provisions on ministerial responsibility.” This section establishes the concept of a special prejudicial act in public law, creating State liability in tort. This liability results from unlawful acts or omissions. The acts concerned may be not only legal acts but also physical acts by the administrative authorities, including acts which are not in principle enforceable through the courts (Kyriakopoulos, Interpretation of the Civil Code, section 105 of the Introductory Law to the Civil Code, no. 23; Filios, Contract, Special Part, volume 6, Tort, 1977, para. 48 B 112; E. Spiliotopoulos, Administrative Law, 3rd edition, para. 217; Court of Cassation judgment no. 535/1971, Nomiko Vima, 19th year, p. 1414; Court of Cassation judgment no. 492/1967, Nomiko Vima, 16th year, p. 75). The admissibility of an action for damages is subject to one condition, namely, the unlawfulness of the act or omission. 3. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code read as follows: “Any person whose personal rights are unlawfully infringed shall be entitled to bring proceedings to enforce cessation of the infringement and restraint of any future infringement. Where the personal rights infringed are those of a deceased person, the right to bring proceedings shall be vested in his spouse, descendants, ascendants, brothers, sisters and testamentary beneficiaries. In addition, claims for damages in accordance with the provisions relating to unlawful acts shall not be excluded.” “In the cases provided for in the two preceding Articles, the court may, in the judgment it gives on the application of the person whose right has been infringed, and regard being had to the nature of the infringement, also order the infringer to make reparation for the plaintiff’s non-pecuniary damage. Such reparation shall consist in the payment of a sum of money, publication of the court’ “Whoever unlawfully and culpably causes damage to another shall be bound to make reparation to the other for any damage thus caused...” “In the case of an unlawful act, the court may, irrespective of any award of compensation for pecuniary damages, award reasonable compensation ... for any non-pecuniary harm suffered...” 4. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code read as follows: “1. Anyone who is under the legal obligation to perform judicial duties and discloses to a third person confidential information of the deliberations or the vote in which he took part shall be punished by up to two years’ imprisonment. (...)” “A civil servant who, with the exception of cases described under Articles 248, 249, 250 and 251, deliberately and with the intention of unlawfully obtaining a pecuniary advantage for himself or another or who causes prejudice to the State or a third party, discloses to a third person (a) information which came to his knowledge because of his position or (b) a document either entrusted to him or accessible to him owing to his position, shall be punished by at least three months’ imprisonment.” “A civil servant who deliberately breaches an official duty with the intention of unlawfully obtaining a pecuniary advantage for himself or another or who causes prejudice to the State or a third party shall be punished by up to two years’ imprisonment, save where the offence is punishable pursuant to another provision of criminal law.” “1. Except in cases which amount to defamation (Articles 362 and 363), anyone who by words or by deeds or by any other means injures another’s reputation shall be punished by up to one year’s imprisonment or by a pecuniary penalty. The pecuniary penalty may be imposed in addition to imprisonment. 2. If the injury to reputation is not severe, considering the circumstances and the person injured, the offender shall be punished by imprisonment or a fine. 3. The provision of paragraph 3 of Article 308 shall apply in this case.” “1. An insult committed through an act (Article 361, paragraph 1) shall be punishable by at least three months’ imprisonment if it was unprovoked by the victim. 2. If two or more persons participated in the act referred to in the previous paragraph, it shall be punishable by at least six months’ imprisonment.” “Anyone who by any means disseminates information to a third party concerning another which may damage the latter’s character or reputation shall be punished by up to two years’ imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty. The pecuniary penalty may be imposed in addition to imprisonment.” “If, in a case under Article 362, the information is false and the offender was aware of the falsity thereof, he shall be punished by up to three months’ imprisonment, and, in addition, a pecuniary penalty may be imposed and deprivation of civil rights under Article 63 may be ordered.” “1. Anyone who by any means asserts or disseminates information concerning a corporation with respect to its business, financial position, products or members of its board of directors which may lower the confidence of the public in the corporation and generally harm its business shall be punished by up to one year’s imprisonment or a pecuniary penalty. 2. If the accused proves the truth of the information which he asserted or disseminated, he shall not be punished. 3. If the information which the accused asserted or disseminated is false, and he was aware of the falsity thereof, he shall be punished by imprisonment.” Article 241 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: “The judicial investigation takes place in writing and without any publicity (...)” 5. Article 99 of the Magistrates’ Code provides in so far as relevant: « (...) 2. The competent judicial authorities are bound to initiate disciplinary proceedings when their attention is drawn by any means to acts committed by the judiciary which may constitute a disciplinary fault (...)” 6. Section 22(4) of Law no. 2472/1997 provides: “Anyone who unlawfully interferes in any way whatsoever with a personal data file, or takes notice of such data, or extracts, alters, adversely affects, destroys, processes, transfers, discloses, makes accessible to unauthorised persons, or permits such persons to take notice of, such data or anyone who exploits such data in any way whatsoever, shall be punished by imprisonment and a fine and, in the case of sensitive data, by imprisonment for a period of at least one (1) year and a fine amounting to between one million drachmas (GRD 1,000,000) and ten million drachmas (GRD 10,000,000), unless otherwise subject to more serious sanctions.” 7. In its Köbler judgment of 30 September 2003 (Case C-224/01) the Court of Justice of the European Communities made clear that, since, in international law, a State which incurred liability for a breach of an international commitment was viewed as a single entity, irrespective of whether the breach which gave rise to the damage was attributable to the legislature, the judiciary or the executive, that principle must apply a fortiori in the Community legal order since all State authorities, including the legislature, were bound, in performing their tasks, to comply with the rules laid down by Community law which directly governed the situation of individuals.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
105,001-92183,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,LEINO v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"The applicant, Mr Martti Leino, is a Finnish national who was born in 1937 and lives in Espoo. He was represented before the Court by Mr P. Kavonius, a lawyer practising in Lohja. The respondent Government were represented by their agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The applicant had a voluntary pension insurance from 1988 until 2001 into which he paid in total 16,902.72 euros (EUR). From April 2001 his employer was responsible for paying contributions to the insurance policy and in November 2001 it paid one instalment of EUR 4,940.25. By a decision of 20 August 2002 the Social Insurance Institution (kansaneläkelaitos - KELA, folkpensionsanstalten – FPA, hereafter “KELA”) granted the applicant an old-age pension (kansaneläke, folkspension) of EUR 154.85 per month as from 1 October 2002. The occupational pension (työeläke, arbetspension) paid to the applicant by a life insurance company was taken into consideration in calculating the amount of his old-age pension. On 5 June 2003 an insurance company granted the applicant a pension based on his voluntary pension insurance retroactively as from 1 October 2002. As a result of this new pension decision the KELA informed the applicant by letter of 10 June 2003 that there had been an error in the previous decision of 20 August 2002 and that his old-age pension would diminish as a result of the pending rectification. The applicant was invited to inform the KELA of his opinion on the rectification by 30 June 2003. A form to this effect was attached to the letter. The applicant did not reply to the letter. On 30 June 2003 the KELA made a decision to cease the payment of the applicant’s old-age pension as of 1 July 2003 due to the increase in his other pensions. The applicant did not appeal against this decision which thus became final. By a letter dated 1 July 2003 the KELA informed the applicant that the old-age pension he had received in the period between 1 October 2002 and 30 June 2003, in total EUR 1,404.81, was in fact in excess due to the new calculations and that he should let the KELA know his opinion on the matter by 12 July 2003. The applicant did not reply to the letter. On 22 August 2003 the KELA decided to recover the entire old-age pension paid. The applicant was given two months to pay. On 17 September 2003 the applicant appealed to the Appellate Board for Social Insurance (tarkastuslautakunta, prövningsnämnden) against the decision of 22 August 2003. He claimed that the entire voluntary pension was regarded by the KELA as one paid by his employer whereas he himself, the tax authorities and his insurance company considered the main part of that pension as being paid by the applicant. On 26 August 2004 the Appellate Board dismissed his appeal, stating that there were no reasons for making an exception to the rule that pension payments to which the recipient was not entitled should be paid back. On 13 October 2004 the applicant appealed to the Insurance Court, which dismissed his appeal on 23 February 2006 without elaborating on the reasons or addressing the specific circumstances of the applicant’s pension. On 17 March 2006 the KELA requested the applicant to contact them regarding the schedule of repayments. Subsequently the insurance company’s lawyer contacted the KELA and provided additional clarifications, to no avail. On 11 May 2006 a payment order was sent to the applicant.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"The applicant, Mr Robin Wood, is a British national who was born in 1948 and lives in Cheshire. He was represented before the Court by Pierce Glynn, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 19 August 1999, leaving one child born in 1970. In April or May 2000 the applicant applied for widows’ benefits. On 4 May 2000 the applicant was informed that his claim had been disallowed as he was not a woman. By a letter of 12 June 2000 the benefits’ agency confirmed their decision and the lack of his right to an appeal. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefit was payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
107,001-23114,ENG,LVA,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,KOZLOVA and SMIRNOVA v. LATVIA,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicants, Oksana Kozlova and Tatjana Smirnova, are “permanently resident non-citizens” of Latvia, born in 1930 and 1946 respectively and living in Riga (Latvia). They were represented before the Court by Mr G. Kotovs, a lawyer practising in Riga. In 1931 the Latvian State sold to a certain O.A.R. a plot of land 3,740 sq. m in area with a semi-detached weekend house, located in Vecāķi (in the suburbs of Riga). After O.A.R.’s death in 1939, the property passed to his daughter, M.R. In 1944 fear of Stalinist persecution forced M.R. to go into exile in the West and abandon her property. The house was also considerably damaged during the 1940s. In a decision of 9 June 1948 the executive committee of the Mangaļi Municipal Council granted the right to use the above-mentioned land to Colonel S. (the applicants’ father) and Lieutenant Colonel B., and calculated the actual value of the building on it. On 27 August 1948 Mr S. and Mr B. purchased the house by paying the tax authorities the sum of 2,080 Soviet roubles. In the following years S. and B. rebuilt the house. In a decision of 4 February 1952 the municipal authorities granted S. and B. the definitive right to use the land. However, on 1 July 1952 those authorities divided the land into three parts, two of which were allocated to S. and B. and the third of which was placed in public ownership. On 25 December 1968 the municipality’s executive council divided the house into two parts and registered them as two separate properties with different numbers. The title to one of the parts was granted to the heirs of S., who had died that year; title to the other half was granted to B.’s former wife. In 1969 the applicants were recognised as the heirs to equal portions of their fathers’ estate. On 30 October 1991 after Latvia had regained its independence, the Supreme Council (Augstākā padome) enacted the Law on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners (Likums “Par namīpašumu atdošanu likumīgajiem īpašniekiem”). On 30 May 1995, in response to an application by O.A.R.’s grandson, A.R., Riga Municipal Council restored ownership of the land in issue to A.R. That decision did not, however, cover the buildings erected on the land. In April 1998 A.R. asked the Riga Regional Court to set aside all the decisions taken in relation to the semi-detached house during the Soviet period and recognise him as the legitimate owner. In a judgment of 30 June 1998 delivered after adversarial proceedings the Riga Regional Court allowed A.R.’s application. The Court noted first of all that although the house in issue had never been formally expropriated, it was covered by section 7 of the Law on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners, which excluded property abandoned for fear of persecution from the category of res nullius (the property of nobody). The taking of possession of the property by the Soviet local authorities in 1948 had therefore been arbitrary and illegal, especially as it had not been based on any judicial decision. Furthermore, the Regional Court pointed out that section 6 of the aforementioned law precluded the return of items of property sold to private individuals acting in good faith by means of contracts certified by a notary. However, it noted that there had been no such contract in the instant case. Lastly, the Regional Court rejected the applicants’ argument that the disputed house had been completely rebuilt by their father and was in fact a new item of property. In that connection, the Court considered on the basis of the evidence produced that the repairs carried out (the replacement of doors, windows and roofing and repairs to some of the walls) were not sufficient to warrant the assertion that the initial building no longer existed and that S. had built a new house. Consequently, the Regional Court declared the decision of 9 June 1948 and all subsequent measures relating to the building null and void and ordered that it be returned to A.R. The applicants appealed against that judgment to the Civil Division of the Supreme Court, which, in a judgment delivered on 9 December 1998 following adversarial proceedings, dismissed A.R.’s application on the ground that the documents he had submitted were not sufficient to prove O.A.R.’s title to the disputed house. In a judgment of 3 March 1999 the Cassation Division of the Supreme Court, ruling on an appeal on points of law lodged by A.R., quashed the aforementioned judgment and remitted the case to the Civil Division. According to the Cassation Division, as a building was in principle an adjunct to the land on which it was built, the house in question should, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, have been considered to have belonged to the owner of the land, namely O.A.R. In a judgment of 20 May 1999 the Civil Division of the Supreme Court allowed A.R.’s application. Having established that the semi-detached house had indisputably belonged to O.A.R., the Civil Division ruled as follows: “... Section 7 of the Law on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners provides that an item of property abandoned by its owner following the events of the Second World War, particularly in order to avoid persecution or other adverse consequences, cannot be classed as res nullius. It appears from the documents in the case file that in 1944, after the death of his grandmother, the appellant and his family left Latvia to escape potential oppression. The case file does not contain any information attesting to the legal basis for the taking of possession of the property by the executive committee ... . No judgment was adopted regarding a res nullius. ... ... [T]he Civil Division considers that by taking possession of the disputed property without paying any compensation and by making use of it subsequently, the municipality infringed the rights of the legitimate owner and adopted a policy of administrative arbitrariness. Under section 6 of the Law on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners, no court order can be made for the return of items of property acquired against payment by natural persons acting in good faith and on the basis of contracts certified by a notary. The file does not contain any evidence that the property came into the ownership of [S.] and [B.] on the basis of an official conveyance certified by a notary. ... That being so, the Civil Division considers that [B.] and [S.] cannot be regarded as purchasers acting in good faith within the meaning of section 6 of the Law on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners. ... Since [S.] cannot be deemed to have purchased the house in good faith, the Civil Division considers the certificate of succession to the estate issued to Tatjana Smirnova [and] Oksana Kozlova ... to be null and void ...” The applicants appealed on points of law against the above judgment cited above to the Cassation Division of the Supreme Court. In a judgment of 6 October 1999 the Cassation Division, ruling as an extended bench of seven judges, rejected that appeal, upholding the reasons given by the Civil Division. The relevant provisions of the Law of 30 October 1991 on the Return of Real Estate to the Legitimate Owners (Likums “Par namīpašumu atdošanu likumīgajiem īpašniekiem”) provide as follows: “Title to immovable property of which the State or legal persons took possession without paying compensation during the period between the 1940s and the 1980s, as part of a policy which infringed the rights of owners and was tainted by administrative arbitrariness, shall be restored to the former owners or their heirs irrespective of their present nationality.” “The property rights of former owners or their heirs who have lodged an application shall be restored by a court order in accordance with the provisions of the Latvian Code of Civil Procedure. ...” “... [T]he courts may declare null and void measures taken by administrative authorities putting an end to or restricting a lawful right to property.” “Immovable property that has come into the ownership of natural persons acting in good faith against payment and on the basis of contracts certified by a notary may not be returned ... In this case, the former owner (or his heir) has the right to demand from the vendor who acquired the property compensation up to the price laid down in the contract of sale; compensation corresponding to the real value of the property must be paid as provided by law. ...” “Immovable property which had to be abandoned by its owner following the military operations of the Second World War, particularly in order to avoid potential repression or other adverse consequences, may not be regarded as res nullius. ...” “Where the immovable property eligible to be claimed by means of a judicial remedy has not survived ..., former owners (or their heirs) are entitled to compensation as provided by law. Immovable property which, after 30 October 1991, has been rebuilt in such a way that most of it (more than sixty-five percent) amounts to a new building, shall also be considered not to have survived in substance. Where the construction or reconstruction has been carried out in breach of the requirements of a law or regulation or by an occupier acting in bad faith, that fact may not be relied on to dismiss an application for restitution of the property.” In a judgment of 22 October 1997 (case no. SKC-287) the Cassation Division held that a decision taken by the municipal authorities in the 1940s whereby a private individual was granted title to an expropriated house provided that he paid a sum to the tax authorities corresponding to the value of the building was equivalent to a “contract certified by a notary” within the meaning of section 6 of the Law. The relevant provisions of the Latvian Civil Code (Latvijas Republikas Civillikums) read as follows: “The claimant must prove that he has title. For this purpose, it is sufficient for him to show that he genuinely acquired that title in a legal manner; it is subsequently for the defendant to prove that the claimant is no longer the owner. Where the claimant maintains that he acquired the property from a third party through delivery or inheritance, he must prove that his predecessor was the owner.” “The defendant may have the application dismissed if he proves that he has title to the property or the right to possess it on the basis of a right in rem or a right in personam which the claimant must respect.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
108,001-115353,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2012,KULEVSKIY v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Anatoly Kovler;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos,"1. The applicant, Mr Igor Anatolyevich Kulevskiy, is a Belarusian national, who was born in 1966 and lived in Gomel, Belarus. He is represented before the Court by Mr V.S. Korchevskiy, a lawyer practising in Tula, Russia. 2. The Russian Government (“the Government”) are represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. In 2004 the applicant left Belarus for Russia. 4. In the same year the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Belarus started an investigation of the activities of a criminal gang which operated in 1989-2004 in the Gomel region. As a result of the investigation fortysix members of the gang stood trial before the Supreme Court of the Republic of Belarus. Proceedings against the remaining alleged members of the gang, including the applicant, whose whereabouts could not be established, were separated. 5. On 12 January 2005 the Prosecutor General’s Office charged the applicant in absentia, issued an order for him to be remanded in custody and declared him a wanted person. The charges against the applicant, as amended on 15 March 2007, included, in particular, attacks on businesses and citizens (under Article 286 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus), acquisition, transfer, storage, transportation and carrying of firearms (under Article 295 § 4 of the Criminal Code), murder of one person in February 1994, murder with particular cruelty of four persons in September 1994 and three more persons in April 1995 (under Article 100 of the 1960 Criminal Code punishable by fifteen to twenty-five years’ imprisonment, life imprisonment or death). 6. On 6 August 2010 the applicant was arrested in the Tula region in Russia. 7. On 16 August 2010 a deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus, relying on Articles 56 and 80 of the CIS Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (“the 1993 Minsk Convention”), requested a deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation to extradite the applicant to Belarus so that he could be prosecuted for the offences with which he was charged. The Prosecutor General’s Office of Belarus guaranteed that the applicant would only be prosecuted for offences in connection with which he would be extradited, that after his trial or after serving his sentence, if convicted, he would be free to leave Belarus and that he would not be transferred to a third state without the Russian Federation’s consent. It was stated further that the request was not aimed at persecuting the applicant on the grounds of his race, religion, ethnic origin or political convictions, and that the statute of limitation for his prosecution had not expired. 8. On 28 October 2010 the Aleksin Town Court, Tula region, convicted the applicant of forgery of a Russian passport, using which he had lived in Russia under a false name, and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. A decision on the applicant’s extradition was postponed. His conviction became final on 6 April 2011. 9. On 23 May 2011 the deputy Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation (“the RF”), relying in particular on Articles 56 and 66 of the 1993 Minsk Convention and Articles 462463 of the RF Code of Criminal Procedure, granted the request for the applicant’s extradition. The decision noted that the offences with which the applicant had been charged in Belarus constituted crimes under the Russian criminal law punishable with more than one year’s imprisonment, and that the statute of limitation for their prosecution had not expired. The applicant was a Belarusian national and did not have Russian citizenship. 10. On the same day the RF deputy Prosecutor General communicated his decision to the Belarus Deputy Prosecutor General, inviting the latter to inform him, under Article 69 of the 1993 Minsk Convention, of the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The extradition was to take place once the applicant’s sentence for passport forgery had been served and the extradition decision had entered into force. 11. On 8 July 2011 the Belarus Deputy Prosecutor General, in reply to the RF Deputy Prosecutor General’s inquiry, supplemented his request for the applicant’s extradition with additional assurances, notably that in the event of the applicant’s extradition to Belarus the requirements of Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms would be observed, the applicant would not be subjected to torture, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. If convicted, he would not be sentenced to death. He would be given a fair trial and, if necessary, provided with appropriate medical care. 12. The applicant appealed against the extradition decision to the Tula Regional Court. A judge to whom the case had been allocated enquired with the RF Prosecutor General about the possibility of obtaining additional assurances from Belarus, to the effect that the relevant court there would not impose the death penalty on the applicant, or that the death penalty would not be carried out. Following that inquiry the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs obtained a Note of 26 July 2011, no. 04-21/1379-k, of the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the Russian Federation which states as follows: “The Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the Russian Federation presents its compliments to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and, in reply to Note no. 8372/2 дснг of 19 July 2011, has the honour to present the following information. The Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the Russian Federation confirms that compliance by all Belorussian law-enforcement organs, including courts and organs of execution of sentences, with the undertakings given by the Republic of Belarus Prosecutor General’s Office on behalf of the Republic of Belarus of the nonapplication of the death penalty to Igor Anatolyevich Kulevskiy, is both lawful and compulsory. By virtue of the law of the Republic of Belarus, in particular Article 494 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Belarus, only the Republic of Belarus Prosecutor General’s Office has the power to give a written undertaking on behalf of the Republic of Belarus of the nonapplication of the death penalty to a person whose extradition is being sought. In this connection, the written undertaking by the Republic of Belarus Prosecutor General’s Office on behalf of the Republic of Belarus of the non-application of the death penalty to Igor Anatolyevich Kulevskiy has in essence the force of an international legal obligation of the Republic of Belarus which is subject to rigorous observance. Taking into account the aforementioned circumstances, the written undertaking by the Republic of Belarus Prosecutor General’s Office specifically indicates that in the event of delivery of a “guilty” verdict a court with jurisdiction to examine the case will not sentence I.A. Kulevskiy to death («... в случае вынесения обвинительного приговора в нем компетентным судом Республики Беларусь не будет назначено наказание И.А. Кулевскому в виде смертной казни ...»). That court will be bound to examine that undertaking at the [Kulevskiy’s] trial and regard it as an obligation of the Republic of Belarus not to apply the death penalty to him. We should also inform you that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Belarus and its diplomatic representation offices are not vested by Belorussian law with powers to give additional legally binding guarantees of non-application of the death penalty. The Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the Russian Federation avails itself of this opportunity to renew to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation the assurances of its highest consideration.” 13. From 15 September 2011, after serving his sentence for the passport forgery, the applicant was in custody pending extradition. He was released on 22 September 2012 when the maximum time-limit for detention had been reached. 14. The applicant’s request for refugee status was refused by a final decision of the Russian Federal Migration Service on 29 November 2011; on an appeal by the applicant that decision was upheld by the Moscow Basmanniy District Court on 11 January 2012 and the Moscow City Court on 24 February 2012. 15. On 6 March 2012 the Tula Regional Court, sitting in a panel of three judges, held an open hearing. Having heard the applicant, his counsel and the prosecutor and having examined other evidence, the Regional Court upheld the extradition decision, which it found to be in compliance with the European Convention on Extradition of 1957, the Minsk 1993 Convention and the RF Code of Criminal Procedure. The Regional Court examined the assurances given by the Belarus Prosecutor General’ 16. In particular, as regards the applicant’s argument that three leaders of the gang convicted of the murders, which offences formed part of the charges against him, had been sentenced to death and executed, the Regional Court established, on the basis of official information from the Belarusian authorities, that those individuals had never been extradited; they had been arrested in Belarus in 2004 and detained there until their conviction and execution. 17. The applicant’s allegations that he had been persecuted in Belarus for his political activity, detained unlawfully and illtreated were found by the Regional Court to be incoherent, unsubstantiated and lacking essential details. No evidence of his detention or illtreatment had been provided. Political motives for leaving his home country had for the first time been raised at the last hearing before the Regional Court, without any details being provided. He had stated to the court previously that he had left Belarus to find a job. He admitted at the hearing that he was not a member of any political, religious, non-governmental or military organisation, and had never distributed materials or appeals in the context of agitation. He had made the same statements when detained with a view to extradition. His wife, daughter and sister were Belarusian nationals, resided in Belarus and had never been persecuted. Upon arrival in Russia he had not applied for refugee status or for Russian citizenship, but had lived under a forged Russian passport. 18. The Regional Court examined human rights organisations’ reports submitted by the defence, which indicated that the human rights situation in Belarus was unstable. Relying on the Convention case-law, the Regional Court noted that the reference to a general problem concerning human rights observance in a particular country could not alone serve as a basis for refusal of extradition. The charges against the applicant did not relate to political activity. The applicant’s allegation that any detainee would be subjected to ill-treatment in Belarus was too general. He was accused of banditry, illegal weapons trafficking and the murder of eight people with aggravating circumstances. There was no evidence that the applicant had engaged in any political activity. His allegations of earlier instances of illtreatment in Belarus were vague, totally unsubstantiated and unconvincing. The Regional Court concluded that there were no grounds to believe that the applicant would be subjected to treatment dangerous to his health or life, or that his trial would be unfair. The applicant had no health issues requiring him to stay in Russia on humanitarian grounds. 19. On 26 April 2012 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the Regional Court’s judgment, having endorsed the Regional Court’s findings. 20. On 21 May 2012 the Court, acting upon the applicant’s request, decided to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, indicating to the Government of the Russian Federation that the applicant should not be extradited to Belarus until further notice by the Court. 21. The CIS Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations in Civil, Family and Criminal Matters (signed in Minsk on 22 January 1993 and amended on 28 March 1997, “the 1993 Minsk Convention”), to which both Russia and Belarus are parties, provides as follows: “1. The Contracting Parties shall ... on each other’s requests extradite persons, who find themselves in their territory, for criminal prosecution or serving a sentence. 2. Extradition for criminal prosecution shall extend to offences which are criminally punishable under the laws of the requesting and requested Contracting Parties, and which entail at least one year’s imprisonment or a heavier sentence.” “1. Extradition shall not be carried out if: (a) the person whose extradition is being requested is a citizen of the requested Contracting Party; (b) At the moment of receipt of the request criminal prosecution cannot be initiated according to the legislation of the requested Contracting Party ... as a result of the expiry of the statute of limitations or on another legal ground; (c) a judgment or a decision on termination of proceedings have been delivered and entered into force on the territory of the requested Contracting Party in respect of the person whose extradition is being requested for the same crime; (d) in accordance with the legislation of the requesting and requested Contracting Parties the crime is being prosecuted by way of private prosecution (on a victim’s request) ...” “1. A request for extradition shall include the following information: (a) the title of the requesting and requested authorities; (b) the description of the factual circumstances of the offence, the text of the law of the requesting Contracting Party which criminalises the offence, and the punishment sanctioned by that law; (c) the [name] of the person to be extradited, the year of his birth, citizenship, place of residence, and, if possible, the description of his appearance, his photograph, fingerprints and other personal information; (d) information concerning the damage caused by the offence. 2. A request for extradition for the purpose of criminal persecution shall be accompanied by a certified copy of a detention order ...” “1. Without the requested Contracting Party’s consent the extradited person must not be prosecuted or punished for the crime committed before his extradition for which he had not been extradited. 2. Furthermore, without the requested Contracting Party’s consent the person cannot be transferred to a third state ...” “The Contracting Parties shall notify each other of the outcome of the criminal proceedings against the extradited person. On request, a copy of the final judgment shall be sent. ” “Relations concerning extradition and criminal prosecution are performed by Prosecutor Generals (prosecutors) of the Contracting Parties.” 22. Similar provisions are contained in chapter 54 (Articles 460-468) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation, which governs the procedure to be followed in the event of extradition. Under Article 462 § 4 of the Code, the extradition decision is taken by the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation or his deputy. 23. Under Article 59 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Belarus, the death penalty is applied, until its abolition, as an exceptional punishment for certain very grave crimes. The death penalty cannot be imposed on anyone who has committed offences when under the age of eighteen, on women, or on men who have reached the age of 65 by the date of delivery of a judgment. The death penalty can be replaced by a life sentence by way of clemency. The last two executions reportedly took place in March 2012. 24. Under Article 494 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Belarus, the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic of Belarus encloses with a request for extradition a written undertaking on behalf of the Republic of Belarus that the death penalty will not be applied to a person whose extradition is being sought, if such an undertaking is a condition of the requested state’s granting the extradition request. 25. Under Article 34 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Belarus, prosecution in criminal proceedings and the bringing of criminal charges before the courts are carried out by prosecutors on behalf of the State. Under Article 17 of the 2007 Law on the Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic of Belarus, the Prosecutor General’s Office supervises the activities of all prosecutors’ offices in the Republic of Belarus. 26. The Coordination Council of the Prosecutor Generals of States Parties to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) was created in 1995 and given the status of CIS interstate organ in 2000. One of its tasks is to assess the efficiency of the CIS 1993 Minsk Convention and to propose measures for improvement of regulation of the relations governed by that Convention. It organises cooperation between the prosecutors of the States members and facilitates the defence of rights of their citizens.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

ITALY,1,Preliminary objections rejected (victim);No violation of Art. 2;No violation of Art. 6-1,Luzius Wildhaber;Paul Mahoney,"9. Immediately following its birth in a private clinic, “La Madonnina”, in Cosenza the applicant's new-born baby was admitted to the intensive care unit of Cosenza Hospital suffering from serious respiratory and neurological post-asphyxia syndrome induced by the position in which it had become lodged during delivery. The baby died on 9 February 1987, two days after birth. 10. On 10 February 1987 the applicants lodged a complaint. The Cosenza public prosecutor's office started an investigation that same day. 11. On 12 February 1987 Ms Ciglio was questioned as a witness. A team of three expert witnesses was named. 12. As nothing further happened in the proceedings, the applicants made several requests, notably on 16 October 1987, and 12 April and 30 June 1988, for the investigation to be expedited. On 16 November 1988 the public prosecutor's office itself requested the expert witnesses to lodge their report. 13. On 19 June 1989 the applicants were informed that at the request of the public prosecutor's office, the investigating judge had notified E.C. – the doctor responsible for delivering the baby and the joint owner of the clinic – that charges would be brought against him. 14. Subsequently, the scheduled questioning of certain witnesses on 18 July 1989 did not take place, as the judge dealing with the case was on holiday. 15. Meanwhile, on 7 July 1989, the applicants were joined to the proceedings as civil parties. 16. On 19 January 1990 the prosecution applied for the complaint to be filed away without further action. That application was dismissed on 24 May 1990. 17. On 3 October 1990 the investigating judge instructed the public prosecutor's office to make further inquiries. Consequently, on 29 November 1990 the deputy public prosecutor ordered forensic tests. The results were made available on 5 January 1991. 18. On 12 June 1991 E.C. was committed for trial before the Cosenza Criminal Court on a charge of involuntary manslaughter and the applicants renewed their application to be joined to the proceedings as civil parties. 19. The first hearing was set down for 2 July 1992 but had to be adjourned because of a lawyers' strike. The next hearing on 15 October 1992 was also adjourned due to a delay in service of a summons on the accused to appear. 20. A new hearing date was fixed for 15 January 1993. On that date an order was made for the accused's trial in absentia. The trial did not begin, however, until 19 March 1993, as meanwhile the accused had changed lawyers. The hearing scheduled for 29 April 1993 was adjourned until 3 June 1993 as the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated. The trial thereafter continued with hearings on 27 May, and 10 and 17 June (the latter hearing being adjourned as one of the expert witnesses appointed by the court had to be replaced). A hearing on 15 July 1993 was adjourned to 16 September 1993, again owing to the fact that the composition of the bench was not the same as that to which the case had been allocated. There were further hearings on 14 and 26 October 1993. On the latter date the order for the accused's trial in absentia was revoked, but the hearing had to be adjourned as the expert witnesses failed to attend without due cause (they were ordered to pay a fine and to attend the next hearing on 14 December). A final hearing took place on 17 December 1993. The accused, who had attended the hearings on 26 October and 14 December 1993, was not present at that hearing. 21. At the hearing on 17 December the Cosenza Criminal Court found the accused guilty in absentia of involuntary manslaughter. Its judgment was lodged with the registry on 19 February 1994. The Criminal Court sentenced the accused to one year's imprisonment and ordered him to pay the civil parties' costs together with compensation to be assessed at a later date. 22. It found firstly that the accused knew that the birth had to be regarded as high risk since the mother was a level-A diabetic and had a past history of confinements that had been equally difficult because of the size of the foetus. The risks inherent in deliveries in such circumstances, which the expert witnesses appointed by the Criminal Court described as readily foreseeable, meant that precautionary measures should have been taken and that the doctor in charge should have been present. The Criminal Court found, however, that E.C., whom the applicant had consulted during the pregnancy, had made no arrangements for precautionary measures, such as an external examination of the mother, to assess whether the foetus was too large for a natural birth. Above all, he had absented himself during the birth. When the complications had occurred, it had taken the nursing staff six or seven minutes to locate E.C., who was busy seeing patients in another part of the clinic. The intervening delay before E.C. was able to perform the manipulation necessary to extract the foetus had significantly reduced the new-born's chances of survival. 23. The Criminal Court nevertheless suspended the sentence and ordered that the conviction should not appear on E.C.'s criminal record. In addition, it dismissed the civil parties' application for a provisional award of compensation. 24. On 17 March 1994 E.C. appealed to the Catanzaro Court of Appeal. 25. In a judgment of 3 August 1994, which was delivered in absentia and lodged with the registry on 17 August 1994, the Court of Appeal declared the appeal inadmissible. Noting that he had been tried in absentia at first instance, the Court of Appeal held that E.C. had failed to give his lawyer the authority to act required under the rules applicable in such cases. It ordered him to reimburse the costs incurred by the civil parties in the proceedings. 26. On 7 October 1994 E.C. appealed to the Court of Cassation. In a judgment of 22 December 1994, which was lodged with the registry on 23 January 1995, the Court of Cassation overturned the decision of the Catanzaro Court of Appeal, to which it remitted the case for a retrial. It held that the Court of Appeal had erred in treating E.C. as being absent, as he had been present at the start of the trial and had accordingly to be regarded as having left the court during the trial and not as liable to trial in absentia. 27. In a judgment of 3 July 1995, which was lodged with the registry on 10 July 1995, the Catanzaro Court of Appeal ruled that the prosecution of the offence was time-barred. 28. In so doing, it noted that the limitation period for the offence of which E.C. was accused had expired on 9 August 1994, in other words, even before the Court of Cassation had delivered its judgment. 29. Following E.C.'s conviction at first instance by the Cosenza Criminal Court on 19 February 1994 (see paragraphs 21-22 above), the applicants served a summons requiring E.C. to appear before the civil court of that town. 30. However, on 27 April 1995 the applicants entered into an agreement with the insurers of the doctor and the clinic under which the insurers were to pay 95,000,000 Italian lire (ITL) for any damage sustained by the applicants. Of that sum, ITL 15,000,000 were designated as reparation for the special loss sustained by Ms Ciglio. At that time, the criminal proceedings were pending in the Catanzaro Court of Appeal following the Court of Cassation's judgment of 22 December 1994 (see paragraph 26 above). 31. Subsequently, as the parties failed to attend a hearing on 16 November 1995, the case was struck out of the civil court's list. At that stage, the criminal proceedings had only just ended, the Court of Appeal's ruling that the prosecution of the offence was time-barred having become final on 17 October 1995. 32. Article 112 of the Italian Constitution provides: “The public prosecutor's office has a duty to prosecute.” 33. Article 589 of the Criminal Code lays down that the penalty for involuntary manslaughter is imprisonment of between six months and five years. 34. Furthermore, Article 157 § 1, sub-paragraph 4, of the Criminal Code provides that the limitation period for involuntary manslaughter is five years. That period may be extended by one half as a result of any interlocutory matters arising, but may under no circumstances exceed seven and a half years from the date of the offence. 35. Lastly, Article 120 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “In cases in which publishing the decision on the merits may contribute to providing reparation for the damage, the court may, on application by an interested party, order the losing party to publish the decision at its own expense in one or more newspapers determined by the court. If the decision is not published within the period fixed by the court, the interested party may arrange for publication and shall retain the right to recover the costs from the losing party.” 36. In the resolution cited above, adopted on 18 September 1975, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommended that in their internal legislation and practice the governments of the member States be guided by the following principles: “1. Criminal proceedings should not be instituted or, if appropriate, sanctions shall not be imposed for manslaughter or accidental bodily injury resulting from a minor traffic offence, that is to say, a driving offence that was not such that its author must have been aware of the danger to which he exposed himself or others; 2. The same should apply, subject to the inexcusable character of the fault committed, in respect of a person who has caused manslaughter or accidental bodily injury if he himself or someone dear to him has been so badly injured that a sanction would be pointless, if not inhuman; 3. Application of the above-mentioned recommendations should in no way prejudice the rights of the victims to obtain compensation.”",[],[],[],"['2', '6']",['6-1'],[],0
110,001-22636,ENG,ITA,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,SALVETTI v. ITALY,3,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mrs Ilaria Salvetti, is an Italian national, who was born in 1969 and lives in Caprino Veronese, Italy. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. In 1971 the applicant was struck down by paralysis, blindness and dysarthria as a result of the compulsory polio inoculation provided by Law no. 51 of 4 February 1966. Section 2 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 provided that people struck down by permanent illnesses as a result of compulsory inoculations were entitled to an allowance from the first day of the month following the claim and to a lump-sum payment. In fact, by a judgment of 22 June 1990 the Constitutional Court had declared Law no. 51 of 4 February 1966 unconstitutional because it did not provide for any fair compensation for illnesses as a result of compulsory polio inoculation. On 13 January 1993 the applicant requested the compensation she was entitled to. On 26 April 1995 the Ministry of Health established, on the basis of the applicant’s claim, that she was entitled to an allowance of 14,107,590 Italian lire (ITL) per annum from 1 February 1993. On 18 May 1995 ITL 32,917,655 were paid in arrears for the period from 1 February 1993 to 31 May 1995. By a judgment of 18 April 1996 the Constitutional Court declared section 2 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 unconstitutional because it did not provide for any compensation for the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the award of the allowance. In 1996, after the Constitutional Court’s judgment, several decree-laws were issued and re-issued in order to resolve the matter of the retrospective compensation. The last decree-law no. 548 of 23 October 1996 converted into Law no. 641 of 23 October 1996 and later Law no. 238 of 25 July 1997 amended section 2 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992. According to the new section 2, in addition to the principal allowance and lump-sum payment already awarded, people injured by compulsory inoculations were entitled to a further compensation for the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the award of the allowance, calculated for every year at 30% of that allowance, without statutory interest and monetary revaluation. Moreover, section 2 provided that people injured by multiple illnesses as a result of compulsory inoculations were entitled to additional compensation, to be determined by a decree of the Ministry of Health, of not more than 50% of the principal award. On 20 July 1997 the applicant lodged an application with the County Court (Pretura) alleging that the decree-law’s provisions were unconstitutional on the grounds of the arbitrary reduction of the retrospective compensation and requesting a declaration of her right to obtain it without any reduction. The applicant also alleged that the provision in relation to the additional award was unconstitutional, because it was determined in a different way from the sum awarded to disabled workers and ex-servicemen. In any case, the applicant requested a provisional order against the Ministry of Health to pay the retrospective compensation as determined by Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 (that is, 30% of the principal award) and statutory interest from 1 February 1993 to 31 May 1995 on the principal allowance arrears. The Ministry of Health asked for the applicant’s requests to be dismissed. The County Court provisionally ordered that Ministry of Health pay ITL 89,386,881 in retrospective compensation as determined by Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992. By judgment of 30 January 1997 the County Court found the applicants’ arguments concerning constitutionality to be manifestly ill-founded and ordered the Ministry of Health to pay ITL 88,877,817 in retrospective compensation as determined by Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 and ITL 4,368,881 in statutory interest from 1 February 1993 to 31 May 1995 in principal allowance arrears. The Court also declared that the applicant was eligible for the additional compensation because of the multiple illnesses following the compulsory inoculation but did not fix the amount because the Ministry of Health’s decree had not yet been issued. The Ministry of Health lodged an appeal against the County Court’s judgment. The applicant asked for the appeal to be dismissed and her previous requests confirmed. By judgment of 24 September 1998 the Labour Court upheld the County Court’s judgment and ordered the Ministry of Health to pay additional compensation of 50% of the principal award. By judgment no. 307 of 22 June 1990 the Constitutional Court declared as follows: Law no. 51 of 4 February (polio compulsory inoculation) is unconstitutional insofar as it does not provide, outside section 2043 of the civil code, for any fair compensation to be charged to the State for damage as a result of infection or other serious illness following compulsory polio inoculation which have struck down inoculated children or people who have personally and directly taken care of them. This unconstitutional declaration (...) introduces a compensation for damage as direct result of compulsory medical treatment within the limits of a fair settlement which considers all the aspects of damage. This compensation is justified (...) by a balanced consideration of the principles of section 32 of the Constitution in relation to the solidarity between individuals and the collectivity, which justifies the imposition of medical treatment. According to Section 1 of Law n. 210 of 25 February 1992: Everyone struck down by illnesses or infirmities as a result of compulsory inoculations (...) is entitled to a compensation to be charged to the State on the conditions and in the ways established by the present law. Section 2 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 provided as follows:  The compensation (...) starts from the first day of the month following the claim. By judgment no.118 of 18 April 1996 the Constitutional Court declared as follows:  Section 2, par. 2 and 3, par. 7 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992 is unconstitutional insofar as it denies the right of people struck down by illnesses as a result of polio compulsory inoculation or of people who have personally and directly taken care of them to a compensation to be charged to the State -outside the provision of section 2043 of the civil code- for the period between the date on which the cause of the action arose and the award of the allowance determined according to the law above. (...) The individual cannot be expected to sacrifice his own health for the benefit of the whole community. The coexistence between the individual and the collective aspect of constitutional discipline of health as well as the duty of solidarity, established by section 2 of the Constitution, which ties the individual to the collectivity, but also the collectivity to the individual, imposes a proper supporting measure of fair compensation for damage to be arranged for people who have suffered damage as a result of compulsory medical treatment. The compensation must be paid independently of the one claimed by the part concerned, if the conditions of section 2043 of the civil code are satisfied. Whereas the defence against tort provided by the section above necessarily and fully pays also for health damages -(...)- the compensation at issue is not concerned with guilt but with the unbreakable duty of solidarity overhanging in this case on the collectivity and, in its place, on the State. Though this compensation could not be derisory and -(...)- must consider all the aspects of damage, it has equitable nature. (...) This is a special duty. The issue for the collectivity is not only the duty to help people in trouble for any cause, but also the duty to compensate the sacrifice that someone can suffer for a benefit to the collectivity. It would be against principles of justice, such as results from section 32 of Constitution, in the light of the duty of solidarity of section 2 of Constitution, that people struck down were left to their own destiny and resources or that the damage at issue was considered an unforeseen event to be compensated with general instruments of public assistance, or that satisfaction for compensation requests of damaged people was subordinated to the existence of others’ negligent behaviour which could be missing. Section 2 of Law no. 210 of 25 February 1992, revised by Law no. 641 of 23 October 1996 and later by law no. 238 of 25 July 1997, provides as follows: 2. The allowance of par. 1 is integrated by a lump-sum payment corresponding to the special additional compensation of Law no. 324 of 27 May 1959 (...) and starts from the first day of the month following the claim (...) By claim and even if the allowance has been already given, a compensation is paid to people indicated in Section 1, par. 1 for the period between the date on which the cause of action arose and the award of the allowance, calculated for every year at 30% of the allowance, without statutory interest and monetary revaluation. 3.4.5.6 (...). 7. People injured by multiple illnesses with distinct disabling effects are entitled to an additional compensation, to be determined by a decree of the Ministry of Health, of not more than 50% of the allowance of par. 1 and 2.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

POLAND,3,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza,"1. The applicant, Preußische Treuhand GmbH & Co. KG a.A. (“the applicant company”), is a German legal person – a limited partnership – with its registered office in Düsseldorf. It pursued the application on behalf of, and in connection with facts concerning, twenty-three natural persons (“the individual applicants”), its shareholders, all German nationals who authorised the applicant company to act for them in the proceedings before the Court. Their names and personal details are listed in an annex attached to the present decision. The applicant company was represented before the Court by Mr T. Gertner, a lawyer practising in Bad Ems. 4. The Nazi authorities prepared plans for the evacuation of German civilians from eastern Europe, including from what are now the western and northern parts of Poland situated east of the Oder-Neisse line, towards the end of the Second World War. The implementation of the plans started on various dates. Most of the evacuation began in January 1945 and continued throughout March or even April 1945. The evacuation of East Prussia was effected in three stages. The first took place in July 1944, the second in October 1944. The population was evacuated to Pomerania and Saxony. The third stage started on 20 January 1945, during the Soviet offensive, and was carried out throughout that month. The capital city, Königsberg, surrendered to the Soviets on 9 April 1945. The Red Army took control of this territory in May 1945. It was later annexed to the Soviet Union and at present belongs to the Russian Federation. The evacuation of Pomerania started in January 1945 but was delayed and further suspended (at the end of February 1945) on account of the fact that massive groups of people evacuated from East Prussia had filled the territory. The evacuation of Silesia began on 19 January 1945. The population was evacuated to Saxony and Bohemia. The evacuation of East Brandenburg (Neumark) and Greater Poland (Wielkopolska) started on 20 January 1945. 5. The Polish State, by virtue of several laws enacted in 1945 and 1946, formally expropriated the property left behind by Germans following their evacuation or expulsion or still occupied by them in the former German territories east of the Oder-Neisse line. The expropriation laws concerned agricultural and forest land, industry and enterprises and other “post-German” property (see paragraph 39 below). They included laws not addressed exclusively to Germans, for instance decrees on the takeover by the State of certain forests and the 1946 nationalisation law, whereby most private owners either had their property expropriated entirely (with or without compensation) or could retain only a certain proportion of it. However, Germans were treated differently since size limitations did not apply to their property, which was expropriated without compensation. The second group of laws specifically concerned the takeover of German property, with a separate set of regulations regarding the “Regained Territories” and the confiscation of property belonging to persons – Germans or others – who were disloyal to the Polish State or nation during the war. They included the Law of 6 May 1945 on Abandoned and Derelict Property (ustawa o majątkach opuszczonych i porzuconych – “the 1945 Act”), the Decree of 8 March 1946 on abandoned or post-German property (dekret o majątkach opuszczonych i poniemieckich – “the March 1946 Decree”), the Decree of 6 September 1946 on the agrarian system and settlement in the Regained Territories and the former Free City of Gdańsk (dekret o ustroju rolnym i osadnictwie na obszarze Ziem Odzyskanych i byłego Wolnego Miasta Gdańska – “the September 1946 Decree”) and the Decree of 15 November 1946 on the seizure of property of States at war with the Polish State in the years 1939-45 and of property of legal persons and citizens of those States and on the receivership of such property (dekret o zajęciu majątków państw pozostających z Państwem Polskim w stanie wojny w latach 1939-45 i majątków osób prawnych i obywateli tych państw oraz o zarządzie przymusowym nad tymi majątkami). 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the individual applicants, may be summarised as follows. 9. In January 1945, having learned of the Allies' decision to divide Germany into occupation zones, the applicant's family left their farm in Dammfelde (at present Dąbrówka Mała), owned by the applicant's father, H.L., before the advancing Red Army arrived. They reached the British occupation zone. The applicant submits that he has still not been allowed to return to his home and has been refused restitution of his property. 10. M.B., the applicant's mother, was driven from her family farm in Rohnstock (at present Roztoka) and died, while fleeing, on 12 or 16 April 1945. The applicant, as his mother's heir, has still not been allowed to return to the family's home and has been refused restitution of his property. 11. At the end of January 1945 the applicant and her brothers and sisters, together with an aunt and her family, left their place of residence, Wisenthal-Röhrsdorf (at present Osowa Sień), in the district of Fraustadt (at present the Wschów District) in Lower Silesia to escape the advancing Red Army. They and the other Germans had an hour to join a convoy of horse-drawn vehicles in the neighbouring village of Röhrsdorf. The applicant's grandfather, E.G., after the applicant and her family had been forced to leave, was shot or beaten to death by Soviet troops on his own farm, and the farm buildings were burned. The house, however, survived. After spending a long time on the road and enduring severe hardship, the applicant and her family reached Saxony. They have still not been allowed to return to their home and have been refused restitution. 12. In late January or early February 1945, the applicant and his family were forced to leave their farm in Ziegellscheune (at present Wszewniki). Each person was allowed to take only one suitcase. From the railway station at Militsch (at present Milicz), they were taken west in cattle wagons, experiencing the bombing of Dresden on the way. The applicant and his family eventually reached Altenroda (Thuringia). In June 1957 he left the former German Democratic Republic and moved to the Federal Republic of Germany. He has still not been allowed to return to his property and has been refused restitution. 13. On 4 March 1945, the applicant's parents and their children were forced to leave their house in Massow (at present Maszewo) since the Red Army was some 20 kilometres away and their evacuation was ordered. Nonetheless, they later returned to Massow, where, according to him, looting, rape and so on were daily occurrences. In September and October 1945 the first Poles arrived, taking over homes and farms. At the end of October 1945 the family's farm was confiscated by the Polish militia. The applicant's father was later arrested by Poles, and taken without reason to the police station at Stettin (at present Szczecin), where he suffered ill-treatment for six weeks. He was then brought before a judge and released. The applicant himself, whose arrest had also been planned, was forced to work for nothing on the farm without any help. Early in 1946, the Poles began to deport the Germans from Stolzenhagen (at present Stolczyn). Since the family's residence permits were due to expire on 31 May 1946, they first went to Odermünde and then to Pölitz, finally reaching the British occupation zone in July 1946. They have still not been allowed to return to their property and have been refused restitution. The family also left behind property in Stettin-Stolzenberg (at present Szczecin-Stołczyn). 14. In January 1945, the applicant's grandparents were expelled from Zoppot (at present Sopot). They went overland westwards. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to his family home and restitution has been refused. 15. In 1946 the applicant's mother and her family were expelled from their farm in Ober Ohlisch (at present Olszówka Górna) by the Polish militia. They were not allowed to take anything with them. The applicant and her mother went first to Polish neighbours, who gave them a room. The applicant's mother had previously been denounced and falsely accused of stealing a horse's harness from a Pole. For three weeks, she was required to report daily to the militia, where she spent the day cleaning toilets and other rooms in the barracks, and looking on while other Germans were questioned and beaten. The applicant and her mother then went back to their home, which had been given to another Pole in the meantime. They were given the room in which the grandmother was still living, but were not allowed to use the toilet or water, and stones were thrown through their window. They also had to pay rent. Having found other quarters, they finally left in 1956. They remained in Poland until 24 June 1989, and then travelled on a visitor's visa to the Federal Republic of Germany, where they decided to stay and where they still live. The applicant submits that they have repeatedly applied to the Polish authorities for restitution of their property, but have been refused on the ground that, as Germans, they have not been rehabilitated. The applicant has not submitted any documents or other evidence showing that she submitted her claims to any Polish administrative, judicial or other authority. 16. In May 1946, the applicant's father and his family were visited by Polish militiamen in their house in Bad Charlottenbrunn (at present Jedlina Zdrój) and told that they were to be deported at once. They were given about an hour to pack essentials, and each was allowed to take only 20 kilograms of luggage. They marched five kilometres to the station and were loaded onto open goods wagons. As the journey went on, many people were robbed of their last belongings. There were repeated body-searches, and Germans were ordered by loudspeaker to hand over valuables, such as savings books, and threatened with severe punishment if they failed to comply. The applicant's father and his family eventually succeeded in reaching the Western occupation zone. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to his family home and has been refused restitution. 17. On 20 January 1945, following an order for Germans to leave Stołężyn and report in Schwarzacker, the applicant and other members of his family fled their home. They stopped in Czarnikau (at present Czarnków), where all the roads were blocked, and they could proceed no further. Red Army soldiers suddenly turned up and were on the point of shooting the applicant – even old people and children had been killed simply because they were German – but a Pole stepped in to protect him. All their belongings were taken, but the family escaped alive. On 23 January 1945 the Soviets ordered the family to return to their home, which they reached on 25 January 1945. The house had been looted. In February 1945, Polish militiamen expelled them again, and they were taken to an internment camp at Elsenau (at present Damasławek), where the last of their belongings were taken, and where they were seriously maltreated. Eventually, they were forced to leave their homeland. They have still not been allowed to return to their home and have been refused restitution. 18. The applicant's grandmother P.N. wished to stay on the family farm in Ridbach (at present Rzeck), but the applicant, his mother and his sister had left by ship in 1945 before the Red Army arrived. The grandmother was shot on the farm shortly afterwards by Red Army soldiers. Since the end of the war the applicant and other members of his family have not been allowed to return to their home and have been refused restitution. 19. In August 1946 the applicant's father and his family were driven at gunpoint from their house and market garden in Bad Charlottenbrunn (at present Jedlina-Zdrój) in Lower Silesia. Polish militiamen told them that they had to be in the street and ready to leave within an hour. They marched with others under police escort to the railway station, some five kilometres away, and various pieces of their luggage were stolen on the way. They were taken in goods wagons to the district town, Waldenburg (at present Wałbrzych), where they were again searched and lost more of their belongings. They were taken towards the Oder-Neisse crossing and from there to the Soviet occupation zone. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to his home and restitution has been refused. 20. The applicant submits that his parents' names had been entered in the Beuthen (at present Bytom in Poland) property register as half-share owners of two houses. They lived in, and did not flee, their home in Königsberg (at present Kaliningrad, in Russia) when the war ended. The applicant has never been able to find out what happened to his mother when the Red Army entered Königsberg. She was probably sentenced to forced labour and died in 1947. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to his property and restitution has been refused. 21. In February 1945 the applicant's grandparents still lived on their farm in Ober-Görrisseiffen (at present Płóczki Górne), in an area already occupied by Soviet troops. One evening, anti-aircraft batteries opened up in the area and the grandparents were ordered to start moving east. They packed essentials and secretly headed west, in the hope of joining other members of the family, following the German army as it retreated. When the war ended on 8 May 1945, they returned to Löwenberg (at present Lwówek Śląski), where their house was the only one not yet looted. At the end of June 1945, given the time to pack only the barest of essentials, they were taken away. Those who wanted to stay were arrested or immediately shot. After stopping in various places on the way, they eventually reached the West, getting as far as the Rhineland. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to her lost homeland and has been refused restitution. 22. On 3 March 1945 the applicant and his parents fled their property in Pomerania with other landowners to escape the approaching Red Army. They reached Testorf in Holstein on 23 March 1945. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to his home and has been refused restitution. 23. Until the end of the War, the applicant's mother lived on her farm in Schönhorst (at present Gniazdowo) in the region of the former Free City of Danzig. On 24 January 1945 she was ordered to leave. She fled with carts, heading west, eventually reaching Sittensen, in the Bremervörde district, in March 1945. The applicant has still not been allowed to return to her family home and restitution has been refused. 24. The applicant and her family were forced to leave their home in Treuburg (at present Olecko) to escape the advancing Red Army in January 1945. They fled, eventually reaching Berlin. They headed further west, and were overtaken by Soviet troops in Mecklenburg. They have still not been allowed to return to their home and have been refused restitution. 25. On 9 July 1947, the applicant's father and his family were forced to leave their 27.14 hectare farm in Lokau (at present Tłokowo). The applicant has still not been allowed to return to her home area, and has been refused restitution. 26. The applicant submits that his family were among those Germans who had not been deported by the Soviets but were expelled by the Poles from areas east of the Oder on 27 June 1945. They were allowed to take only bare essentials with them. The applicant's uncle (later declared dead on 31 December 1945) was not in Stolzenfelde (at present Stołeczna) at the time, and his wife had died there on 20 February 1945. They did not experience the expulsion – unlike the applicant and his surviving relatives, who have so far been refused rehabilitation and restitution. 27. The applicant's great-aunt and her family survived the heavy air raid on Swinemünde (at present Świnoujście), which took place on 12 March 1945, and were also left unharmed when the Red Army arrived on 5 May 1945. On 6 October 1945 Poland took over Swinemünde and Polish civilians started to attack and rob Germans. In April 1946 the Polish militia ordered the applicant and his mother to leave, taking only the barest personal essentials with them. The applicant's great-aunt and grandmother were at first unwilling to leave, but the threat of violence left them no choice and they eventually reached Stralsund in summer 1947. The applicant and his mother had already fled to Stralsund in April 1946. All members of his family have consistently been refused rehabilitation and restitution. 28. On 22 October 1944 the applicant and her parents fled their home village Moschenen (at present Możne) in the Treuburg District (at present the Olecko District). They reached the Sensburg (at present Mrągowo) District in East Prussia, but could get no further, since all the roads were blocked by refugees. They decided to return to the lodgings they had found in the Sensburg district, where they saw German civilians murdered when the Red Army arrived. One of the victims was the applicant's father, who was shot in early February 1945. In June 1945, the applicant and her mother set off for their home village of Moschenen, to see if their farm was still there, but the Poles who were already in possession of it immediately reported their arrival to the Soviet authorities in Treuburg. Threatened with shooting and unable to reclaim their farm, their only choice was again to flee. The family have been refused rehabilitation and restitution. 29. On 29 January 1945 the applicant and his parents fled their home in Heilsberg (at present Lidzbark Warmiński), escaping the advancing Red Army, first to Heiligenbeil (at present Mamanowo) and then, at the beginning of February 1945, to Danzig. When the Red Army entered on 27 or 28 March 1945 all refugees were ordered back to their homes. At the end of May 1945, the family set out on foot, with a handcart, for their home in Heilsberg. The parents' houses were still occupied by Soviet troops and the refugees were housed by relatives. At the end of July 1945 they were expelled from Poland, and taken by goods train via Bischoffsstein (at present Bisztynek) to Berlin, losing various belongings to thieves on the way. They eventually arrived at Beckum in Westphalia on 1 February 1946. The applicant, like his deceased relatives, has been refused rehabilitation and restitution. 30. Preußische Treuhand was founded in 2000 as a self-help organisation of “displaced persons from private German properties in the expulsion territories”. It seeks to secure and execute the restitution of the confiscated properties of Germans expelled from territories which after the Second World War became parts of various eastern European States, including Poland. Preußische Treuhand proclaims that it represents and promotes the ownership rights of single individuals and asserts them legally and commercially. 31. The Yalta Conference, which was held by the Allied leaders, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, from 4 to 11 February 1945, was devoted to the final strategy of the Second World War and the proposed future occupation of Germany. It was agreed that the new border between Poland and the Soviet Union would be drawn along the Curzon line, which meant that part of Poland's eastern border was to be fixed along the Bug River, whose central course formed part of that line, and that the Polish eastern provinces (at present, parts of Belarus, Lithuania and Ukraine) were to be annexed to the Soviet Union (see also paragraph 3 above). Poland was to be granted territorial compensation in the west. Stalin proposed the Oder-Neisse line as a new Polish-German border but the matter was eventually left for decision at the further conference, which was held in Potsdam. 32. The Potsdam Agreement, an agreement on policy for the occupation and reconstruction of Germany after the Second World War and the German surrender of 8 May 1945, adopted by the Three Heads of Government of the United States (USA), the United Kingdom (UK) and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (“the Three Powers”), set out, among other things, the principles governing war reparations from Germany (Chapter III: “Reparations from Germany”), the delimitation of the border with Poland (Chapter VIII B: “Western frontier of Poland”) and the repatriation of German nationals to Germany (Chapter XII: “Orderly transfer of German population”). The provisions of the chapter “Reparations from Germany” read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1. Reparation claims of the USSR shall be met by removals from the zone of Germany occupied by the USSR and from appropriate external German assets. 2. The USSR undertakes to settle the reparation claims of Poland from its own share of reparations.” The sub-chapter “Western frontier of Poland” reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “The three heads of Government agree that, pending the final determination of Poland's western frontier, the former German territories east of a line running from the Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinemünde, and thence along the Oder River to the confluence of the Western Neisse River and along the Western Neisse to the Czechoslovak frontier, including that portion of East Prussia not placed under the administration of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in accordance with the understanding reached at this conference and including the area of the former Free City of Danzig, shall be under the administration of the Polish State and for such purposes should not be considered as part of the Soviet zone of occupation in Germany.” The chapter “Orderly transfer of German populations” reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “The Three Governments, having considered the question in all its aspects, recognise that the transfer to Germany of German populations, or elements thereof, remaining in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, will have to be undertaken. They agree that any transfers that take place should be effected in an orderly and humane manner. Since the influx of a large number of Germans into Germany would increase the burden already resting on the occupying authorities, they consider that the Control Council in Germany should in the first instance examine the problem, with special regard to the question of the equitable distribution of these Germans among the several zones of occupation. They are accordingly instructing their respective representatives on the Control Council to report to their Governments as soon as possible the extent to which such persons have already entered Germany from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, to submit an estimate of the time and rate at which further transfers could be carried out having regard to the present situation in Germany. The Czechoslovak Government, the Polish Provisional Government and the Control Council in Hungary are at the same time being informed of the above and are being requested meanwhile to suspend further expulsions pending an examination by the Governments concerned of the report from their representatives on the Control Council.” 33. The issue of war reparations for Poland, which in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement were to be settled by the Soviet Union from its share (see paragraph 32 above), was resolved by a bilateral treaty between the USSR and Poland, namely the Agreement of 16 August 1945 between the Polish Provisional Government of National Unity and the government of the USSR on compensation for financial losses sustained during the German occupation (umowa między Tymczasowym Rządem Jedności Narodowej RP a Rządem ZSRR o wynagrodzeniu szkód finansowych wyrządzonych przez okupację niemiecką). Under the terms of the agreement, the USSR relinquished to Poland all its claims to German assets located on Polish territory, including the portion of German territory east of the Oder-Neisse line that was to be assigned to Poland. It was assumed that this treaty constituted an instrument for the implementation of the Potsdam Agreement and a basis for Poland's takeover of German property located in Poland within the borders as fixed by that Agreement. 34. The so-called “Treaty of Zgorzelec”, that is, the Agreement concerning the demarcation of the established and the existing Polish-German State frontier, was signed by the heads of government of the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic (“the former GDR”) in Zgorzelec (in German, Görlitz) on 6 July 1950. It recognised and acknowledged the Oder-Neisse line as referred to in the Potsdam Agreement as the border between Poland and the former GDR. The treaty, although considered valid and binding by the Contracting States, was not accepted by the authorities of the former Federal Republic of Germany (“the former FRG”). 35. The Treaty between the German Democratic Republic and the Polish People's Republic on the Delimitation of the Sea Area in the Oder Bay, concluded on 22 May 1989, was a subsequent instrument aimed at the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty of Zgorzelec concerning the Polish-German state border. It concerned the delimitation of the territorial sea, the continental shelf and the fishery zones of both States. 36. The Agreement between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the basis for normalisation of their mutual relations, also called the Treaty of Warsaw (in German, Warschauer Vertrag), was an agreement concluded by the former FRG and Poland on 7 December 1970. It was ratified by the FRG's Parliament (Bundestag) on 17 May 1972. Under the terms of that Treaty, the parties committed themselves to non-violence, affirming that any disputes between them were to be resolved by peaceful means, that they would refrain from the use, or the threat, of force and that they would take steps aimed at full normalisation and further development of their mutual relations. Article 1 of the Treaty read: “(1) The Federal Republic of Germany and Polish People's Republic state in mutual agreement that the existing boundary line, the course of which is laid down in Chapter IX of the decisions of the Potsdam Conference of 2 August 1945 as running from the Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinemünde, and thence along the Oder River to the confluence of the Western Neisse River and along the Western Neisse to the Czechoslovak frontier, shall constitute the western State frontier of the Polish People's Republic. (2) They reaffirm the inviolability of their existing frontiers now and in the future and undertake to respect each other's territorial integrity without restriction. (3) They declare that they have no territorial claims whatsoever against each other and that they will not assert such claims in the future.” 37. After German reunification by virtue of the Unification Treaty (Einigungsvertrag) of 31 August 1990, the frontier between Poland and Germany, as established under the Potsdam Agreement and endorsed by further treaties with former separate German States, was confirmed by the Treaty of 14 November 1990 in the following way: “The Contracting Parties reaffirm the frontier between them, whose course is defined in the Agreement between the Polish Republic and the German Democratic Republic concerning the demarcation of the established and existing Polish-German State frontier of 6 July 1950 and agreements concluded with a view to implementing and supplementing the Agreement (Instrument confirming the demarcation of the State frontier between Poland and Germany of 27 January 1951; Agreement between the Polish People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic regarding the delimitation of the sea areas in the Oder Bay of 22 May 1989, as well as the Agreement between the Polish People's Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany concerning the basis for normalisation of their mutual relations of 7 December 1970).” “The Contracting Parties declare that the frontier between them is inviolable now and in future and mutually pledge to respect unconditionally their sovereignty and territorial integrity.” “The Contracting Parties declare that they have no territorial claims against each other and they shall not put forward such claims in future.” 38. Under section 1 of the 1945 Act, any movable or immovable property which in connection with the war that began on 1 September 1939 was not in the possession of its owners or their legal heirs or representatives was considered abandoned property. Section 2 stated that any movable or immovable property which had been owned or possessed by the German State and on the date of the entry into force of the 1945 Act had not yet been taken over by the Polish authorities, as well as property of German citizens or persons who had defected, was considered “derelict property” for the purposes of that Act. Under section 5 of the 1945 Act, all abandoned or derelict property was placed under State administration. In contrast to German – “derelict” – property, abandoned property could be repossessed by the owners or their close relatives on application. 39. The March 1946 Decree replaced the 1945 Act. It entered into force on 19 April 1946 and was repealed on 1 August 1985. As regards the two types of property referred to therein, “abandoned” covered mostly property owned by Jews in Poland, possession of which they had lost in consequence of the war and the Holocaust, whereas “post-German” covered property owned by the German Reich and German natural and legal persons. “Abandoned property” was defined by section 1 of the March 1946 Decree. This provision read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “1(1). Any property (movable or immovable) of persons who in connection with the war that began on 1 September 1939 lost and did not subsequently recover possession of it shall be considered abandoned property within the meaning of this Decree.” Under sections 15 et seq., owners of abandoned property could apply for, and obtain, its restoration. The deadline for making such applications was set at 31 December 1948. The State acquired ownership of such property by prescription within five years (as regards movables) and ten years (as regards immovable property), which started running “at the end of the calendar year in which the war ended”. Pursuant to section 2, “post-German” property was to be taken over by the State and neither compensation nor restoration procedures applied. Section 2 read, in so far as relevant, as follows: “2(1). By virtue of the law, any of the following kinds of property shall, in its entirety, be taken over by the State Treasury: (a) belonging to the German Reich and the former Free City of Gdańsk; (b) belonging to citizens of the German Reich and the former Free City of Gdańsk; (c) belonging to German and Gdańsk legal persons, except public-law legal persons; (d) belonging to companies controlled by German or Gdańsk citizens or by the German or Gdańsk administration; (e) belonging to persons who have defected. 2(2) The preceding provision shall not apply to the necessary personal items belonging to the persons referred to in subsections (a) and (b).” 40. The September 1946 Decree entered into force on 14 October 1946 and, although amended on several occasions, has not yet been repealed. Pursuant to section 1, all agricultural and forest land (the latter if its surface exceeded 25 hectares), except for land already owned by natural persons, was designated for securing a pool of property for Polish citizens who moved there within the framework of the “settlement action” carried out by the authorities. The action concerned mostly persons resettled from the former eastern provinces of Poland beyond the Bug River, taken over by the Soviet Union (see paragraph 3 above). 41. This was the final decree on the expropriation of property of German persons. Its purpose was to secure the definite takeover of property which might not have been covered by the previous expropriation laws.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
113,001-22631,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,C.M. v. FRANCE,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, C. M., is a French national, born in 1939 and living in Grande Synthe (France). He is represented before the Court by Mr W. Watel, a lawyer practising in Lille. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is the owner of a private motor vehicle which he also uses in the course of his professional activities with the permission, granted on 1 October 1991, of the regional director for industry, research and the environment. On 22 September 1994 the applicant’s son, accompanied by a friend, was driving the car when he was stopped for a customs inspection. The customs officers found nineteen grams of heroin, whereupon the applicant’s son and his friend admitted that they had been to the Netherlands to acquire drugs for their personal use. On 23 September 1994 the Lille Criminal Court convicted the applicant’s son of drug smuggling and drug use. The Court also ordered that the vehicle used to commit the smuggling offence should be forfeited to the customs authorities. The applicant’s son lodged an appeal against the judgment relating solely to the forfeiture of the vehicle. On 18 January 1995 the Douai Court of Appeal upheld the judgment ordering the forfeiture on the following grounds: “The vehicle was lawfully seized under Article 323 of the Customs Code. Under Article 414 of the Customs Code, any smuggling offence involving prohibited goods results in the forfeiture of the vehicle. Liability to forfeiture is incurred whenever an offence has been committed (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division – “Cass. Crim.”, 1980). Moreover, it is clear that the vehicle was used to commit the offence. The case law provides the following clarification of the position: – The statutory provision requiring the forfeiture of vehicles used for smuggling is general and absolute and makes no exception in respect of vehicles without which it would have been impossible to bring smuggled goods in or out. It suffices that they were used in one way or another. (Cass. Crim. 1956) – Courts which find that a vehicle was used for smuggling cannot refrain from ordering their forfeiture save where they find extenuating circumstances as provided by Article 369 of the Customs Code, which makes no reference to Article 463 of the former Criminal Code and is not covered by section 323 of Law no. 92-1336 of 16 December 1992. Accordingly, this court allows the authorities’ application and upholds the judgment of the Lille Criminal Court since, in view of the seriousness of the offences of which he is accused, [the applicant’s son] is not entitled to plead extenuating circumstances under customs law.” The applicant was not notified of either the judgment of 23 September 1994 or that of 18 January 1995. In a letter of 30 September 1994 the applicant’s lawyer asked the customs authorities to return the applicant’s private vehicle to him along with some personal effects (a pair of gloves, a pair of hunting boots, two knives and a pack of cards). On 28 October 1994 the applicant’s lawyer sent a further letter repeating his request and stating that the applicant refused to pay any sum, however small, to recover his vehicle. In a letter of 18 November 1994 the interregional director of customs stated that the applicant could recover his personal effects, as he had already been told during a telephone conversation on 26 September 1994. Regarding the vehicle, the director informed him that he was “prepared to accept a friendly settlement for the transfer of the vehicle ... in return for payment in cash of FRF 3,000 (three thousand francs)”. The relevant provisions of the Customs Code read as follows: “1. When seized goods are not prohibited an offer to release the vehicle from judicial seizure shall be made subject to security from a reliable guarantor or deposit of the value. 2. That offer and the reply thereto shall be recorded in the official report. 3. The vehicle shall be returned without the need for a guarantor or a deposit to any owner acting in good faith who has entered into a haulage, rental or leasing contract with the offender in accordance with the laws and regulations in force and the normal practice of the profession. However, restitution is subject to the reimbursement of any costs incurred by the customs authorities for the holding and safe keeping of the seized vehicle.” “District courts shall adjudicate disputes relating to the payment or reimbursement of duties, applications to set aside an order to pay and other customs cases not falling within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts.” “1. Seized or forfeited objects may not be claimed by the owners, nor may the value of the vehicle, whether deposited or not, be claimed by creditors, including secured creditors, save through action against the party who committed the customs offence. 2. Once time limits for lodging appeals, third party applications and sales have expired, all actions for restitution and other actions shall be inadmissible.” The relevant provisions of the Code of Judicial Organisation read as follows: “District Courts shall hear the following cases, subject to appeal: (9) Disputes relating to refusal to pay customs duties, applications to set aside an order to pay, failure to discharge liabilities imposed by transit bonds and other customs cases; ...” Finance Amendment Law no. 81-1179 of 31 December 1981 amended Article 326 of the Customs Code by adding a third paragraph providing for the establishment of an exceptional procedure where owners have acted in good faith. The reform was intended to resolve problems in applying Article 376 § 1 resulting from the increase in vehicle rental and leasing contracts by allowing the situation of various vehicle rental, leasing and public transport or freight companies to be resolved by absolving them from guarantor and deposit requirements as long as there was proof of good faith and a contract had been negotiated. This statutory system has been progressively supplemented by case-law. The Court of Cassation has clarified that this was the only legal remedy that an owner acting in good faith could use to have his vehicle restored as a civil claim in criminal proceedings against a person who had committed a customs offence would be inadmissible because the loss or damage complained of was not the direct result of the offences at issue (Cass. Crim., 6 March 1989, Bulletin criminel – “Bull. crim.” no. 101). On 12 January 1987 the Criminal Division also established the principle that paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 326 should be read separately: “Under Article 326 § 3 of the Customs Code, the vehicle must be returned without the need for a guarantor or a deposit to any owner acting in good faith who has entered into a haulage, rental or leasing contract with the offender in accordance with the laws and regulations in force and the normal practice of the profession, regardless of the nature of the goods transported.” (Bull. crim. no. 8). Furthermore, in a judgment of 9 April 1991 the Court of Cassation established the principle that the district courts had jurisdiction to hear applications for restitution under Articles 326 and 341 bis-2 of the Customs Code which, when combined with Article 357 of the Code, “assign[ed] jurisdiction to rule on the restitution of vehicles seized during these operations to the district court of the place in which the seizure took place. Under these circumstances and provided that the ship-owner was not implicated in the criminal proceedings the impugned judgment rightly upheld the District Court’s decision that it had jurisdiction”. In this ruling the Court of Cassation also specified that the provisions of Article 326 applied both to the seizure carried out by the customs authorities and to the forfeiture ordered by the courts and moreover that the civil courts were under no obligation to defer their decision pending the outcome of the criminal proceedings. “Under certain circumstances specified therein, Article 362 § 3 of the Customs Code entitles owners acting in good faith of vehicles seized because they were used for smuggling to have their vehicle returned without the need for a guarantor or a deposit even when a criminal court has ordered their forfeiture. It follows that criminal proceedings during which such orders are issued cannot have any influence on any future decisions in civil proceedings to establish ownership.” (Cass. Crim. 9 April 1991, Bull. crim. no. 125; JCP 1991-IV, p. 226). The jurisdiction of the district courts was reconfirmed in a judgment of 21 February 1995 (Crassat case) in the following terms: “District courts hear disputes relating to the payment or reimbursement of duties, applications to set aside an order to pay and other customs cases not falling within the jurisdiction of the criminal courts. Under Articles 356 and 357 of the Customs Code, the criminal courts hear cases relating to petty and lesser indictable customs offences and all customs matters raised as a defence. It follows that the district courts have primary jurisdiction to hear these cases provided that they fall within the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts.” In this judgement, the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation also extended the scope of Article 326 § 3, taking the view that this provision allowed any vehicle to be returned to owners acting in good faith, without the need for a guarantor or a deposit, even if there was no contract between the owner and the offender who had used the vehicle.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
114,001-23062,ENG,GRC,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,KARABOUYIOUKLOU v. GREECE,4,Inadmissible,Françoise Tulkens,"The applicant, Mr Retzep Karabouyiouklou, is a Greek national, who was born in 1959 and lives in Xanthi. The Government are represented by Mr V. Kyriazopoulos and Mr D. Kalogiros of the Legal Council of the State, Acting Agents. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant, who considers himself a member of the Muslim Turkish minority of Thrace, is a graduate of the Special Academy for Teachers of Thessaloniki. He used to work as a teacher in the minority schools of Thrace. His conditions of employment were not different from those of other civil servants. On 18 January 1993 the Minority Schools Office of the Prefecture of Rodopi called all the Muslim teachers of the minority schools of Rodopi to attend an educational meeting on 1 February 1993. The aim of the meeting was to present new books for the teaching of the Turkish language, which would be delivered to the directors of the schools between 2 and 5 February 1993. A similar order was issued on 19 January 1993 by the Minority Schools Office of the Prefecture of Xanthi. On 26 January 1993 the Co-ordination Committee of the Highest Council of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace issued a statement to the effect that the content of these books “was in breach of the autonomy of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace” and failed to respect certain international agreements. The Muslim teachers were called upon not to collect these books and the Muslim pupils not to attend school between 1 and 5 February 1993, in order to voice the protest of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace. On 29 January 1993 the Union of Turkish Teachers of Western Thrace issued a statement to the effect that the Turkish schools of Western Thrace would be closed between 1 and 5 February 1993, because the Turkish teachers of Western Thrace were against the Turkish language books which the Greek State intended to distribute to the pupils of the minority schools. The statement also said that all the Turkish Muslim teachers of Western Thrace would participate in the strike. Reference was made to the members of the Union of Teachers of Western Thrace who were graduates of the Special Academy for Teachers of Thessaloniki. The statement specified that all those who felt they were Turkish and who wanted to learn or teach the Turkish language would take part in the boycott. On an unspecified date, a Muslim religious leader, the mufti of Xanthi, called on the Muslim teachers who felt they were Turkish, not to go to the presentation of the books on 1 February 1993. On 1 February 1993 eleven teachers of the minority schools of Xanthi, including the applicant, signed a statement to the effect that they would not attend the educational meeting in the Minority Schools Office of the Prefecture of Xanthi in order to protest about certain unfair decisions against them concerning posting, transfer and secondment and their exclusion from training seminars in Thessaloniki and Strasbourg. They specified that they would not carry out their duties between 1 and 5 February 1993. On 5 February 1993 the Executive Committee of the Highest Council of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace issued a statement congratulating the pupils and teachers who took part in the mobilisation which showed the length to which the minority was prepared to go in order to vindicate its rights. On 8 February 1993 the Minority Schools Office of the Prefecture of Xanthi decided to institute disciplinary proceedings under Article 206 § 1 of the Civil Servants’ Code against thirteen minority school teachers, including the applicant, for having failed to attend the educational meeting of 1 February 1993. On 10 February 1993 the Regional Disciplinary Board of Xanthi ordered an inquiry and decided provisionally to suspend the applicant from his duties for a year pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings against him. On 31 March 1993 the Ministry of Education confirmed the decision of the Regional Disciplinary Board of Xanthi regarding the provisional suspension of the applicant from his duties. On 5 April 1994 the Regional Disciplinary Board of Xanthi issued a decision in which it considered the following: – Firstly, the applicant had been asked by his superiors to attend the educational meeting of 1 February 1993 but had failed to do so, arguing that attending the meeting would have disrupted his relationship with his pupils and their parents and put his personal integrity in danger. However, the Board considered that this excuse was not valid, because the meeting would have taken place in the city of Xanthi far from the applicant’s school area. Moreover, the applicant took part in the strike between 1 and 5 February 1993 complying with the order and appeal of the irregular Co-ordination Committee of the Highest Council of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace and the appeal of the illegally self-proclaimed mufti of Xanthi calling on the Muslim teachers who felt they were Turkish not to attend the meeting of 1 February 1993. He had accused the State of persecuting him. His illegal acts had contributed to creating tension and commotion in the minority community. The applicant had allied himself with certain subversive elements in the minority community who falsely contended that there was no equality before the law in Western Thrace. Thus, he had become an agent of foreign anti-Greek powers. These facts constituted the following disciplinary offences: not having faith in and dedication to his country (Article 206 § 1–1 of the Civil Servants’ Code), refusing to discharge his duties or employing obstructive tactics (Article 206 § 1–19 of the Code), taking part in a strike in breach of Article 23 § 2 of the Constitution and the relevant legislation (Article 206 § 1–20 of the Code) and intentionally engaging in an act or omission which could damage or endanger the interests of the State (Article 206 § 1–27 of the Code). – Secondly, the applicant had publicly criticised the Ministry of Education on the ground that the new books were distributed in breach of international agreements concluded by Greece. As a result, he had committed the disciplinary offence of criticising the actions of his superiors in public using phraseology which showed lack of respect or intentionally using unfounded arguments (Article 206 § 1–6 of the above-mentioned Code). – Thirdly, the applicant had become an organ of irregular committees acting against the interests of the nation. His actions had stirred up trouble in the minority community and had led to the involvement of Turkish newspapers, to tension between the two countries, and to criminal proceedings being instituted against parents who had disrupted the functioning of the schools. As a result, the applicant had committed the disciplinary offence of failing to respect a duty imposed by criminal law (Article 206 § 1–28 of the Code). The Board was fully satisfied that the applicant “acting in full conscience and with intent and malice, behaving in a manner incompatible with [his] status as civil servant, acting against the nation and obeying the commands of anti-Greek power structures, aimed at destabilising the region where the situation was until then normal and creating social unrest”. In the light of all the above, the Board decided to dismiss the applicant. On 7 April 1994 the Prefect of Xanthi ordered the applicant’s dismissal by virtue of Article 12 of Presidential Decree no. 1024/1979. Under that decree, pertaining to the appointment and career of Muslim teachers in the minority schools of Thrace, the Prefect is the competent authority to pronounce the termination of service of Muslim teachers. On 30 May 1994 the applicant challenged the decision of the Disciplinary Board and the Prefect’s decision before the Council of State. He claimed that he did not lack faith in and dedication to his country, that he had not acted against social order, that he had the right to engage in objective and reasonable criticism of the actions of his superiors or the Government, that he had not refused to discharge his duties but had instead participated in a lawful strike, that he had not engaged in any acts which could have caused damage to the State or in any criminal offences, that he had been forced not to collect the books in person because his life had been threatened by other Muslims, that the Board had attributed wrong motives to his actions which were not anti-Greek and that his punishment aimed at his destruction. He further submitted that the hearing before the Disciplinary Board had not been preceded by a proper inquiry, that he had been punished for offences which were not mentioned in the decision instituting proceedings against him and that the Board had not heard a number of witnesses he had proposed. Finally, the applicant argued that the decision of the Board was not duly reasoned in that it failed to specify how his actions amounted to the particular disciplinary offences which should be punished with the particular penalty. On 22 June 1995 the Council of State rejected the applicant’s appeal against the decision of the Disciplinary Board of 5 April 1994. The Council considered that the inquiry ordered on 10 February 1993 satisfied the requirements of the law and that the Board had not failed to examine any witnesses proposed by the applicant. The Council also considered that the applicant could not be punished for facts other than those which were mentioned in the decision of 8 February 1993 by which the disciplinary proceedings had been instituted. The applicant could only be punished for having failed to attend the educational meeting of 1 February 1993. However, the Disciplinary Board and the Council of State remained free to examine these facts under different legal provisions from those mentioned in the decision instituting disciplinary proceedings. The Council considered that the applicant’s failure to attend the meeting of 1 February 1993 in order to participate in the strike between 1 and 5 February 1993 amounted to the disciplinary offence of serious disobedience under Article 207 § 4–10 of the Civil Servants’ Code. The Council found that the punishment imposed was appropriate given the circumstances in which the offence had taken place. The Council referred in this connection to the statement of 26 January 1993 of the Co-ordination Committee of the Highest Council of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace, the statement of 29 January 1993 of the Union of Turkish Teachers of Western Thrace and the statement of the mufti of Xanthi which called on all the Muslim teachers who considered themselves Turkish not to attend the educational meeting of 1 February 1993. The Council considered that the applicant had obviously associated his failure to comply with the order to attend the educational meeting with the above-mentioned statements of organisations which purported to represent the self-proclaimed Turkish minority of Western Thrace. Seen in the light of the above, the applicant’s actions had had as a result the disruption of the functioning of the minority schools in Western Thrace in which the State was particularly interested. They had also resulted in social unrest among the Muslim minority of this sensitive region. This in turn could have resulted in dangerous albeit unwarranted disruption of the friendly relations between Greece and neighbouring countries and in the disruption of the harmonious coexistence between the Greek citizens, Muslim and Christian, who lived in Western Thrace. Finally, the Council considered that the decision of the Board was duly reasoned. All the elements of the disciplinary offence of serious disobedience were set out in the decision which specified that the applicant had not attended the meeting of 1 February 1993, although he had been asked to do so by his superiors. The decision also specified that the applicant had complied with the order and appeal of the irregular Coordination Committee of the Highest Council of the Muslim Turkish Minority of Western Thrace and the appeal of the illegally self-proclaimed mufti of Xanthi calling on the Muslim teachers who felt they were Turkish not to attend the meeting of 1 February 1993 (decision no. 3597/1995). On 4 December 1995 the Prefect of Xanthi revoked his decision of 7 April 1994 and, in compliance with decision no. 3597/1995 of the Council of State, ordered the applicant’s dismissal as from the same date. On 4 April 1996 the Council of State struck out the proceedings instituted against the Prefect’s decision of 7 April 1994, on the ground that the decision complained of had already been revoked by the Prefect (decision no. 1717/1996). On 4 December 1997 the Prefect ordered for the third time the applicant’s dismissal. On 16 March 1998 the applicant appealed against the Prefect’s decision of 4 December 1997 to the Administrative Court of Appeal of Komotini. He claimed that all other civil servants were dismissed by ministerial decision and complained that his dismissal by prefectural decision was contrary to religious freedom. He further complained that he was not previously heard by the Prefect. The applicant further invoked Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention and 1 of Protocol No. 1. On 13 June 2000 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the appeal (decision no. 174/2000). The court held that, by definition, the Prefect had a better knowledge of the local situation than the Minister; therefore, it could not be sustained that the delegation to the Prefect to pronounce the termination of service of Muslim teachers violated the religious freedom. Moreover, the court held that the Prefect’s decision aimed at complying with the relevant decisions of the Council of State; therefore, the previous hearing of the applicant was not required. The applicant did not appeal against this decision to the Council of State. The applicant claims that he has instituted civil and administrative proceedings in order to recover several sums (arrears of salaries, compensation for his dismissal, etc.). The applicant alleges that a set of proceedings instituted on 30 June 1997 before the First Instance Court of Rodopi is still pending. He further alleges that on 12 October 1998 the Minority Schools Office notified to him a decision of the Minister of Education that his pecuniary claims had been statute-barred. On 2 September 1997 the applicant instituted proceedings also before the First Instance Administrative Court of Komotini. On 28 December 2001 the court noted that the applicant had perceived his salaries for a certain period after his dismissal. It declared his recourse inadmissible on the ground that the applicant was not duly represented by a lawyer (decision no. 280/2001). The applicant did not appeal against this decision within the sixty days time-limit provided for by the Code of Administrative Proceedings.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

HUNGARY,3,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - award,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Guido Raimondi;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria,"5. The applicant is a company limited by shares with its seat in Budapest. 6. By way of assignments for consideration, done in October 2001 and July 2002, the applicant acquired – through intermediaries – the debts of V. Rt and M. Rt from the Tax Authority. The debts consisted mostly of unpaid payroll taxes and social security contributions and originated in the period before 1998. 7. Since the debtors had become insolvent, the applicant brought an action against the State-owned Hungarian Privatisation and State Holding Company (ÁPV Rt) before the Budapest Regional Court in order to recover the assigned claims. Relying on section 328 of the (Old) Companies Act 1988, it argued that ÁPV Rt – the majority owner of the two debtor companies – bore vicarious liability for the outstanding debts. 8. On 25 September 2003 the Regional Court partly found for the applicant. The court awarded some 47.3 million Hungarian forints (HUF) to the applicant, which corresponded to the debts of V. Rt other than the payroll taxes and social security contributions. It dismissed the action in respect of the latter items. The applicant was obliged to pay HUF 9.6 million to the respondent in legal fees. 9. The applicant appealed. It claimed 22,482,500 Hungarian forints (HUF) plus accrued interest on account of the remaining debts of V. Rt and HUF 177,975,985 plus accrued interest on account of those of M. Rt. 10. The Budapest Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance decision on 9 July 2004. The applicant was obliged to pay HUF 3 million as procedural fees. 11. The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court in respect of the social security contributions owed by M. Rt. It submitted that their amount altogether was approximately HUF 160 million – a sum including the principal of HUF 84,515,225 – but susceptible to further taking of evidence in resumed proceedings. 12. On 5 April 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. It was satisfied that ÁPV Rt indeed bore vicarious liability in the circumstances. Relying on Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE, it held however that – pursuant to sections 3(3) and 25(2) of the (Old) Taxation Order Act 1990 – for the impugned social security contributions to be enforceable by the applicant, a decision should have been issued by the Tax Authority establishing the vicarious liability. For want of such a decision, the contributions could not be enforced by the applicant, since the assignment had not conferred any public law powers on it. The applicant was obliged to pay once more HUF 3 million as procedural fee. 13. Section 328 of the (Old) Companies Act 1988 provided as follows: “(1) If [the majority-owner, i.e. controlling] joint-stock company acquires such part of the shares of [the controlled joint-stock company] as exceeding three-fourth of [the latter's] share capital, the board of directors of the controlling ... company ... may give instructions concerning the management of the [controlled] ... company to [its] board of directors, which the latter must carry out (“joint-stock company under direct control”). (2) The controlling ... company shall bear unlimited liability for the debts of the joint-stock company under direct control.” 14. Section 3(3) c) of the (Old) Taxation Order Act 1990 (no. XCI of 1990) (as in force at the material time) provides that the Act is to be applied to the payment of social security contributions. Section 25(2) f) provides that, if a taxpayer fails to pay the tax and it cannot be recovered from that taxpayer, the Tax Authority is entitled to the adoption of a decision establishing vicarious liability to cover the outstanding debt. Sections 6(1) and 6(2), 35(2)f) and 120(1)a) of the (New) Taxation Order Act 2003 (no. XCII of 2003) contain identical rules. 15. The interpretation that assignees cannot claim in civil courts outstanding taxes from those with vicarious liability was upheld by the Supreme Court in Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE. It considered that, under both Taxation Order Acts, vicarious liability for tax debts was to be established by a decision of the Tax Authority. 16. However, the above legislation was subsequently repealed by Act no. LVI of 2005. According to the reasoning of the bill, the interpretation of the Supreme Court in Uniformity Decision no. 2/2004.PJE – an economically unjustified misconception of the law running counter to the intentions of the lawmaker – rendered unenforceable and thus worthless those tax debts which could not be recovered in the liquidation of the original debtors. Therefore the legal avenue of a civil action was to be opened for the assignees of such claims vis-à-vis those with vicarious liability, so as to restore constitutionality in terms of the right to access to a court in this context.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, aged sixty three, would not become eligible for a State pension until he was sixty five, whereas a woman could claim a State pension from age sixty. He was currently unemployed but if he returned to work he and any potential employer would be liable to make national insurance contributions. 9. On 4 February 2002, the applicant issued proceedings for damages in the High Court against the Benefits Agency, alleging inter alia that the refusal to pay him a pension from the age of sixty was discriminatory. On 2 October 2002, the applicant’s claim was struck out on the basis that the particulars of claim disclosed no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim (Civil Procedure Rule 3.4.2.). On 27 February 2003, permission to appeal was refused. 10. Section 122 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 defines “pensionable age” as: “(a) the age of 65, in the case of a man; and (b) the age of 60, in the case of a woman”. 11. Section 126 of the Pensions Act 1995 provides for the equalisation of State pension ages for men and women to the age of 65. The State pension age for women will increase gradually from 2010 and the equalisation will be complete in 2020. At the same time, the age until which women are liable to pay national insurance contributions will gradually increase in line with the increase in the State pension age. 12. Council Directive 79/7/EEC of 19 December 1978 provides for the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. However, in Article 7(1)(a) the Directive provides for derogation in the matter of “the determination of pensionable age for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and the possible consequences therefore for other benefits”. 13. In Case C-9/91 The Queen v. Secretary of State for Social Security, ex parte Equal Opportunities Commission [1992] ECR 1-4297 (“the EOC case” concerning a reference for a preliminary ruling from the High Court), the European Court of Justice found that: Article 7(1)a had to be interpreted as authorising the determination of a statutory pensionable age which differs according to sex for the purposes of granting old-age and retirement pensions and also forms of discrimination which are necessarily linked to that difference; Inequality between men and women with respect to the length of contribution periods required to obtain a pension constitutes such discrimination where, having regard to the financial equilibrium of the national pension system in the context in which it appears, it cannot be dissociated from a difference in pensionable age; In view of the advantages allowed to women by national pension systems, in particular as regards statutory pensionable age and length of contribution periods, and the disruption that would necessarily be caused to the equilibrium of those systems if the principle of equality between the sexes were to be applied from one day to the next in respect of those periods, the Community legislature intended to authorise the progressive implementation of that principle by the member States and that progressive nature could not be ensured if the scope of the derogation authorised by Article 7(1)a were to be interpreted restrictively.",[],[],[],"['14', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],0

The Russian Government were initially represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Mrs V. Milinchuk. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was questioned by the police in the absence of his lawyer and confessed to the murder of his wife. Before the questioning he had made a handwritten statement that he did not need legal assistance. On 29 May 1998 the Klintsovskiy District Court of the Bryansk Region convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to fourteen years’ imprisonment. The applicant was assisted by legal-aid counsel. The applicant appealed. In his grounds of appeal he advanced the defence of irresistible impulse and asked for a more lenient sentence. He also applied for free legal representation because he did not have sufficient means to retain counsel. He relied on Article 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see below). By letter of 23 April 2003, a deputy President of the Bryansk Regional Court rejected the applicant’s request for free legal assistance because “there were no right to free legal representation before appeal courts”. On 25 April 2003 the Bryansk Regional Court upheld the conviction on appeal but reduced the sentence to twelve years’ imprisonment. The applicant was not assisted by counsel. On 9 March 2006 a deputy Prosecutor General lodged an application for supervisory review with the Presidium of the Bryansk Regional Court. He submitted that the Bryansk Regional Court had infringed the applicant’s right to free legal representation. On 26 April 2006 the Presidium of the Bryansk Regional Court granted the prosecutor’s application, finding that the refusal to provide the applicant with free legal representation at the appeal hearing had violated the rights of the defence. It quashed the appeal judgment of 25 April 2003 and remitted the case for a fresh examination before the Bryansk Regional Court. On 7 July 2006 the Bryansk Regional Court held a new appeal hearing. It upheld the applicant’s conviction but reduced the sentence to eleven years’ imprisonment. On 29 December 2006 the applicant was released on parole.

RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Elisabeth Steiner;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev,"The applicant, Mr Pavel Vasilyevich Zaytsev, is a Russian national who was born in 1970 and lives in Moscow. He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Gofshteyn, a lawyer practising in Moscow. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and subsequently by their Representative, Mr G. Matyushkin. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. Since 1999 the applicant has been working as a special investigator for important cases at the Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior. On 7 September 2000 the Chief Department of the Interior of the Moscow Region started an investigation into a case concerning customs and financial fraud involving a group of companies which were allegedly affiliated with various high-ranking State officials. On 9 October 2000 the fraud case was assigned to the applicant, and from 22 October 2000 he was in charge of the investigation team working on this case. The investigation involved surveillance and telephone interception; the applicant claims that he also received instructions from his superior to conduct searches, if necessary without prior authorisation, under the extraordinary powers provided for in urgent cases. On 10 and 15 November 2000 the applicant, acting under his own authority, ordered a series of urgent searches. The searches were carried out on 12, 16 and 19 November 2000. Two suspects were arrested but both were released three days later. On 22 November 2000 the office of the Prosecutor General notified the Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior that “some unlawful searches and arrests had taken place in connection with the [fraud] case” and withdrew the case file from the Ministry of the Interior. The Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior carried out an internal enquiry and concluded that there had been no abuse of authority on the part of the applicant. The applicant alleged that certain documents disappeared from the case file as soon as the Prosecutor General’s Office took over the case. On 20 December 2000 the Prosecutor General instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant on charges of abuse of official powers and ordering unlawful arrest (Article 286 § 1 and Article 301 § 1 of the Criminal Code), on account of the above searches and arrests. Between 8 February 2001 and 18 February 2001 the applicant was under an obligation not to leave the city. The recognisance not to leave the city was renewed on 6 June 2001 and remained in force until the date of his conviction, 3 November 2003. On 17 February 2001 the Minister of the Interior sent a letter to the Prosecutor General in which he contested the charges against the applicant. He alleged that the searches were necessary and that the applicant’s decision to proceed without prior authorisation was made in accordance with the law and was justified by the special circumstances. He also contended that a persecution of the investigators had been orchestrated by the suspects in the fraud case, through certain contacts within the Prosecutor General’s Office, and that the same persons had attempted to have the fraud case file closed. The Minister of the Interior requested the Prosecutor General to end the proceedings against the applicant. On 7 May 2001 the Prosecutor General discontinued criminal proceedings in the fraud case. On 6 June 2001 the applicant was indicted on charges of exceeding official powers and ordering unlawful arrest. On 8 June 2001 a newly appointed Minister of the Interior wrote to the Prosecutor General restating, in substance, his predecessor’s letter of 17 February 2001. On 28 June 2001 the Deputy Prosecutor General replied to the Minister of the Interior that the criminal proceedings against the applicant had been instituted lawfully and reasonably. On 29 October 2001 the criminal case against the applicant was submitted to the Moscow City Court. At first the Moscow City Court President assigned the case to judge N.G., but owing to the latter’s heavy workload it was transferred to judge M.K. On 14 February 2002 the President of the Security Committee of the State Duma made an official inquiry about the state of proceedings against the applicant, in reply to which the Prosecutor General allegedly stated “I will lock him up”. On 13 March 2002 the State Duma issued a Resolution entitled “Parliamentary Question to the Prosecutor General, V.V. Ustinov, about the Circumstances surrounding the Investigation into the case concerning the Smuggling of Furniture into the Russian Federation”. The Resolution read as follows: “On 7 September 2000 the Chief Department of the Interior of the Moscow Region opened criminal proceedings concerning the fraudulent import of furniture into the Russian Federation through a shell [company], following a finding by the State Customs Committee that there had been a breach of customs rules. ... the Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior started its investigation. The Ministry of the Interior and the State Customs Committee set up a joint investigation group which made important progress in investigating the facts of furniture smuggling ... Subsequently the case file was reclaimed by the Prosecutor General’s Office and the case was transferred to the special investigator for important cases at the Prosecutor General’s office, who decided to terminate the proceedings for a lack of corpus delicti. The Prosecutor General’s Office also instituted criminal proceedings against P. V. Zaytsev, the investigator of the Investigation Board of the Ministry of Interior who investigated the [case of fraud], and charged him with having ordered searches and arrests in breach of the procedure prescribed by law, ... ... To ensure a fair and objective assessment of this situation, and further to a proposal by the Prosecutor General, a joint expert group was set up, in which the Prosecutor General’s Office, the State Customs Committee of the Russian Federation and the Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior took part. ... On 14 February 2002 the Security Committee of the State Duma heard the report of the joint expert group. The President of the State Customs Committee, the acting Chief of the Investigation Board of the Ministry of the Interior and the experts representing these agencies, who were all present at the meeting, expressed their disagreement with the termination of the [fraud investigation], having noted that the special investigator for important cases at the Prosecutor General’s Office had failed to examine a number of substantive issues ... Having regard to the above, the [State Duma] requests that [the Prosecutor General] resumes criminal proceedings in the case concerning the smuggling of furniture into the Russian Federation ...” The Prosecutor General did not resume the criminal proceedings requested by the State Duma. These proceedings were resumed only in 2006. In the meantime the criminal case against the applicant had continued. On 5 September 2002 the Moscow City Court, composed of judge M.K. and two lay assessors, examined the case and acquitted the applicant of all charges. On 25 February 2003 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation granted an appeal by the public prosecutor and reversed the acquittal, on the grounds that the court’s conclusion had been self-contradictory. It remitted the case for fresh examination by the first-instance court in a different composition. On 23 April 2003 that court, composed of Ms Kudeshkina as judge, and two lay assessors, Ms G. and Ms V.K., began to examine the case. Ms G. and Ms V.K. were subsequently replaced for unknown reasons. On 24 April 2003 the hearing was adjourned on the grounds of the applicant’s illness. On 24 June 2003 the court, composed of judge Kudeshkina and two newly appointed lay assessors, Ms I. and Ms D., resumed the hearing. During the hearing on 26 June 2003 judge Kudeshkina invited the public prosecutor to present evidence for the prosecution. The prosecutor replied that the court had failed to ensure the attendance of the prosecution witnesses and objected to the manner in which the proceedings were being conducted. On the following day, Friday 27 June 2003, he challenged Ms Kudeshkina on the grounds of bias which she had allegedly shown when questioning one of the victims. Other parties to the proceedings, including the victim in question, objected to the challenge. On the same day the lay assessors dismissed the challenge, following which the public prosecutor challenged both lay assessors. The parties to the proceedings objected to the challenge and it was dismissed. On the same day the public prosecutor filed another challenge to the lay assessors on the grounds of bias, which was also dismissed by Ms Kudeshkina on the same day. On Monday 30 June 2003 both lay assessors filed a motion to withdraw from the proceedings. On 1 July 2003 the public prosecutor declared that the minutes of the proceedings were being kept incorrectly and requested access to the records. The court refused this motion, on the grounds that the minutes could be accessed after their completion. On 3 July 2003 Ms Kudeshkina allowed the withdrawal of both lay assessors, stating as follows: “At the hearing the lay assessors I and D declared their withdrawal from the proceedings, on the grounds that they were unable to participate in the examination of the case because of the [public prosecutor’s] biased and discourteous behaviour towards them and due to the perverse environment at the hearing, for which he is responsible and which made them ill.” The Moscow City Court President, Ms Yegorova, then during the proceedings called Ms Kudeshkina to her office and asked her about the details of the proceedings, putting certain questions regarding the conduct of the trial and the decisions on the above motions. The parties disagree on the circumstances of Ms Kudeshkina’s withdrawal from the case. According to the applicant, Ms Yegorova removed Ms Kudeshkina from sitting in the case on 4 July 2003, the day after the lay assessors’ withdrawal. According to the Government, the case remained with Ms Kudeshkina until 23 July 2003, when it was withdrawn from her on the grounds that she had delayed forming a new court composition and that there was a risk of further delay in view of her request for annual leave from 11 August to 11 September 2003, which she filed on 22 July 2003. On 23 July 2003 the Moscow City Court President assigned the case to judge M. On 25 August 2003 the Moscow City Court, composed of judge M. and lay assessors Mr B. and Mr S., began to examine the case. On 3 November 2003 the court found the applicant guilty of having exceeded his official powers. The other charge had been dropped by the prosecutor. The applicant was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment, suspended, with one-year probation. The court also decided that an injunction against holding office in the bodies of the Ministry of the Interior was not necessary. The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, pleading not guilty and claiming that his conviction was based on the wrong assessment of evidence and misinterpretation of the Criminal Code. While the applicant’s appeal was pending, on 2 December 2003 Ms Kudeshkina lodged a complaint with the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, in which she referred to certain alleged procedural irregularities in the criminal case against the applicant. Her complaint read as follows: “I request that the President of the Moscow City Court, Olga Aleksandrovna Yegorova, be charged with a disciplinary offence for exerting unlawful pressure on me in June 2003, when I was presiding in the criminal proceedings against P.V. Zaytsev. She demanded that I give an account on the merits of this case while its examination was underway, and that I inform her about the decisions the court was about to take; she even called me out of the deliberations room for that purpose. [She] insisted on removing certain documents from the case file, forced me to forge the minutes of the hearing, and also recommended that I ask the lay assessors not to turn up for the hearing. Following my refusal to bow to this unlawful pressure [she] removed me from the proceedings and transferred the case to another judge. As to the particular circumstances, they were as follows. I was appointed to examine the case against Zaytsev and the court, acting in a bench with two lay assessors, I. and D., started its examination. Having started the trial, the court questioned a number of victims. The public prosecutor who was representing the Prosecutor General’s Office clearly decided that this questioning was not favourable to the prosecution and therefore did everything possible to disrupt the hearing. For no reason he challenged me as a judge, the lay assessors and the whole composition of the court. His motions were made in a manner that was humiliating, offensive and insulting to the court, and were clearly untrue. Soon after his challenge was rejected by the court, the Moscow City Court President Yegorova called me to her office. In violation of Article 120 of the Constitution and section 10 of the Law “On the Status of a Judge in the Russian Federation”, the Moscow City Court President demanded an explanation from me as to why the lay assessors and I were putting one or other question to the victims in the trial and why one or another motion by the parties was refused or accepted. In my presence the Moscow City Court President had a telephone conversation with the [First Deputy Prosecutor General], who had issued the indictment against Zaytsev. Yegorova informed [the First Deputy Prosecutor General] that the judge was being called to account with regard to what was going on in the proceedings. Back in my office I told the lay assessors what had happened. By then they were already reduced to despair by the repeated groundless objections and insulting challenges against them on the part of the public prosecutor, and they therefore considered it impossible to continue to take part in the proceedings. One of the assessors, Ms I., was seeking medical assistance due to a health problem. For these reasons they decided to withdraw from the proceedings and to state frankly in their request that the reason for their withdrawal was the pressure put on them by the agent of the Prosecutor General’s Office. At the court’s following meeting the lay assessors announced their withdrawal on the above grounds. Their written requests were given to me to be enclosed in the file, and the court adjourned for deliberations. I was again called from the deliberations room by the Moscow City Court President, Yegorova. This time she demanded that I explain what we were doing in the deliberations room and what decisions we were going to take. Her main point was that there should have been no mention in the assessors’ written requests that the reason for their withdrawal was pressure being exerted on the court. The Moscow City Court President also insisted on excluding from the hearing minutes any mention of the behaviour by the public prosecutor which the assessors had regarded as pressure. In essence, Yegorova was pushing me to forge the case file. Moreover, she proposed that I ensure that the assessors did not turn up for the hearing, literally ‘ask them not to come to the court any more’. The aim was obvious – if the assessors [did] not appear the proceedings themselves [would] fall apart. It seemed that for some reason [she] did not want the case to continue to be examined in this composition. The unlawfulness of the Moscow City Court President’s actions was obvious. I followed none of her instructions. The lay assessors’ requests were included in the file, the court allowed their withdrawal and stated that the reason for it was the pressure being applied by the Prosecutor General’s Office. The hearing minutes reflected everything that happened in the proceedings. Once I signed [the minutes] Yegorova withdrew the case from me and transferred it to another judge without stating reasons. I consider that such acts on the part of the Moscow City Court President, Olga Alexandrovna Yegorova, are incompatible with the status of a judge and undermine judicial authority, and are thus destructive for justice, for which she must be held liable. This is what I hereby request from the High Judiciary Qualification Panel of the Russian Federation.” The applicant was not notified of this complaint. In December 2003 Ms Kudeshkina, furthermore, gave one radio interview and two newspaper interviews reiterating the above allegations and criticism. Following this, on 15 December 2003 Ms D., one of the lay assessors who had, on 3 July 2003, withdrawn from the criminal case against the applicant sent a letter to the High Judiciary Qualification Panel which read as follows: “Further to the publication of an interview with judge Kudeshkina ... I decided to write you because I participated in Zaytsev’s case as a lay assessor. I entirely support everything judge Kudeshkina said in her interview. During the trial the [public prosecutor] did everything to prevent the court from hearing the case. He was rude and aggressive to the court; in his interventions and requests he deliberately misrepresented what was going on in the proceedings, and he repeatedly filed objections to the court’s composition. These motions were made in a humiliating, even obnoxious manner. By doing so he was exerting pressure on the court, to force it to give a judgment that was convenient to him, or, alternatively, to set the court hearing at naught. I was appalled by that, but what was my surprise when I learned about the pressure also being exerted on judge Kudeshkina by the court President! We, the assessors, were there when, during the interval, judge Kudeshkina received a phone call from the court President to come and see her. After some time judge Kudeshkina returned, she was upset and depressed. To our question she replied that [the court President] had accused her that the court was reluctant to examine the case; that the lay assessors were asking the victims the wrong questions; and that she had suggested that judge Kudeshkina arrange for the lay assessors not to appear at the court proceedings. ... On the following morning ... both Ms I. and I decided to withdraw from the proceedings. At the start of the hearing on that day the public prosecutor, before he was called by the court, began with a motion in which he, in essence, again degraded and insulted me by repeating [a] comment made by [the victim] outside the courtroom about me ... he did not react to the reproof by the judge. After that ... I declared that I was withdrawing from sitting in the proceedings on the grounds of the public prosecutor’s rude and offensive behaviour, which could not be defined as anything but pressure on the court. After that Ms I. also withdrew. Before the trial I had never met anybody [involved in the proceedings]: not the judge, not [the applicant], not the public prosecutor, not the defence counsel; I had no personal interest in the case. The public prosecutor’s behaviour was therefore inexplicable and came as a shock to me. At about 6 p.m. judge Kudeshkina was called out from the deliberations room, where the court was taking a decision. It was the court President who called her. ... On the following day ... judge Kudeshkina told us that the court President had shouted at her, demanding that she refrain from enclosing [the assessors’] withdrawal requests in the file and not refer in the court’s decision to the reason for the withdrawal. Ms I. and I were shocked by what was going on. First it was the public prosecutor who put pressure on us at the hearing, and then it turned out that the [court President] joined in. What a surprise it was when the [court’s Deputy President] came into the deliberations room and started trying to persuade me and Ms I. not to comment on the public prosecutor’s behaviour in the court decision, but to state in our requests and in the court decision that we withdrew on medical grounds. She said that they would invite me and Ms I. to take part in other proceedings. Ms I. and I refused to change our requests, and after the Deputy President had left the court issued the decision [to allow withdrawal] which reflected what had happened. I have been a lay assessor before, I have taken part in several other proceedings, but this was the first time that I came across such pressure being exerted on the court. I request you to look into the above events and to take action against the [court’s President and her Deputy].” On 16 December 2003 the other lay assessor who had withdrawn, Ms I., sent a similar letter to the High Judiciary Qualification Panel. Following Ms Kudeshkina’s complaint of 2 December 2003, the High Judiciary Qualification Panel appointed Mr S., a judge of the Moscow City Commercial Court, to examine the allegations against Ms Yegorova, the Moscow City Court President. The Government submitted a copy of an internal report prepared by Mr S. and submitted to the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, which contained the following conclusions: – during the hearing of the criminal case against the applicant judge Kudeshkina herself consulted Ms Yegorova, seeking advice on the conduct of the proceedings in view of the public prosecutor’s behaviour; – further communications between judge Kudeshkina and Ms Yegorova and, on another occasion, the deputy court president, took place in private and their content could not be established; – there was insufficient evidence that Ms Yegorova exerted pressure on judge Kudeshkina, since both Ms Yegorova and the deputy court president denied the allegations; – Ms Yegorova transferred the criminal case file against the applicant to another judge on the grounds that Ms Kudeshkina “was unable to conduct the court hearing, her procedural acts were inconsistent, [she acted] in breach of the principle of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms, she stated her legal opinion on the pending criminal case and she attempted to seek the court president’s advice on that case, and in view of the existence of confidential reports by relevant agencies to the Moscow City Court President with regard to judge Kudeshkina, in connection with the examination of Zaytsev’s case and other criminal cases”. On 11 May 2004 the High Judiciary Qualification Panel reported to the President of the Supreme Court their findings concerning the complaint against Ms Yegorova. The President decided, without elaborating on the reasons, that there were no grounds for charging Ms Yegorova with a disciplinary offence. On 17 May 2004 the High Judiciary Qualification Panel decided to dispense with disciplinary proceedings against Ms Yegorova. No copy of this decision was provided to the Court. The applicant was not informed about the enquiry conducted by the High Judiciary Qualification Panel, or about its findings. On the same day Ms Kudeshkina was informed by letter that her complaint against the court president had been examined and that no further action was considered necessary. On the same day the High Judiciary Qualification Panel wrote a letter to both lay assessors stating that no grounds had been found to bring disciplinary proceedings against the President of the Moscow City Court. On 19 May 2004, following disciplinary proceedings against Ms Kudeshkina, the High Judiciary Qualification Panel decided that her office as a judge should be terminated on account of her statements in the interviews given in December 2003. On 10 August 2004 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation examined the applicant’s appeal against his conviction. The court, composed of three judges, upheld the judgment of 3 November 2003 by a majority, having found that the applicant’s conviction was lawful and wellfounded. Judge G. expressed a dissenting opinion stating that the applicant’s actions had no constituent elements of a crime as provided for by Article 286 § 1 of the Criminal Code. On 30 November 2004 the Office of the Prosecutor General sent an official enquiry to the Deputy Minister of the Interior about the applicant’s continued employment in the Ministry of the Interior, in spite of his conviction for abuse of powers. The Ministry of the Interior reviewed the applicant’s file and considered that it was not necessary to dismiss the applicant, in view of the court’s decision to dispense with an injunction against holding office in the bodies of the Ministry of the Interior. On 24 February 2005 the First Deputy Prosecutor General sent an official letter of warning to the Minister of the Interior. The letter referred to the generally unsatisfactory performance by the Ministry of the Interior in investigating criminal cases and pointed out certain instances of breach of procedure. Among the latter the prosecutor’s office indicated the “appalling example” of the applicant’s continued employment in the Ministry of the Interior after his conviction for abuse of power. On 31 March 2005 the acting First Deputy Minister of the Interior replied to the prosecutor’s warning. In so far as it concerned the applicant, he relied on the decision by the first-instance court, upheld by the Supreme Court, to dispense with an injunction against the applicant holding office in the Ministry of the Interior’s entities and informed the prosecutor’s office that the applicant had not been dismissed. Article 168 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, in force at the material time, provided that in urgent cases an investigating officer could exceptionally order and carry out a search without prior authorisation by the prosecutor. The prosecutor was to be notified within 24 hours of a search carried out under this provision. The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation provides: “Acts by an official which clearly go beyond his or her authority, if they incur a substantial breach of individual rights and the legitimate interests of a person or organisation, or of state or public interests protected by law – are punishable by a fine of up to eighty thousand roubles or of up to six times the monthly salary or other income of the convicted, or by a prohibition to hold certain official posts or to perform certain official functions for up to five years, or by arrest for four to six months, or by imprisonment of up to four years.” The Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation provides: “1. The case must be examined by one and the same judge or by a court bench in one and the same composition. 2. If one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing he or she must be replaced by another judge, and the court hearing must restart from the beginning.” Law no. 3132-I of 26 June 1992 “On the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation” provides: “1. The Court President, at the same time as exercising judicial powers in the respective court and the procedural powers conferred on court presidents by Federal Constitutional Laws and Federal Laws, carries out the following functions: (1) organises the court’s work; ... (3) distributes duties between the President’s deputies and, in accordance with the procedure provided for by Federal Law, between the judges; ...” The instruction on courts’ internal document management in force at the material time provided that the court President was responsible for the court’s clerical and office management. As a matter of common practice, a court President distributes cases lodged with a court between the judges of that court. The Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation provides: “... 3. ... the city courts of [Moscow and St Petersburg], ... have jurisdiction in criminal proceedings concerning: (1) criminal offences provided for by Articles ..., 294-302, ... of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation; (2) criminal cases remitted to these courts in accordance with Articles 34 and 35 of this Code; ... 4. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation has jurisdiction in the criminal cases indicated in Article 452 of this Code and other criminal cases that fall under its jurisdiction in accordance with the Constitutional Laws and the Federal Laws.” “A criminal case against a member of the Federal Council, a deputy of the State Duma or a judge of a federal court is to be examined by the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation at their request, to be submitted before the beginning of the court examination in their case.” “A criminal case must be examined by a court in the place where the crime has been committed, except for the cases provided for by Article 35 of this Code.” “1. When the judge who decides on the scheduling of a hearing establishes that the case ... falls outside the jurisdiction of that court, he or she shall issue an order to remit the case according to jurisdiction. ...” “1. Territorial jurisdiction in a criminal case may be changed: (1) at a party’s request – if it has successfully challenged, in accordance with Article 65 of this Code, the entire court composition of the relevant court. ... 2. Territorial jurisdiction of a criminal case may only be changed before the beginning of the court examination.” “3. A challenge brought against several judges or the whole court composition must be decided upon by the same court in its entire composition, by a majority vote. ... 5. If the challenge to a judge, several judges or the whole court composition is granted the criminal case, the request or the complaint must be transferred to another judge or court composition in accordance with the procedure provided for by this Code.” “... 2. The grounds for quashing of a judicial decision [by the cassation instance] are, in any event, as follows: ... (2) judgment held by an unlawful court composition ...” “The court examining the case as a cassation instance may quash the [first instance] conviction and terminate the proceedings if there exist grounds provided for by this Code.” “1. Criminal case is remitted for a fresh examination: ... (2) to the same court that held the [first instance] judgment but in a different composition ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
120,001-58084,ENG,CHE,GRANDCHAMBER,1997,CASE OF BALMER-SCHAFROTH AND OTHERS v. SWITZERLAND,2,Preliminary objection rejected (victim);Not necessary to examine preliminary objection (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies),C. Russo;John Freeland;N. Valticos,"7. The applicants live in the villages of Wilteroltigen, Deltigen and Gümmenen, situated in containment zone no. 1 (Alarmzone 1) within a radius of between four and five kilometres from the nuclear power station at Mühleberg (Canton of Berne). They either own or rent their homes. 8. On 9 November 1990 the company which had operated the power station since 1971, the Bernische Kraftwerke AG (“the operating company”), applied to the Swiss Federal Council (the government) for an extension of its operating licence for an indefinite period and for permission to increase production by 10%. The application was published in the Official Gazette of 4 December 1990 together with a notice inviting persons satisfying the requirements laid down by section 48 of the Federal Administrative Proceedings Act (see paragraph 15 below) to file an objection. 9. More than 28,000 objections in all were sent to the Federal Energy Office, 21,000 of which came from Germany and Austria. In their objection of 4 March 1991, to which several expert opinions were attached, the applicants requested the Federal Council to refuse an extension of the operating licence and to order the immediate and permanent closure of the nuclear power station. Relying in particular on section 5 (1) and (the former) section 10 (1) of the Nuclear Energy Act (see paragraph 12 below), they maintained that the power station did not meet current safety standards on account of serious and irremediable construction defects and that, owing to its condition, the risk of an accident occurring was greater than usual. In addition, they asked the authorities to obtain further data and in the meantime take certain provisional measures. With regard to the fact that under the applicable law the Federal Council would consider the application for an operating licence as an authority of both first and last instance, they pointed out that its decision could give rise to an application based on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention since it affected their civil rights. 10. On 3 September 1991 and 23 June 1992 the Federal Department of Transport, Communications and Energy rejected the requests for interim measures and for gathering the additional data. 11. On 14 December 1992 the Federal Council dismissed all the objections as being unfounded and, subject to compliance with various specified safeguards, granted an operating licence until 31 December 2002 and authorised a 10% increase in production. In its decision it relied on an expert report by the Central Office for Nuclear Safety, an independent report prepared at the request of the Federal Energy Office on the effects of the power station on the nearby river and opinions of the Nuclear Technology and Safety Measures Section of the Federal Energy Office, the Federal Commission for the Safety of Nuclear Power Installations and the cantonal authorities. The Federal Council found firstly that the objectors living in containment zone no. 1 were entitled to take part in the proceedings, unlike the objectors who lived further away from the power station, mainly in Germany and Austria. It then recapitulated the factors which, under section 5 of the Nuclear Energy Act (see paragraph 12 below), justified refusing an operating licence or granting it subject to conditions and stated that applicants who satisfied all the statutory requirements were entitled to an operating licence. It went on to note that although power stations built twenty years earlier certainly no longer met current technical standards, they could nonetheless be maintained and modernised so that they could continue to operate quite safely. In order to satisfy itself that this was so in the instance under review, the Federal Council considered each of the objections in turn. It found them to be unfounded. With regard to the complaint based on the right to life protected by the Constitution, the Federal Council drew attention to the position under the Federal Court's case-law, whereby only deliberate infringements could constitute a breach of that right. That did not apply to the operation of a nuclear power station, at least so long as appropriate technical and operating procedures were adopted to prevent such an infringement and so long as these could reasonably be considered to provide a level of protection comparable to that existing in other generally accepted technical installations. 12. Under section 4 (1) (a) of the Federal Act of 23 December 1959 on the Peaceful Use of Nuclear Energy (“the Nuclear Energy Act”), a licence from the Confederation is required for the construction and operation of nuclear installations and for any changes in the purpose, nature or scale of such installations. Section 5 (1) provides that a licence must be refused or granted subject to appropriate conditions or obligations if that is necessary in order, in particular, to protect people, the property of others or important rights. Section 6 provides that the Federal Council or a body designated by it decides licence applications. No appeal lies against its decisions. 13. Under the Federal Court's case-law, the safety of nuclear power stations can only be considered by the Confederation as part of its licensing procedures (Judgments of the Federal Court (ATF), vol. 119 Ia, p. 402). 14. Section 97 of the Federal Judicature Act of 16 December 1943 provides that the Federal Court hears, as a final court of appeal, administrative-law appeals against decisions of the federal authorities. However, by section 99 (e), as worded at the material time, no appeal lay against the grant of a licence for technical installations to be brought into service. 15. Section 44 of the Federal Administrative Proceedings Act of 20 December 1968 lays down the principle that administrative decisions are appealable. By section 46, however, an appeal is inadmissible if it is made against a decision against which an administrative-law appeal lies to the Federal Court. Under section 48 (a) a person has locus standi to appeal if he is affected by the decision and has an interest worthy of protection in having the decision set aside or varied. 16. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code read as follows: “Any person who sustains or is exposed to damage because an owner abuses his right may bring an action against that owner requiring him to restore the previous position or to take preventive measures, without prejudice to any damages.” “1. When exercising their right, especially when carrying on industrial processes, owners are required to refrain from acting in a manner detrimental to neighbouring properties. 2. The following, in particular, are prohibited: emissions of smoke or soot, offensive smells, noises, and vibrations which are harmful and exceed the limits of the tolerance which neighbours must show to each other having regard to local custom and the situation and type of the buildings.” 17. By virtue of section 1 of the Federal Expropriation Act of 20 June 1930, expropriations may be carried out “for the purposes of works that are in the interest of the Confederation or of a substantial area of the country and for any other public-interest aim recognised by federal law”. Section 5 (1) provides: “The following may be expropriated: rights in rem over land, rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent premises and the rights in personam of tenants or farmers of the property to be expropriated.” 18. With regard to the latter provision, the Federal Court has held: “Actions brought under Articles 679 and 684 to 686 [of the Civil Code] ... are included among the rights which may be expropriated under section 5 ... If the emissions or other allegedly adverse effects result from the construction, in accordance with the applicable law, of a building in the public interest for which land has been expropriated, or are the consequence of using the building for its intended purpose, no private-law action lies for the purpose of obtaining an injunction or compensation. A claim for compensation for expropriation replaces the cause of action under private law and must be made to the expropriations judge, who has jurisdiction not only to assess compensation but also to rule on whether the right ... exists. An expropriating authority's refusal to commence proceedings may be challenged, at last instance, by means of an administrative-law appeal to the Federal Court.” (ATF, vol. 116 Ib, p. 253) In another judgment the Federal Court held: “By virtue of section 5 ..., rights arising from land ownership that concern relations between owners and occupiers of adjacent premises may be expropriated and be forfeited or restricted, temporarily or permanently, provided that the proportionality principle is complied with ...” (ATF, vol. 119 Ib, p. 341) 19. Section 5 of the Act has applied in the case of people living near very busy main roads who were concerned about pollution from exhaust fumes (ATF, vol. 118 Ib, p. 205). Under the Federal Court's case-law, compensation is awarded if the nuisance was not foreseeable and resulted in substantial damage and if the owner suffered special loss (loc. cit., p. 205). In order to assess foreseeability, it is necessary to determine whether the owner could reasonably have known of the future nuisance when he became the owner of the property (ATF, vol. 111 Ib, p. 234).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The first applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Dillenburg, a town situated in the Federal Republic of Germany. The second applicant lives in Weissenburg, also situated in the Federal Republic of Germany. 7. On 7 August 1998 at 10.30 a.m. the car of which the applicant is the registered keeper was recorded by a radar speed detector as exceeding the speed limit by 17 k.p.h. 8. On 12 October 1998 the Deutschlandsberg District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) ordered the applicant to disclose within two weeks the full name and address of the person who had been driving his car at the material time and place on 7 August 1998. It noted that an administrative offence had been committed by the driver of the car. The order referred to section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act (Kraftfahrzeuggesetz) as its legal basis. 9. On 25 October 1998 the applicant replied that, on the date at issue, he had been on holiday with some friends and could not remember who had been driving the car at the material time. 10. On 9 November 1998 the District Administrative Authority issued a provisional penal order (Strafverfügung) in which it sentenced the applicant under sections 103(2) and 134(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act to pay a fine of 1,500 Austrian schillings (ATS) with two days’ imprisonment in default. It found that the applicant had failed to give the requested information. 11. The applicant filed an objection against this decision. 12. On 29 December 1998 the District Administrative Authority dismissed the applicant’s objection and issued a penal order (Straferkenntnis) confirming its previous decision. 13. The applicant appealed on 20 January 1999, submitting in particular that he had not given any false information but had replied as best as he could. In any case, the obligation under section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act to disclose the identity of the driver of his car violated his right not to incriminate himself as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention. 14. On 1 March 1999 the Styria Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat) dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It noted in particular that the registered car keeper did not only act contrary to section 103(2) of the Road Traffic Act if he gave false information, but also if he provided incomplete information or no information at all. If need be he was obliged to keep records of the names and addresses of persons who had been driving his car. The applicant had failed to give the information requested by the District Administrative Authority’s order of 12 October 1998. As to the applicant’s complaint that the obligation to disclose the identity of the driver of his car at a given time violated his right not to incriminate himself, the Panel observed that the relevant sentence in section 103(2) had constitutional rank. In this connection it referred to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 29 September 1988 (see paragraph 32 below). 15. On 8 June 1999 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint. Referring to its judgment of 29 September 1988, it considered that the applicant’s complaint about an alleged violation of his right not to incriminate himself did not offer sufficient prospects of success. 16. On 5 August 1999 the Administrative Court (Verwaltungs-gerichtshof) refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint pursuant to section 33a of the Administrative Court Act since the amount of the penalty did not exceed ATS 10,000 and no important legal problem was at stake. This decision was served on the applicant on 26 August 1999. 17. No proceedings for speeding were brought against the applicant. 18. On 25 August 1998 at 3 p.m. the car of which the applicant is the registered keeper was parked illegally in a street in the seventh district of Vienna. 19. On 3 November 1998 the Vienna Municipal Authority (Magistratsabteilung der Stadt Wien) issued a provisional penal order against the applicant for parking contrary to the provisions of the Vienna Parking Meter Act (Wiener Parkometergesetz) and sentenced him to pay a fine of ATS 500 Austrian schillings with twelve hours’ imprisonment in default. 20. The applicant filed an objection against this decision. Consequently, the provisional penal order became invalid in accordance with section 49(2) of the Act on Administrative Offences (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz). However, the criminal proceedings against the applicant relating to the offence of illicit parking remained pending. 21. On 28 December 1998, the Vienna Municipal Authority ordered the applicant pursuant to section 1a of the Vienna Parking Meter Act to disclose within two weeks the full name and address of the person who had parked his car on 25 August 1998 at the above-mentioned place. It noted that an offence under the said Act, namely illicit parking in a short-term parking area, had been committed. The order informed the applicant that failure to provide the information or any incomplete or belated giving of information constituted an offence by virtue of section 1a taken in conjunction with section 4(2) of the Vienna Parking Meter Act. The applicant did not reply. 22. On 3 March 1999 the Vienna Municipal Authority issued a provisional penal order sentencing the applicant under section 1a taken together with Section 4 § 2 of the Vienna Parking Meter Act to pay a fine of ATS 500 with twelve hours’ imprisonment in default for failure to disclose the identity of the driver of his car. 23. The applicant lodged an objection against this decision. 24. On 10 June 1999 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed the applicant’s objection and issued a penal order confirming its previous decision. 25. The applicant appealed on 6 July 1999 submitting, in particular, that the imposition of a fine for failure to disclose the identity of the driver of his car violated his right not to incriminate himself as guaranteed by Article 6 of the Convention. 26. On 6 September 1999 the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It noted in particular that the registered car keeper’s obligation to disclose the identity of the driver of his car pursuant to section 1a of the Vienna Parking Meter Act had to be read in conjunction with Article II of Federal Law no. 384/1986, which provided that the authority’s right to require information shall take precedence over the right to refuse to give information. This provision had constitutional rank and was comparable to the last sentence of section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act. 27. On 1 February 2000 the Vienna Municipal Authority informed the applicant that the criminal proceedings against him for illicit parking had been discontinued. 28. On 6 March 2000 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint. Having regard to its case-law relating to section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, it found that the applicant’s complaint did not offer sufficient prospects of success. 29. On 15 May 2000 the Administrative Court refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint pursuant to section 33a of the Administrative Court Act since the amount of the penalty did not exceed ATS 10,000 and no important legal problem was at stake. 30. Section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, as amended in 1986, (Kraftfahrgesetz) provides as follows: “The authority may request information as to who had driven a certain motor vehicle identified by the number plate .... at a certain time or had last parked such a motor vehicle ... at a certain place before a certain date. The registered car keeper ... must provide such information, which must include the name and address of the person concerned; if he or she is unable to give such information, he/she must name a person who can do so and who will then be under an obligation to inform the authority; the statements made by the person required to give information do not release the authority from its duty to verify’s right to require such information shall take precedence over the right to refuse to give information.” 31. The last sentence of this provision was enacted as a provision of constitutional rank after the Constitutional Court had, in its judgments of 3 March 1984 and 8 March 1985, quashed previous similar provisions on the ground that they were contrary to Article 90 § 2 of the Federal Constitution which prohibits, inter alia, that a suspect be obliged on pain of a fine to incriminate himself. 32. In its judgment of 29 September 1988 (VfSlg. 11.829) the Constitutional Court found that the first to third sentences of section 103(2) of the Motor Vehicles Act, as amended in 1986, were, like the previous provisions, contrary to the right not to incriminate oneself which flowed from Article 90 § 2 of the Federal Constitution and from Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights but were saved by the last sentence of that provision, which had constitutional rank. In reaching that conclusion the Constitutional Court had examined whether the last sentence of section 103(2) was contrary to the guiding principles of the constitution, but had found that this was not the case. 33. Section 134(1) of the Motor Vehicles Act, in the version in force at the material time, provided that a fine of up to ATS 30,000, or up to six weeks’ imprisonment in default, could be imposed on a person who violates the regulations of that Act. 34. The Vienna Parking Meter Act regulates the levying of parking fees in specified “short-term parking areas”. 35. The relevant part of section 1a of the Vienna Parking Meter Act reads as follows: “(1) The registered keeper of a motor vehicle ... has, if the motor vehicle has been parking in a short-term parking area liable to a fee, to inform the Municipal Authority to whom he has left the motor vehicle ... at a certain time. (2) The information, which must include the name and address of the person concerned, is to be provided immediately or, in case of a written request, within two weeks after the request has been served; where such information cannot be provided without keeping pertinent records, such records shall be kept.” 36. According to section 4(2) of the Vienna Parking Meter Act, in the version in force at the material time, a fine of up to ATS 3,000 could be imposed for a failure to comply with the obligation laid down in Section 1a. 37. The relevant part of Article II of Federal Law no. 384/1986 reads as follows: “Where the Länder, in regulating the levying of fees for the parking of motor vehicles ... oblige the registered keeper ... to inform the authority upon its request to whom he has left the motor vehicle ... at a certain time, the authority’s right to require such information shall take precedence over the right to refuse to give information.” This provision was enacted as a provision of constitutional rank. 38. Pursuant to section 5 of the Act on Administrative Offences (Verwaltungsstrafgesetz) any administrative criminal offence may be committed by negligence, unless provided otherwise. 39. Pursuant to section 16 of that Act an administrative fine is to be accompanied by a default prison term of up to fourteen days’ imprisonment, unless provided otherwise. The enforcement of a default prison term is regulated by section 54b of the Act on Administrative Offences. It is only admissible if it is established that the fine is not recoverable. The competent authority has to conduct enforcement proceedings, in which the person concerned has the possibility to request a stay of the payment or payment by instalments. Only if the enforcement of the fine proves to be unsuccessful can an order for the enforcement of the default prison term be made. The order must inform the person concerned that payment of the fine can be made at any time in order to avert the execution of the default prison term.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
122,001-22786,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,LELLA v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Pauli Lella, is a Finnish national, born in 1944 and living in Kehro. At the relevant time the applicant had been politically active for over twenty years, as a member of the Urjala Municipal Assembly and as candidate for Parliament on two occasions. In 1996 he was convicted of aggravated debtor’s dishonesty and a book-keeping offence and sentenced to one year and six months’ imprisonment. The judgment was upheld by a court of appeal and the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal in September 1998. A subsequent request for the case to be re-opened was likewise refused. On 29 September 1998 the Department for Prison Administration of the Ministry of Justice refused the applicant’s request that the enforcement of his sentence be postponed due to his illness. On 19 October 1998 the Urjala Municipal Assembly voted to disqualify the applicant from sitting on the assembly on account of his having been sentenced to over six months’ imprisonment. His appeal was refused by the County Administrative Court (lääninoikeus, länsrätten) of Häme on 11 May 1999. His further appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) was apparently likewise refused. Meanwhile, on 29 October 1998, the Chief Enforcement Officer (kihlakunnanvouti, häradsfogden) of Valkeakoski granted the applicant’s further postponement request in order to enable him to organise certain private matters prior to serving his sentence. He was ordered to start serving his prison term on 4 January 1999. In November 1998 the applicant requested that the enforcement of his sentence be postponed until 1 April 1999 so as to allow for his effective participation in the parliamentary elections on 21 March 1999 in which he intended to present himself as a candidate. On 30 November 1998 this request was dismissed, the Chief Enforcement Officer having concluded that the already fixed enforcement would not engender any exceptional and significant losses or difficulties to the applicant, his family, his employer or to society within the meaning of the chapter 2, section 1 (c) of the Act on the Enforcement of Sentences (laki rangaistusten täytäntöönpanosta, lag om verkställighet av straff). Moreover, the considerations militating in favour of the immediate enforcement of his sentence clearly outweighed the inconvenience which such enforcement would cause. Under chapter 2, section 1 (d) of the said Act the decision was automatically referred to the Department for Prison Administration which upheld it on 10 December 1998. Having started to serve his sentence on 4 January 1999, the applicant, on 11 February 1999, filed an extraordinary appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court, seeking to have the refusal quashed as it had been based on a manifestly incorrect application of the law. He also sought to have the enforcement of his sentence stayed at least until the court had decided the matter. On 12 March 1999 the court refused to re-open the case. Meanwhile, on 4 February 1999 the applicant registered as candidate in the upcoming elections. His three requests for leave immediately prior to and on the election day, in order to enable him to complete his campaign, were all refused by the Prison Governor. The refusals were automatically referred to the Department for Prison Administration which upheld them. The applicant was not elected. The sentences imposed on four other defendants convicted in the same criminal proceedings were allegedly not enforced until 1 October 1999. B. Relevant domestic law Parliamentary elections are normally held every four years in Finland. Under the Parliament Act (valtiopäiväjärjestys, riksdagsordning), as in force at the relevant time, anyone entitled to vote in parliamentary elections is likewise entitled to stand as a candidate, unless placed under guardianship (section 7).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
123,001-113164,ENG,LVA,ADMISSIBILITY,2012,BUKS v. LATVIA,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Ján Šikuta;Luis López Guerra;Nona Tsotsoria,"1. The applicant, Mr Agris Buks, is a Latvian national, who was born in 1967 and lives in Vārve Parish, Latvia. 2. The Latvian Government (“the Government”) was represented by their Agent, Mrs I. Reine. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. In 2000 the applicant was diagnosed with diabetes, type II. From February 2001 the applicant needed to receive regular injections of insulin. 5. On 31 October 2001 he was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the organising of human trafficking. On the same day he was admitted to Rīga Hospital No 1. Two days later the applicant was transferred to the hospital wing of Rīga Central Prison, where he remained until 20 December 2001 when he was transferred to the medical unit of Matīsa Prison. 6. On 4 September 2002 the lower court found the applicant guilty, sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of his property. The appellate court on 26 November 2002 took the applicant’s poor health into consideration as well as the fact that the applicant could not be provided with proper medical treatment in prison. As a result the court reduced his sentence by one year. 7. In March 2003 the applicant was transferred to Jelgava Prison, from which he was released on 31 October 2003 after having served his sentence. 8. According to the applicant, on his admission to the medical unit of Matīsa Prison he was informed that owing to insufficient funds the prison was not in a position to provide him with insulin, and that he had to rely on his relatives to obtain it for him. 9. From 13 to 28 March 2002 the applicant was held in a disciplinary cell in Matīsa Prison for having committed a disciplinary offence. According to the applicant’s submission, he had had to inject himself with insulin there despite conditions being insanitary. 10. Meanwhile, from 29 May to 19 June 2002 and from 19 August to 9 September 2002 the applicant was held in the Kuldīga Police Department short-term detention unit in order to ensure his attendance at the court hearing in Kuldīga. According to the applicant, the conditions there amounted to torture in that he had been denied a consultation with a doctor and food was provided only once per day. 11. At the applicant’s request the Inspectorate for Quality Control of Medical Care and Working Capability (“the MADEKKI”) assessed the adequacy of the medical care received by the applicant in Matīsa Prison in 2002 and 2003. 12. In its report of 10 May 2002 the MADEKKI found no infringement of the applicant’s right to medical treatment over the period from October 2001 to May 2002. In the course of preparing the report a representative of the MADEKKI met with the applicant, who did not raise any complaints regarding the quality of medical care he had received. The inspectorate observed that, before the arrest, the applicant’s doctor had repeatedly recommended that he visit an endocrinologist but the applicant had not done so, blaming his busy schedule. The inspectorate concluded that the applicant had been injecting insulin himself following the doctor’s recommendations, and monitoring his sugar levels with the use of a glucometer. The applicant’s overall state of health was considered to be stable. 13. In several letters dated 26 February, 1 July and 17 September 2003 the Prisons Administration dismissed the complaints which the applicant had brought regarding the medical care he had received and the fact that he had not been provided with insulin in Matīsa Prison. The Prisons Administration noted, in particular, that under the State medical system the applicant’s relatives were allowed to obtain insulin and syringes free of charge on his behalf. 14. On 10 and 13 October 2003 the applicant addressed a similar complaint to the MADEKKI and the Office of the Prosecutor. The applicant also drew the MADEKKI’s attention to the poor conditions in the Kuldīga Police Department. 15. On 24 November 2003 the MADEKKI drew up a second report concerning the medical care the applicant had received in Matīsa Prison. It observed that his entire stay in Matīsa Prison had been spent in the medical unit, where he had been regularly examined by doctors. It noted that the applicant’s sugar level was 14-18 mmol/l and he had been injecting himself with insulin and testing his sugar levels. 16. With regard to the supply of insulin to the applicant, the MADEKKI concluded that during his stay in Matīsa Prison the administration had failed to furnish him with insulin; that the laboratory testing of his sugar levels had not been carried out regularly, and that he had not had a consultation with an endocrinologist. 17. With regard to the complaint of a lack of medical care in Kuldīga Police Department unit from 29 May to 19 June 2002 and from 19 August to 9 September 2002, the MADEKKI noted that the medical unit of Matīsa Prison had informed the Kuldīga Police Department that the applicant was permitted to use insulin, certain medications and a glucometer. The MADEKKI observed that the applicant had not raised any health-related complaints while in the Kuldīga short-term detention unit, where he had been provided with the standard diet for detainees. 18. The Office of the Prosecutor in its letter of 4 November 2003 reminded the applicant that according to his agreement with the medical unit of Matīsa Prison, from 20 December 2001 to 5 March 2003 he had agreed to supply the insulin himself. In the same letter the Office of the Prosecutor stated that on 16 October 2002 the Prisons Administration had purchased insulin especially for the applicant which he had used until his transfer to Jelgava Prison on 5 March 2003. The applicant did not complain in this respect to a higher prosecutor. 19. The applicant’s medical file, as summarised by the MADEKKI’s reports mentioned above, show that he was diagnosed with diabetes type II in February 2000. From February 2001 he was recommended insulin treatment because his sugar levels occasionally reached 16-17 mmol/l. Every two months, on average, the applicant’s doctor would issue repeat prescriptions for about twenty doses of insulin (Monotard). In response to the applicant’s complaints that his sugar levels occasionally reached 18 mmol/l the doctor had recommended, on at least two occasions, that the applicant attend self-care and awareness clinics for diabetic patients. The report reveals that the applicant had not done so. 20. From 2 November to 20 December 2001 the applicant received medical treatment in the prison hospital where he was seen by various specialists. The sugar level in his blood and urine was monitored twice a week on average. By 28 November 2001, according to prison hospital records, the applicant’s health had improved; he declined to increase his dose of insulin and agreed on a particular course of treatment with the doctor at the prison hospital. 21. On 10 and 15 January 2002, the applicant underwent medical examinations and was then admitted to the prison hospital on 19 January 2002, where he remained until 24 January 2002, because he was suffering from hyperglycaemia. 22. On the applicant’s discharge from the hospital in November 2001 and again in January 2002 it was recommended that he have his blood and urine sugar levels monitored and be given a tailored diet and medication, including insulin. In the medical unit of Matīsa Prison he was prescribed insulin and two kinds of medication as recommended. 23. On 21 February 2002 the applicant’s health was assessed by a medical consultative commission at Matīsa Prison, which prescribed a particular treatment including an injection of insulin twice per day. The follow-up of the treatment was carried out on average once a week until June 2002. After he had been transferred to the disciplinary cell he was authorised to use two other kinds of medication brought from home. 24. On 19 and 24 July and 1 and 5 August the applicant’s sugar levels had increased so he was repeatedly admitted to the prison hospital in the period from 8 August to 15 August 2002, when he was discharged from the hospital at his own request. 25. The applicant was visited by a doctor before and after his transfer to the Kuldīga Police Department on 27 May, 20 June, 15 August and 11 September 2002. He had not raised any complaints and his health was considered to be satisfactory. 26. According to a medical report from Ventspils hospital, the applicant’s former doctor gave the applicant’s wife prescriptions for insulin and the other medicine, at her request, on separate occasions in December 2001, February and April 2002. 27. At the Government Agent’s request on 9 July 2009 the Prisons Administration explained that under the State – financed health programme, as in force at the material time, all diabetic patients in Latvia received insulin and syringes free of charge, while detention facilities were obliged to purchase insulin for detainees suffering from diabetes from their budgets. Owing to insufficient funds available for medication, the administration of the prison authorised diabetic detainees to receive insulin from outside the prison. Usually family members received prescriptions for insulin from the detainee’s former doctor and brought the insulin to the detainee in prison. 28. In response to the Government Agent’s questions, the Health Inspectorate (Veselības Inspekcija) explained that the minimum healthcare requirements of diabetic patients comprised the regular administering of medication, monitoring of sugar levels and treatment for hypoglycaemia. Blood tests should be carried out as required. There was no vital need for an endocrinologist if the sugar levels were satisfactory. 29. The Inspectorate also noted that it was of crucial importance that diabetic patients had an understanding of their illness. Since there was no special “diabetic diet”, by monitoring the sugar levels of the patient the amount of insulin was to be adjusted according to the quantity of food taken. 30. Regulations no. 358 of the Cabinet of Ministers of 19 October 1999 concern the provision of medical assistance to convicted and detained persons in their place of custody (see Leitendorfs v. Latvia (dec.), no. 35161/03, § 27, 3 July 2012).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
124,001-23528,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,"POPOV and OTHERS, VAKARELOVA, MARKOV and BANKOV v. BULGARIA",4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"All applicants are practising medical doctors. Some of them are members of the Bulgarian Doctors’ Union („Български лекарски съюз“ – “BDU”), established in July 1998 by the Professional Organisations of Doctors and Dentists Act („Закон за съсловните организации на лекарите и стоматолозите“ – “PODDA” or “Act”), while some have refused to become such members. The applicants in the first application (no. 48047/99), Mr Toma Dimitrov Popov, Mr Marcel Haim Levy, Mr Ivan Yordanov Chalakov and Mr Velko Vladimirov Kalaydjiev, are Bulgarian nationals who were born in 1949, 1960, 1947 and 1964 respectively and live in Sofia. They were represented before the Court by Ms Z. Kalaydjieva and Ms N. Sedefova, lawyers practising in Sofia. The applicant in the second application (no. 48961/99), Ms Mariana Ilieva Vakarelova, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1959 and lives in Sofia. She was represented before the Court by Ms V. Terzieva and Mr Y. Grozev, lawyers practising in Sofia. The applicant in the third application (no. 50786/99), Mr Nikolai Markov Markov, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1952 and lives in Sofia. He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Nikolov, a lawyer practising in Sofia. The applicant in the fourth application (no. 50792/99), Mr Georgi Hristov Bankov, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1967 and lives in Veliko Tarnovo. He was represented before the Court by Ms V. Terzieva and Mr Y. Grozev, lawyers practising in Sofia. The BDU was originally established in 1901 as a professional association of medical doctors. During World War II membership in the union became compulsory. After the war the union was liquidated. Similarly, the Union of Dentists in Bulgaria („Съюз на стоматолозите в България“ – “UDB”) was established in 1905 as a professional association of dentists and ceased to exist after World War II. In 1991 an organisation named BDU was founded by a group of medical doctors. It was registered as a notforprofit association under the Persons and Family Act (the statute governing this type of organisations). The association was active on the whole territory of Bulgaria and had numerous members. The applicant in application no. 48961/99, Ms Vakarelova, was one of its members. Between 1991 and 1993 she chaired the regional section of the BDU in the Fourteenth Regional Hospital. On 8 July 1998 the Bulgarian Parliament adopted PODDA. The Act was published in the State Gazette on 21 July 1998 and entered into force on 25 July 1998. It established two organisations: the BDU and the UDB, and provided, in paragraph 9 of its transitional and concluding provisions, that the two organisations were the respective successors of the BDU of 1901 and the UDB of 1905. By virtue of PODDA all practising medical doctors and dentists in the country were obliged to become members of, respectively, the newly established BDU and UDB. Those medical doctors and dentists who were not practising could, but were not obliged to, become members. PODDA introduced amendments to the Labour Code and Criminal Code whereby a medical doctor or a dentist working under an employment contract who had not become a member of the respective union was liable to be dismissed from work without notice and became criminally liable if he or she continued to practise. In August 1998 sixty Members of Parliament requested the Constitutional Court to declare PODDA unconstitutional. They argued that compulsory membership in the BDU and the UDB went against Article 44 of the Constitution, enshrining, inter alia, negative freedom of association. They further submitted that the Act infringed Article 48 of the Constitution, guaranteeing the right to work, and also the principle that government functions should not be entrusted to public organisations without their express consent. They also maintained that the Act created undue privileges for the two unions to the detriment of other organisations and that it regulated matters which should have been left to the discretion of the unions’ governing bodies. Finally, the MPs asserted that section 34(1)(7) of PODDA was vague and could lead to unjustified gathering of irrelevant information about BDU and UDB members. The Constitutional Court gave judgment on 11 November 1998. In respect of the allegation that PODDA infringed the medical doctors’ and dentists’ negative freedom of association it held as follows: “... Through PODDA the legislature regulated the structure, the organisation and the activities of the professional organisations of the medical doctors and the dentists, the conditions for practising medicine and odontology, and the responsibility for breaches of professional ethics. According to section 1(2) of the Act the professional organisation of medical doctors is the BDU, and that of dentists – the UDB. Section 3(1) provides that all medical doctors and dentists who practise their profession must be members of the BDU or the UDB, respectively. The [Members of Parliament] who filed the request maintain that the above provisions contravene Article 12 § 1, Article 44 § 1 and Article 48 §§ 1 and 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, as well as international treaties ... which ... are part of the domestic law of the country... It is submitted that by requiring all practising medical doctors and dentists to be members of the BDU and the UDB the Act infringes the constitutionally protected freedom of association (Article 44 of the Constitution), because it brings about an element of compulsion which is irreconcilable with that freedom. In addition, according to the request, the provisions of the challenged Act run counter to Article 48 §§ 1 and 3 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria, which proclaims on the one hand the citizens’ right to work and on the other – the obligation for the State to create the conditions for the realisation of that right. The Constitutional Court finds that these submissions and the arguments presented in support of the request are illfounded. I.1. PODDA does not contain a provision which excludes the right of other organisations, including professional and tradeunion type, founded by medical doctors and dentists, to exist alongside the BDU and the UDB. It does not proscribe the establishment of associations by medical doctors and dentists under the Persons and Family Act or another statute. Therefore, the Act does not run counter to Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution. It does not affect the constitutionally protected freedom of association, because that freedom pertains to privatelaw associations, including trade unions under Article 49 of the Constitution. This constitutionally recognised freedom includes not only the freedom to take up the initiative and to form an association, respectively to become a member of an existing one, but also the socalled “negative freedom”, i.e. the right to not become a member of an existing association. 2. PODDA does not lie on the plane of Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution. It is an Act which creates publiclaw corporations with compulsory membership of medical doctors and dentists. These corporations are endowed with certain publiclaw functions: to organise, control and discipline medical doctors and dentists. Accordingly, freedom of association, proclaimed by Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution, does not apply to them: they are created by statute and not through the free will of their members. The Constitutional Court considers that, when deciding on the applicability of Articles 12 and 44 of the Constitution to publiclaw corporations, it must have regard to the caselaw of the European Court of Human Rights and the interpretation of Article 11 § 1 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms [(“ECHR”)]. This provision corresponds to Article 44 § 1 of our Constitution. This is so, because [ECHR] is part of domestic law and, according to its Article 46, the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights [and the interpretations of the ECHR contained therein] are binding on all State bodies in the country. [In] a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg of 27 May 1981, the issue [was] whether the compulsory membership of medical doctors in a publiclaw corporation – “Ordre des médecins” –, created by act of the king of Belgium, ran counter to Article 11 § 1 of the ECHR (which corresponds to Article 44 § 1 of our Constitution). That corporation’s aim was to protect the citizens’ health by exercising control over the practice of medicine. This function led to [the giving] a number of administrative powers to the “Ordre [des médecins]”, including the power to discipline the medical doctors registered with it. According to the unanimous judgment of the European Court of Human Rights, the corporation of Belgian medical doctors “Ordre [des médecins]” could not be considered as an association within the meaning of Article 11 of the ECHR and [compulsory membership in it] did not run counter to this Article. 3. It should be pointed out that a similar opinion was expressed by the German Federal Constitutional Court and by the prevailing German doctrine in respect of the various publiclaw corporations (the socalled “chambers”) which exist in Germany, such as: the lawyers’, notaries’, medical doctors’, dentists’, pharmacists’, handicraftsmen’s, etc. chambers. According to this opinion, the compulsory membership of the persons who practise the respective professions in these chambers does not contravene Article 9 § 1 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany which proclaims freedom of association, because that Article concerns the formation of notforprofit associations and of companies, which are of privatelaw character and thus do not fall in the category of publiclaw corporations. For this reasons these corporations [were] not [considered] unconstitutional... 4. In order to better understand the fundamental difference between a publiclaw corporation with compulsory membership of all persons who practise the respective profession and a voluntary privatelaw association, regard must be had to the European Court of Human Right’s judgment of 13 August 1981 in the case of Young, James and Webster [v. the United Kingdom, series A no. 44]. Its subjectmatter was an agreement for the compulsory membership of employees in a trade union. Since Article 11 § 1 of the ECHR (corresponding to Article 44 § 1 of our Constitution) applies to trade unions, the European Court in Strasbourg found in favour of the applicants, because it found that the freedom of association in trade unions could not be restricted through compulsory membership in a given trade union under the threat of dismissal from work of an employee who was not a member. The abovementioned judgments of the European Court of Human Rights draw a sharp distinction between publiclaw corporations, which have compulsory membership, and privatelaw associations, including trade unions. Article 11 § 1 of the ECHR, corresponding to Article 44 § 1 of our Constitution, applies only to privatelaw associations. The conclusion drawn by the Constitutional Court is that PODDA does not contravene Article 44 § 1 of the Constitution. 5. A decisive argument in support of this conclusion is Article 134 of the Constitution. Article 134 provides that the Bar is selfgoverning and provides for the adoption of a special statute on its organisation and activities. It is common knowledge that in many countries, and in our country even before the Constitution of 1991, the practising of the legal profession was subject to membership in the respective lawyers’ organisation, i.e. registration of the person wishing to practise as a lawyer in this organisation. It is therefore beyond question that the Bar is a telling example of a publiclaw corporation. These elements abound in our Bar Act [of 1991]. It is true that the Constitution does not expressly provide that the medical doctors’ and dentists’ unions should be corporations with publiclaw elements. But this is by no means necessary. The formation of various corporations with publiclaw elements is a matter of legislative discretion and is not dependent upon an express constitutional command. By its very nature the Constitution cannot and should not exhaustively enumerate the permissible forms of organisation. But when it regulates the Bar, it clearly indicates that organisations like it are compatible with the Constitution. Such an organisation is also the Notaries Chamber (see the Notaries Act [of 1996]). Such is also the Act challenged before the Court. 6. Through this Act the State performs its obligation under Article 52 § 3 of the Constitution to protect the citizens’ health and to provide them with highquality health care. By entrusting to medical doctors and dentists themselves the supervision of the two professions through corporations ran by them, the challenged Act manages to achieve in the most expedient manner the observance of the Professional Ethics Code and the Rules of Good Medical Practice, as well the regulation of the profession. Otherwise these functions would have to be entrusted to civil servants who would not be as competent and would cost considerable amounts of money to the State budget. This explains why the manner of organisation of medical doctors and dentists used by PODDA is also used in a number of European countries such as Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Iceland, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, [and] France. 7. PODDA is necessary also because of the inseverable link between it and the Health Security Act [of 1998 („Закон за здравното осигуряване“ – “HSA”)], because health insurance, guaranteed by Article 52 § 1 of the Constitution, may function only if the organisations of medical doctors and dentists created by PODDA exist. These organisations are parties to the National Framework Agreement concluded for the purpose of carrying out the activities under HSA. By section 55 of HSA, the National Framework Agreement regulates the conditions for and the manner of selecting medical service providers, the forms, conditions and manner in which medical services are dispensed, the amount, prices and method of payment for the medical services and drugs, as well as all other matters relating to health security. In other words, not a single health security activity could be carried out without this Agreement, which would deprive the citizens of the possibility to exercise their constitutionally guaranteed (Article 52 § 1 [of the Constitution]) right to health security. This convincingly demonstrates that not only does PODDA not contravene the Constitution, but that it is in fact mandated by the Constitution, so that the right guaranteed by Article 52 § 1 of the Constitution becomes a social reality. ...” As regards the allegation that section 34(1)(7) of PODDA was vague and allowed the gathering and retention of personal information, the Constitutional Court held: “... it is true that point 7 [of section 34(1)] has a blanket wording. However, it is sufficient to connect this provision with section 32 of [PODDA] in order to see that the term “other circumstances” means a number of facts set forth in section 32(3), without being expressly referred to in section 34(1) points 1 to 6, but which should nevertheless be entered in the register (e.g. length of service, indication that a doctor is a foreign national, [and] criminal record). If sections 32 and 34 are construed in connection with one another, the conclusion could and should be that “other circumstances” means exactly the facts mentioned in section 32. Thus, the blanket wording of point 7 of section 34(1) becomes clear and the alleged infringement of the rights set forth by Article 32 of the Constitution is excluded.” Five judges dissented from the Constitutional Court’s judgment, each writing an individual dissenting opinion. The dissenting judges were of the opinion, inter alia, that the BDU and the UDB could not be considered as falling outside the scope of Article 44 of the Constitution. The argument that they had been created by law was not persuasive because PODDA had merely branded two notforprofit associations “professional organisations” and had endowed them with certain publiclaw functions without declaring their liquidation or transformation or annulling the court’s decisions for their registration; it was doubtful whether this could be done by an Act of Parliament. The unions were essentially privatelaw associations, much like the one at issue in the case of Sigurður A. Sigurjónsson v. Iceland (judgment of 30 June 1993, Series A no. 264). Also, the notion of publiclaw functions was not unambiguous and could not serve as a basis for excluding the unions in question from the ambit of Article 44 of the Constitution. Indeed, by section 5(1) of PODDA, the two unions represented their members and protected their professional rights and interests, which were functions of a typical association or trade union. “1. Citizens’ associations shall serve for fulfilling and protecting citizens’ interests. 2. Citizens’ associations, including trade unions, may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties.” “The private life of the citizens shall be inviolable. Everyone shall have the right to be protected against illegal interference in his private or family life and against encroachments on his honour, dignity and reputation.” “1. Citizens may associate freely. 2. Organisations whose activity is directed against the sovereignty, the territorial integrity of the country [or] the unity of the nation, towards the incitement of racial, national, ethnical or religious enmity, towards the infringement of the citizens’ rights and freedoms, as well as organisations which seek to achieve their goals through violence, shall be prohibited.” The structure, the organisation and the activities of the professional organisations of the doctors and dentists – the BDU and the UDB –, are regulated by PODDA (section 1(1)). By section 3 of the Act, all practising medical doctors and dentists must be members of the respective union, whereas the membership of nonpractising doctors and dentists is optional. PODDA provides that the functions of the BDU and the UDB are as follows: a) to represent their members and protect their professional rights and interests; b) to represent their members as parties to the National Framework Agreement with the National Health Security Fund; c) to draft a Professional Ethics Code for medical doctors, respectively dentists, and to exercise control for compliance with that Code; d) to adopt, together with the National Health Insurance Fund, Rules for Good Medical Practice, to submit them for approval by the Minister of Health and to exercise control for compliance with them; e) to impose the sanctions which PODDA provides for medical malpractice; f) to draw up and keep a national and regional registers of their members; g) to participate in the organisation and conducting of professional qualification courses for doctors and dentists; h) to appoint representatives to the High Medical Council at the Ministry of Health; i) to express opinions on draft bills and regulations in the area of public health; j) to cooperate with other organisations and institutions in the country and abroad; k) to provide assistance to their members and their families in case they need it; l) to carry out any other activity which their statutes provide for (section 5). PODDA provides that the BDU and the UDB are legal persons and sets forth their structure and bodies. By section 18 of the Act, the BDU and the UDB have regional sections in all municipalities of the country. All practising medical doctors and dentists within a given municipality must be members of the regional section of the BDU or the UDB, respectively. The central bodies of the BDU and the UDB are their conventions (consisting of the elected representatives of their regional sections – section 8(1)), their managing boards (consisting of a chairperson, deputychairpersons, secretarygeneral and members – section 11), their control commissions (consisting of a chairperson and members – section 15(1)), and their professional ethics commissions (consisting of a chairperson and members – section 16(1)). The regional bodies of the unions are the general meetings of all practising doctors, respectively dentists, in the region (consisting of the delegates – at a one to ten rate – of all doctors or dentists within the given region – section 20(1)), the managing boards of the regional sections (consisting of a chairperson, deputychairpersons, secretarygeneral and members – section 23(1)), the control commissions of the regional sections (consisting of a chairperson and members – section 26(1)), and the professional ethics commissions of the regional sections (consisting of a chairperson and members – section 28(1)). The Act describes in detail the powers of each of the bodies. Under HSA, health coverage for all Bulgarian citizens and foreigners permanently residing on the territory of Bulgaria is provided by the National Health Security Fund („Национална здравноосигурителна каса“)(section 33 of HSA). The Fund, which receives monthly payments in respect of all persons with health coverage (section 40 of HSA), enters into a National Framework Agreement with the BDU and the UDB, as established by PODDA (section 54 of HSA). The National Framework Agreement sets forth, inter alia, the types of medical services to which all persons with health coverage are entitled, the manner of their dispensing, and the prices that the medical service providers (hospitals and medical doctors and dentists) can charge the Fund and the patients for these services (a patient pays a minimal amount every time he or she uses medical services and the remainder is paid directly by the Fund)(section 55(2) of HSA). The Agreement between the Fund and the BDU and the UDB is renegotiated every year (section 55(1) of HSA). Thus, the BDU and the UDB represent all medical doctors and dentists for the purpose of negotiating the terms of the Agreement and therefore the prices hospitals and doctors and dentists can charge the Fund for providing medical services to persons with health coverage and the manner of providing such services. The Agreement must be countersigned by the Minister of Health and is subject to control by the Supreme Administrative Court in the same manner as is delegated legislation (решение № 8145 от 18 август 2003 г. по адм. д. № 3896/ 2003 г., V чл. св на ВАС, обн. ДВ, бр. 76 от 2003 г.). All hospitals, other medical institutions and individually practising medical doctors and dentists enter into individual contracts with the local branches of the Fund pursuant to the National Framework Agreement (section 59(1) of HSA). These contracts cannot deviate from the terms of the National Framework Agreement (section 59(2) and (8) of HSA). Section 25a(4)(4) of the Public Health Act of 1973 („Закон за народното здраве“), as in force until 1999, and section 40(6) of the Medical Institutions Act of 1999 („Закон за лечебните заведения“), which superseded it, provide that in order to register private practice a medical doctor or a dentist has to produce a certificate to the effect that he or she has been registered with the BDU or the UDB, respectively. Article 324 § 2 of the Criminal Code, as amended by PODDA, provides that a medical doctor or a dentist who practises his or her profession in violation of the law is punishable with up to three years’ imprisonment or a fine from one to three hundred Bulgarian levs. By Article 330 § 2 (2) of the Labour Code, as amended by PODDA, a medical doctor or a dentist may be dismissed from work without notice if he or she had been struck off the registers kept respectively by the BDU or the UDB. Section 34(1) of PODDA enumerates the kinds of information which should be entered in the registers of medical doctors and dentists kept by the regional sections of the BDU and the UDB. While points 1 to 6 of section 34(1) set forth specific types of information (e.g. name, address, education, speciality), point 7 of that section provides that in the register shall be entered “other circumstances”. Section 32(3) of PODDA provides that the application for membership in the BDU, respectively the UDB, should be accompanied by a diploma, a document certifying that in case of a career interruption of more than five years the medical doctor or dentist has successfully passed a validation examination, a scientific degree certificate (if the doctor or dentist has one), a document certifying the place of work and the length of service, and, for foreign nationals – a residence permit and a document certifying that have passed the requisite examinations, as well as a criminal record. In 2002 Parliament adopted the Protection of Personal Data Act („Закон за защита на личните данни“), the purpose of which was to guarantee the integrity of the person and the private life by protecting the individuals from illegal processing of personal data relating to them and to regulate the right of access to such data (section 1(2) of the Protection of Personal Data Act).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

RUSSIA,4,Violation of P4-2,Anatoly Kovler;Christos Rozakis;Dean Spielmann;George Nicolaou;Giorgio Malinverni;Khanlar Hajiyev,"5. The applicants, mother and son, were born in 1958 and 1981 respectively. The first applicant lives in Ozersk, a closed town in Chelyabinsk Region where the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant is located and where the second applicant permanently resided before his conviction in 2002. They are joint owners of a flat in Ozersk. The second applicant is currently serving a prison sentence in a correctional colony in Chelyabinsk Region. 6. On 5 August 2002 the second applicant was found guilty at Ozersk Town Court of certain criminal offences and sentenced to four years' imprisonment. 7. On 15 July 2004 the Kasli Town Court, Chelyabinsk Region, relieved him from further serving his sentence. The second applicant returned to Ozersk. 8. The first applicant requested the local administration to authorise the second applicant's entry to, and permanent residence in, Ozersk. It appears the authorities permitted the second applicant's temporary stay in Ozersk from 25 November 2004 to 16 January 2005. 9. On an unspecified date the Ozersk Town Administration (Администрация Озерского городского округа, “the Town Administration”) and the Chelyabinsk Regional Division of the Federal Security Service (Управление федеральной службы безопасности по Челябинской области, “the Regional Security Service”) dismissed the request, referring to the second applicant's conviction. The second applicant challenged the refusal in court. 10. On 21 June 2005 the Ozersk Town Court, Chelyabinsk Region, granted the second applicant's claim. According to the court's findings, the dismissal by the competent authorities of the second applicant's request for the entry to, and permanent residence in, Ozersk did not have a basis in law. The Town Court ordered (1) the Town Administration to issue the second applicant with an entry and residence permit and (2) the Regional Security Service to approve it. 11. The parties did not appeal against the judgment of 21 June 2005 and on 2 July 2005 it came into force. The Town Court issued two writs of execution. 12. On 29 July 2005 the Head of the Town's Administration approved the second applicant's application to be permanently registered in Ozersk. Despite this, on 6 August 2005 the bailiff opened enforcement proceedings in respect of the Town Administration. 13. On 18 August 2005 the administration of the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant informed the first applicant as follows: “Pursuant to Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no. 693 as of 11 July 1996 on special regulations in a closed administrative and territorial entity where enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Nuclear Power are located, on 12 October 2004 the federal security service authorised the temporary residence of [the second applicant] in ... Ozersk. As regards your application for permanent residence [for the second applicant] in [Ozersk], on 3 August 2005 the [Mayak administration] forwarded the [relevant] documents ... to the [Regional Security Service]. The time-limit for their response shall not exceed sixty days. Should the federal security service approve permanent residence [for the second applicant], the [Mayak administration] will prepare the necessary documents for his registration at his place of residence and issuance of a permanent pass.” 14. On 26 August 2005 the bailiff opened enforcement proceedings in respect of the Regional Security Service. 15. According to the Government, on 30 August 2005 the bailiff closed the enforcement proceedings in respect of the Town Administration, noting that the latter had complied with the judgment of 21 June 2005. According to the applicants, the bailiff's decision was not communicated to them. 16. On 5 September 2005 the management of the Mayak nuclear fuel reprocessing plant informed the second applicant that the Regional Security Service had refused to approve him for permanent residence in Ozersk. 17. According to the Government, on 10 October 2005 the bailiff closed the enforcement proceedings in respect of the Regional Security Service, noting that the judgment of 21 June 2005 had been enforced in full. The Government did not, however, submit any documents in support of this allegation. According to the applicants, they were not informed of the alleged closing of the enforcement proceedings. 18. On 13 December 2005 the second applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug dealing. On 16 March 2006 the Ozersk Town Court found him guilty as charged and sentenced him to four years' imprisonment. The second applicant's conviction was upheld in substance by the Presidium of the Chelyabinsk Regional Court by way of supervisory review. 19. The Law of the Russian Federation On Closed Administrative and Territorial Entities of 14 July 1992 (Article 1), as amended, provides as follows: “A closed administrative and territorial entity is a municipality where industrial enterprises specialising in development, production, storage and disposal of mass destruction weapons, processing of radioactive and other materials, military and other facilities... are located. [Such entities] are subject to special regulations on secured operation and protection of state secrets, including special residence conditions.” 20. Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation no. 693 as of 11 July 1996 on special regulations in a closed administrative and territorial entity where enterprises affiliated with the Ministry of Nuclear Power are located stipulates that entry to, and permanent residence in, a closed administrative and territorial entity is subject to restrictions (§ 2). The head of the administration may, subject to the approval of the federal security service, authorise entry to the closed entity (§ 19). Title to real property located in a closed administrative and territorial entity may give rise to a right to enter and reside there, subject to authorisation of access to state secrets (§ 23).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Waldemar Baran-Baranowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1944 and is currently serving a prison sentence at the Prison in Katowice. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Zaleski, a lawyer practising in Katowice. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 20 May 2003 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of trafficking in drugs and counterfeit US dollars while leading an organised criminal group. Later, several other members of the same criminal group were detained and charged in connection with the investigation of the applicant’s activities. The investigation was conducted by the Organised Crime Department of the Katowice Regional Prosecutor’s Office. On 21 May 2003 the Katowice District Court remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might tamper with evidence, go into hiding or induce witnesses to give false testimony. The court also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence. An appeal by the applicant against the detention order was dismissed on 18 June 2003 by the Katowice Regional Court. Subsequent appeals against decisions extending his detention were all unsuccessful. In his appeals he argued that the charges against him were based on unreliable and contradictory evidence. He further pleaded not guilty. On 23 December 2003 the applicant began serving a twenty-five-year prison sentence, given by the Olsztyn Regional Court in a different set of criminal proceedings. In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions, inter alia on 5 August and 7 November 2003 and 13 February and 23 April 2004 by the Katowice Regional Court, 12 May and 22 September 2004, 13 May and 7 December 2005, 8 March, 27 September and 20 December 2006, and 4 April, 24 October and 28 December 2007 by the Katowice Court of Appeal. On 6 February 2008, on a decision by the Katowice Court of Appeal the applicant’s detention was further extended until 30 April 2008. In all their detention decisions the authorities repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention. They considered that the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, in particular the need to verify evidence from thirty-three suspects and fifty witnesses and to have them all confronted justified holding him in custody. They further stressed the extensive body of evidence to be considered in the case and the need to obtain opinions from several experts, including those with expertise in toxicology and chemistry. On 17 April 2008 the Katowice Regional Court decided to lodge a request with the Katowice Court of Appeal to have the applicant’s detention further extended until 31 July 2008. On 14 December 2004 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges of trafficking in drugs and other illicit substances and counterfeit US dollars brought against several defendants, who were all acting in an organised criminal group. The maximum anticipated prison sentence against the applicant was more than eight years. On 16 July 2008 the Katowice Regional Court delivered a judgment. The applicant was found guilty as charged and sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. He appealed. At present the appeal proceedings are pending. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of detention during judicial proceedings (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006 and Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr D. Walton of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 4 February 2002, the applicant received a letter from the West Mercia Constabulary asking him to provide information about who was driving his car on 31 January 2002 when it failed to comply with the speed limit. The letter also stated that the police intended to prosecute the driver and that failing to supply information as to the driver was a criminal offence under section 172 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. The applicant replied that he was responding under duress and that he was the driver. On 18 September 2002, before the Magistrates’ Court, the applicant pleaded not guilty to the speeding offence and the prosecution sought to rely on his admission. The Magistrates rejected the applicant’s arguments that the use of the confession violated the Convention. He was convicted of speeding and fined GBP 125, with GBP 263 costs and three penalty points endorsed on his licence.

128,001-66772,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,MAZUREK v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicants, Mrs Maria Mazurek and Mr Tadeusz Mazurek, are Polish nationals who were born in 1932 and 1927 respectively. They live in Rumia, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicants shared an apartment with a certain married couple, J.K. and U.K. On 2 November 1992 the applicants requested the Gdynia District Court (Sad Rejonowy) to order eviction of J.K. and U.K. (“the defendants”) from the apartment. They claimed that the defendants had no legal title to occupy the premises. On 2 February 1993 the Gdynia District Court gave judgment, in which it ordered eviction of the defendants from the applicants’ apartment. The judgment became final. On 27 April 1993 the District Court issued a writ of enforcement. The case was transferred to the Rumia Municipal Office (Urzad Miasta Rumia) which was charged with enforcement of the judgment by providing the defendants with an alternative dwelling (lokal zastepczy). On 15 January 1997 the applicants lodged with the Gdańsk Governor (Wojewoda) a complaint about the inactivity of the Rumia Municipal Office. The complaint was transferred to the Gdańsk SelfGovernment Board, which ordered the Rumia Municipal Office to submit the applicants’ casefile. Subsequently, the Rumia Municipal Office informed the Gdańsk Self-Government Board that no decision had yet been made in the case. Following several complaints made by the applicants to the Municipal Office, the MPs and the Ombudsman, on 19 May 1999 the Rumia Mayor informed them that it was not possible to give an exact date when the proceedings would end because the municipality did not have available a sufficient number of alternative dwellings. On 3 January 2001 the applicants turned to the Pomorskie Governor complaining about the inactivity of the administrative authorities. On 5 January 2001 the Pomorskie Governor requested the Rumia Mayor to deal with the case as soon as possible. On 20 February 2001 the Rumia Mayor provided the defendants with an alternative dwelling. According to the Law of 2 July 1994 on the Lease of Dwellings and Housing Allowances (Ustawa o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych), enforcement of a final court’s judgment concerning the provision of an alternative dwelling should be dealt by the municipalities in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Administrative Procedure. Article 35 of the Code of Administrative Procedure lays down timelimits ranging from 1 month to 2 months for dealing with a case pending before an administrative authority. If those time-limits have not been complied with, the authority must, under Article 36 of the Code, inform the parties of that fact, explain the reasons for the delay and fix a new timelimit. Pursuant to Article 37 § 1, if the case has not been handled within the time-limits referred to in Articles 35 and 36, a party to administrative proceedings can lodge an appeal to the higher authority, alleging inactivity. In cases where the allegations of inactivity are well-founded, the higher authority fixes a new term for handling the case and orders an inquiry in order to determine the reasons for the inactivity and to identify the persons responsible for the delay. If need be, the authority may order that measures be applied to prevent future such delays. Until 1 October 1995, under Article 216 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, a party to administrative proceedings could, at any time, lodge with the Supreme Administrative Court a complaint about the fact that an administrative authority had failed to issue a decision. On 1 October 1995, when a new Law of 11 May 1995 on the Supreme Administrative Court (“the 1995 Act”) took effect, Article 216 of the Code of Administrative Procedure was repealed. Under section 17 of the 1995 Act, a party to administrative proceedings may, at any time, lodge with the Supreme Administrative Court a complaint against inactivity on the part of an authority obliged to issue an administrative decision. Section 26 of the Law provides: “When a complaint alleging inactivity on the part of an administrative authority is well-founded, the Supreme Administrative Court shall oblige that authority to issue a decision, or to perform a specific act, or to confirm, declare, or recognise a right or obligation provided for by law.” Moreover, the Court notes that pursuant to section 30 of the Law, the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court ordering an authority to put an end to its inactivity is legally binding on the authority concerned. If the authority has not complied with the decision, the court may, under section 31 of the 1995 Act, impose a fine on it and may itself give a ruling on the right or obligation in question. Pursuant to section 31 of the Law, a party to the proceedings who sustains damage as a result of a failure of the administrative body to act in compliance with the judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court given under Article 17 of the Act, is entitled to claim compensation from the administrative authority concerned, according to principles of civil liability as set out in the Civil Code. Such a claim should be first lodged with that authority. A decision on the compensation claim should be taken by that administrative authority within three months. If the authority concerned fails to give a ruling in this respect within this timelimit, or if the party is not satisfied with the compensation granted, a compensation claim against the administrative body can be lodged with a civil court. Section 34 of the 1995 Act sets out the requirement of the exhaustion of available remedies before lodging a complaint with the Supreme Administrative Court. Accordingly, a complaint concerning alleged inactivity should be preceded by the lodging of a complaint with an administrative organ of a higher level, pursuant to the abovementioned Article 37 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
129,001-24052,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,TAHERI KANDOMABADI v. the NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Akbar Taheri Kandomabadi, is an Iranian national, who was born in 1979 and is currently staying in the Netherlands. He is represented before the Court by Mr M.A. Collet, a lawyer practising in Waalwijk. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 7 August 2000 the applicant arrived in the Netherlands. On the same day, he applied for asylum. In support of his claim for asylum he submitted the following: Whilst living in Teheran, the applicant and his family (consisting of his mother and his two brothers) were frequently harassed by the authorities. By threatening to arrest the family members, the authorities wanted to exert pressure on the applicant’s father to give himself up. The applicant’s father was a professional soldier who did not agree with the regime. When he was ordered to fight against the Kurds in Iran, he deserted, fled the country and applied for asylum in the Netherlands in 1993. Although his father was not recognised as a refugee within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951 (“the Geneva Convention”), he had been granted a residence permit. In order to avoid arrest, the applicant and his mother and siblings stayed with different relatives, making sure never to stay at any one address for very long. However, the authorities always managed to trace them. The applicant was unable to go to school because his name featured on a list of people who were not allowed to attend school. According to the applicant, this was because his father was wanted by the authorities. In March 1994 the Vezarat-e Sepah Pasdaran-e Enqelab-e Islamic (Islamic Revolutionary Guards, “Sepah Pasdaran”) came to arrest the applicant’s older brother, Hamid, but his uncle Bahran had managed to organise Hamid’s departure to Turkey before he could be arrested. In 1996, the applicant, his mother and younger brother also managed to reach Turkey. However, when Hamid was arrested in Istanbul and sent back to Iran, the other relatives also decided to return to Iran out of concern for him. Hamid was detained for two to three months and tortured during that time. His uncle Bahran managed to obtain Hamid’s release, presumably through the payment of bribes. The applicant resumed his life of staying at different addresses. On 8 July 1999, students demonstrated in Teheran following the closure of a newspaper. That night, security services raided dormitories on the university campus. Several students were wounded and others arrested in the raid. As a result, more student protests followed. The protests spread to other cities. Non-students, including the applicant, also participated. During one of the demonstrations, the applicant handed out wood and stones to the students, helped set fire to a bus and a fire engine and built barricades. Troops responsible for public order charged at the demonstrators; the applicant was beaten and his hand broken. After the demonstrations, many people were arrested and nothing more was heard of them. The applicant learnt that photographs had been taken of the people who had set fire to the bus and the fire engine. His uncle Bahran thought that it would be better for the applicant to leave the country and he put up the money for the applicant to go to Turkey in October 1999. Until his departure, he remained in Teheran, staying in hiding at the houses of friends. Whilst in Turkey, the applicant was told by his mother on the telephone that a summons in his name, ordering him to report to the Sepah Pasdaran, had been delivered to his uncle’s address. The applicant stayed in Turkey for some ten months. He did not apply for asylum in Turkey. A “travel agent” arranged for him to go to the Netherlands, together with a number of other people. They travelled by foot, boat, bus and train. The applicant used a Swedish passport in the name of a man of Iranian origin. The passport had been given to him by the “travel agent”. The applicant did not know through which countries his journey took him. In the proceedings on his first request for asylum, the applicant submitted copies of two summonses. The first (“document (A)”) was dated 17 July 1999 and bore the number 1, the second (“document (B)”) was dated 15 August 1999 and bore the number 3 – the applicant stated that the summons bearing number 2 had never been received. The summonses had been issued by Sepah Pasdaran’s Justice Bureau and stated, without giving any reasons, that the applicant was to report to a specific place at a specific time. According to the applicant, these summonses had been given to his mother. Having considered that the applicant’s asylum request could be dealt with in the so-called accelerated procedure (see below), the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) rejected the request on 24 August 2000. The applicant’s objection (bezwaar) against this decision was dismissed as manifestly ill-founded on 12 September 2000 by the Acting President of the Regional Court of The Hague, together with his request for a stay of expulsion. The Acting President agreed with the Deputy Minister that the applicant’s failure to submit documents capable of establishing his identity, his nationality or his travel route affected the sincerity of his account and detracted from its credibility. The Acting President further expressed doubts as to the credibility of the applicant’s account concerning the problems encountered by his family in Iran allegedly as a result of the situation of his father. It was noted in this respect that the applicant’s father had told the Netherlands authorities that he had never encountered problems for political reasons, but that he had been unable to obtain promotion in the army on account of several episodes of desertion. The Acting President also did not find it sufficiently established that the Iranian authorities were aware of the applicant’s participation in the student demonstrations, or that he was “wanted” by those authorities as a result of his participation. The applicant was found to have been inconsistent in this regard, first telling the immigration authorities that, whilst in Turkey, his mother had told him that a summons had been sent to his uncle’s address, yet the copies of the summonses submitted dated from the time when the applicant had still been in Iran, and they had allegedly been given to his mother. Finally, the summonses submitted were not originals and did not state the reason why the applicant was supposed to report to the authorities. On 9 July 2001 the applicant requested both the Deputy Minister and the Regional Court to review their respective decisions in view of the fact that he had in the meantime managed to obtain original documents. The Regional Court refused this request in a decision on 15 February 2002, stating in an obiter dictum that the documents might lead the applicant to decide to lodge a new request for asylum. On 25 June 2002 the Deputy Minister informed the applicant that a request for revision could only be made in the form of a new request for asylum. The applicant was subsequently informed when and where he should formally lodge such a new request. The applicant lodged his second request for asylum on 2 August 2002. This was also dealt with in the accelerated procedure. In support of this request he submitted the originals of the above-mentioned summonses (A) and (B), as well as a further summons (“document (C)”), dated 28 August 1999. He also stated that his uncle in Iran had recently managed to get a third person to obtain the following, original, documents from a file on the applicant: – a letter/memo dated 11 September 1999 from the Justice Bureau in the Western Teheran district to the Opposition Operations Department, stating that the applicant was being prosecuted on charges of participation in the revolt at the university campus, and requesting the addressee to arrest the applicant (“document (D)”); – an undated letter/memo (the space after “date: ” is left blank) from the assistant criminal investigations officer in the police operations division to the commanding officer of border controls, in which reference is made to a letter dated 29 November 1999 of the public prosecution department, and in which the addressee is requested to ensure that the applicant does not leave the country and is arrested should he try to leave (“document (E)”); – an undated letter/memo (the space after “date: ” is left blank) from an assistant information officer to his counterpart in the police identification division, in which reference is made to the order issued by the commanding officer of Sepah Pasdaran relating to the identification of the suspects at the university campus, and in which the addressee is requested to make available all information concerning the background of the applicant (“document (F)”); – an undated letter/memo (the space after “date: ” is left blank) from an assistant information officer to the commanding officer of the Greater Teheran District, in which reference is made to the order issued by the Sepah Pasdaran commanding officer relating to the arrest of those persons who had “caused the university campus [disturbance]”, and in which the addressee is requested to observe all of the applicant’s movements so that he could be arrested once his whereabouts were known (“document (G)”). The applicant’s second request for asylum was rejected by the Minister for Aliens Affairs and Integration (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie, the successor of the Deputy Minister of Justice) on 5 August 2002. The Minister held that the documents submitted by the applicant did not constitute newly emerged facts or altered circumstances. In this respect, the Minister found that no decisive importance could be attributed to the undated documents. The new documents did not lead to a conclusion different from the one reached on the first request for asylum, given that in those earlier proceedings the applicant’s account had not been found wholly credible; the applicant had not established his identity so that it could not be ascertained whether the new documents related to him, and he had failed to give a plausible explanation as to why he could not have submitted the new documents at an earlier stage. For these reasons, the Minister did not consider that the merits of the new request for asylum should be examined. He therefore rejected it by referring to the decision on the first request, in accordance with Article 4:6 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht). On 6 September 2002 the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Arnhem, rejected both the applicant’s request for a stay of expulsion and his appeal (beroep) against the decision of the Minister. The judge agreed with the Minister that no newly emerged facts or altered circumstances had been adduced by the applicant. Such facts or circumstances only existed if they had not played a role in the proceedings on the first request for asylum and if they could not have been submitted at that time. Facts and circumstances which had been known to the applicant prior to 12 September 2000 (the date of the final decision on the first request for asylum) could thus in principle not be considered. The documents (E), (F) and (G) could only be seen as further arguments (nadere bewijsvoering) relating to the first request which had already been rejected. The applicant lodged a further appeal (hoger beroep) with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State), in which he argued that there were “altered circumstances”: his first request for asylum had been rejected because his account was found not to be credible, whereas the new documents showed that it was credible. The further appeal was rejected on 8 November 2002, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division finding that since documents (E), (F) and (G) were undated, it could not be established that it had been impossible for the applicant to submit them in the proceedings on his first request for asylum. It was further held that the applicant had not adduced any exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him personally, on the basis of which his new request for asylum fell to be assessed outside the framework of Article 4:6 of the General Administrative Law Act. Following the rejection of the applicant’s first request for asylum by the Deputy Minister of Justice on 24 August 2000, the applicant’s entitlement to State-sponsored reception facilities ceased, and it was not revived with the lodging of the second request for asylum. The applicant subsequently received some financial support from refugee and charitable organisations and private donors, but from February 2004 he was no longer in receipt of any kind of income. On 19 April 2004 he lodged an official request to the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (Central Orgaan opvang Asielzoekers; hereafter the “COA”) to be provided with facilities to meet his basic needs. Having received no reaction, the applicant lodged an objection against the implied refusal (fictieve weigering) of his request on 8 May 2004. He also applied to the Regional Court for a provisional measure. Both procedures are currently still pending. Under Article 15 § 1 of the Aliens Act 1965 (vreemdelingenwet, hereinafter “the Act”), which was in force until 1 April 2001, aliens coming from a country where they have a well-founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political convictions, or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group, could be admitted as refugees. The expression “refugee” in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention (decision of the Judicial Division of Council of State of 16 October 1980, Rechtspraak Vreemdelingenrecht [Immigration Law Reports] 1981, no. 1). On 1 April 2001, the Aliens Act 2000 entered into force. On the basis of Article 29 of the new Aliens Act, an alien may be eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if, inter alia, – he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, or – he or she has established well-founded reasons to assume that he/she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin. Requests which, after a first intake interview with the applicant, are judged to be inadmissible and/or manifestly ill-founded, may be dealt with in an accelerated procedure if they do not require a time-consuming investigation, meaning that they can be processed with all due care within 48 working hours. This fast-track procedure was introduced following a huge rise in the number of asylum applications that began in 1993. Article 4:6 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht) provides that an applicant must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances (nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden) if a new request is filed following a decision in which the original request is, either totally or partially, rejected. When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced, the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request. Article 4:6 thus embodies the ne bis in idem principle for the administrative law. Nevertheless, an exception has been made in this particular area of the law, in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally, on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of Article 4:6. In the case of a repeat asylum application which also invokes the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, an assessment by the court outside the framework of Article 4:6 is therefore possible. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State has on one occasion quashed the dismissal of a repeat application for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum despite the absence of new facts or altered circumstances (judgment of 24 April 2003, no. 220300506/1, Nieuwsbrief Asiel- en Vluchtelingenrecht [Newsletter on Asylum and Refugeelaw] 2003/160). It did so on the basis of the exceptional circumstance that there was no dispute between the parties, that on his return to his country of origin, the alien would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment or punishment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention. During the initial asylum procedure, an alien is entitled to reception and other facilities provided by the State. However, entitlements do not exist if the application has been refused in the accelerated procedure. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Aliens Act 2000, an alien whose stay in the Netherlands is not lawful is not entitled to reception facilities. This provision applies to asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful. Also, a second or further application for asylum does not confer a new entitlement to reception facilities. An exception to that basic principle can nevertheless be made if, inter alia, the asylum seeker finds him or herself in extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances (zeer schrijnende humanitaire omstandigheden, Chapter C5/20.4 of the Aliens Circular 2000). The question whether such circumstances exist is always considered after it has been ascertained that the second or further application for asylum will not be processed in the accelerated procedure. It may also be considered if a person, who has submitted a second or further application, requests reception facilities due to extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances. The COA decides whether or not reception facilities will be provided. Appeal lies against a decision to refuse reception, but also against a failure to decide (or to decide within a reasonable time) on a request for reception facilities. The lodging of an appeal does not suspend the denial of reception facilities, but a provisional measure may be requested to the effect that such facilities are made available pending the appeal proceedings. In a decision of 28 April 2004 (nr. AWB 04/4053 COA), the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Alkmaar, noted that the legislator had omitted to regulate whether or not an entitlement to reception facilities existed during the period for which an interim measure pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court was in place. The judge considered that, as a result of the application of Rule 39, the petitioner could not be said to be under an obligation to leave the country and his stay in the Netherlands was, therefore, lawful. In addition, the denial of reception facilities – which was aimed at encouraging a departure from the Netherlands – might detract from the effectiveness of the interim measure. In these circumstances, the judge perceived cause to grant a provisional measure to the effect that the COA should provide the petitioner with reception facilities pending the proceedings on his appeal against the COA’s refusal of such facilities. In different proceedings, the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State held on 25 May 2004 that, as long as an interim measure pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court is in place, the stay in the Netherlands of the person concerned is lawful (nr. 200400863/1). Policy is based on official country reports (ambtsberichten), periodically drawn up by the Netherlands’ Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The country report on Iran of 21 December 1999 described how student demonstrations followed parliamentary discussions on a bill relating to the press and the closure of a newspaper on 7 July 1999, which got out of hand when riot police, security forces and units of the fundamentalist Ansare Hezbollah raided the campus of the University of Teheran and used force against the students, resulting in a number of deaths and hundreds of injuries. The violent attack on the students led to mass street protests in several Iranian cities, where demonstrations for greater openness and freedom were held over a number of days. These led to violent confrontations with the police, security services and groups supporting conservative forces. President Khatami finally banned all demonstrations. It appeared that 1,500 students were arrested. At the time of the country report, 200 were still thought to be in detention. The four “instigators” of the protests had allegedly been condemned to death, although the Iranian Government neither confirmed nor denied such reports. Prison terms varying from a few months to thirteen years (for one of the “instigators”) were imposed. The country report concluded that the human rights situation in Iran remained a source of concern, despite a few positive developments. Notably those groups or individuals perceived in Iran as a threat or potential threat to a society based on Islamic values and standards were at risk of becoming victims of human rights violations. The policy formulated on the basis of this country report meant that inter alia the following persons were eligible for consideration as possible refugees: – persons viewed, whether individually or as a member of a particular group, as a threat, or a potential threat, to a society based on Islamic values and standards; and – intellectuals, and in particular writers, journalists or publishers, who were viewed as a threat, or a potential threat, to society on the basis of their publications or other utterances in Iran. According to the country report of 30 August 2000, students in Iran were relatively quiet in the period leading up to the commemoration on 8 July 2000 of the riots of July 1999. However, a demonstration on 8 July 2000 that was intended to be peaceful got completely out of hand. The police intervened when the marchers began to shout slogans, students were arrested and fights broke out. Many participants in the demonstration at the University of Teheran were in fact ordinary people, rather than students. On 11 February 2000, Ayatollah Khamenei announced an amnesty for 10,000 people who had been involved in the riots of July 1999. The death penalty was imposed on one of the participants in the student disturbances but not carried out, the sentence being commuted to 15 years’ imprisonment. The three “instigators” of the student unrest of July 1999, who had been arrested on 26 July 1999, and on 1 March 2000 sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, were acquitted on appeal in mid-July 2000. The country report of 24 August 2001 showed that the human rights situation in Iran had deteriorated in the second half of 2000 and the first few months of 2001. The persecution of reformist intellectuals continued unabated. Nevertheless, in July 2001 it was reported in the press that the speaker of the Iranian parliament had requested Ayatollah Khamenei to grant an amnesty to the last 17 students still in prison because of their activities during the student revolt. Only ten students from this group – the ones who had received the heaviest sentences – were still in prison at the time of the country report. They were primarily members and sympathisers of a student union that was viewed with suspicion by the regime. The most recent country report, that of 10 February 2003, states that, as far as could be ascertained, six of the students imprisoned for taking part in the riots of July 1999 were still in prison, four students having been released in 2002. In the light of the most recent developments in Iran, as described in the country reports, Netherlands policy on admitting Iranian nationals has remained largely unchanged. Every asylum seeker from Iran must still demonstrate that the personal facts and circumstances of his or her case – viewed objectively – justify a fear of persecution as defined in refugee law or might lead to the conclusion that he or she would be subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention if returned. Furthermore, the mere fact of a person being a student is no reason to fear persecution by the Iranian authorities. In order to be eligible for a residence permit, students who have taken part in demonstrations or riots, or who occupy important positions within the student movement, have to establish that, because of that fact, they personally are viewed with suspicion by the authorities. Moreover, not every form of suspicion immediately leads to the conclusion that there can be said to be persecution within the meaning of refugee law. On 25 February 2004 the United States Department of State released the 2003 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Iran. It stated inter alia: “The Government’s poor human rights record worsened, and it continued to commit numerous, serious abuses. ... Continuing serious abuses included: summary executions; disappearances; torture and other degrading treatment, reportedly including severe punishments such as beheading and flogging; poor prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of habeas corpus or access to counsel and prolonged and incommunicado detention. Citizens often did not receive due process or fair trials. The Government infringed on citizens’ privacy rights, and restricted freedom of speech, press, assembly, association and religion. ... During a wave of student protests in June, vigilantes beat many protestors, and police arrested approximately 4,000 persons (both protestors and vigilantes), according to Government figures shortly after the protests. The Government banned demonstrations planned for July 9 to commemorate the killing of several students by security forces in demonstrations held in 1999 and arrested more student activists at that time.” In its Annual Report 2004, covering events from January to December 2003, Amnesty International noted with respect to Iran inter alia: “Scores of political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, continued to serve sentences imposed in previous years following unfair trials. Scores more were arrested in 2003, often arbitrarily and many following student demonstrations. ... The development and fulfilment of human rights in Iran were adversely affected by the political stalemate between supporters and opponents of reform. ... Students convicted and imprisoned after student demonstrations in 1999 were reported to have been ill-treated in custody. In several cases, they faced new charges, including some relating to defamation and insult, reportedly based on statements made in prison or given to the media while on temporary leave from prison.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Mr Yevgeniy Yevgenyevich Trifontsov, is a Russian national who was born in 1963 and lives in Kaliningrad. He was represented before the Court by Mr V. Filatyev and Mr S. Baranov, lawyers practising in Kaliningrad. 2. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr P. Laptev, the former Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights, and then by Mr G. Matyushkin, their Representative at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. At the relevant time the applicant was working as a police investigator. He was in charge of a criminal case against N.K., a student suspected of illegal possession of drugs. The case against N.K. was opened on 23 November 1999. 4. According to the official account of events, in December 1999January 2000 the applicant repeatedly contacted N.K.’s parents offering to close the case against their son in exchange for payment of a certain sum of money. The applicant’s father, V.K., tentatively agreed. However, some time later V.K., having discussed the matter with his wife, decided to report the applicant and secretly recorded their conversations on several audiotapes. On 28 December 1999 V.K. informed the Internal Security Service (hereinafter the “ISS”) of the offer he had received from the applicant. He gave them the audiotapes at a later date. It is unclear when those recordings were made and what they contained. 5. The applicant claimed that he had been incited by V.K. to take the money. He also maintained that V.K. had been acting on ISS orders, and that the ISS had instructed V.K. to make him accept the deal and to secretly record their conversations. 6. The ISS’s first official record of V.K.’s statement reporting the applicant was dated 15 January 2000. To the extent that V.K.’s statement is legible (the record of his questioning is hand-written), it can be summarised as follows. According to V.K., in December 1999 the applicant solicited a bribe from N.K.’s mother. In January 2000 the applicant made a similar approach to V.K. The applicant allegedly asked for 5,000 US dollars (US$), which were supposed to go to a supervising prosecutor. V.K. claimed that he had taped some of his conversations with the applicant on his own initiative. 7. On the same date, the ISS conducted a covert operation targeting the applicant. They equipped V.K. with a radio-transmitting device connected to a tape-recorder and instructed him to record his conversation with the applicant. They also gave V.K. money to be handed over to the applicant, and recorded the serial numbers of the banknotes in a document, signed by two attesting witnesses – soldiers from a nearby military base. 8. Again on 15 January 2000 V.K. called the applicant, who told V.K. that they should meet at the regional Prosecutor’s Office. They met there at about noon and discussed the deal. Their conversation was recorded by the ISS through the radio transmitter. In the course of the conversation, the applicant reproached V.K. for having brought only US$ 2,500, namely half the amount agreed earlier. V.K. replied that he would bring the remaining half later. The applicant also asked V.K. whether he had told anybody about their deal. V.K. replied in the negative. The applicant then asked V.K. to leave the money on a table, in a plastic bag. When V.K. had done so, the applicant gave him an official note signed by the applicant and confirming that the case against N.K. had been closed. 9. As soon as the applicant left the building, V.K. contacted the ISS officers, who were waiting nearby and informed them that the money had been handed over. The ISS officers immediately apprehended the applicant, but found that he was not in possession of the money. They then searched the premises where V.K. had met the applicant and found the money in a plastic bag, hidden in the corridor. The serial numbers on the banknotes found there corresponded to those on the banknotes received by V.K. from the ISS. The ISS officers drew up a report of the search of the place of the incident, which was attested by the same two witnesses. The applicant was questioned and arrested. The case was then transferred to the regional Prosecutor’s Office, and on 18 January 2000 the applicant was formally charged with taking a bribe. Material obtained by the ISS during the covert operation was declassified and attached to the criminal case file. On 16 May 2000 the prosecution sent the case with a bill of indictment to the Kaliningrad Regional Court. 10. In the course of the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty and alleged that it was V.K. who had offered him money. The applicant did not deny that he had agreed to take the money but claimed that his real intention had been to report V.K. as a briber. He had arranged for the meeting to take place at the Prosecutor’s Office in order to report him to his friends who worked there. The applicant also claimed that the tape recorded on 15 January 2000 and the search report should not have been admitted in evidence. 11. The prosecution insisted that the applicant had extorted money from V.K. In support, they produced the report of “the search of the place of the incident” (namely the corridor where the money had been discovered in a plastic bag). They also produced the report of an expert examination of the fingerprints on the plastic bag, according to which the fingerprints belonged to the applicant. A record of the conversation of 15 January 2000 between the applicant and V.K. was also presented to the court. Finally, the prosecution submitted the official note signed by the applicant certifying that the case against N.K. was closed.. 12. The court heard several witnesses. V.K. testified that the applicant had offered to discontinue the proceedings against his son in exchange for a sum of money. His testimony was corroborated by N.K., who testified that in 1999 his father had told him about the offer made by the applicant. Another witness, V.K.’s wife, stated that she had known about the deal and had persuaded her husband to inform the ISS about it. The court also examined the ISS officers involved in the operation. They confirmed that V.K. had informed them about the offer made by the applicant. The applicant’s immediate superiors and colleagues were also examined. They claimed that the applicant had never told them that V.K. had offered him money to close the criminal case against N.K. 13. The court also examined the record of the applicant’s first questioning and noted that the applicant had not referred to “incitement” when questioned. The court also heard the two attesting witnesses who had been present on 15 January 2000 during the preparation of the covert operation and during the search of the premises of the regional Prosecutor’s Office. They confirmed the accuracy of the reports drawn up by the ISS. 14. Finally, the court listened to the tape recording made secretly during the meeting between V.K. and the applicant on 15 January 2000, examined the transcript of the tape and studied the official note concerning the closure of the criminal case against N.K. 15. On 13 July 2000 the Kaliningrad Regional Court found the applicant guilty of taking a bribe and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment. 16. The applicant appealed. He maintained that ISS officers had framed him. He submitted that the ISS should have first obtained V.K.’s written statement, then opened an inquiry or instituted criminal proceedings, but that none of that had been done. The applicant also contested the admissibility and authencity of the tape recording of his conversation with V.K.. He also contested the admissibility of the search report . He submitted that those pieces of evidence had been obtained in breach of the law. Furthermore, the applicant challenged the veracity and consistency of statements of the witnesses who had testified against him. 17. On 28 December 2000 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the decision of the Kaliningrad Regional Court and confirmed the findings of the first-instance court as to the facts of the case. It also noted that the operation that had led to the applicant’s arrest had been carried out in conformity with the applicable legislation. The material obtained by the ISS had been duly incorporated in the body of evidence. Furthermore, in accordance with criminal procedure rules, the ISS had the right to search premises without waiting for an investigator from the Prosecutor’s Office. 18.

131,001-94312,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,WNUK v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"The applicant, Ms Mariola Wnuk, is a Polish national who was born in 1977 and lives in Trzebnica. The applicant lodged with the Wrocław Regional Court an action for payment against the State Insurance Company (“PZU”). On 8 October 1999 the Regional Court partly allowed the applicant’s claim. She appealed. On 29 March 2000 the Wrocław Court of Appeal slightly increased the amount awarded to the applicant. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, erroneous assessment of evidence and application of incorrect criteria by the lower courts in respect of the value of her claim. On 8 May 2002 the Supreme Court refused to entertain the cassation appeal. It relied on a provision of the newly amended Code of Civil Procedure (which entered into force on 1 July 2000) allowing it to leave without examination manifestly ill-founded appeals or appeals in cases where no serious legal issue arises. The decision was taken by a single judge sitting in camera. The written reasons provided as follows: According to Article 393 of the Code of Civil Procedure, when the challenged judicial decision does not manifestly breach the law or the proceedings are not invalid in law (§ 2), the Supreme Court may refuse to entertain a cassation appeal if there is no appearance of a significant legal issue in the case, there is no need for the interpretation of provisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the courts’ case-law or the cassation appeal is manifestly ill-founded (§ 1). (...) In the present case none of the circumstances set out in Article 393 § 2 was present and consequently the Supreme Court, having considered the grounds set out in § 1, found it justified to refuse to entertain the cassation appeal. On 11 October 2002 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, alleging, inter alia, a breach of her right of access to court and to a fair hearing on account of the retrospective application of new Article 393 of the Code of Civil Procedure to cassation appeals lodged before its entry into force. On 31 March 2005 the Constitutional Court delivered judgment no. SK 26/02, having joined several complaints, including the applicant’s complaint, in the same proceedings (see domestic law below). A party to civil proceedings could, at the material time, lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court against a judicial decision of a secondinstance court. A party had to be represented by an advocate or a legal adviser. Article 3931 of the Code of Civil Procedure as applicable at that time listed the grounds on which a cassation appeal could be lodged. It read as follows: “The cassation appeal may be based on the following grounds: 1) a breach of substantive law as a result of its erroneous interpretation or wrongful application; 2) a breach of procedural provisions, if that defect could significantly affect the outcome of the case.” Article 3933 specified the requirements of a cassation appeal. It read in its relevant part: “§ 1. A cassation appeal should include: 1) an indication of the decision under appeal together with information as to whether the appeal is lodged against this decision in its entirety or in part only; 2) an indication of the grounds for the cassation appeal; 3) arguments showing that its examination would be justified; 4) a motion to have the decision under appeal quashed or amended, specifying also the scope of the motion.” Pursuant to Article 393¹³ the Supreme Court, having allowed a cassation appeal, could quash the challenged judgment in its entirety or in part and remit the case for re-examination. Where the Supreme Court failed to find non-conformity with the law, it dismissed the cassation appeal. Pursuant to Article 3937 a cassation appeal, in principle, was examined during a hearing by a panel of three judges; the court could, however, reject a cassation appeal on formal grounds at a sitting. The judgment or decision had to be accompanied by written reasons. On 24 May 2000 a law was enacted amending the Code of Civil Procedure. It entered into force on 1 July 2000. It introduced, inter alia, the following provision (amended Article 393) – the so-called “pre-judgment” (preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal): “§ 1. The Supreme Court may refuse to entertain the cassation appeal, if: 1) there is no appearance of any significant legal issue in the case, 2) there is no need for the interpretation of provisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the courts’ case-law, 3) the appeal is manifestly ill-founded. § 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the challenged judicial decision manifestly breached law or when the proceedings are invalid at law.” Pursuant to amended Article 3937 the decision to refuse to entertain a cassation appeal or to reject it on formal grounds could be taken in camera in a single judge formation. Although the legal provisions did not expressly provide for such a possibility, usually the written reasons accompanying such decisions were limited to a simplified, schematic formula which did not contain any legal analysis, did not indicate the specific grounds for the decision, did not invoke grounds of appeal and did not refer to any facts or circumstances which would allow the identification of a particular case. On 6 February 2005 new provisions on a “cassation complaint” came into effect, replacing the provisions governing the cassation appeal. In its judgment of 31 March 2005 (SK 26/02) the Constitutional Court examined a number of constitutional complaints challenging the provisions of Article 393 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The Constitutional Court held that although the Constitution did not guarantee a right to cassation as such, the fact that it was provided for by the Code of Civil Procedure meant that it had to meet the requirements of the rule of law and procedural justice. The Constitutional Court observed, inter alia, that certain terms describing the conditions which a cassation appeal had to meet under Articles 393 et seq. of the Code (“significant legal issue”, “provisions raising serious doubts or causing discrepancies in the courts’ case-law”, “arguments showing that examination of the cassation appeal would be justified”) were drafted in the broadest terms. It noted that the judicial practice regarding their application had given rise to serious interpretational difficulties and discrepancies in the caselaw of the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Court considered the relevant requirements of Article 393 and their interpretation by the Supreme Court to be vague and subjective and, in practice, known exclusively to the Supreme Court but not to those who wished to lodge a cassation appeal. According to the Constitutional Court, if the conditions for admissibility of a claim (preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal) were formulated in imprecise terms, the right of access to a court could not be exercised effectively because of the risk of arbitrariness of the assessing body. In this context the court criticised, in particular, the practice of “simplified reasons”. It held that the use of open-ended concepts by the legislator could not be considered, in itself, as unconstitutional, as it allowed the courts a certain flexibility, to better tailor their decisions to circumstances at hand. However, in such case the obligation to substantiate the legal norm was shifted to the stage of its application. This gave the courts a certain discretion which was not to be confused with an absolute freedom from external supervision. Consequently, a general and imprecise procedural clause required a strong justification and indication of specific circumstances. The practice of formulaic justification in the preliminary assessment of a cassation appeal created a situation where nobody could identify how, if at all, the Supreme Court had performed the necessary assessment to substantiate those vague terms. The case-law providing guidance on their application was thus practically non-existent. The court informed the addressee of its decision that the requirements of the given article had not been met, but did not indicate any circumstances which justified this conclusion. As a result, a principle of trust has been breached. Moreover, it was impossible for lawyers in general to recognise the Supreme Court’s understanding of those requirements for the purpose of effectively lodging a cassation appeal in the future. Consequently, the “pre-judgment” did not guarantee procedural predictability to the party, who has lodged a cassation appeal meeting all formal requirements. The right of access to a court had thus been transformed into a pretence of this right. Nevertheless the Constitutional Court found that it was the practice of the Supreme Court that deserved disapproval and not the relevant provisions, and the wording of those provisions could not be considered unconstitutional. In this context the court observed that the practice was not uniform and certain chambers of the Supreme Court justified their decisions in a much more elaborate and substantive way. The court further observed that the challenged provisions had already ceased to exist prior to the delivery of the present judgment. Accordingly, the Constitutional Court refused to decide on the compatibility of those provisions with the Constitution and discontinued the proceedings in this respect. Article 79 § 1 of the Constitution, which entered into force on 17 October 1997, provides as follows: “In accordance with principles specified by statute, everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed, shall have the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the conformity with the Constitution of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the Constitution.” Article 190 of the Constitution, insofar as relevant, provides as follows: “1. Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final. 2. Judgments of the Constitutional Court, ... shall be published without delay. 3. A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from the day of its publication; however, the Constitutional Court may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act. Such time-limit may not exceed 18 months in relation to a statute or 12 months in relation to any other normative act. ... 4. A judgment of the Constitutional Court on the non-conformity with the Constitution, an international agreement or statute, of a normative act on the basis of which a final and enforceable judicial decision or a final administrative decision ... was given, shall be a basis for re-opening of the proceedings, or for quashing the decision ... in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings.” Article 39 of the Constitutional Court Act reads: “1. The Court shall, at a sitting in camera, discontinue the proceedings: 1) if the pronouncement of a judicial decision would not serve any purpose or is inadmissible; 2) in consequence of the withdrawal of the application, question of law or constitutional complaint; 3) if the normative act has ceased to have effect ... prior to the delivery of a judicial decision by the Tribunal. 2. If these circumstances come to light at the hearing, the Tribunal shall take a decision to discontinue the proceedings. 3. Item 1 (3) of the present Article does not apply if giving a decision on the compatibility with the Constitution of a normative act which has already lost its validity is necessary for the protection of the constitutional freedoms and rights.” Article 4011 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that a party to civil proceedings which have ended with a final judgment on the merits can request that these proceedings be re-opened, if the Constitutional Court has found that the legal provision on the basis of which this judgment was given was incompatible with the Constitution. Such a request can be lodged with the competent court within one month from the date of the judgment of the Constitutional Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
132,001-68938,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,2005,CASE OF A.L. v. GERMANY,3,No violation of Art. 6-2,,"4. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Germany. He used to run a car rental business. 5. On 3 November 1994 the Limburg Prosecuting Office informed him that it had begun criminal investigations against him and three other persons on the suspicion of insurance fraud. They were suspected of having obtained reimbursement for non-existent car rental costs and of having requested payment for non-refundable kilometres. 6. On 4 November 1994, following the Wetzlar District Court's arrest warrant, the applicant was arrested on the suspicion that he would attempt to hinder the investigation proceedings (Verdunklungsgefahr). 7. On 29 November 1994 the District Court suspended the execution of the arrest warrant on the condition that the applicant cease to have contact with his co-suspects and any of the witnesses involved. 8. On 10 February 1997 the applicant and his co-suspects were indicted for fraud. 9. On 10 March 1997 the District Court revoked the arrest warrant. 10. On 12 January 2000 the Limburg Regional Court provisionally discontinued proceedings with the applicant's consent pursuant to Section 153a § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see relevant domestic law below) on the condition that the applicant pay a sum of 3,500 DEM to the Association to Aid Criminal Offenders (Verein für Straffälligenhilfe). 11. On 21 March 2000, after the applicant had fulfilled this condition, the Regional Court, sitting as a chamber of three judges, permanently discontinued proceedings against the applicant but refused to grant him compensation for the time spent in detention on remand, finding that such compensation would not be equitable (entspricht nicht der Billigkeit), in particular as the applicant had waived any right to compensation. 12. The applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that he had never waived his right to compensation and that compensation would be equitable, as the criminal proceedings had caused him to lose his source of income and had prevented him from finishing his law studies. 13. By letter to the applicant's counsel of 18 May 2000, the presiding judge of the competent chamber of the Regional Court confirmed that if the proceedings had been pursued, the Regional Court would have opened proceedings against the applicant with regard to parts of the indictment. The applicant would then have been convicted with predominant probability (“Insoweit war auch mit bei weitem überwiegender Wahrscheinlichkeit mit Verurteilung zu rechnen”). In one of the cases of fraud, this predominant probability was based on the submissions of another accused and of a former suspect. In another case, a conviction for fraud was to be expected following the submission of various car rental receipts (“...war schon im Hinblick auf die Einreichung der diversen Mietwagenrechnungen mit einer Verurteilung wegen Betrugs zu rechnen”). 14. On 22 September 2000 the Frankfurt/Main Court of Appeal rejected the applicant's appeal. It noted that granting compensation for prosecution measures lay within the discretion of the competent courts or prosecuting offices. The relevant Section 3 of the Act on Compensation for Prosecution Measures (Gesetz über die Entschädigung für Strafverfolgungs- massnahmen, see relevant domestic law below) was to be seen as an exception to the rule - according to this provision, compensation should be granted in special cases where the execution of provisional prosecution measures was considered to be grossly disproportionate (“grob unverhältnismässig”). This did not apply to the case against the applicant. 15. The Court of Appeal noted that the measures of prosecution instituted against the applicant were originally based on a strong suspicion (dringender Verdacht). If the proceedings had continued, the Regional Court would have opened proceedings against the applicant regarding a certain part of the indictment. The Court of Appeal found that taking into account a remaining suspicion (“verbleibender Tatverdacht”) when deciding on compensation was not in violation of the right to the presumption of innocence under Article 6 of the Convention, as it did not involve the establishment or allocation of guilt, but only constituted an admissible and necessary evaluation of the situation. Legal consequences of a non-punitive character, such as the refusal of compensation for prosecution measures, may be linked to such a remaining suspicion. This remaining suspicion, which the Regional Court took into account when deciding on compensation, was only relevant with regard to the question of whether to open proceedings and of whether the public interest in further prosecution could be overcome. It was not relevant with regard to the actual question of guilt or the probability of a conviction. 16. On 14 December 2000 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant's complaint against the court decisions and the letter of the Regional Court, finding that the principle of the presumption of innocence did not prevent the establishment and assessment of a remaining suspicion in a decision on the discontinuance of criminal proceedings before a conviction has taken place. It thus also did not prevent courts or prosecuting offices from taking this remaining suspicion into account when deciding on compensation. 17. The presumption of innocence prohibits imposing sanctions with a punitive or de facto punitive effect on an accused whose guilt has not been established in the relevant criminal proceedings. However, in a decision on the discontinuance of proceedings, legal consequences of a non-punitive character may be linked to a remaining suspicion, but it must become sufficiently clear from its reasoning that this does not occur out of the intention to establish or allocate guilt, but out of the intention to describe and assess the state of suspicion (Verdachtslage). This distinction had to be sufficiently expressed in the decision's reasons. In this respect, the context of all the given reasons had to be taken into account. 18. In the light of the above principles, the Federal Constitutional Court found that the impugned decisions were compatible with the German Basic Law. It noted that the Court of Appeal had refused to grant the applicant compensation under Section 3 of the Act on Compensation for Prosecution Measures on the ground that if the proceedings against the applicant had been pursued, the Regional Court would have opened court proceedings against the applicant based on parts of the indictment. This evaluation of the remaining suspicion with regard to the question of the opening of proceedings and overcoming the public interest in pursuing prosecution measures neither contained a declaration on the probability of the applicant's conviction, nor did it contain a criminal allocation of guilt. 19. According to Section 153a of the Code of Criminal Procedure, criminal proceedings involving a less serious criminal offence (Vergehen) may be discontinued subject to certain conditions and instructions (Auflagen und Weisungen). 20. If the proceedings are still in the investigation phase, the Public Prosecutor's Office may, with the consent of the competent court and the accused, provisionally refrain from issuing an indictment relating to an offence and may at the same time order the accused (1) to take measures providing reparation, (2) to pay a sum of money to a charitable association or the Treasury, (3) to take other measures or (4) to make maintenance payments of a particular amount, if such conditions and instructions can remove the public interest in prosecution and if this is not in conflict with the seriousness of the crime (“...wenn diese geeignet sind, das öffentliche Interesse an der Strafverfolgung zu beseitigen, und die Schwere der Schuld nicht entgegensteht”) (Section 153a § 1). 21. If the accused has already been indicted, the court may, with the consent of both the public prosecutor's office and the accused, discontinue the proceedings and impose the same conditions and instructions (Section 153a § 2). 22. Compensation for various prosecution measures is covered by the Act on Compensation for Prosecution Measures (Gesetz über die Entschädigung für Strafverfolgungsmassnahmen). 23. In cases where an accused is acquitted or where the proceedings against him are discontinued or where a court refuses to open the proceedings against him, he is entitled to compensation for damages suffered due to time spent in detention on remand or due to other prosecution measures (Section 2). 24. If the discontinuation of the proceedings is subject to the discretion of the prosecutor' 25. According to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court, cases where the proceedings have been discontinued according to Section 153a of the Code of Criminal Procedure also fall under the scope of the above regulations.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-2'],[],0
133,001-57511,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,1980,CASE OF KÖNIG v. GERMANY (ARTICLE 50),2,Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,,"8. The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, the Court will confine itself here to giving some brief particulars; for the remaining details, reference should be made to paragraphs 15 to 81 of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978 (ibid., pp. 7-27). 9. That judgment concerned the length of actions brought by Dr. König before the Frankfurt Administrative Court in 1967 and in 1971 to challenge, respectively, the withdrawal of the permit to run his clinic and the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise medicine. In the second matter, the Administrative Court had dismissed the applicant’s action by a judgment delivered on 9 June 1976 which had been affirmed by the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal on 2 May 1978. Dr. König lodged an appeal (Nichtzulässigkeitsbeschwerde) and an application to quash (Revision) but these were rejected by the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht), in two final decisions, on 10 September and 18 October 1979. In the case concerning the clinic, the Frankfurt Administrative Court had dismissed Dr. König’s action on 22 June 1977. An appeal by him against that decision is still pending before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal which, with the agreement of the parties, stayed the proceedings on 21 February 1979 pending the outcome of the above-mentioned proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court. 10. After delivery of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978, the Government and the applicant attempted, with the Commission’s assistance, to arrive at a friendly settlement of the latter’s claims, details whereof had been given by Mr. Hofferbert in his letter of 18 September 1978 (see paragraph 3 above). The attempt met with failure in November 1978: Dr. König found that the Government’s offer of DM 20,000 in full and final settlement was not sufficient. 11. The applicant seeks pecuniary compensation for the two heads of damage allegedly caused to him by the violation of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1): he maintains that his financial and professional situation may have been permanently ruined and, secondly, that his personal and professional reputation had been indirectly lowered. Without quantifying his claims, he furnishes certain particulars – regarding notably the average annual income he could have anticipated as a medical practitioner and as the head of a clinic - on the basis of which he considers it possible to gauge the extent of his aggregate loss and to assess the fraction thereof attributable to the fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded. In addition, the applicant asks for reimbursement of the expenses he incurred both in Germany, in order to expedite the hearing of his actions, and before the Convention institutions. Dr. König leaves the assessment of the sum to be awarded to him to the Court’s discretion, thereby confirming the position he had adopted in 1977 (Series A no. 27, p. 41, par. 113). 12. In their observations of 6 October 1978 (see paragraph 3 above), the Commission’s Delegates stated that they did not wish to comment on the first of the applicant’s claims which they saw as being concerned with the consequences of the two withdrawals of authorisation; at the hearing, they submitted that in their opinion the attribution of specific material losses to the breach found by the Court was impossible, at least on the strength of the evidence before it. On the other hand, the Delegates suggest that account should be taken of the fact that the applicant was left in a prolonged state of uncertainty as to his professional future, and this at a time of life - between the ages of forty-nine (in 1967) and sixty (in 1978) - when a man is normally at the peak of his career. They also consider that the breach of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), taken by itself, may be another factor having a bearing on an award of just satisfaction. As far as concerns the costs of the proceedings, the expenditure incurred by Dr. König in order to expedite the domestic litigation and to present his case in Strasbourg is regarded by the Delegates as a relevant item. They express no firm view as to whether the same applies to the expenditure arising from his applications to the German courts for restoration of the suspensive effect of his appeal against the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise; in their opinion, those applications were aimed not at speeding up the proceedings but at limiting the consequences of their excessive length. Neither do the Delegates comment on the justification for the figures given by the applicant. 13. The Government’s position is as follows: there is no causal link between the breach found by the Court and the alleged damage to Dr. König’s professional career; on the other hand, ""reasonable"", ""necessary"" and proven costs resulting from the exercise of the domestic legal remedies can give rise to compensation to the extent that those remedies were aimed at accelerating the procedure; furthermore, the ""reasonable costs"" incurred in connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions should be reimbursed; finally, it is for the Court to determine whether the applicant should be awarded monetary compensation for the ""non-material"" injury he suffered by reason of the mere fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
134,001-67675,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,AMEGNIGAN v. THE NETHERLANDS,2,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr Kossi Archil Amegnigan, is a Togolese national, who was born in 1980 and lives in Klazienaveen. He is represented before the Court by Mr R. Bosma, a lawyer practising in Assen. On 18 September 2000, the applicant applied for asylum in the Netherlands under a false identity. This asylum request was rejected by decision of 19 December 2001. The applicant's subsequent appeal was dismissed on 17 June 2003 by the Regional Court (arrondissementsrechtbank) of The Hague. On 14 March 2001, the applicant filed a second request for asylum in the Netherlands, this time under this true identity. He stated that he was single, that he had no relatives living in the Netherlands and that his father had died. His family in Togo consisted of his maternal grandfather, his mother and one brother who was born in 1985. He had no other relatives. He claimed that he had been arrested in Togo on 5 November 2000 after a passenger in his taxi had been found to carry weapon parts, that he had been taken into detention, had been ill-treated during his detention and had managed to escape with the aid of a guard. He further claimed that had left Togo by boat on 22 February 2001 and that he had arrived in the Netherlands on 11 March 2001. On an unspecified date, a medical examination of the applicant disclosed that he might be infected with HIV and he was referred to the Groningen Academic Hospital in May 2001 for further medical examinations. In a letter of 4 July 2001, a specialist in internal diseases of this hospital confirmed this diagnosis and stated that the applicant found himself in the A3 clinical category of the disease, i.e. the asymptomatic stage of the disease with a CD4+ count of less than 200 cells/µL. The specialist concluded that, given the low CD4+ count, antiretroviral treatment was indicated. The applicant was in fact provided with such treatment. On 19 December 2001, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatsecretairs van Justitie) rejected the applicant's asylum request, finding that the applicant's asylum account lacked credibility. In so far as the applicant relied on his health problems, the Deputy Minister considered that the applicant could apply for a residence permit on medical grounds. On 14 January 2002, the applicant filed an appeal with the Regional Court of The Hague. In a letter of 24 March 2003, a specialist in internal diseases of the Groningen Academic Hospital informed the applicant's lawyer that, if the applicant were to cease taking anti-HIV medication, his prospects would become very unfavourable within a short delay. The specialist further wrote that it was not to be expected that, in Togo, medication was obtainable that the applicant needed to suppress the HIV-infection and to improve his immune system. On 17 June 2003, following a hearing held on 25 March 2003, the Regional Court of The Hague rejected the applicant's appeal of 14 January 2002. It accepted the finding of the Deputy Minister that no credence could be attached to the applicant's asylum account. In so far as the applicant relied on his health problems, the Regional Court decided not to take into account the information set out in the letter of 24 March 2003 as this information had only been submitted one day before the hearing held on 25 March 2003. It found that taking this information into consideration would be contrary to the principles of due process. It further held that it had not been established that there was a causal link between the applicant's illness and his departure from Togo and that it had not appeared that there were such compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature being connected to the applicant's reasons for leaving Togo that it should be held that, in all reasonability, it could not be expected from the applicant to return to his country of origin. No further appeal lay against this decision. On 16 October 2003, the applicant filed a third request for asylum on the basis of newly emerged facts or altered circumstances (nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden). When, on the same date, he was interviewed by the immigration authorities on this request, the applicant stated inter alia that he was cohabiting with another asylum seeker from Togo since 2002 and that two children had been born out of this relationship in March 2002 and July 2003, respectively. He further stated that his family in Togo consisted of his mother and a younger brother. This third request was rejected on 19 October 2003 by the Minister for Immigration and Integration (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie), who had succeeded the Deputy Minister of Justice under the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet) which, on 1 April 2001, had replaced the Aliens Act 1965. As to the applicant's argument that, given his HIVinfection, his expulsion to Togo would be in violation of his rights under Article 3 of the Convention; the Minister recalled that, according to the constant case-law, such a situation would only arise if the alien concerned found himself in an advanced and directly life-threatening stage of an incurable disease. The Minister found that there were insufficient indications in the applicant's submissions for holding that there was such a situation in his case and, on this basis, concluded that – irrespective of the possibilities of treatment in Togo and the presence a social support network there – the applicant's case did not raise an issue under Article 3 of the Convention. Moreover, as already indicated in the decision of 19 December 2001, the applicant could apply for a temporary residence permit on medical grounds. The Minister further found no indication in the applicant's case for concluding that, owing to traumatic experiences linked to the reasons for leaving the country of origin, it could not in all reasonability be expected from the applicant to return to Togo thus rendering him eligible for a residence permit on grounds of compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature. On this point, the Minister considered that the health problems relied on by the applicant were not linked to his reasons for leaving Togo. The applicant was ordered to leave the Netherlands within 24 hours. On 25 October 2003, the Minister informed the Central Agency for the Reception of Asylum Seekers (Central Orgaan opvang Asielzoekers; “COA”), since the applicant's asylum request had been rejected on 19 October 2003, the applicant's entitlement to State-sponsored reception and care facilities for asylum seekers (“opvang”) had ceased. However, the Minister was of the opinion that the applicant's expulsion should be stayed under Article 64 of the Aliens Act 2000 as, according to medical advice obtained, the applicant was unfit to travel. The Minister therefore advised the COA to prolong the provision of reception and care facilities to the applicant until 8 January 2004. On the same day, the Minister informed the applicant that the COA had been advised to prolong until 8 January 2004 the provision of facilities. The Minister further indicated that an advice of the Medical Advice Bureau (Bureau Medische Advisering) would be sought on a possible prolongation of this period. On 3 November 2003, the applicant's treating specialist doctor of the Groningen Academic Hospital informed the applicant's lawyer that, two years after having started treatment in August 2001, the applicant's condition was stable but that his immune system had apparently been so weakened when he had started treatment that it had still not been properly restored. The doctor further stated that by the suppression of the AIDS virus there was no direct danger, but that as soon as the anti-HIV therapy would be stopped, the applicant would fall back to the advanced stage of the disease which, given its incurable nature, would entail a direct threat for life. The applicant's appeal against this Minister's decision of 19 October 2003 was dismissed by the Regional Court of The Hague on 13 November 2003. By letter of 4 March 2004, the Minister for Immigration and Integration informed the applicant's lawyer that, before a decision could be taken on the question whether the applicant's expulsion should be stayed further on medical grounds, it was necessary to obtain medical information from the doctors treating the applicant for which the latter's written consent was required. The applicant's lawyer was requested to return the appended consent form within two weeks. On 25 March 2004, the Minister informed the applicant that, pending the issuance of an advisory opinion of the Medical Advice Bureau about his situation and on the basis of Article 64 of the Aliens Act 2000, his expulsion would be stayed until 8 July 2004. The applicant's appeal to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State against the ruling given on 13 November 2003 by the Regional Court of The Hague was rejected on 5 April 2004. Although the Administrative Jurisdiction Division accepted that the letter of 24 March 2003 of the Groningen Academic Hospital constituted a relevant new fact, it found that this could not lead to quashing the impugned decision taken by the Minister on 19 October 2003. It considered that it could not be concluded from the contents of this letter that the applicant's illness had attained such an advanced and direct lifethreatening stage that it should be held that the expulsion of the applicant to Togo or any other country would be in violation of Article 3 of the Convention. It further took into consideration that – according to an additional medical statement of 3 November 2003 that had been submitted to the Regional Court – the HIV-virus would be suppressed as long the applicant would continue taking medication, so that there was no direct threat for life. It therefore accepted that there were no grounds on the basis of which the Minister should reconsider the decision of 19 December 2001. Under Article 15 § 1 of the Aliens Act 1965 (Vreemdelingenwet, hereinafter “the Act”), which was in force until 1 April 2001, aliens coming from a country where they have a well-founded reason to fear persecution on account of their religious or political convictions, or of belonging to a particular race or a particular social group, could be admitted as refugees. The expression “refugee” in this provision was construed to have the same meaning as in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention (decision of the Judicial Division (Afdeling Rechtspraak) of Council of State of 16 October 1980, Rechtspraak Vreemdelingenrecht [Immigration Law Reports] 1981, no. 1). On 1 April 2001, the Aliens Act 2000 entered into force. On the basis of Article 29 of the new Aliens Act, an alien may be eligible for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum if, inter alia, – he or she is a refugee within the meaning of the Geneva Convention, or – he or she has established well-founded reasons to assume that he/she will run a real risk of being subjected to torture or other cruel or degrading treatment or punishment if expelled to the country of origin. Article 4:6 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht) provides that an applicant must adduce newly emerged facts or altered circumstances (nieuw gebleken feiten of veranderde omstandigheden) if a new request is filed following a decision in which the original request is, either totally or partially, rejected. When no such facts or altered circumstances have been adduced, the administrative authority may reject the new request with reference to the decision on the original request. Article 4:6 thus embodies the res iudicata principle for the administrative law. Nevertheless, an exception has been made in this particular area of the law, in that an alien may adduce exceptional facts and circumstances relating to him or her personally, on the basis of which the new request may be assessed outside the framework of Article 4:6. In the case of a repeat asylum application which also invokes the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, an assessment by the court outside the framework of Article 4:6 is therefore possible. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State has on one occasion quashed the dismissal of a repeat application for a residence permit for the purposes of asylum despite the absence of new facts or altered circumstances (judgment of 24 April 2003, no. 220300506/1, Nieuwsbrief Asiel- en Vluchtelingenrecht [Newsletter on Asylum and Refugeelaw] 2003/160). It did so on the basis of the exceptional circumstance that there was no dispute between the parties, that on his return to his country of origin, the alien would run a real risk of being subjected to treatment or punishment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention. During the initial asylum procedure, an alien is in principle entitled to reception and other facilities including health care, provided by the State. Pursuant to Article 10 of the Aliens Act 2000, an alien whose stay in the Netherlands is not lawful is not entitled to such facilities. This provision applies to asylum seekers whose applications have been unsuccessful. Also, a second or further application for asylum does not confer a new entitlement to facilities. An exception to that basic principle can nevertheless be made if, inter alia, the asylum seeker finds him or herself in extremely compelling humanitarian circumstances (zeer schrijnende humanitaire omstandigheden, Chapter C5/20.4 of the Aliens Circular 2000). The COA decides whether or not facilities will be provided. Appeal lies against a decision to refuse facilities, but also against a failure to decide (or to decide within a reasonable time) on a request for facilities. The lodging of an appeal does not suspend the denial of facilities, but a provisional measure may be requested to the effect that such facilities are made available pending the appeal proceedings. According to Article 63 of the Aliens Act 2000, the Minister can order the expulsion of an alien illegally staying in the Netherlands and who has not voluntarily left the Netherlands within the time-limit fixed for this purpose. However, pursuant to Article 64 of the Aliens Act 2000, no expulsion will take place when, in view of the health condition of the alien, travelling is contra-indicated. In a report dated September 2000 of the German Federal Office for Refugees (Bundesamt für die Anerkennung ausländischer Flüchtlinge) on HIV and AIDS in Togo, it is stated that – according to information set out in the UNAIDS/WHO Epidemiological Fact Sheet 2000 on TOGO – it was assumed that 5.98% of the adult population in Togo was HIV-positive whereas less than 5% of the total population in Togo is insured against sickness. As regards the local possibilities of treatment, the report states that – although treatment is possible in various hospitals in the capital of Togo as well as in all regional hospitals – many patients cannot afford treatment. According to a report issued on 20 August 2002 by the Swiss Federal Office for Refugees (Office federal des réfugiés), treatment is available in Togo, both in various hospitals in its capital Lomé and in four regional hospitals. It further states that, as less than 5% of the total population in Togo has a health insurance, the costs of treatment are generally borne privately and that, as the average monthly income in Togo lies between 38 and 76 euros, a person infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS who does not have health insurance will hardly be able to afford treatment if relatives are unable to provide financial support, despite the fact that negotiations between the Togolese authorities and the pharmaceutical industry have resulted in a considerable reduction of the prices of certain medications for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
135,001-99334,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2010,ERCANLAR OTOMOTİV Tİc. A.Ş.  v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria,"The applicant, Ercanlar Otomotiv Tic. A.Ş., is a joint stock company registered in Turkey and located in Istanbul. It was represented before the Court by Mr S.N. Gürel, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 17 November 1982 a public company, the Türkiye Süt Endüstrisi Kurumu (the State dairy producer, hereafter referred to as the “SEK”), decided to partially expropriate a plot of land (parcel no. 80) owned by the applicant company and located in Mersinli, İzmir. On 25 February 1983 the applicant company was officially notified of the SEK's expropriation decision by a notice served through the notary public. It was indicated in the notice that expropriation compensation in the amount of 2,803,700 Turkish liras (TRL) had been deposited in the applicant company's name in a blocked bank account at the Alsancak Branch of Ziraat Bankası, a State-run bank. The applicant subsequently sought the annulment of the expropriation. On 21 December 1983 the İzmir Administrative Court rejected the applicant's request and on 18 December 1984 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the administrative court's decision. On an unspecified date the applicant company commenced proceedings for additional compensation. On 4 November 1986 the İzmir Civil Court ordered that the amount of compensation be increased by TRL 7,848,800. The judgment became final on 17 February 1987, neither of the parties having appealed. On 25 November 1987 the additional expropriation was deposited in the same account at Ziraat Bankası in the applicant company's name. The applicant company subsequently lodged an action with the İzmir Administrative Court for the annulment of the parcel plan pertaining to the expropriated plot of land. On 27 April 1988 the İzmir Administrative Court annulled the parcel plan as requested. On 29 May 1989 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the administrative court. A new parcel plan was prepared on 24 September 1998, which was also annulled by the İzmir Administrative Court on 18 October 2002. It appears that there is presently no parcel plan in respect of the land in question. On 3 December 1987 the SEK commenced proceedings before the İzmir Civil Court for the compulsory registration of the title of the expropriated land in its name. Following proceedings which lasted for ten years and involved six examinations, on 1 April 1997 the Court of Cassation granted the suit. On 2 July 1997 it rejected the applicant company's rectification request. The Court of Cassation held that the pending parcel plan pertaining to the relevant land did not preclude the registration of its title in the expropriating company's name. In the meantime, on 6 March 1992 the applicant company lodged an action for recovery of the expropriated land in accordance with Article 23 of the now defunct Expropriation Law (Law No. 6830). They argued that the public interest justifying expropriation in the present case had been lost as the land had not been put to use in accordance with the initial purpose of the measure. On 30 October 1996 İzmir Civil Court dismissed the applicant's request, holding that the conditions for restitution of expropriated land under Article 23 of the said Law had not materialised. On 4 April 1997 the Court of Cassation upheld this judgment and on 4 June 1997 it rejected the applicant company's rectification request. On 11 November 1997 the SEK was merged with another public company, thereby losing its legal personality. Upon this merger, on 11 February 1998 the applicant company applied for the reopening of the proceedings concerning the recovery and the compulsory registration of the land. They argued that the land was no longer required for public purposes as the expropriating public company had ceased to exist. On 21 December 1999 the İzmir Civil Court rejected the applicant's request by two separate judgments (cases nos. 1996/529 E. and 1996/530 E.), holding that the conditions for reopening the proceedings had not been satisfied. According to the information in the case file, both judgments became final on 19 October 2000. On 7 June 2000 the applicant company sent a letter to Ziraat Bankası to inquire whether the expropriation compensation, together with the additional amount, had been deposited with the bank and, in the affirmative, whether they were entitled to have access to the money. On 26 July 2000 they sent another letter to the bank, requesting it to expedite the reply. It is alleged that the bank never sent a written reply but orally informed the applicant company that they had no records regarding the requested information. The applicant company accordingly brought an action seeking a declaratory judgment (tespit davası) on 15 April 2002 before the İzmir Civil Court to establish whether the expropriation compensation had been deposited in a blocked account at Ziraat Bankası in its name or whether any payment had been otherwise made to it in compensation for the expropriation. The bank verified during the proceedings that the expropriation compensation had been deposited in a blocked account in the applicant company's name at their Alsancak Branch, but no attempt had been made to collect it. On 19 September 2002 the firstinstance court dismissed the applicant company's case, as the statements received from the bank had made it unnecessary to render a declaratory judgment. On 8 April 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court and on 27 June 2003 it rejected the rectification request.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
136,001-22719,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,ANDREWS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Thomas Charles Andrews, is a British national, who was born in 1936 and lives in London, England. He is represented before the Court by Mr Geoffrey Goldkorn, a lawyer practising in London with Goldkorn & Mathias, Solicitors. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent, Ms R. Mandal, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 17 March 1994 H.M. Customs & Excise (“C&E”) arrested the applicant and his son D, searched the applicant’s home and seized GBP 42,305. The applicant was charged with an offence of so conducting himself that his conduct must have involved the commission of one or more VAT offences in connection with the affairs of J&A Transport Ltd, a company of which he was director and secretary. D was also charged with similar offences in relation to the same company as well as two other companies, Avonmarsh Ltd and A.J. Kingsland & Sons Ltd. As to J&A Transport Ltd, the applicant was registered as the owner of one of the two issued shares, his daughter-in-law (D’s wife) being the registered owner of the remaining share. According to the Government, the applicant represented the company in all dealings with C&E in regard to VAT-related matters. J&A Transport Ltd took over the business of Avonmarsh Ltd. D was declared bankrupt in September 1991. On 27 May 1994 the applicant and D were further charged with, inter alia, failure to operate the PAYE (Pay as You Earn) tax system correctly. On 7 July 1994 on the ex parte application of C&E under sections 77 and 78 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (“the CJA”), Mr Justice Schiemann in the Queen’s Bench Division made an order against the applicant (“the Restraint Order”) under the CJA. The general effect of the Restraint Order was to prevent the applicant from disposing of his assets as identified in the Order. Furthermore, the applicant’s home was made subject to a charge in order to secure payment to the Crown of an amount equal to the value of the property. By a further order under the CJA, Mr Justice Schiemann appointed a Receiver and manager of the applicant’s realisable property. Under this order, the Receiver was given power to pay all fees, commission and other costs from the proceeds of sale or realisation of the assets subject to the order, and was allowed remuneration in an amount to be agreed by C&E or, in default of agreement, to be determined by the court. The property listed in the schedule to the receivership order included not only the sum of GBP 42,305 seized from the applicant’s home, but also the bank accounts of the applicant and of J&A Transport Ltd and vehicles used by the latter company. Similar orders were also made on the same day by Mr Justice Schiemann against D. To comply with the Restraint Order, the applicant swore an affidavit on 20 July 1994 in which he identified his assets. He stated inter alia that his assets included a 50% share in J&A Transport Ltd, and that he had therefore “an interest in all the assets and liabilities of J&A Transport Ltd ....” He further specified that he had an interest in the money in a bank account of J&A Transport Ltd, and that he was owed dividends of GBP 36,000 by the company. The applicant also stated in the affidavit that some of the money seized from his home (GBP 42,305) was partly his and partly his wife’s or belonged to other members of his family. C&E were authorised to pay over to the Receiver the sum of GBP 42,305 which it had seized from the applicant’s home. Pursuant to the terms of the Restraint Order, the Receiver took possession of this amount. C&E were not required to give any cross-undertaking in damages in respect of any of the orders obtained from Mr Justice Schiemann. The Restraint Order was varied by consent on 3 August 1994, 20 September 1994, 13 October 1994 and 10 April 1995 to enable sums to be paid to the applicant’s former solicitors for legal costs in connection with his defence in the pending criminal proceedings. In all, sums totalling GBP 32,924 were released by the Receiver to the applicant’s solicitors for these purposes, leaving a balance of GBP 10,011 in the Receiver’s hands. Prior to the applicant’s trial, the Receiver used this balance in payment of her costs and remuneration. The majority of the costs were attributable to the monitoring of J&A Transport Ltd including its bank accounts “and to discussing various vehicle sales and purchases with the applicant in order to maintain the quality of the fleet.” D maintained at his trial that the applicant had played no active role within J&A Transport Ltd and that he had asked the applicant to be the director and secretary of the company because of his [D’s] impending bankruptcy. He stated that the applicant only signed documents as director of the company on his request, including blank cheques. On 11 December 1995 D was convicted of cheating the public revenue by failing to declare the Income Tax and National Insurance contributions on the full value of wage payments made to the employees of J&A Transport Ltd. On 12 December 1995 D was convicted of the fraudulent evasion of VAT with respect to the affairs of J&A Transport Ltd. On 11 December 1995 the applicant was acquitted of all charges against him. The applicant was awarded his costs from central funds. However, these did not include the costs incurred by, or the remuneration of, the Receiver. According to the applicant, the trial judge found that D was the beneficial owner of J&A Transport Ltd and that the applicant had no interest in its assets. Furthermore, it was at no time asserted by the prosecution during the trial that the GBP 42,305 or any part of it belonged to D. In separate proceedings a confiscation and compensation order was made against D under the CJA. On 9 January 1996 the applicant applied to the High Court for the discharge of the orders against him. In an affidavit sworn on 8 January 1996 the applicant indicated that he wished the receivership to be discharged in order to enable J&A to continue trading. On 19 January 1996 the Restraint and Receivership Orders were discharged by order of Mr Justice Keene with liberty to the applicant to apply for his costs. The applicant’s home was released from the charging order and the applicant and his daughter-in-law were permitted to deal in property relating to J&A Transport Ltd to enable it to continue trading. The conduct of the business of the company remained under the supervision of the Receiver. The remaining GBP 10,011 was not returned to the applicant after the discharge of the Restraint Order. By letter to the Receiver dated 18 February 1997 the applicant’s solicitors sought repayment of the balance of the GBP 42,305 after deduction of the amounts already released to cover his legal costs. However, by letter dated 3 March 1997 the Receiver stated that no funds remained to be returned because all balances had been used to defray the “prior costs of the receivership”. From the Receiver’s affidavit sworn on 1 August 1996, it appears that the Receiver utilised the balance of the applicant’s funds prior to his acquittal, largely for the purpose of monitoring the business of J&A Transport Ltd (see above). On 19 January 1996 (the date of discharge of the Restraint Order) the Receiver held a balance of GBP 11,428.32 arising from the sale of certain of J&A Transport Ltd’s vehicles, which funds “were utilised to settle costs arising subsequent to the applicant’s acquittal.” On 5 June 1997 the applicant applied for an order that C&E pay his costs arising out of the civil proceedings in which the Restraint Order had been made including the Receiver’s costs, expenses and remuneration. On 3 October 1997 the applicant’s application was heard by Mr Justice Owen. It was made clear that the application was limited to seeking an order for payment of the balance of GBP 10,011. Mr Justice Owen dismissed the applicant’s application and refused leave to appeal. In relation to the applicant’s claim to be repaid the sum of GBP 10,011, Mr Justice Owen stated: “Now the applicant says, “it is unfair that I should not have that money.” One can well see his point of view. The result is unfair. However, we live in a society where sometimes unfairness will and must occur. It was necessary to appoint the Receiver to act as was the case. There was no way at the time to separate the GBP 42,305 from the other assets.” Mr Justice Owen further observed : “In my judgment, it would not be at all proper to order [C&E] to repay the £10,000 as to which, as I have already explained, the applicant may feel that he has been hard done by. The social explanation for that is, as a result of his son’s criminal behaviour, the order had to be made and if he has lost this money, as he has, then he should put it down to his son’s criminal behaviour. There was nothing improper in the action of the [C&E], or in the order which was made by the court.” Mr Justice Owen further considered that negligence could not be imputed to the Receiver such as to bring section 88 of the CJA into play; nor were the C&E guilty of any serious default in its investigation or prosecution of the offences at issue which could have allowed the applicant to invoke the compensation provisions of section 89 of the CJA. On 23 April 1998 leave to appeal against the decision of Mr Justice Owen was granted by Lord Justices Auld and Buxton. Leave was restricted to the question of whether the applicant could recover the sum of GBP 10,011 by way of an order that C&E pay his costs of the civil proceedings including the Receiver’s costs, expenses and remuneration. On 13 January 1999 the applicant’s appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal (Lord Justices Hirst, Aldous and Ward). Lord Justice Ward summarised the issue before the court as follows: “... if a receiver is appointed under the [Criminal Justice Act 1988] to receive and manage a defendant’s property and incurs costs and expenses in so doing, who bears that cost and expenses if the defendant is subsequently acquitted by the Crown Court and awarded his costs of defence out of public funds?” Lord Justice Ward summarised the law relating to the payment of receivers’ costs as follows: “The ordinary rule is that receivers should not accept their appointment unless satisfied that the receivable assets will be sufficient to meet their claim for costs and for remuneration or that they would be otherwise indemnified, by contract or by order of the court, by the party responsible for their appointment. In this case there was an agreement between the receiver and [C&E] that [C&E] would indemnify the receiver if she were unable to bring in sufficient assets to meet her costs. That did no more than replicate the statutory position ...” The Court of Appeal considered that the remuneration of the Receiver was not costs incidental to the receivership proceedings. In the court’s opinion the charges incurred by the Receiver in supervising the running of the company during the relevant period were expenses of the receivership and were not therefore recoverable by the applicant even if he had ultimately been successful in the receivership proceedings. Lord Justice Ward, although sympathetic to the applicant’s situation, stated: “The true position, as it now appears to me, is that the investigation of whether or not the defendant has suffered loss by reason of the receivership is an investigation which should be and ordinarily would be conducted in deciding whether or not damages should be awarded against the plaintiff for the breach of the usual undertakings as to damages a plaintiff would normally be required to give. Such an investigation would enable justice to be done. Here no undertaking was given and none ordinarily is.” Lord Justice Ward then observed that section 89 of the CJA only provided the applicant with the possibility to obtain compensation from the C&E on proof that the latter authority had been guilty of serious default in the investigation and prosecution of the offences with which the applicant was charged. In the words of Lord Justice Ward, section 89 “simply does not provide an adequate remedy.” With reluctance he concluded that: “... even if the expenses of the receivership are within the definition of costs, they are not costs of and incidental to the proceedings.” Lord Justice Aldous observed that: “... on the facts ... the [applicant] may seem to have been treated unfairly by the conclusion that I have reached, as his GBP 10,000 was used up as an expense of the receivership and therefore cannot be recovered. That in my view is the result of the type of proceedings and the conditions for recovery laid down in the Act. Parliament in section 88 of the Act specifically limited the right to recover from a receiver to cases where negligence is established. It is accepted for the purposes of these proceedings that there was no negligence. I would add that in my judgment [counsel for C&E] was right in his submission that this really was a claim for compensation dressed up as an application for an award of costs, and it is therefore most significant that by section 89 Parliament laid down a carefully regulated code for such a claim. Consequently, in my judgment, section 89 is the proper avenue for a compensation claim of this kind, provided of course the claimant can bring himself within the rather strict requirements of that section.” In its judgment on 25 February 1999, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. It refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. The applicant did not petition for leave to appeal to the House of Lords, having being advised by counsel that this course of action offered no prospects of success. (1) The High Court may by order (referred to in this Part of this Act as a “restraint order”) prohibit any person from dealing with any realisable property, subject to such conditions and exceptions as may be specified in the order.

(...)” “(1) The High Court may make a charging order on realisable property for securing the payment to the Crown– (a) where a confiscation order has not been made, of an amount equal to the value from time to time of the property charged; and (b) in any other case, of an amount not exceeding the amount payable under the confiscation order. (2) For the purposes of this Part of this Act, a charging order is an order made under this section imposing on any such realisable property as may be specified in the order a charge for securing the payment of money to the Crown. (3) A charging order– (a) may be made only on an application by the prosecutor; (b) may be made on an ex parte application to a judge in chambers; (c) shall provide for notice to be given to persons affected by the order; and (d) may be made subject to such conditions as the court thinks fit and, without prejudice to the generality of this paragraph, such conditions as it thinks fit as to the time when the charge is to become effective.

137,001-24040,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,PODOLSKAYA v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mrs Valentina Vsevolodovna Podolskaya, is a Russian national, who was born in 1932 and lives in Orenburg. The respondent Government are represented by Mr P. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 16 June 2000 the applicant’s husband, Mr Podolskiy, was presented a book Doctors of the 20th Century (“Доктора ХХ века”) published by the Orenburg health protection department. On reading the book Mr Podolskiy found that his name had been omitted from a chronological list of directors of the Orenburg health protection department, although he had worked in that position from 1966 to 1981. Also, in another place there was a mistake in his initials. Finally, the book contained a photograph of Mr Podolskiy with an unknown woman; the caption of the photograph indicated that the persons on the photograph were “Mr Podolskiy with his spouse”. On 7 August 2000 Mr Podolskiy lodged a civil action against the authors and publishers of the book for the protection of his honour, dignity and professional reputation and compensation for non-pecuniary damage. He also sought an injunction to stop dissemination of the book, recall all printed copies and make necessary corrections. Mr Podolskiy submitted that the omissions in the publication damaged his professional reputation and also “upset the peace” of his family life. He explained that he had been married to his spouse for more than fifty years and they both adhered to “traditional moral values” that included disapproval of divorce and re-marriages. He also stated that because of the publication he had to seek medical assistance in June and July 2000. On 15 May 2001 the Leninskiy District Court of Orenburg gave its judgment. The court found that a mistake in Mr Podolskiy’s initials was a typographical error. It established that Mr Podolskiy’s name had been wrongly omitted from the chronological list and the caption of the picture was indeed incorrect. Nevertheless, the court concluded: “However, the court does not consider that [this information] is damaging, i.e. [that it] contains indications that the plaintiff has committed an offence under existing laws or has transgressed moral principles... Re-marriages are not prohibited by law, not condemned in society and can be entered into because of various reasons.” The court dismissed Mr Podolskiy’s action in full. On 24 May 2001 Mr Podolskiy’s lawyer appealed against the judgment. He argued, in particular, that the damage caused to the plaintiff’s goodwill had to be assessed with regard to the plaintiff’s individual subjective values, such as the conviction that remarriages were unacceptable. On 4 July 2001 Mr Podolskiy died of a heart attack. On the applicant’s request, she was recognised as Mr Podolskiy’s legal successor in the civil proceedings. The court agreed that the applicant also had her own interest in pursuing the claim. On 30 August 2001 the Orenburg Regional Court upheld the judgment of 15 May 2001. The court confirmed that the information in the book was incorrect; however, it did not consider that such information was damaging to Mr Podolskiy’s or the applicant’s dignity, honour or reputation. Article 151 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation of 30 November 1994 provides that a court may award compensation for non-pecuniary damage to an individual who sustained such damage as a result of acts that violated his personal non-pecuniary rights. Article 152 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides that an individual may seize a court with a request for retraction of information damaging his or her honour, dignity or professional reputation unless the person who distributed such information proves its accuracy. In addition to retraction, the individual may also claim compensation for losses and non-pecuniary damage sustained as a result of distribution of such information.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
138,001-5130,ENG,CYP,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,NICHOLAS v. CYPRUS,3,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is a British national, born in 1951 and living in London. He is represented before the Court by Mr N.S. Ahluwalia, a lawyer practising in London. A. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. I. Recourse No. 633/95 before the Supreme Court On 12 July 1995 the applicant applied to the Supreme Court of Cyprus for a declaration that Cyprus Airways and the Government, the major shareholder of that company, had breached the Constitution in refusing to employ him and employing others instead (recourse No. 633/95). On 10 April 1997 the applicant asked the Chief Registrar of the Supreme Court whether legal aid was available for actions alleging infringement of constitutional rights, such as recourse No. 633/95. On the same date the Chief Registrar informed the applicant that “legal aid is not available for civil cases”. The applicant represented himself in the proceedings. On 19 September 1997 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s recourse as inadmissible. The court found that Cyprus Airways was in every respect a private company. As a result, its decisions did not fall within the ambit of Article 146 of the Constitution. The refusal to employ the applicant was, therefore, wrongly challenged by means of a recourse to the Supreme Court. II. Case No. 5807/95 before the Nicosia District Court In 1993 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Supreme Court seeking the annulment of the Ministry of Labour's decision to issue work permits to six foreign pilots employed by EuroCypria Airlines, a subsidiary of Cyprus Airways (case No. 701/93). On 19 April 1995 the Supreme Court found in favour of the applicant. Relying on the above decision, the applicant instituted proceedings before the Nicosia District Court for damages against the Government (case No. 5807/95). He was represented by counsel who acted on a “no fee” basis. On 26 June 1998 the court rejected the action. The applicant’s counsel lodged an appeal. The proceedings are still pending. III. Case No. 1676/94 before the Larnaca District Court On 29 August 1993 the newspaper Alithia published a letter by EuroCypria Airlines worded as follows: “With reference to your article in connection with Charalambos Nicholas, we confirm once again that our intention is to ‘Cypriotise’ [give priority to Cypriot employees] as soon as possible. Within the bounds of safety and operations of the company, for us to achieve this aim, the recruitment of suitable, qualified pilots is an absolute necessity. … We have offered employment without exception to each and every qualified suitable Cypriot pilot who has applied and today we employ eight such pilots … . The recruitment of ab initio Cypriot pilots has already commenced and we will continue this policy until all the foreigners in our company are replaced. With regard to Mr Nicholas's specific case, the reasons he was not selected are known to both himself and the Government agencies concerned through correspondence dating from 1991. As for the rest it is against our policy to discuss individual cases in the press”. On 11 May 1994 the applicant instituted proceedings for defamation against EuroCypria Airlines before the Larnaca District Court (Case No. 1676/94). He alleged that it transpired from the publication in question that (a) he was an unqualified and inexperienced pilot and not suitable to fly aircrafts, (b) he was so incompetent and/or had such disadvantages as a person and as a professional so as to jeopardise the safety of the flights and the operation of the company, or any other airline company, (c) he was not selected for employment, not because there were other persons more qualified than him, but because he was totally useless and/or incompetent and/or an ignorant professional pilot and (d) he was generally a dangerous and suspicious person and could not be trusted. The applicant applied for damages and an injunction preventing the defendants from continuing to publish defamatory statements. The applicant was represented by counsel. A hearing was fixed for 16 February 1996. On that date the applicant failed to appear and the court dismissed the action. On 21 May 1996 the applicant’s counsel asked for the reinstatement of the action. On 27 June 1996 the action was reinstated. A hearing was fixed for 27 November 1996. It was adjourned on several occasions. On 27 August 1997 the applicant informed his lawyer, Mr K, that he did not exclude the possibility of engaging the services of another lawyer. On 1 September 1997 Mr K informed the applicant that he was no longer able to represent him. The lawyer invited the applicant to collect the file so he could prepare his case himself. He stated that “no fees (were) expected to be paid by (the applicant)”. After Mr K’s withdrawal the applicant sent a number of faxes to the court’s registry asking for the case to be adjourned. On 20 November 1997 Mr E, in whose chambers Mr K used to work, appeared before the court on behalf of the applicant and asked for an adjournment. The court adjourned the hearing of the case until 27 February 1998. On 27 February 1998 none of the parties appeared and the court dismissed the action. On 1 July 1999 Mr E wrote a letter to the applicant’s representatives before the Court to the effect that his firm had agreed to represent the applicant “on a no fee basis”, that Mr K had withdrawn from the case because he had been appointed a judge and that the case “had a very good chance of success if handled properly”. B. Relevant domestic law The law on defamation in Cyprus is found in sections 17 to 24 of the Civil Wrongs Law. The following principles transpire from the case-law: “In accordance with the principles of legal interpretation applied in England, expressions used in (the Civil Wrongs Law) shall be presumed so far as they are consistent with their context and except as may be otherwise expressly provided to be used with the meaning attaching to them in English Law and shall be construed in accordance therewith. … Time and again it was said that the gist of the torts of libel and slander is the publication of words conveying a defamatory imputation. A defamatory imputation is one to a man's discredit, or which tends to lower him in the estimation of others, or to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to injure his reputation in his office, trade or profession or to injure his financial credit. The standard of opinion is that of right-thinking persons generally.” (Supreme Court of Cyprus in Paniccos Agathangelou v. S. Mousoulides and Sons, (1980) 1 CLR pp. 272 and 277) “The meaning of words in a libel case is not a matter of construction as a lawyer construes a contract. It is a matter of the impression an ordinary person gets on a first reading not on a later analysis.” (Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. (1963) 2 All E.R. p. 151) “An innuendo properly so called which is an allegation that words were used in a defamatory sense other than their ordinary meaning and which provides a separate cause of action must be supported by extrinsic facts or matters and cannot be found only on interpretation, because if the words bear the interpretation imputed to them they are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning.” (Grubb v. Bristol United Press Ltd. (1962) 2 All E.R. p. 380) According to a letter addressed to the applicant by the Cyprus High Commission on 9 June 1997, the Law Office of the Republic confirmed that “legal aid (was) not available in civil cases. Despite the fact that Article 30.3(d) of (the) Constitution provides that every person has the right to have free legal assistance where the interests of justice so require and as provided by law, such a law has not as yet been introduced”.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
139,001-101536,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2010,KÖPKE v. GERMANY,3,Inadmissible,Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"The applicant, Ms Karin Köpke, is a German national who was born in 1953 and lives in Feldberg. She was represented before the Court by Mr K. Nicolai, a lawyer practising in Neustrelitz. The applicant started working as a shop assistant in 1968. From 1 August 1991 until her dismissal on 5 November 2002 she was employed as a shop assistant and cashier in a supermarket in Feldberg. She has been unemployed since then. The applicant's employer noted in September 2002 that there were irregularities concerning the accounts in the drinks department of that supermarket, in that the sum of the till receipts for empty deposit bottles which had been printed out exceeded the total value of empty deposit bottles received by the supermarket. It suspected the applicant and another employee of having manipulated the accounts. Between 7 October 2002 and 19 October 2002 the applicant's employer, with the help of a detective agency, carried out covert video surveillance of the supermarket's drinks department. The camera covered the area behind the cash desk including the till, the cashier and the area immediately surrounding the cash desk. The detective agency made a video and examined the data obtained. It drew up a written report and produced several photos from the recording, which it sent to the applicant's employer together with two copies of the video (one concerning the applicant and one concerning the other employee monitored). On 5 November 2002 the applicant's employer dismissed the applicant without notice for theft. The applicant was accused of having manipulated the accounts in the drinks department of the supermarket and of having taken money (some 100 euros during the period in which she had been filmed) from the tills for herself which she had hidden in her clothes. On 14 November 2002 the applicant, who was represented by counsel throughout the proceedings, brought an action in the Neubrandenburg Labour Court against her employer, requesting that the court find her dismissal invalid. She further claimed compensation for non-pecuniary damage she had suffered as a result of the covert video surveillance and requested to be given the videotapes, including all copies made thereof. She was granted legal aid for these proceedings. The applicant contested having manipulated the tills or having stolen money and submitted that she had only put tips she had received from customers into her pockets. In accordance with the supermarket's practice, she had later put these tips into a separate till where all tips received by supermarket staff were collected. She further objected to the use of the covert video surveillance, arguing that this surveillance had breached her right to protection of her privacy. On 29 August 2003 the Neubrandenburg Labour Court dismissed the applicant's action, having held a hearing in which it heard as witnesses the three staff members of the defendant party involved in the applicant's video surveillance and dismissal and having watched the video tapes submitted by the defendant party. The Labour Court found that the defendant party had been entitled to dismiss the applicant without notice. It considered that the defendant party had been authorised to observe the applicant by means of covert video surveillance and to use the recording obtained thereby. The losses discovered in the drinks department during stocktaking and the irregularities between the amount of money paid out for returned empty deposit bottles and the value of the full bottles sold in the market during the applicant's working time had constituted sufficient grounds for the defendant party to order her surveillance. The defendant party's property rights had been seriously interfered with. In such circumstances, the video observation of an employee was lawful, as had been confirmed by the Federal Labour Court in its judgment of 27 March 2003 (file no. 2 AZR 51/02, see 'Relevant domestic law and practice' below). In case of the covert video surveillance of an employee on suspicion of theft, the employer's fundamental right to respect for his property rights had to be weighed against the employee's fundamental right to privacy vis-à-vis third persons, including his employer or his colleagues. Special circumstances were necessary to justify an interference with the employee's right to privacy, which had to be proportionate. Weighing these competing interests in the present case, the Labour Court found that the defendant party had been entitled to put the applicant under covert video surveillance. Having regard to the organisation of work in the drinks department of the supermarket, there were no other means to protect the defendant party's property rights. The surveillance had not been random, but carried out following suspicions of theft against two employees. The video records obtained had been used by the management staff of the defendant party and had been submitted to the court in order to justify the applicant's dismissal without notice. There was no risk of the records being used in a different manner. Therefore, the applicant neither had a right to non-pecuniary damage nor to be given the video tapes. The Labour Court, having regard to the evidence before it including the information obtained by examining the video tapes in question, found that the defendant party had had sufficient grounds to conclude that the applicant had repeatedly committed offences against its property during the relevant period. The applicant had not proven that the money she had undeniably taken from the till had been tips. In any event, it had not been necessary to hear the witnesses named by the applicant to prove that the money concerned had been tips because such tips were, in any event, also the property of the defendant party according to the work regulations in place. On 18 May 2004 the Mecklenburg Western-Pomerania Labour Court of Appeal, which had granted the applicant legal aid, dismissed the applicant's appeal and refused to grant her leave to appeal on points of law. The Labour Court of Appeal, referring to the case-law of the Federal Labour Court (judgment of 27 March 2003, file no. 2 AZR 51/02, see 'Relevant domestic law and practice' below), endorsed the Labour Court's finding that the defendant party had been authorised to carry out the covert video surveillance of the cash desk area of the drinks department. Her dismissal without notice had been justified as, following the examination of the videotapes in the proceedings, the applicant had stopped contesting that she had taken money from the till on several occasions. The covert video surveillance of the applicant had complied with section 6b of the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, see 'Relevant domestic law and practice' below), which transferred Directive 95/46/EG into domestic law. The workplace of a cashier behind the cash desk was not an area in the supermarket accessible to the public. Therefore, video surveillance thereof did not have to be made visible under section 6b § 2 of that Act. In any event, a cashier whose surveillance had been justified could not rely on the fact that the video surveillance had also covered customers who were standing at the cash desk and in respect of whom the covert video surveillance had not been permitted. The Labour Court of Appeal further considered that it had not been necessary to take further evidence in the proceedings, in particular to play the videotapes, after the applicant had stopped contesting having taken money from the till and having put it in her pockets on several occasions. As this fact alone justified the applicant's dismissal without notice, the use of the impugned videotapes as evidence in the proceedings had not been necessary. Even assuming that the defendant party had illegally obtained knowledge of the fact that the applicant had taken money from the till and even if this evidence were excluded, the defendant party had not been prevented from alleging this issue and the applicant had been obliged to reply truthfully. Moreover, it had not been necessary to take further evidence in order to verify whether the applicant had taken only tips from the till which she had later put into another till designated for tips. An employer could not be expected to further employ a cashier who put money from the till into her pockets without keeping any records on where the money was to be found. The witnesses named by the applicant to prove that there had been a separate till for tips and that the applicant had put money into that till would not be sufficient to prove that all the money taken from the till in the drinks department had been tips and had been put into the till designated for tips. The Labour Court of Appeal finally found that, at least at that stage of the proceedings, the applicant could not ask for the videotapes to be erased. The defendant party had a right to keep the videotapes at least until a final decision was given in the court proceedings brought by the applicant and until the admissibility and necessity of the tapes as evidence was no longer at issue (compare section 6b § 5 of the Federal Data Protection Act). By a decision of 14 December 2004 the Federal Labour Court dismissed the applicant's complaint about the refusal of the Labour Court of Appeal to grant her leave to appeal. It further dismissed the applicant's request for legal aid as her complaint had not had reasonable prospects of success. The Federal Labour Court found, in particular, that the Labour Court of Appeal had not diverged from the Federal Labour Court's case-law. In any event, the Labour Court of Appeal had left open whether the video surveillance of the applicant had been lawful and whether the evidence obtained thereby should have been used in the proceedings before the labour courts. It had instead based its judgment on facts uncontested between the parties. As it had considered the applicant's dismissal lawful, it had also considered her claim for damages ill-founded. The lawfulness of the video surveillance had therefore been irrelevant to the outcome of the proceedings. On 31 January 2005 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. She argued, in particular, that her right to privacy (allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht) had been breached by the unlawful covert video surveillance, by the processing of the data obtained thereby and by their use in the proceedings before the labour courts, which had refused to order the destruction of the video recording. Moreover, she submitted that her right to a fair trial and to be heard had been violated in that the labour courts had failed to take relevant evidence. She further submitted that the Federal Labour Court's refusal to grant her legal aid had breached her right of equal access to court. On 28 June 2006 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant's constitutional complaint and dismissed the applicant's request to be granted legal aid (file no. 1 BvR 379/05). It found that the applicant's complaint had no prospects of success as there was nothing to indicate that her fundamental rights had been violated by the decisions of the labour courts. Provisions aimed at protecting individuals against infringements of their right to privacy as a result of the way in which their personal data are handled are contained in the Federal Data Protection Act. Changes to that Act entered into force in 2001 in order to implement Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Section 6b of the Federal Data Protection Act contains rules on the monitoring of publicly accessible areas with optic-electronic devices. Such video surveillance is lawful only in so far as it is necessary, in particular, to pursue legitimate aims for specifically defined purposes and if there are no indications of overriding the legitimate interests of the data subject (section 6b § 1 no. 3). Suitable measures shall be taken to make it visible that the area is being monitored and to identify the controller (section 6b § 2). The data shall be erased as soon as they are no longer needed to achieve the purpose or if further storage would conflict with the legitimate interests of the data subject (section 6b § 5). On 1 September 2009 a new section 32 of the Federal Data Protection Act entered into force. It codifies (see judgment of the Berlin Labour Court of 18 February 2010, file no. 38 Ca 12879/09)) the previously developed case-law of the Federal Labour Court on video surveillance at the workplace (see below). Under paragraph 1 of section 32, an employee's personal data may be collected, processed or used for employment-related purposes where necessary for decisions regarding hiring or, after hiring, for carrying out or terminating the employment contract. Employees' personal data may be collected, processed or used to investigate criminal offences only under the following circumstances: if there is a documented, factual reason to believe that the data subject has committed a criminal offence in the course of his work; if the collection, processing or use of such data is necessary to investigate the criminal offence; if the employee does not have an overriding legitimate interest in ruling out the possibility of the collection, processing or use of such data, and, in particular, if the type and extent are not disproportionate to the aim pursued. On 27 March 2003 the Federal Labour Court rendered a leading judgment on the lawfulness of covert video surveillance in the workplace (file no. 2 AZR 51/02). The Federal Labour Court, upholding the judgment rendered by the Schleswig-Holstein Labour Court of Appeal on 4 December 2001 (file no. 1 Sa 392 b/01), found that the covert video surveillance of an employee by his employer interfered with the employee's fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed by Article 2 § 1, read in conjunction with Article 1, of the Basic Law, which also had to be respected in the relationship between private persons, including employment relations. This right had to be weighed against the employer's interest in securing evidence for his claim, having regard to the necessity of an effective judicial system required by the rule of law. However, such an interference with the employee's right to privacy was justified and did not entail an exclusion of the evidence obtained thereby in subsequent court proceedings if there was a substantiated suspicion that the employee had committed an offence or was guilty of other serious misconduct towards his employer, if less intrusive means to examine the suspicion had been exhausted, if the video surveillance was, in practice, the only means which remained to verify the suspicion and if it was not as a whole disproportionate. The Federal Labour Court confirmed this judgment in several subsequent decisions (see the decision of the Federal Labour Court of 29 June 2004, file no. 1 ABR 21/03; decision of 14 December 2004, file no. 1 ABR 34/03; and decision of 26 August 2008, file no. 1 ABR 16/07).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
140,001-87795,ENG,SWE,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,GUNEY v. SWEDEN,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Elisabet Fura;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall,"The applicant, Mr Musa Güney, is a Swedish citizen who was born in 1960. He was represented before the Court by Mr R. Armholt, a lawyer practising in Stockholm. The Swedish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C.-H. Ehrenkrona, Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The Tax Authority made a tax audit of a restaurant business, owned by a holding company owned, in its turn, by the applicant and three other persons. Following the audit the Tax Authority, by decisions of 8 December 2004, raised the company’s turnover by 2.7 million Swedish kronor (SEK) and considered that SEK 1.9 million of that amount had been paid to the company owners during the tax assessment years 2002 and 2003. Consequently, by the same decisions, the applicant’s taxable income for both years was raised by SEK 236,581. Moreover, as the revised taxation involved a discretionary assessment due to allegedly undisclosed salary payments in the applicant’s tax returns, tax surcharges (skattetillägg) were imposed on him, amounting to SEK 30,078 and 25,886, respectively, for the two assessment years (in total approximately 6,000 euros (EUR)). The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Stockholm through his legal counsel. On 14 March 2005 the Tax Authority reconsidered its decisions but did not change them. On 31 August 2005 the applicant applied to the County Administrative Court for legal aid. Referring to Article 6 § 3 (c) of the Convention, he maintained that he had no financial means to pay for legal representation as he had not been granted a respite to pay the tax amounts, that the legal issues were not uncomplicated as statistical information concerning the Swedish restaurant business had been used in determining the revised taxes and that the tax surcharges imposed on him were considerable. He further stated that, being of foreign origin, he did not fully master the Swedish language. On 8 September 2005 the court refused the applicant legal aid. It noted that, under the terms of the Legal Aid Act (Rättshjälpslagen, 1996:1619), the scope for granting legal aid to a businessman in a taxation case was very limited. According to a leading decision by the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten), the application of Article 6 § 3 (c) in a case concerning tax surcharges would depend on the size of the surcharges and the nature of the case; only if the penalties were particularly heavy and the legal issues complicated could legal aid be granted by virtue of the Convention (RÅ 2003 ref. 56). The instant case concerned mainly the question whether the documentation obtained by the Tax Authority constituted a sufficient ground for increasing the first applicant’s liability to income tax. The court found that, although the documentation was relatively extensive, the legal issues, including those related to the subordinate questions concerning the tax surcharges, were not of such a character that the applicant had a right to legal aid under Swedish law or the Convention. On 18 October 2005 the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm rejected the applicant’s appeal, subscribing to the reasons given by the County Administrative Court. On 5 April 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal. By a judgment of 3 January 2007, the County Administrative Court reduced the company’s unrecorded revenues and salary payments. Accordingly, in a further judgment of 16 March 2007 the court lowered the applicant’s taxable income to SEK 125,008 for each of the assessment years. In consequence of this finding, the tax surcharges were also reduced, to SEK 14,495 and 12,614, respectively, for the two assessment years (in total approximately EUR 3,000). The court also decided that the applicant be compensated for litigation costs under the Act on Compensation for Costs and Expenses in Cases Concerning Taxes, etc. (Lagen om ersättning för kostnader i ärenden och mål om skatt, m.m., 1989:479). The applicant was awarded SEK 825 concerning the court proceedings and SEK 1,000 concerning the proceedings before the Tax Authority (in total about EUR 200). He had claimed SEK 825 and 3,500, respectively. The applicant appealed against the taxation and the tax surcharges to the Administrative Court of Appeal, where the case was still pending at the time of the present decision.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
141,001-77874,ENG,DNK,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,BIGUM AND OTHERS v. DENMARK,4,Inadmissible,Snejana Botoucharova,"The applicants are a married couple, born in 1975 and 1972, respectively, and their daughter, C, born on 1 November 2003. They live in Gram. They are represented before the Court by Mr Ladegaard Jensen, a lawyer practising in Holsted. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Peter Taksøe-Jensen of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant parents suffer from arrested development. Intellectually they have been placed in the category of severely mentally retarded pesons and their disorders have been assessed to be congenital. Since their childhood they have been in close contact with the social and health authorities. The applicant parents have cohabited since 1995. On 22 September 1996 the applicant parents’ first child, M, was born. On the social authorities’ initiative, seven days after the birth the applicant parents and M moved into a family observation institution (Institutionen Bethesda), with staff consisting of social workers, psychologists and social education workers, which was to support the applicant parents and assess the extent to which they possessed potential in the parenting role. The institution submitted its report on 27 November 1996. As to the applicant mother, the report stated, inter alia, that her attention could only be maintained for short intervals and with massive support. She was generally preoccupied with talking about her physical ailments to the extent that it took most of her energy. When faced with demands, for example if M started to cry or became restless, the mother became anxious and could seem panicstricken. She was not able to recognise her own problems and need for support and she had great difficulty in establishing contact with M. As regards the applicant father, notably during the beginning of his stay at the institution, he often made verbal threats against the staff and the other families at the institution. He had violent nightmares during which he would cry out loudly and pull out his tongue. Moreover, his night sleep was broken by long hot showers for up to two hours, during which he would talk or shout to himself. Consequently, he would often be exhausted during the day and sleep most of the time. He had no structure to his day and showed no signs of being able to handle daily routines. He had no understanding or recognition of his need for help and support in the parental role. He had trouble realising the consequences of his actions, and was not capable of protecting their baby M from physical harm (for example, he left M alone on the changing table although the danger of doing so had been explained to him frequently). With regard to the parents’ care skills, the report stated that both parents had extreme difficulty in establishing contact with M, and they often asked the staff to take over when they became impatient with her. None of the parents handled M particularly gently and their movements sometimes seemed uncoordinated. Mostly, they forgot to hold the baby’s head. They would not let M sleep and were in general not capable of recognising and understanding her needs. The report also stated that due to the parents’ inability to concentrate, M’s attempts to make contact with the parents were usually rejected or not answered. Thus, M eventually gave up contact and looked away from the parents when being with them. The conclusion read as follows: “The parents appear as a very emotional damaged couple who, because of their own disadvantaged upbringing, find it extremely difficult to master the task of parenting. The staff have no doubt that both parents have done their best in a spirit of love for their child, but their personality structure and their non-existing inner picture of the parent role prevent them from developing sufficient parenting functions. Moreover, their lack of mental resources is a further hindrance to the task of their developing parenting potential. Despite intervention at various levels, the basic symbiotic mother-child dyad has not developed. For the mother’s parental skills, this lack of bonding means that she is unable to see and understand the child’s signals, nor is she able to adapt to the child’s needs, which is crucial for the child’s attachment ability and emotional development. We have examined whether the father has the resources to take over this process, but the examination showed that he does not master this either. Their lack of timing and the resulting unintended abuse create unpredictability and chaos in the child’s world and will be a risk factor in her development, Moreover, both parents lack the fundamental ability to structure their everyday lives, for the child as well as for themselves. In particular, their serious problems managing their finances permeate their entire everyday lives. Their - as we see it - very resource-poor network means that the father, mother and child cannot expect adequate support. Mother and father tell us themselves that they have no friends who can give them special support. Our observations have also shown that their ability to create relations is virtually non-existent.” On 9 December 1996 M was taken into public care without the parents’ consent. Since May 1997 she has lived with a foster family. A relief foster family was also provided for her, to take over during holidays etc. The applicant parents were granted regular access, which was to take place under surveillance. Since February 2004 access has taken place in the presence of the foster family. The applicant parents’ second child, C, was born on 1 November 2003. Beforehand, at a meeting held on 8 September 2003, the applicant parents were informed by a social worker at the Municipality (Nørre-Rangstrup Kommune) that the latter would not recommend that the family be placed in a family institution when the child was born. The decision was based on the report of 27 November 1996 and reports on the applicant parents’ access to M. In addition, the decision was based on two statements of 19 January 2001 by a neuropsychologist, who in December 2000 had examined each of the applicant parents at the request of the social and health authorities in connection with the granting of social benefits (førtidspension). With regard to the applicant father the statement concluded: “The findings of the neuropsychological examination show a 27-year-old man, whose intelligence is probably far below average and whose current intellectual and memory functions correspond to this level, thus presently placing him in the severely mentally retarded category. On review of the individual neuropsychological functions as well as the intellectual and memory functions, a number of heavy disorders appear, manifested in a more diffuse affection of cortical brain areas, most pronounced in the frontoparietal brain areas of the left hemisphere. The disorders are assessed to be congenital. As regards an assessment of future job possibilities, I believe the chances of his being placed in the labour market under normal conditions to be non-existent, and that he has no real capacity for working in any kind of occupation, not even in sheltered surroundings.” With regard to the applicant mother the statement concluded: “The findings of the neuropsychological examination show a 25-year-old woman whose intelligence is probably far below average and whose current intellectual and memory functions correspond to this level, thus presently placing her in the severely mentally retarded category. On review of the individual neuropsychological functions as well as the intellectual and memory functions, a number of disorders appear, manifested in a more diffuse affection of cortical brain areas, most pronounced in the frontoparietal brain areas of the right hemisphere. The disorders are assessed to be congenital.” On 21 October 2003 the Municipality received written information from an acquaintance of the applicant parents that the latter planned to run away from the hospital with the baby when it had been born. On 23 October 2003, a family care consultant also informed the Municipality that the applicant father had told her that with the help of others he had planned to run away with the baby within 24 hours after its birth. By decision of 29 October 2003 the Municipality refused the applicant parents’ request that they and their newborn pursuant to Section 40 (2) of the Act on Social Services (Lov om Social Service) be placed at a family institution observation home or that mother and child be placed together with a foster family. At the same time the applicant parents were also informed that the Municipality intended to take the newborn into public care. The applicant appealed against the decision to the Social Appeal Board (Den Sociale Ankestyrelse). On 1 November 2003 C was born and the same day the Chairman of the Children and Young Persons Committee (Børne- og Ungeudvalget) under the Municipality decided provisionally, pursuant to section 45 (1) of the Act on Social Services, to take C into public care without the consent of the applicant parents. The decision gave the police the authority to prevent the applicant parents from leaving the hospital with C, but the parents had unlimited access to their baby during the stay at the hospital. According to section 45 (3) of the Act on Social Services, the preliminary decision was approved by the entire Children and Young Persons Committee at a meeting on 6 November 2003, during which the applicant parents’ lawyer was present. The decision was based on the report of 27 November 1996, the two statements of 19 January 2001 and the information submitted about the applicants’ intention to run away with the newborn baby. The decision was implemented sixteen days later in connection with the applicant mother’s discharge from the hospital. At the wish of the applicant parents, C was placed with M’s relief foster family, which allowed the children to see each other on a regular basis. During a meeting on 1 December 2003, at which the applicant parents, represented by their lawyer, were heard together with their two advisers (bisiddere), the Children- and Young Persons Committee made its final care order pursuant to section 42 (2) of the Act on Social Services. The applicant parents had access to C one hour twice a week in the foster parents’ home. On appeal, by decision of 6 January 2004, the Social Appeal Board upheld the Children and Young Persons Committee’s decisions of 6 November 2003 and 1 December 2003. Before the Board, the applicant parents, represented by their lawyer, and an adviser were heard. In addition, various documents were submitted, including the report of 27 November 1996, the two statements of 19 January 2001 concerning the neuropsychological examinations of the applicants and the Municipality’s case file. The Social Appeal Board found that due to the applicant parents’ diminished intellectual functioning and limited personal resources, there was an evident risk that C’s health and development would suffer serious damage if she was to remain with them. For the same reasons, it considered that the problems could not be solved in the applicant parents’ home, even if they were granted measures of support. The care order was to be reconsidered by the Children and Young Persons Committee no later than one year from the Board’s decision or, if the decision was brought before the High Court, no later than one year from the High Court’s judgment. On 23 January 2004 the applicants appealed against the decision to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret), claiming the Municipality’s care order to be revoked as regards C. They also appealed against a decision of 20 November 2003 in which the Social Appeal Board had continued the taking into public care of M. The applicant parents were heard by the High Court. In addition to the written material already submitted before the Social Appeal Board, the court also obtained two statements of February 2004 in which the foster families described the positive health and development of M and C respectively. They stated that the applicant parents’ access to the children was well implemented. By judgment of 18 March 2004, the High Court found against the applicants. It stated that for the reasons set out by the Social Appeal Board the conditions under section 42 of the Act on Social Services were fulfilled for taking the applicant parents’ children, M and C, into public care. The applicants’ request to be granted leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret) was refused on 19 August 2004. In 2004, in connection with the review of the public care order, the Municipality decided to make an assessment of the applicants’ parenting skills by a psychologist. The assessment was submitted on 1 February 2005 and contained a recommendation to maintain C in public care since the applicants parental skills were found too limited. In a statement of 27 January 2005 the foster family described their view on C’s development and on how access with the parents was working out. The parents had been good at keeping the appointments, and although the father had only little contact with C, the mother was very preoccupied with proving that she could perform the role as a mother. Both applicant parents, however, were unable to interpret the child’s signals and impervious to advise. Consequently, the contact confused the child. On 9 March 2005 having heard the applicant parents and one of their advisers, the Children and Young Persons Committee decided to continue the public care for another two years. On appeal, on 24 May 2005, the Social Appeal Board confirmed the decision. The applicant did not bring this decision before the courts. On the contrary, on 1 December 2005 the applicant parents gave their consent to the taking of C into public care. In the meantime, in March 2005, the applicant parent’s access to C was increased and now took place once a week for four hours in the presence of the support person appointed to the parents. In May 2005, however, on the applicant parents’ request, access was reduced to take place once a week for two hours. B. Relevant domestic law and practice The relevant provisions of the Act on Social Services (Lov om Social Service) at the time read as follows: Section 40 1. The Municipality takes a decision as to measures to be taken under subsection 2, when this is deemed to be of significant importance with regard to a child’s or young person’s special need for support. From the measures listed in subsection 2, one or more of the least restrictive measures among those suitable shall be chosen. Any such decision shall be subject to the consent of the custodial parent, or other person having custody ... Any decision taken under subsection 2 (xi) shall be subject also to the consent of the young person, who has reached the age of 15 years. 2. The Municipality may decide: (i) to offer consultation assistance relating to the child or young person’s conditions, including the admission of the child or young person to a daytime facility, a youth club, training or education establishment, etc.; (ii) to offer practical, pedagogical or other support in the home; (iii) to offer family therapy or similar support; (iv) to offer the custodial parent, or other person having custody, the child or young person and other family members the possibility of staying on a full-time basis ..., in an institution, with a foster family, at another approved facility, in a municipal full-time facility or in an accommodation facility approved by the county authority subject to the rules provided under section 94a below; (v) to offer a relief arrangement ... at a full-time institution, with a foster family, in a municipal full-time facility or at an approved facility; (vi) to appoint a welfare officer for the child or young person; (vii) to appoint a permanent contact person for the child or young person or for the whole family; (viii) to grant financial support in respect of expenses incidental to the measures listed under (i)-(v) where the custodial parent or other person having custody cannot afford such expenses; (ix) to grant financial support in respect of expenses incurred for the purpose of preventing a child or young person being taken into care, for the purpose of expediting the return of a child or young person to his/her home or of contributing towards creating and maintaining stable contact between parents and children while one or more children are in care; (x) to grant financial support for attendance at a boarding school or continuation school where the custodial parent, or other person having custody, cannot afford such costs; (xi) to take the child or young person into care at a full-time institution, with a foster family, in a municipal full-time facility or at an approved facility deemed suitable for the special needs of the child or young person .... Section 40a In connection with a child or a young person being taken into public care ..., the Municipality proposes that a support person be appointed to the custodial parent or other person having custody of the child. Section 42 1. If there is an obvious risk that the health or development of the child or young person will suffer major damage due to (i) inadequate care or treatment of the child or young person; (ii) violence or other serious ill-treatment; (iii) substance abuse or criminal conduct or other serious social difficulties on the part of the child or young person; or (iv) any other behavioural or adjustment problems in the child or young person, the Children and Young Persons Committee may decide that the child or the young person be taken into care according to section 40 (2) (xi) without the consent of the custodial parent or other person having custody, or of the young person having reached the age of 15 years. [Such a decision] may be made only when there is a reasonable assumption that the problems cannot be resolved during the child’s or young person’s continued stay in the home. 2. If it is in the child’s or young person’s best interest, the Children and Young Persons Committee may decide that the child or young person be taken into care pursuant to subsection 1, notwithstanding that the custodial parent, or other person having custody, and the young person consent to an arrangement under section 40 (2) (xi). 3. ... 4. Any decision taken under subsections 1-3 may be made on a provisional basis subject to the rules provided under section 45 below provided the requirements are met. Section 45 1. Decisions under sections ... 42, ... 57(3), ... which, because of the immediate needs of the child or young person, cannot be deferred pending consideration by the Children and Young Persons Committee, may be made on a provisional basis by the Chairman of the Committee or in his absence by the Deputy Chairman. 2. The custodial parent or other person having custody, ... shall within 24 hours of the implementation of a provisional decision be given written notice of the decision and the reasons for the decision. Such notice shall also give particulars of the right of access to case records provided for by the Act on Public Administration, the right to be heard and to receive free legal assistance. 3. A provisional decision made under subsection 1 shall be submitted to the Children and Young Persons Committee for their approval as soon as possible and within a maximum period of seven days from the implementation of the decision, whether or not the measure has been discontinued. ...

(vi) approval of a provisional decision under section 45(3); 2. Before a decision is made, the custodial parent, or other person having custody, the child or young person, the legal adviser and any other adviser to the custodial parent or other person having custody shall be given an opportunity to be heard by the Children and Young Persons Committee. An opportunity provided under the first sentence to the child or young person may be dispensed with if the child has not attained the age of 12 or where it is deemed to be harmful to the child or young person. ... Section 123 1. Decisions by the Children and Young Persons Committee accordingly to section 62, may be brought before the Social Appeals Board ... ... Section 124 1.

142,001-82005,ENG,UKR,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,BORDOKINA v. UKRAINE,4,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Ms Lyubov Ivanovna Bordokina, is a Ukrainian national who lives in Molodogvardiysk. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr Y. Zaytsev, their Agent, and Mrs I. Shevchuk, Head of the Office of the Government Agent before the European Court of Human Rights. In July 1994 the applicant deposited 1,000,000 karbovantsi (around 30 ECU in the Ukrainian transitional currency) with the private commercial bank “Privatbank” (the “Bank”; Комерційний банк “Приватбанк”) for a four-year term at an annual interest rate of 500%. At the end of the contract, the Bank paid the applicant 182 Ukrainian hryvnyas (about 0.70 ECU), referring to the introduction of the new hryvnya currency and a revision of interest rates as allowed by the contract between the parties. On 30 September 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Leninsky District Court of Lugansk (the “District Court”; Ленінський районний суд м. Луганська) seeking higher payment and damages. Subsequently, she amended her claims on one occasion. On 18 November 1998 the District Court ordered a financial expert assessment, which was received on 16 February 1999. On 18 March 1999 the District Court held a hearing and dismissed the applicant’s claims, finding that the Bank had acted in compliance with applicable law and the contract between the parties. The judgment became final. Unsatisfied with the outcome of her litigation, the applicant requested the authorities to re-open the proceedings by way of lodging a supervisory protest. On 19 April 2000 the Presidium of the Lugansk Regional Court (the “Regional Court;” Луганський обласний суд) quashed the judgment of 18 March 1999 following a protest introduced by its President and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the District Court. Between July and December 2000 the District Court held three hearings. On 14 December 2000 the District Court allowed the applicant’s amended claims, finding that the Bank had breached the contract. The Bank appealed in cassation. On 22 January 2001 the Regional Court upheld the judgment of 14 December 2000 and it became final. The Bank requested to re-open the proceedings by way of supervisory review. On 28 February 2001 the Presidium of the Regional Court quashed the rulings of 14 December 2000 and 22 January 2001 following a protest lodged by its President and remitted the case to the District Court for a fresh consideration. Between May and July 2001 the District Court scheduled three hearings, one of them being adjourned on account of the defendant’s absence. On 3 July 2001 the District Court dismissed the applicant’s claims. The applicant appealed. On 3 September 2001 the Regional Court upheld this judgment on appeal. The applicant appealed in cassation. On 23 April 2003 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal in cassation.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicants were born in 1954 and live in Moscow. 5. On 5 October 2001 the applicants sued the Nefron association seeking conclusion of employment contracts. 6. The Nagatinskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) scheduled the first hearing for 21 February 2002. Between 21 February 2002 and 17 June 2003 one hearing was held as planned. Six scheduled hearings did not take place due to the respondent’s default in appearance or requests for adjournment, three hearings had to be postponed following the applicants’ failure to appear or requests for adjournment, and three hearings could not proceed as both parties either failed to submit evidence or to show in court altogether. 7. On 17 June 2003 the District Court considered that the applicants no longer intended to pursue their civil action and decided to strike the case out of its list. 8. On 7 August 2003 the applicants asked the court to reinstate the case to its list claiming that they had not been able to appear at the hearings because the first applicant had been undergoing hospital treatment. 9. On 9 September 2003 the District Court quashed its earlier decision and reinstated the case to its list. The next hearing was scheduled for 3 November 2003. Between 3 November 2003 and 12 July 2004 five hearings were held as planned, whereas five other hearings were postponed due to the fault of the respondent, two for the applicants’ failure to appear, and two others for both parties’ default. 10. On 12 July 2004 the District Court again considered that the applicants no longer intended to pursue their civil action and decided to strike the case out of its list. 11. On 22 December 2004 the applicants asked the court to reinstate the case to its list. On 19 January 2005 the District Court quashed its decision of 12 July 2004 after finding that the applicants had not been duly notified of certain unspecified hearings and resumed the proceedings. The next hearing was scheduled for 31 January 2005. 12. The hearing of 31 January 2005 was adjourned as the respondent did not appear. 13. On 16 February and 10 March 2005 the hearings were held as planned. 14. On 11 March 2005 the District Court dismissed the applicants’ claims in full. 15. On 8 June 2005 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment on appeal. 16. On an unspecified date the first applicant sued the Military Commission of Moscow for recalculation of his pension. 17. On 14 July 2006 the Justice of the Peace of the 384th Court Circuit of the Meshchanskiy District of Moscow dismissed his claims. 18.

The applicant was born in 1944 and lives in Merthyr Tydfil. 8. In the early evening of 9 December 1997, the applicant went to visit his mother at her house in Merthyr Tydfil but could not park his car because of obstruction by other vehicles. He went into his mother's house having been unable to alert the owners of other vehicles by sounding his horn. He decided to telephone the police to complain about the obstruction and his mother tried to stop him. At some stage, someone contacted the police and they arrived at the house some minutes later. 9. There is a dispute about what occurred subsequently. The applicant was arrested inside his mother's house for breach of the peace. He disputes that there were lawful grounds for arresting him. He was taken outside the house into the street. The police claimed that at that stage, they intended to take him home but as a result of what happened outside they decided to remove him in accordance with section 136(1) of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the 1983 Act” – see paragraphs 33-36 below). 10. The applicant was taken to St Tydfil's hospital, less than a mile away from his mother's home, where he was detained pursuant to section 136(2) of the 1983 Act and, subsequently, section 2 of the 1983 Act until 18 December 1997, when his release was ordered by a mental health review tribunal. 11. On 5 August 2003, the applicant's then solicitors wrote to the police claiming damages on the basis that there was no justification for the applicant's detention under section 136. 12. On 8 December 2003, the eve of the expiry of the relevant limitation period (see paragraph 37 below), the applicant (who was by then no longer legally represented) issued proceedings in the County Court seeking damages from the Chief Constable of South Wales Police for “trespass, assault, wrongful arrest, misuse of police powers, misuse of section 136 of the 1983 Act, falsehood and personal injuries sustained” as a result of the events of 9 December 1997. His particulars of claim indicated that: “At the time of the incident on 9/12/97 at my mother's house the police at no time inform[ed] me of any arrest or that I was to be detained pursuant to Section 136 of the Mental Health Act, 1983. I am aware that the police can only use Section 136 to detain persons found in public places provided that the person to be detained appears to the police constable to have a mental disorder and to be in immediate need of care or control and such that it be necessary to take the person to a place of safety for the protection of the person detained or for the protection of others. At no stage did the police find me in a public place, on the contrary I was taken from a private dwelling by the police to a public place and at no time could my conduct be construed or considered as that of a mentally-disordered person. Therefore the use of Section 136 of the Mental Health Act was unlawful.” 13. Under section 139(2) of the 1983 Act, the leave of the High Court was required prior to the commencement of any claim relating to the exercise of powers under that Act (see paragraph 34 below). The applicant failed to seek High Court leave before commencing his claim. 14. On 4 May 2004, the respondent filed both a defence to the claim on the grounds of section 139(1) of the 1983 Act (see paragraph 34 below) relying on the absence of allegations of bad faith or failure to take reasonable care and an application for the claim to be struck out on the grounds that leave from the High Court, as required under section 139(2), had not been obtained prior to the proceedings being brought. The respondent further argued that the claims in defamation and falsehood were time-barred pursuant to section 4A of the Limitation Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act” – see paragraph 38 below). 15. On 5 July 2004, the County Court ordered that the claim be struck out on the basis that the proceedings were a nullity as leave had not been granted by the High Court. The claim in defamation and malicious falsehood was struck out by consent as the relevant limitation period had expired in respect of such claims. 16. On 27 August 2004, permission to appeal the decision to strike out the claim was granted. 17. On 18 October 2004, the Circuit Judge varied the order of the County Court. He reinstated the claim insofar as it related to events which took place before the applicant was detained and removed under the 1983 Act. In relation to the applicant's complaints regarding his detention under the 1983 Act, however, the Circuit Judge dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding the legal proceedings in that regard to be a nullity as a result of the failure to obtain prior leave. 18. In handing down his judgment, he noted: “I did consider at one stage whether it would be open to Mr. Seal simply to make an application to the High Court for the permission required by section 139 of the Mental Health Act and then simply apply under the provisions of the [Civil Procedure Rules] ... to add the further claim. However, the defendant will raise the Limitation Act defence.” 19. The applicant was granted leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 20. Before the Court of Appeal, the applicant argued that the Circuit Judge should have reinstated the whole claim and should have granted a stay in relation to that part of the complaint relating to the removal and detention under the 1983 Act until the necessary leave had been obtained. On 19 May 2005, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was granted. 21. The argument before the House of Lords focussed on the consequences in terms of section 139(2) of the 1983 Act of bringing proceedings without prior leave from the High Court. The respondent argued that such a failure rendered the proceedings a nullity. The applicant, on the other hand, argued that lack of leave was a procedural irregularity which could be corrected. 22. On 4 July 2007, the House of Lords handed down its judgment and, by a majority of three to two, dismissed the applicant's appeal. 23. Lord Bingham of Cornhill, of the majority, considered the applicant's argument that section 139(2) infringed his right of access to court but concluded that this was not an argument that he could accept. He noted (at paragraph 20): “The European Court has accepted that the right of access to the court is not absolute, but may be subject to limitations: Ashingdane v United Kingdom (1985) 7 EHRR 528, para 57. The protection of those responsible for the care of mental patients from being harassed by litigation has been accepted as a legitimate objective: ibid, para 58; M v United Kingdom (1987) 52 DR 269, 270. What matters (Ashingdane, para 57) is that the limitations applied must not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent as to impair the very essence of the right. But the threshold for obtaining leave under section 139(2) has been set at a very unexacting level: Winch v Jones [1986] QB 296. An applicant with an arguable case will be granted leave. Mr Seal's undoing lay not in his failure to obtain leave which he should have had but in his failure to proceed within the generous time limit allowed by the 1980 Act, which would not itself fall foul of article 6: Stubbings v United Kingdom (1996) 23 EHRR 213.” 24. Similarly, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood considered that Parliament had made it clear under section 139 that relevant proceedings brought without leave were a nullity. “ 73. It seems to me quite evident from the legislative history of this provision that from 1930 onwards Parliament intended to make leave a precondition of any effective proceedings. Unlike the position prior to 1930, the prospective defendant was not to be required to take any action whatever with regard to a proposed claim unless and until it was sanctioned by a High Court judge. Absent such leave, albeit he might be notified of a claimant's proposal to proceed against him, he was not to be troubled by such proceedings. The very inflexibility of the provision was an integral part of the protection it afforded. If, however, the [applicant's] approach were to be adopted, inevitably (unless by chance the court took the point of its own motion) the defendant himself would be drawn into the litigation. 74. ... I repeat, the requirement for leave here was to safeguard prospective defendants from being faced with proceedings (which might not be sufficiently meritorious to deserve leave) unless and until a High Court judge thought it appropriate that they be issued. And that is not a protection that can be secured save by a clear and inflexible rule such as section 139(2) (and its legislative predecessors) have always hitherto been understood to provide. Just such a rule applies in respect of those adjudged vexatious litigants under section 42 of the Supreme Court Act 1981 and Parliament clearly intended to achieve the same result under the Mental Health Act legislation. Whether or not such protection is necessary or desirable is, of course, open to question and has, indeed, been extensively debated over recent years. But your Lordships' task is not to decide whether it is desirable but whether presently the legislation confers it.” 25. As to the Article 6 argument advanced by the applicant, Lord Brown said (at paragraph 75): “To suggest that the approach hitherto adopted to section 139(2) involves a violation of article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights seems to me fanciful. Such an approach cannot sensibly be seen (as Baroness Hale suggests) 'to brand every person who is or has been subject to the compulsory powers in the Mental Health Act as a potential vexatious litigant'. Nor can it be seen to have 'an effect out of all proportion to the aim which it is attempting to pursue.' Of course, in a rare case (perhaps such as this one) a combination of circumstances—ignorance of the law (ie of section 139(2)), the delay in the issue of proceedings until the very end of the six year limitation period, and the inflexibility of section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 itself (assuming the defendant chooses to take the Limitation Act defence) will operate to deprive the prospective claimant of his claim. But that, of course, is equally so in the case of a litigant in person ignorant of the six year limitation period itself. In each case the loss of the claim is the price paid for certainty—just as there is a price to be paid for the established principle (and the assurance it provides) protecting various classes of prospective defendant against claims in negligence ... None of these cases can properly be characterised as a denial of access to the courts contrary to article 6 and it seems to me unsurprising that the point was not even taken in the courts below.” 26. Baroness Hale of Richmond, dissenting, noted at the outset of her opinion (at paragraph 38): “The question is one of statutory construction. Despite the antiquity of this provision, which dates back to the Mental Treatment Act 1930, the question has never arisen directly before. But it concerns a fundamental constitutional right – the right of access to the courts. It also concerns the exercise of that right by a peculiarly vulnerable group of people – people who are or have been the subject of compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act 1983. The courts here – and in Strasbourg – have taken particular care to safeguard the right of prisoners to have access to the courts while acknowledging that imprisonment inevitably imposes some constraints: see particularly Golder v United Kingdom (1975) 1 EHRR 524 in Strasbourg and R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Leech [1994] QB 198; R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Simms [2000] 2 AC 115; and R (Daly) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2001] UKHL 26; [2001] 2 AC 532 in the United Kingdom. The courts should be no less vigilant to safeguard the rights of mental patients, most of whom have done no wrong and very few of whom are suffering from mental disorders which make them more likely than others to bring vexatious claims.” 27. She continued: “41. I approach the task of construing section 139(2), therefore, on the basis that Parliament, by enacting the procedural requirement to obtain leave, did not intend the result to be that a claimant might be deprived of access to the courts, unless there is express language or necessary implication to the contrary. If there is no express language, there will be no necessary implication unless the legislative purpose cannot be achieved in any other way. Procedural requirements are there to serve the ends of justice, not to defeat them. It does not serve the ends of justice for a claimant to be deprived of a meritorious claim because of a procedural failure which does no substantial injustice to the defendant. 42. The express words are: 'No civil proceedings shall be brought ... in respect of any such act without the leave of the High Court; ...' These words say nothing about what is to be the consequence if, through ignorance or error, proceedings are in fact started without leave ...” ... “49. Nowhere ... is there any discussion of the consequence if proceedings are brought without first obtaining leave. The purpose was and remains the protection of staff. But protection from what? It cannot have been intended or expected that staff would be protected from all knowledge of possible claims. The 1930 Act had expressly required that notice of an application for leave be given to the proposed defendant. Good practice and common courtesy, then as now, would require that they be informed of what was afoot and have the opportunity if they so desired to resist the grant of leave. What staff are protected from is having to defend a baseless action. Such protection is not undermined if an action is, whether through ignorance or inadvertence, begun without leave and the defendant takes the point or the court takes it of its own motion. The burden is still on the claimant to establish that the case should go further.” 28. She concluded (at paragraphs 53-54) that: “If spotted in time, the failure to obtain leave for civil proceedings can readily be put right and without prejudice to the legitimate interests of the defendant. If it is not spotted in time, and the action succeeds, no injustice will be done to the unsuccessful defendant if the judgment is allowed to stand; but a serious injustice will be done to the successful claimant if it has to be set aside, for by then it is not at all unlikely that the action will be statute barred. The fact that leave is required at all may not emerge until a relatively late stage in the proceedings. That a claimant who has suffered a wrong should be deprived of his remedy merely because of a procedural failure which no-one noticed at the time is an affront to justice. My Lords, I would not interpret section 139(2) so as to achieve such an obviously unjust result unless driven by the statutory language so to do. The statutory language makes it clear that if anyone, including the claimant, appreciates the point, then leave must be obtained. It does not make it clear that if no-one, including the court or the defendant, does so, the proceedings are a nullity. Halfway houses are usually to be preferred to absolute extremes.” 29. Considering Article 6 § 1 and the jurisprudence of this Court, Baroness Hale noted: “57. To be proportionate, a restriction on fundamental rights has first to bear a rational connection with the legitimate aim pursued. To restrict the right of access to the courts of people who have previously abused that right obviously bears a rational connection with the aim of protecting defendants against vexatious claims. But it is not obviously rational to brand every person who is or has been subject to the compulsory powers in the Mental Health Act as a potential vexatious litigant. There are some compulsory patients who suffer from paranoid delusions; there are some who suffer from psychopathic disorders who may be more inclined than others to make trouble. But the blanket restriction in section 139(2) takes no account of these subtleties. It assumes that everyone who has ever been subject to Mental Health Act compulsion is automatically suspect. This is not only empirically unproven. It certainly cannot be taken for granted when Mental Health Act powers may be exercised by people with no mental health expertise whatsoever. On the one hand, therefore, section 139(2) goes too far. On the other hand, however, it may not go far enough, because it is limited to acts done in pursuance of the Mental Health Act itself. If certain mental patients are ex hypothesi vexatious litigants, then people who exercise authority over them otherwise than under the Mental Health Act may also deserve protection. 58. This case is an excellent illustration. The police case is that Mr Seal was first arrested inside his mother's home for a breach of the peace. Having been taken outside he was then detained under section 136(1) of the 1983 Act: ... Police officers lead difficult and dangerous lives. They have to make snap decisions in complex situations where there is no time for quiet contemplation. They deserve the support of the public, the courts and the law. But it has not been shown why they should need more protection and more support when they remove people to a place of safety under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 than they have when they conduct an ordinary arrest. 59. Even where a rational connection between the end and the means can be shown, the means still have to be proportionate to the ends. There will be cases in which the operation of section 139(2) is proportionate. There will be other cases, quite possibly including this, in which it is not. Blanket provisions, which catch a great many cases in which the restriction is not justified in order to catch the few where it may be, require particularly careful scrutiny. If section 139(2) has the effect that proceedings are always a compete nullity, thus depriving a claimant of a good claim, that is an effect out of all proportion to the aim which it is attempting to pursue. Interpreting the subsection so as to allow the court to cure the defect once detected is a proportionate response.” 30. In the applicant's case, she concluded that the appeal should be allowed, noting (at paragraphs 60-61): “ The police may well have an answer to Mr Seal's claim. But their case is not without difficulty. If he was 'removed' under section 136 of the Mental Health Act from his mother's home, he cannot have been 'found in a place to which the public have access'. If he was arrested in her home for a breach of the peace, and then 'removed' under section 136 after they had taken him outside, can it be said that they 'found' him there? (To say otherwise would deprive section 136 of much of its usefulness when an arrested person is later discovered to have a mental disorder.) These are questions which deserve to be addressed at the trial of the claim. By no stretch of the imagination is this vexatious. It may not be worth a great deal of money but that is not the point. 61. Section 139(2) covers a great many people who are neither vexatious litigants nor, by reason of their mental disorder, more likely than the general population to launch vexatious actions. I do not believe that Parliament ever intended that it should operate so as to bar the claims of people who began proceedings in time but did not obtain the High Court's leave in time. Defendants deserve protection from vexatious claims. They do not deserve protection from meritorious claims. But if that was Parliament's intention, it is an irrational and disproportionate interference in the Convention right to access to justice. There is no problem in reading down section 139(2) to cure that because there is nothing there to prevent it. However, the best solution would be to remove the procedural requirement altogether, as proposed in Clause 298 of the Draft Mental Health Bill proposed by the Department of Health in 2004 (2004, Cm 6305-1). The Mental Health Bill currently before Parliament, provides such an opportunity.” 31. Also dissenting, Lord Woolf accepted that it was not desirable to leave it until the limitation period had 32. Following the conclusion of the proceedings in the House of Lords, the applicant did not continue with the remainder of his claim (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 17 above) in the County Court. 33. Section 136 of the 1983 Act, as in force at the time of the applicant's arrest and the commencement of the legal proceedings in this case, provided as follows: “(1) If a constable finds in a place to which the public have access a person who appears to him to be suffering from mental disorder and to be in immediate need of care or control, the constable may, if he thinks it necessary to do so in the interests of that person or for the protection of other persons, remove that person to a place of safety within the meaning of section 135 above. (2) A person removed to a place of safety under this section may be detained there for a period not exceeding 72 hours for the purpose of enabling him to be examined by a registered medical practitioner and to be interviewed by an approved social worker and of making any necessary arrangements for his treatment or care.” 34. Section 139 provided: “(1) No person shall be liable, whether on the ground of want of jurisdiction or on any other ground, to any civil or criminal proceedings to which he would have been liable apart from this section in respect of any act purporting to be done in pursuance of this Act or any regulations or rules made under this Act, or in, or in pursuance of anything done in, the discharge of functions conferred by any other enactment on the authority having jurisdiction under Part VII of this Act, unless the act was done in bad faith or without reasonable care. (2) No civil proceedings shall be brought against any person in any court in respect of any such act without the leave of the High Court; and no criminal proceedings shall be brought against any person in any court in respect of any such act except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.” 35. The relevant provisions of the 1983 Act have undergone amendments since the time of the events to which this application relates which are irrelevant for the present purposes. 36. Section 2 of the 1983 Act allows for detention for the purposes of assessment for up to 28 days. 37. Section 2 of the Limitation Act 1980 (“the 1980 Act”) provides as follows: “An action founded on tort shall not be brought after the expiration of six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued” 38. Section 4A establishes a more limited time period for commencing actions for defamation or malicious falsehood and provides that: “The time limit under section 2 of this Act shall not apply to an action for– (a) libel or slander, or (b) slander of title, slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, but no such action shall be brought after the expiration of one year from the date on which the cause of action accrued.” 39. Section 11 of the 1980 Act provides for a special time limit for actions in respect of personal injuries: “(1) This section applies to any action for damages for negligence, nuisance or breach of duty ... where the damages claimed by the plaintiff for the negligence, nuisance or breach of duty consist of or include damages in respect of personal injuries to the plaintiff or any other person. ... (2) None of the time limits given in the preceding provisions of this Act shall apply to an action to which this section applies. (3) An action to which this section applies shall not be brought after the expiration of the period applicable in accordance with subsection (4) or (5) below. (4) Except where subsection (5) below applies, the period applicable is three years from– (a) the date on which the cause of action accrued; or (b) the date of knowledge (if later) of the person injured. ...” 40. Section 33 of the Act provides for discretionary disapplication of the time-limit for actions in respect of personal injuries or death: “(1) If it appears to the court that it would be equitable to allow an action to proceed having regard to the degree to which– (a) the provisions of section 11 ... of this Act prejudice the plaintiff or any person whom he represents; and (b) any decision of the court under this subsection would prejudice the defendant or any person whom he represents; the court may direct that those provisions shall not apply to the action, or shall not apply to any specified cause of action to which the action relates. ... – (a) the length of, and the reasons for, the delay on the part of the plaintiff; (b) the extent to which, having regard to the delay, the evidence adduced or likely to be adduced by the plaintiff or the defendant is or is likely to be less cogent than if the action had been brought within the time allowed by section 11 ...; (c) the conduct of the defendant after the cause of action arose, including the extent (if any) to which he responded to requests reasonably made by the plaintiff for information or inspection for the purpose of ascertaining facts which were or might be relevant to the plaintiff's cause of action against the defendant; ... (e) the extent to which the plaintiff acted promptly and reasonably once he knew whether or not the act or omission of the defendant, to which the injury was attributable, might be capable at that time of giving rise to an action for damages; (f) the steps, if any, taken by the plaintiff to obtain medical, legal or other expert advice and the nature of any such advice he may have received. ...” 41. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, signed by the respondent State on 30 March 2007 and ratified on 8 June 2009, aims to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity (Article 1 of the UN Convention). 42. Article 12 provides for equal recognition before the law and stipulates: “1. States Parties reaffirm that persons with disabilities have the right to recognition everywhere as persons before the law. 2. States Parties shall recognize that persons with disabilities enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. 3. States Parties shall take appropriate measures to provide access by persons with disabilities to the support they may require in exercising their legal capacity. 4. States Parties shall ensure that all measures that relate to the exercise of legal capacity provide for appropriate and effective safeguards to prevent abuse in accordance with international human rights law. Such safeguards shall ensure that measures relating to the exercise of legal capacity respect the rights, will and preferences of the person, are free of conflict of interest and undue influence, are proportional and tailored to the person's circumstances, apply for the shortest time possible and are subject to regular review by a competent, independent and impartial authority or judicial body. The safeguards shall be proportional to the degree to which such measures affect the person's rights and interests. 5. Subject to the provisions of this article, States Parties shall take all appropriate and effective measures to ensure the equal right of persons with disabilities to own or inherit property, to control their own financial affairs and to have equal access to bank loans, mortgages and other forms of financial credit, and shall ensure that persons with disabilities are not arbitrarily deprived of their property.” 43. Article 13 contains provisions on access to justice and provides, in so far as relevant: “1. States Parties shall ensure effective access to justice for persons with disabilities on an equal basis with others, including through the provision of procedural and age-appropriate accommodations, in order to facilitate their effective role as direct and indirect participants, including as witnesses, in all legal proceedings, including at investigative and other preliminary stages. ...”",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
145,001-23966,ENG,SVN,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,NADBISKUPIJA ZAGREBACKA v. SLOVENIA,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Mark Villiger,"The applicant, the Zagreb Archdiocese (Nadbiskupija Zagrebačka), is a juristic person whose seat is in Zagreb, Croatia. It is represented before the Court by Zvjezdana Znidarčić-Begović, a lawyer practising in Zagreb, Croatia. The facts of the case as submitted by the applicant may be summarised as follows. On 7 June 1993 the Zagreb Archdiocese, acting through its legal representative, lodged with the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Slovenia a claim for restitution of castle Mokrice, its outbuildings and surrounding estate together with related movables and works of art. It based its claim on sections 14 and 54 of the Denationalisation Act 1991. The castle and its estate are located on the territory of present-day Slovenia and were purchased in 1937 by the Zagreb Archdiocese Seminary. They were nationalized after the Second World War by Yugoslav authorities. In 1988, the castle and part of the estate were classified as Slovenian cultural and natural monuments. On 25 July 1994 the Ministry of Culture dismissed the claim for restitution on the ground that section 14 of the Denationalisation Act 1991 gave the right to restitution of expropriated property to “churches and other religious communities, their institutions and orders, operating on the territory of Slovenia” on 7 December 1991, the date of the entry into force of the Act. It was generally known, however, that at that time the Zagreb Archdiocese exercised its activities in Croatia. The Zagreb Archdiocese was therefore not entitled to restitution. Further, the Ministry of Culture separated and transferred a part of the claim concerning a part of the surrounding land and certain movables to the Municipality of Brežice as the competent authority. On 25 August 1994 the applicant instituted administrative litigation with the Supreme Court, asserting that the claim for the restitution of the property emanated from the Zagreb Archdiocese as part of the Catholic Church and the catholic religious community. It was clear that, regardless of its internal organisation, the Catholic Church was entitled to restitution under the Denationalisation Act 1991. Moreover, the Razkrižje parish, located on Slovenian territory, belonged, in ecclesiastical administrative terms, to the Zagreb Archdiocese. This meant that the Zagreb Archdiocese was “operating on Slovenian territory” within the meaning of section 14 of the Denationalisation Act 1991 and was therefore entitled to restitution. By a judgment of 23 January 1997, the Supreme Court rejected the applicant's claim and upheld the decision of the Ministry of Culture, holding that section 14 of the Denationalisation Act 1991, with special reference to the concept of “churches and other religious communities, their institutions and orders, operating on Slovenian territory”, should be interpreted narrowly. It transpired from that provision that it was not the universal Catholic Church but its constituent juristic persons operating on the territory of Slovenia and registered as religious communities under the Legal Status of Religious Communities in the Republic of Slovenia Act 1967 that were entitled to restitution. The Catholic Church, as a much wider entity, did not therefore satisfy this criterion. The Supreme Court also rejected the Zagreb Archdiocese's argument that the presence on Slovenian territory of a single parish belonging to the applicant in accordance with the internal organisation of the Catholic Church justified its claim to be operating on Slovenian territory. It held that this was not sufficient for the applicant to qualify as a Slovenian juristic person, since the greater part of its activities took place in another State where its seat was located and to the jurisdiction of which it was subject. On 9 May 1997 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal with the Constitutional Court, alleging that the Zagreb Archdiocese was a part of the Roman Catholic Church and that its internal organisation was regulated by the Code of canon law (Codex iuris canonici), promulgated on 25 January 1983. According to the provisions of this code, the supreme authority regulating the ownership of property was vested in the Pope. Since Article 7 of the Slovenian Constitution provided for the separation of Church and State and recognised their equality, this implied recognition of the internal organisation of the Catholic Church under the Code of canon law. There can consequently be no doubt that the Catholic Church was entitled to restitution. The decision of the Supreme Court, moreover, violated the right to own property, as protected by Article 67 of the Constitution. On 30 November 1999 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant's constitutional appeal inadmissible, on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to review application of the law by ordinary courts. It found that the applicant essentially contested the Supreme Court's refusal to take into account the Code of canon law in determining the applicant's right to restitution. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the law was reasoned and there was no indication that its conclusions were arbitrary or in breach of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The decision was served on the applicant's lawyer on 21 December 1999. 1. The Constitution (Ustava Republike Slovenije, Official Gazette no. 33/91) “The State and religious communities shall be separate. Religious communities shall enjoy equal rights; they shall pursue their activities freely. ” “The manner in which property is acquired and enjoyed shall be established by law so as to ensure its economic, social and environmental function. (...) ” 2. The Denationalisation Act 1991 (Zakon o denacionalizaciji, Official Journal no. 27/91, with amendments) At the time of the adoption of the Act, its sections 3, 4, 5, 10 and 13 limited the right to restitution of expropriated property to natural persons. The only exception were churches and religious communities, which were expressly recognised as beneficiaries under section 14 of the Act (see below). By the Constitutional Court's decision of 4 March 1993 (see below), the right to restitution was extended to all domestic juristic persons. “(...) The conditions and the mode of denationalisation are determined by this Act. ” “The right to recovery of property is hereby given to churches and other religious communities, their institutions and orders operating on the territory of the Republic of Slovenia at the time of the coming into effect of this Act. ” “ (...) 5. The Ministry of Culture shall decide on denationalisation of objects specified in (...) of this Act (...)” 3. The Constitutional Court's case-law On 4 March 1993 the Constitutional Court adopted a decision in a case brought by three legal persons (not party to the proceedings in this case) who challenged the constitutionality of several provisions of the Denationalisation Act 1991 (U-I-25/92). It declared that the restriction of the right to restitution to natural persons and only certain legal persons was unconstitutional. By altering the wording of sections 3, 4, 5, 10 and 13 of the Act, the Constitutional Court extended the right to restitution to all Slovenian legal persons. It held that section 14 thus acquired a new meaning. The Constitutional Court reasoned that: “...the provision of section 14 is no longer contrary to the Constitution, because it does no longer have the function of providing a legislative basis for denationalisation claims of churches and other religious communities, their institutions and orders. With the annulment (...) of the pertinent legislative provisions, this provision was given a different content. It only means that under this legislative provision the right to restitution of property is accorded only to those churches and other religious communities, their institutions and orders, that were operating on Slovenian territory at the time of the adoption of the Denationalisation Act 1991...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Françoise Tulkens;Ireneu Cabral Barreto;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria,"The applicants are Turkish nationals and at the time of their applications they were all but six in pre-trial detention in Diyarbakır F-type Prison. The names and dates of birth of the applicants appear in the appendix. They were all represented before the Court by Mr M. Şahin and Mr O. Çelik, lawyers practising in Diyarbakır. On 7 September 2006 the applicants announced a collective two-day hunger strike in protest against the conditions of detention of Abdullah Öcalan, leader of the PKK (the Workers’ Party of Kurdistan), an illegal, armed organisation. On 11 September 2006 the Diyarbakır F-type Prison Disciplinary Board imposed a disciplinary sanction on the applicants, consisting of a one-month ban on sports activities and conversation in groups (spor ve sohbet etkinlikleri), for launching a hunger strike and forming a group with a view to breaching the regulations. The applicants lodged appeals, which were rejected by the Diyarbakır Enforcement Court and the Diyarbakır Assize Court on 25 September and 9 October 2006 respectively. The final decision was deposited with the registry of the court on 10 November 2006. Law no. 5275 on the Enforcement of Sentences and Preventive Measures provides as follows: Article 40 “1. The penalty of a deprivation of certain activities deprives convicts of the right to participate in the prison workshops and sports activities from one to three months. 2.

147,001-57524,ENG,BEL,CHAMBER,1967,"CASE ""RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE LAWS ON THE USE OF LANGUAGES IN EDUCATION IN BELGIUM"" v. BELGIUM",2,Preliminary objection rejected (incompatibility),,"1. The object of the Commission’s request is to submit the case to the Court, so that the Court may decide whether or not certain provisions of the Belgian linguistic legislation relating to education are in conformity with the requirements of Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention and Article 2 of the First Protocol (P1-2). The Commission’s provisional submissions on the merits of the case are set out in paragraph 33 of its first memorial. 2. The Applicants, who are parents of families of Belgian nationality, applied to the Commission both on their own behalf and on behalf of their children under age, of whom there are more than 800. Pointing out that they are French-speaking or that they express themselves most frequently in French, they want their children to be educated in that language. Alsemberg, Beersel, Antwerp, Ghent, Louvain and Vilvorde, where the signatories of five of the six Applications (Nos. 1474/62, 1691/62, 1769/63, 1994/63, and 2126/64) live, belong to the region considered by law as Dutch-speaking, whereas Kraainem (Application No. 1677/62) has since 1963 formed part of a separate administrative district with a ""special status"". In all of these districts (""communes"") part of the population - in some cases a large part - is French-speaking. 3. Though the six Applications differ on a number of points, they are similar in many respects. For the purposes of this judgment it is sufficient to note that in substance they complain that the Belgian State: - does not provide any French-language education in the municipalities where the Applicants live or, in the case of Kraainem, that the provision made for such education is, in their opinion, inadequate; - withholds grants from any institutions in the said municipalities which may fail to comply with the linguistic provisions of the legislation for schools; - refuses to homologate leaving certificates issued by such institutions; - does not allow the Applicants’ children to attend the French classes which exist in certain places; - thereby obliges the Applicants either to enrol their children in local schools, a solution which they consider contrary to their aspirations, or to send them to school in the ""Greater Brussels district"", where the language of instruction is Dutch or French according to the child’s mother-tongue or usual language or in the ""French-speaking region"" (Walloon area). Such ""scholastic emigration"" is said to entail serious risks and hardships. In the main the Applicants complain that they and their children have suffered violation of certain Articles of the Convention and the Protocol as a result of being subjected to various provisions of the Act of 14th July 1932 ""on language regulations in primary and intermediate education"", the Act of 15th July 1932 ""on the conferring of academic degrees"", the Acts of 27th July 1955 and 29th May 1959, the Act of 30th July 1963 ""on language regulations in education"" and the Act of 2nd August 1963 ""on the use of languages in administrative matters"". The Acts of 14th and 15th July 1932 were repealed by the Act of 30th July 1963, but were still in force when the Alsemberg, Beersel, Kraainem, Antwerp and Ghent Applicants brought their cases before the Commission, and those Applicants still challenge these acts while at the same time attacking the present legislation. 4. Before the Commission, the Applicants complained of violations of Articles 8, 9, 10 and 14 (art. 8, art. 9, art. 10, art. 14) of the Convention and Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2). The Belgian Government, for its part, pleaded that the legislation in dispute fully respects or respected those Articles, and it therefore asked the Commission to declare the Applications inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded (Article 27 (2) of the Convention) (art. 27-2). The Commission did in fact, for that reason, reject the complaints which the Applicants (with the exception of those of Vilvorde) based on Articles 9 and 10 (art. 9, art. 10); on the other hand, it considered the six Applications admissible in so far as they alleged violations of Articles 8 and 14 (art. 8, art. 14) of the Convention and Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2). The decisions on this point were given on various dates between 26th July 1963 and 29th June 1964. 5. The Commission having decided to join the six Applications, a single Sub-Commission ascertained the facts by examining the Applications together with the parties and tried to arrange a friendly settlement between the parties (Articles 28 and 29) (art. 28, art. 29). This attempt failed, and the plenary Commission therefore drew up a report as required under Article 31 (art. 31). The report was adopted on 24th June 1965 and transmitted to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 25th June. That same day the Commission brought the case before the Court under Article 48 (a) (art. 48-a) of the Convention. 6. Summarising the opinion expressed in its report, the Commission recalled in paragraph 7 of its first memorial that it took the view: ""- by 9 votes to 3, that the legislation complained of was not incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol (P1-2), considered in isolation; - unanimously, that the legislation was not incompatible with the second sentence of the said article (P1-2), considered in isolation or in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention; - by 10 votes to 2, that the legislation was not incompatible, in the case of the Applicants, with Article 8 (art. 8) of the Convention, considered in isolation or in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+8); - by 9 votes to 3, that the general system of education in the areas which are unilingual by law was not incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, considered in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention; - by 11 votes to 1, that the same was true of the ""special status"" conferred by Section 7 of the Act of 2nd August 1963 on six bilingual communes, of which Kraainem, on the periphery of Brussels, is one; - by 7 votes to 5, that the Acts of 1963 were incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, read in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention, in so far as they result in the total withdrawal of subsidies from provincial, commune and private schools providing, in the form of non-subsidised classes and in addition to instruction given in the language prescribed by the language legislation, complete or partial education in another language; - unanimously, that the conditions on which children whose parents live outside the Greater Brussels district may be enrolled in schools in that district (Section 17 of the Act of 30th July 1963) were not, in the case of the Applicants, incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, read in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention; - that the Acts of 1963 were incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, read in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention, in so far as they prevent certain children, solely on the basis of their parents’ place of residence, from attending French-language schools at Louvain (8 votes to 4) and in the above-mentioned six communes on the periphery of Brussels (7 votes to 5); - by 8 votes to 4, that the legislation complained of was also incompatible with the first sentence of Article 2 of the Protocol, read in conjunction with Article 14 (art. 14+P1-2) of the Convention, in so far as it has resulted, since 1932, in a refusal to homologate certificates relating to secondary schooling not in accordance with the language requirements."" Altogether, of the 12 members of the Commission concerned in the adoption of the report, three found no breach by the Belgian State of its obligations, while the majority considered that there had been a breach on three counts, but none on the others. The size and composition of the majorities on the various questions varied appreciably; moreover, the majorities on some questions embodied more than one point of view. Therefore the Commission’s report also sets out a number of individual opinions - some concurring, some dissenting. 7. In its first memorial the Commission pointed out that its decision to refer the matter to the Court had been unanimous. Among its reasons for taking this step it particularly stressed the legal importance and complexity of the case and its human and social aspects. 8. During the written proceedings the following submissions were made with regard to the preliminary objection raised by the Belgian Government: - by the Government in its first memorial: ""1. The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Protocol secure the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms expressly mentioned in Articles 2-13 (art. 2, art. 3, art. 4, art. 5, art. 6, art. 7, art. 8, art. 9, art. 10, art. 11, art. 12, art. 13) of the Convention and Articles 1-3 of the Protocol (P1-1, P1-2, P1-3). 2. The idea of ""national minority"" within the meaning of Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention may benefit the members of a specified social group where there is a violation of a right of freedom guaranteed in the Convention or the Protocol. 3. However, in these cases, the Convention affords no such protection, since (a) the right to education in one’s own language is not included among the rights and freedoms enshrined in the Convention and the Protocol; a fortiori there is no guarantee of the right to subsidies for education in one’s own language or to admission to all occupations on the strength of such education; (b) as a subsidiary argument, the ""Applicants"" do not belong to a ""national minority"" within the meaning of Article 14 (art. 14) of the Convention; (c) it follows that the Court is ratione materiae not competent to examine the merits of the dispute submitted to it. May it please the Court (a) to admit the Belgian Government’s preliminary objection and dismiss the legal action brought against the Government; (b) alternatively, to join the preliminary objection to the merits."" - by the Commission in its second memorial ""The Commission invites the Court to reject the objection raised by the Belgian Government""; - by the Government in its second memorial ""The Belgian Government confirms the submissions stated by it at the end of its first memorial and reserves the right to supplement and amend them in subsequent proceedings"". 9. At the hearing on 21st November 1966, the following submissions were made: - by the Commission: ""The Commission ... requests the Court to reject the preliminary objection"". - by the Belgian Government: ""The Government’s preliminary objection should be accepted and the Applicants’ complaints rejected. Purely subsidiary, the Government requests that its preliminary objection be joined to the merits. It reserves the right to supplement and amend its submissions in the course of these proceedings"". At the hearing on 22nd November 1966 the Commission made the following submissions: ‘The Commission upholds its request that the Court now reject the preliminary objection raised by the Belgian Government. ""With regard to the Government’s alternative submission that the objection be joined to the merits we do not wish to express an opinion. We leave this point to the wisdom of the Court"". At the hearing on 23rd November 1966, the Belgian Government asked the Court by way of final submissions: - to accept the preliminary objection and - alternatively, to join it to the merits. The Commission for its part stated, before the hearing closed, that it upheld its submission ""in full"".",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
148,001-23056,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,CAGLAYAN v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress,"The applicant, İbrahim Cağlayan, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1952 and lives in Istanbul. He was represented before the Court by Mr Kocak, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. In 1992, the General Directorate of National Roads and Highways (Devlet Karayolları Genel Müdürlüğü), a state body responsible, inter alia, for motorway construction, expropriated a plot of land belonging to the applicant in İstanbul. A committee of experts assessed the value of the plot of land and this amount was paid to the applicant when the expropriation took place. On 25 November 1997, following the applicant’s request for increased compensation, the Pendik Civil Court of General Jurisdiction awarded him an additional compensation of 1,479,600,000 Turkish liras (TRL) plus an interest at the statutory rate of 30 % per annum. On 9 March 1998 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the firstinstance court. The due amount, which was 2,501,918,000 Turkish liras (TRL) including the interest, was paid to the applicant on 26 May 1998. Under Law no. 3095 of 4 December 1984 the rate of interest on overdue State debts was set at 30% per annum. As of 1 January 1998 the statutory rate of interest was increased to 50%. The statutory rate of interest was set at the compound interest rate, namely 60% as of 1 January 2000. A description of further relevant domestic law may be found in the Aka v. Turkey, judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, §§ 17-25; Akkuş v. Turkey, judgment of 9 July 1997, Reports 1997-IV, §§ 13-16.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
149,001-23674,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,KUSTILA and OKSIO v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The first applicant is Mr Marko Kustila, a Finnish national, who was born in 1962 and was serving a prison sentence at the time of the application. The second applicant is Mr Jukka Oksio, a Finnish national who was born in 1967 and was serving a prison sentence at the time of the application. They are represented before the Court by Mr Jaakko Tuutti, a lawyer practising in Tampere, Finland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. The first applicant had been detained pending a criminal trial concerning – amongst others – two serious drug offences. On 5 July 2000, at the end of the hearing, the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) of Jyväskylä informed the parties that it had decided to reserve the judgment until 12 July 2000. The public prosecutor demanded a sentence of seven years imprisonment and that the first applicant should remain in detention pending the delivery of the judgment. The District Court ordered that the first applicant be detained pending the delivery of the judgment, basing the detention on Sections 26 and 26a of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation (pakkokeinolaki, tvångsmedelslag; 450/1987). It held, inter alia, as follows: “Because the District Court has in its decision after the end of the principal hearing notified the date of the reserved judgment, the grounds for K.’s [the first applicant’s] detention are based on the principles supporting section 26 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation. K., who has been detained throughout from 21 May 2000, has been charged with offences for which, if proven guilty as charged, he will clearly, according to normal case law, be sentenced to imprisonment for longer than two years. Without prejudice to the length of the final imprisonment sentence and taking into consideration that the reserved judgment will be given in less than one week’s time, the arguments presented in favour of K. do not disclose that his detention is excessive.” On the same day (5 July 2000) the first applicant applied to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) of Vaasa, claiming that his detention was unlawful and demanding the District Court’s decision to be quashed as well as his immediate release. He claimed that the District Court could not have based its decision on Section 26 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation, because he had not yet been sentenced as required by that provision. He also maintained that Finnish legislation did not contain any basis for detention of a defendant in a case where the hearing had been closed and the judgment reserved and invoked Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. On 7 July 2000 the Court of Appeal of Vaasa quashed the District Court’s decision to detain the first applicant and ordered his immediate release. The Court of Appeal reasoned its decision, inter alia, as follows: “Because K. had not been sentenced at the end of the principal hearing on 5 July 2000, he could not have been ordered to remain detained pursuant to Section 26 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation.” On 12 July 2000 the District Court of Jyväskylä sentenced the first applicant to five years’ imprisonment. It also ordered the arrest of the first applicant, who had gone missing after his release on 7 July 2000. On 11 July 2000 the first applicant meanwhile applied to the District Court of Tampere, claiming compensation under the Act on Compensation by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons. The District Court rejected the applicant’s claims on 10 November 2000, referring to section 2 of that Act. It held, inter alia, as follows: “It is undisputed in the case that K. was detained during the time mentioned in his application for summons. It is also undisputed that the Court of Appeal of Vaasa released K. because it was not possible to keep K. detained on the grounds that the public prosecutor put forward and on which the District Court had made the decision, i.e. pursuant to Section 26 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation. Therefore, the detention was not based on the grounds on which the public prosecutor and the District Court justified the detention. ... Taking into account the seriousness of the offences that underlie the detention of K., his guilt as stated in the judgment and the length of the imposed penalty, it would be excessive to oblige the State to pay K. compensation for the deprivation of his liberty. Compensation would be excessive also because he was deprived of his liberty for only two days and because this time has been subtracted from the sentenced imprisonment according to Section 11 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Code. Because of K.’s guilt the deprivation period cannot be deemed to cause him such mental suffering as would be the case if an innocent person had been detained.” The Court of Appeal of Turku upheld the District Court’s judgment on 24 April 2001. The Court of Appeal reasoned its judgment, inter alia, as follows: “As the District Court has maintained, there were no legal grounds for K.’s detention during 5 July – 7 July 2000. However, on 12 July 2000 K. was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for the crimes that initially led to his detention, and ordered to be taken into custody. K. has subsequently been avoiding the implementation of the sentence and a warrant for his arrest has been issued. Therefore it would be excessive to oblige the State to pay him compensation for his short term detention. Further, because it cannot be maintained that K.’s liberty has been restricted in an arbitrary fashion or without justification, he is not entitled to compensation on the basis of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms either.” In a letter dated 11 November 2000 the first applicant asked the police to investigate whether the judge and laymen of the District Court of Jyväskylä had committed a crime when they ordered his detention. On 14 November 2000 the police sent a report to the Chancellor of Justice and informed him that a criminal investigation would not commence before the Chancellor of Justice had examined the matter. On 18 April 2001 the Deputy Chancellor of Justice noted in his decision that there was no directly applicable statute in the law concerning detention of an accused by a court when reserving a judgment to a later date. He concluded however that both the District Court and the Court of Appeal had erred as the defendant could, and should have, been detained, under Section 23 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation. According to the Deputy Chancellor of Justice, that interpretation of law had been accepted by the Court of Appeal in similar cases. He did not find any grounds for prosecution in the case. The second applicant was serving a term of imprisonment in an open prison when on 23 September 1997 he was taken in police custody to a police station as suspected of another crime. Some time later he was transferred to the Hämeenlinna Central Prison, from which he was transferred to a prison in Köyliö on 5 November 1997. On 31 December 1998 a public prosecutor decided not to press further charges against the second applicant. On 31 May 1999 the second applicant filed a suit against the State under the Act on Compensation by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons. He demanded, inter alia, compensation for non-pecuniary damages caused by his detention from 23 September 1997 to 5 November 1997. On 18 October 1999 the District Court rejected the second applicant’s claims. It reasoned its decision, inter alia, as follows: “Even though [the second applicant’s] liberty and possibilities to act were de facto restricted to a greater degree due to his transferral to the police jail compared to the conditions in an open prison establishment, [the second applicant] was also nevertheless a prisoner in the open prison. As [the second applicant] was already imprisoned and as transferral to a different kind of prison does not require compensation pursuant to the Act on Compensation by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons, and as [the second applicant] cannot be considered as equivalent to a detained or convicted innocent person or to a person subject to an injunction order, the District Court holds that the State is not obliged to pay [the second applicant] compensation for any possible non-pecuniary damage caused by the transferral to a police jail.” The second applicant complained to the Court of Appeal which, on 5 October 2000, upheld the District Court’s judgment. The Supreme Court refused the second applicant leave to appeal on 30 July 2001. Section 23 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation (693/1997), as in force at the time of the events, provided: “When the court cancels or defers the principal hearing in a case where the defendant has been detained, the court has to examine and assess whether there are reasons to keep the defendant detained.” Section 23 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation was amended on 27 June 2003 (646/2003). The new section entered into force on 1 January 2004 and it provides: “When the court cancels or defers the principal hearing or orders a new principal hearing in a case where the defendant has been detained, the court has to examine and assess whether there are reasons to keep the defendant detained. However, the question of detention does not have to be re-examined or reassessed during the time when the principal hearing has been deferred due to a mental examination of one of the defendants in the case. The court must also rule on the question of detaining the defendant, if the court does not deliver its judgment directly after the principal hearing.” Section 26 of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation (213/1995) states: “The court may detain a person convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, or order the continuation such a person’s detention, if: (1) the defendant has been sentenced to at least two years imprisonment.” Section 26a of Chapter 1 of the Act on Coercive Means of Criminal Investigation (213/1995) provides: “Nobody may be detained or ordered to continue to be detained if the detention would be excessive due to the nature of the case, the suspect’s or sentenced person’s age or due to other personal circumstances of the person in question.” Section 1 of the Act on Compensation by the State for the Deprivation of the Liberty of Detained or Convicted Innocent Persons (1974/422) provides: “A person who has been arrested or detained as a suspect for a crime has a right to compensation from the State, if: (1) a criminal investigation has ended without a criminal charge being brought; (2) a criminal charge is withdrawn or dismissed; (3) he or she has been found guilty of an offence which did not justify arrest or detention, or; (4) there was no legal basis for the arrest or detention. There is no right to compensation if the deprivation of liberty has not exceeded twenty-four hours.” Section 2 of the above-mentioned Act (1974/422) states:",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
150,001-72345,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,WIACEK v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Jan Wiącek, is a Polish national who was born in 1950 and lives in Nowa Słupia, Poland. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was a party to civil proceedings concerning a claim for division of marital co-ownership. On 6 September 2000 a hearing took place before the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski District Court (Sąd Rejonowy). The judge heard the applicant and dictated his replies to the court clerk, who was taking minutes of the hearing. As the judge’s instructions to the clerk differed considerably from what the applicant was saying and as the judge repeatedly interrupted the applicant in his statements, the applicant expressed his objections. However, this was to no avail. Eventually the applicant said: “I should reply, not the court”. The judge became angry and warned the applicant that a fine could be imposed on him. The records of the hearing first relate the applicant’s statements concerning the subject matter of the case. Then it reads as follows: “The presiding judge warned the [applicant] not to make any comments to the court and warned him that a fine would be imposed on him if he continued to do so. Thereupon the [applicant] says: “If it is necessary, I will pay”. The court holds that a fine of PLN 500 be imposed on the [applicant]. “ On 12 September 2000 the applicant appealed to the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) against the imposition of the fine. On 12 October 2000 the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski District Court (Sąd Rejonowy), invoking the Act of 20 June 1985, rejected the applicant’s appeal, considering that the domestic law did not provide for a possibility to appeal against such a decision. On 9 November 2000 the applicant lodged an interim appeal against this decision. On 10 November 2000 the District Court rejected the applicant’s appeal as lodged outside the prescribed time limit. On 29 November 2000 the applicant applied for leave to file an appeal out of time. His motion was dismissed on 24 April 2001. On 14 September 2000 the applicant lodged a request with the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski District Court to rectify the minutes of the hearing of 6 September 2000. He submitted that during that hearing he had said, reacting to the court’s interruptions and interference with the contents of his statements: “I should reply, not the court.” This statement had not been recorded in the minutes of the hearing. Consequently, the actual circumstances in which the presiding judge decided to impose a fine on the applicant were not reflected in the minutes, as required by Article 158 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure. On 13 October 2000 the court refused to rectify the minutes. The court considered it to be sufficient that the court’s reaction to the applicant’s conduct was reflected in the minutes of the hearing, and that therefore the minutes were exact. On 9 November 2000 the applicant appealed against this decision. He reiterated that the minutes of the hearing did not reflect the actual conduct of the hearing in that his statement was not noted. As a result, they contained the presiding judge’s warning about the imposition of a fine, but no information as to the reason which had prompted this reaction on the part of the judge. The applicant stated that this was illogical. He further stressed that he had not said anything that could have been construed as either insulting to the court, or not linked to the subject-matter of the civil case. The court’s failure to dictate the parties’ statements so that the minutes reflected exactly what was said amounted to a procedural breach, which could negatively affect the substantive outcome of the case. On 22 December 2000 the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski District Court dismissed his appeal. The court reiterated the reasons invoked in the first-instance decision of 13 October 2000. It was further stated that according to the case-law of the Supreme Court, the court was not obliged to include in the minutes of a hearing all the statements of the parties, in particular those which were not related to the subject-matter of the proceedings. On 7 February 2003 the Ostrowiec Świętokrzyski District Court of its own motion gave a decision and quashed its decision of 12 October 2000. The court held that on 1 October 2001 the new act on the legal structure of the courts entered into force. According to Section 50 of the new act it was possible to file an appeal against a decision imposing a fine for contempt of court. The court considered that the change of law was of such importance that it justified quashing the decision of 12 October 2000 even though it had been delivered under the 1985 Act. On 22 July 2003 the Ostrowiec Świetokrzyski District Court ordered the return to the applicant of the fine paid by him. On 23 July 2003, 500 PLN was transferred to the applicant’s bank account. Section 43 § 1 of the Act of 20 June 1985 (“the 1985 Act”) on the legal structure of the courts (Prawo o ustroju sądów powszechnych), provides inter alia that the court may impose a disciplinary penalty, a fine or a prison sentence, on a person who, at a court session, behaves in an abusive manner or disturbs the public order. Under Section 44 § 1 of the Act, no appeal is available against a decision to impose such a penalty. On 1 October 2001 the new act on the legal structure of the courts entered into force. According to Section 50 of the new act it is possible to file an appeal against a decision to impose a penalty for contempt of court. On 3 July 2002 the Constitutional Court gave judgment (No. SK 31/01) and declared unconstitutional Section 44 § 1 of the 1985 Act. It found that this provision was not in compliance with article 78 (right to appeal) and article 176 § 1 (right to two court instances) of the Constitution. Article 380 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides: “The second-instance court shall, upon a motion by a party, examine all those rulings of the court of first-instance which were not subject to interlocutory appeal but which had an effect on the determination of the case.” Article 79 § 1 of the Constitution provides as follows: “In accordance with principles specified by statute, everyone whose constitutional freedoms or rights have been infringed, shall have the right to appeal to the Constitutional Court for a judgment on the conformity with the Constitution of a statute or another normative act on the basis of which a court or an administrative authority has issued a final decision on his freedoms or rights or on his obligations specified in the Constitution.” “1. Judgments of the Constitutional Court shall be universally binding and final. 2. Judgments of the Constitutional Court, ... shall be published without delay. 3. A judgment of the Constitutional Court shall take effect from the day of its publication; however, the Constitutional Court may specify another date for the end of the binding force of a normative act. Such time-limit may not exceed 18 months in relation to a statute or 12 months in relation to any other normative act. ... 4. A judgment of the Constitutional Court on the non-conformity with the Constitution, an international agreement or statute, of a normative act on the basis of which a final and enforceable judicial decision or a final administrative decision ... was given, shall be a basis for re-opening of the proceedings, or for quashing the decision ... in a manner and on principles specified in provisions applicable to the given proceedings.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
151,001-57742,ENG,BEL,CHAMBER,1992,CASE OF KOLOMPAR v. BELGIUM,3,Preliminary objection rejected (non-exhaustion);No violation of Art. 5-1;No violation of Art. 5-4,,"6. Having been extradited from Belgium to Italy, Mr Djula Kolompar was released from prison on 27 December 1990; he currently resides in Amsterdam. 7. On 13 June 1980 the Florence Assize Court sentenced him in absentia to eighteen years’ imprisonment, having convicted him of, inter alia, attempted rape and attempted murder committed on 24 December 1977. 8. By a judgment of 8 May 1981, which became final a month later, the Florence Assize Court of Appeal, also giving judgment in absentia, reduced the prison sentence to ten years; the accused had been declared untraceable (irreperibile) and then to be evading arrest (latitante). Pursuant to a Presidential Decree of 1978, the Florence Assize Court of Appeal and the Court of Appeal itself granted the applicant, on 23 November 1981 and 8 March 1982, remission of sentence amounting to a total of a little over two and a half years. 9. In 1982 Italy requested the Netherlands authorities to extradite the applicant. This request was refused following an unfavourable opinion from the Rotterdam District Court (Arrondissementsrechtbank) of 14 October 1982; the Rotterdam court took the view that the applicant’s right to defend himself had not been respected. 10. In May 1983 Italy made a similar request to Belgium, where Mr Kolompar was then staying. 11. On 7 March 1984 the judgment of 8 May 1981 and the warrant for his arrest as a convicted person (ordine di carcerazione di condannato) issued by the principal public prosecutor at the Florence Court of Appeal on 13 March 1982, together with an official Dutch translation of those documents, were served on the applicant by a bailiff in accordance with the Belgian Extradition Act of 15 March 1874 (""the 1874 Act"") and the Belgian-Italian extradition treaty of 15 January 1875. The bailiff’s writ stated that the applicant would be detained with a view to his extradition. 12. On 22 January 1984 Mr Kolompar had been arrested in Belgium on suspicion of aggravated theft and attempted theft committed in that country; the following day an Antwerp investigating judge had remanded him in custody in respect of these charges. The investigating judge revoked his detention order on 11 April 1984, but the applicant remained in custody in connection with the extradition proceedings (see paragraph 11 above). 13. On 4 January 1985 the Antwerp Criminal Court sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment for the offences committed in Belgium. This judgment was upheld by the Antwerp Court of Appeal, whose judgment of 25 April 1985 became final a month later. By a letter of 4 June 1985 the Minister of Justice informed the applicant that, on account of the period that he had spent in detention since 22 January 1984 (see paragraph 12 above), the prison term was to be deemed to have been completed on 20 January 1985. 14. Following a favourable opinion from the indictments chamber (Kamer van Inbeschuldigingstelling) of the Antwerp Court of Appeal on 24 April 1984, on 2 May the Belgium Minister of Justice authorised Mr Kolompar’s extradition to Italy. 15. On 29 October 1984 the applicant asked the Minister to reconsider his decision and to stay the execution of the extradition order in the meantime. He invoked the opinion of the Rotterdam District Court of 14 October 1982 (see paragraph 9 above). On 13 December 1984 he requested the Minister to confirm in writing that he had stated during a meeting with the applicant’s lawyer on 7 December 1984 that he was prepared to grant an application for a stay of execution of the extradition order. 16. On 17 December 1984 the Minister replied to him that the extradition was a matter for the Italian authorities, who might possibly withdraw their request. He advised the applicant to apply to those authorities without delay in that connection, adding that, if the applicant so requested, he could stay the execution of the extradition order; the duration of such a measure could not however exceed a reasonable time. 17. By letter of 2 January 1985 Mr Kolompar again asked the Minister of Justice to stay the execution of the extradition decision. In support of his request he provided statements from various witnesses, according to which he had been in Denmark on 24 December 1977, the date of the offences for which he had been convicted in Italy. 18. The Minister contacted the Italian authorities. He drew their attention to the applicant’s version of events and asked them to state whether they wished to maintain their extradition request. 19. On 28 March 1985 the Director of the Rome extraditions department replied to the above query in the affirmative. He stressed that if there was any new evidence it could serve as the basis for an application for retrial of the case (Article 553 of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure). On 4 April 1985 the Minister sent to the applicant a copy of this letter, notifying him that the extradition procedure would be continued as soon as it was no longer necessary to keep him at the disposal of the Belgian authorities for the offences committed in Belgium (see paragraph 13 above). 20. On 21 June 1985 Mr Kolompar wrote to the Minister of Justice to ask him to obtain from Interpol’s Copenhagen office information which he had himself unsuccessfully sought from the Danish consulate general in Rotterdam. As a result the Minister instructed the Antwerp public prosecutor’s office to determine the accuracy of the applicant’s claims concerning his one-time presence in Denmark (see paragraph 17 above). A message from Interpol-Copenhagen to Interpol-Brussels of 14 August 1985 indicated that the Danish police had questioned the applicant on 12 April 1978 when he had been in custody in Gentofte in connection with alleged forgery, attempted theft and receiving stolen goods. He had stated that he had entered Denmark on 10 April 1978 and that it was the first time that he had visited the country. In June 1978 his wife had affirmed that she had herself arrived in the country on 23 May 1978 and that her family had lived for a long time near Rome. However, another Yugoslavian national, probably residing in the Netherlands, had maintained in May 1978 that the couple were living in Italy at the time and that the applicant had visited him on several occasions. A Danish police- officer claimed to remember Mr Kolompar but could not certify that he had seen him on 24 December 1977. The text of the message was transmitted to the Antwerp criminal police on 16 August 1985; on 17 September 1985 the principal public prosecutor’s office of that town sent to the Minister of Justice a report on the information obtained from Interpol-Copenhagen. 21. In the meantime Mr Kolompar, having been advised orally that his extradition could take place on 25 June 1985, submitted an application for his release to the committals chamber (Raadkamer) of the Antwerp First-Instance Court on 15 June, founded essentially on the alleged unlawfulness of such a measure. 22. By an order of 21 June the committals chamber declared the application inadmissible; the applicant appealed immediately, relying on Articles 3, 5 and 6 para. 1 (art. 3, art. 5, art. 6-1) of the Convention. In addition, he requested the Minister of Justice, again on 21 June, to stay the execution of the extradition order pending a final decision on his application of 15 June. On 24 June the Minister sent by telex instructions to this effect to the principal public prosecutor’s office in Antwerp. The applicant’s lawyer was notified of this by telephone. On 5 July 1985 the indictments chamber of the Antwerp Court of Appeal confirmed the order of 21 June 1985 on the ground, inter alia, that it was not empowered to order the applicant’s release. It noted that the fourth subsection of section 5 of the 1874 Act, which provided for the possibility of applying to the investigating authorities for release, ceased to apply once the detainee had been placed at the disposal of the Government with a view to extradition. It added that the provisions of the Convention cited by Mr Kolompar did not in themselves confer on it jurisdiction to rule on the matter. 23. On 8 October 1985 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal filed on 8 July. It found that no grounds had been validly and usefully submitted and took the view that the indictments chamber had complied with the essential procedural requirements or the formalities whose disregard entailed nullity and that its decision was lawful. 24. On 17 September 1985 the applicant filed an urgent application with the President of the Brussels First-Instance Court seeking an order prohibiting his extradition, which, he contended, would be contrary to Articles 6 para. 1, 3 and 14 (art. 6-1, art. 3, art. 14) of the Convention on account, inter alia, of the incompatibility of the proceedings conducted against him in Italy with the Convention; he requested further his immediate release on the ground that his detention was also unlawful for the reasons which his lawyer had given before the indictments chamber of the Antwerp Court of Appeal on 5 July 1985 (see paragraph 22 above). By a letter of 4 November 1985 the Minister of Justice drew the attention of the Antwerp principal public prosecutor’s office to the desirability of staying the execution of the extradition order until a final decision had been given on Mr Kolompar’s application. The Belgian State filed its submissions on 24 December 1985; Mr Kolompar submitted his at a hearing held on 19 March 1986. On 21 March the President of the Brussels First-Instance Court found that it was not necessary to make an urgent ruling. He noted that under the first paragraph of Article 584 of the Judicial Code he was empowered to give ""a provisional ruling where he [recognised] that there was urgency, in all matters except those which are excluded by law from the competence of the courts"" and that, according to academic writers and the case-law, this jurisdiction extended to cases of unlawful acts by the authorities (onrechtmatige overheidsdaad). In the present case, however, the contested detention did not represent such an act because it had been lawfully and properly ordered in the context of extradition proceedings in accordance with the Act of 15 March 1874 and the Belgian-Italian extradition treaty of 15 January 1875. As far as the extradition was concerned, the President considered that it was not for him to determine whether the applicant’s conviction by the Florence Assize Court had infringed the Convention. He added that the applicant could, as the Director of the Rome extraditions department had pointed out (see paragraph 19 above), file an application for a retrial if the conditions set out in Article 553 of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure were satisfied. 25. After the Belgian State had served this order on Mr Kolompar, the latter filed an appeal against it by a document lodged with the registry of the Brussels Court of Appeal on 12 June 1986. By a letter registered on 19 June he requested that the case be heard at a later date. The Belgian State filed its submissions on 19 November 1986, but the proceedings remained pending. The Belgian lawyer appointed to represent the applicant had withdrawn his services pending payment of an advance. His client claimed that he was not in a position to pay, but he had not informed the authorities of this and had not requested legal aid. 26. By a letter from his lawyer, dated 13 September 1987, the applicant informed the Minister of Justice that he no longer opposed his extradition in view of the length of the proceedings instituted both at national and international level, and that he waived his right to rely on the undertaking not to hand him over to Italy pending the outcome of the appeals lodged in Belgium. Twelve days later Mr Kolompar was extradited to Italy. He was released from prison there on 27 December 1990 under an amnesty.",[],[],[],['5'],"['5-1', '5-4']",[],0

The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Y. Zaytsev. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 21 August 1999 the Tsentralno-Gorodskoy District Court of Gorlovka awarded the applicant 1,438 Ukrainian hryvnias in compensation for damage caused to his property by a privately owned company, “Z.”. That judgment became final and the State Bailiffs’ Service instituted proceedings to enforce it.

In this regard on 4 November 2003 the State Bailiffs’ Service terminated the enforcement proceedings against the debtor company and transferred the applicant’s writ of enforcement to the liquidation commission for further processing. The applicant complained to various State authorities about lengthy non-enforcement of the judgment in his favour, but to no avail. However, he did not sue the State Bailiffs’ Service for its alleged inactivity or omissions. The judgment of 21 August 1999 remains unenforced.

The applicant was born in 1930 and lives in Slatina. He is retired. 7. On 7 August 2001 he lodged a criminal complaint against E.I., claiming that she had stolen certain items from his flat. He stated that E.I. regularly came to his flat to clean it and that on 20 January 2001 she had removed several items of jewellery and clothing from his flat. He had only realised in July 2001 that those items had disappeared from his flat. 8. The case was heard by the Drăgăşani District Court, which delivered its first-instance judgment on 14 January 2002 finding E.I. guilty and sentencing her to three months’ imprisonment, suspended. E.I. was ordered to pay the applicant damages of 10,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL – approximately 350 euros (EUR) at the time), representing the estimated value of the stolen items, and ROL 2,500,000 (approximately EUR 90) in legal fees. The District Court based its decision on the statements of the parties and of two witnesses. According to one of the witnesses, the applicant had complained to him in July 2001 that several items were missing from his flat. According to the second witness, in February 2001 the defendant had shown him several items of jewellery and clothing, mentioning that she had received them as a gift from the applicant. 9. On 1 April 2002 the Vâlcea County Court dismissed an appeal by E.I. and the judgment of 14 January 2002 thus became final and enforceable. 10. On an unspecified date the Prosecutor General of Romania lodged an extraordinary appeal (recurs in anulare) against the judgment of 14 January 2002. The Prosecutor General argued that E.I. had been wrongfully convicted, as none of the evidence adduced was conclusive as to her guilt. This had led to a breach of her right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. The prosecutor also indicated that E.I. had submitted two pieces of evidence as part of her defence which had been ignored in the ordinary proceedings. One of the documents was a request lodged by the applicant to the owners’ association in which he sought an exemption from utility costs for the period December 2000-April 2001, when he would be away in the United Kingdom. This document was relevant, as the applicant stated that E.I. entered his flat only when he was there and he had declared that the items had been stolen on the exact date of 20 January 2001, when, according to that document, he was not in Romania. The second document was a report of a search conducted by the police at the home of the defendant, which indicated that none of the items claimed to have been stolen from the applicant’s flat had been found there. 11. In a decision of 4 November 2003 the High Court of Cassation and Justice allowed the extraordinary appeal, quashed the judgments of 14 January and 1 April 2002, acquitted E.I. and relieved her of the obligation to pay the applicant compensation for the stolen items and the legal costs. The court held that the prior conviction had been based on the statements of two witnesses who declared that they knew that E.I. was doing housework for the applicant, that he owned the items mentioned in his criminal complaint and that after 20 January 2001 some of the items were seen by one of the witnesses in the house of E.I. Nevertheless, the court indicated that these statements were contradicted by the evidence in the case file indicating that the applicant had been away from Romania between December 2000 and April 2001. Furthermore, taking into account that he had always stated that E.I. only did housework in his flat when he was there, the court indicated that his submission that he had not noticed E.I. leaving the flat with so many items was not credible. The court further concluded that the evidence adduced in the case was both contradictory and inconclusive in respect of the date the alleged theft was committed and of whether the defendant had committed the theft. It therefore quashed the earlier decisions on the ground that they had not been lawful and acquitted E.I. of all charges, relieving her also of the obligation to pay compensation for the stolen items and for the court costs incurred by the applicant. 12. The applicant attended the hearing and submitted his arguments in support of his claims. 13. For a summary of the relevant domestic-law provisions concerning this type of extraordinary appeal (recurs in anulare) see the judgment in the case of Precup v.

154,001-107136,ENG,CZE,ADMISSIBILITY,2011,COLLOREDO MANSFELDOVÁ v. THE CZECH REPUBLIC,4,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Dean Spielmann;Elisabet Fura;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger,"The applicant, Ms Kristina Colloredo Mansfeldová, is a Czech national who was born in 1940 and lives in Opočno. She was represented before the Court by Mr P. Virag, a lawyer practising in Prague. The Czech Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V.A. Schorm, from the Ministry of Justice. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is the daughter and heir of J. Colloredo Mansfeld, a Czech nobleman who died in 1990. On 16 February 1942 during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the latter’s estate and castle in Opočno were confiscated by the occupying forces. After the war and after the estate had been returned to the applicant’s family, the former Prague Municipal National Council (zemský národní výbor) confiscated the estate on the ground that the applicant’s father was to be considered German, as he had stated that he was of German origin in a questionnaire during the war. On 16 December 1948 the Ministry of Agriculture, deciding upon an appeal by the applicant’s late father, quashed the confiscation decision finding that the statutory requirements necessary for the confiscation had not been met in his case. The estate remained in the possession of the State. In March 1995 the applicant filed an action with the Rychnov nad Kněžnou District Court (okresní soud), whereby she sought to order the State represented by the Pardubice Heritage Institute (památkový ústav) to conclude with her a restitution agreement with regard to the castle and other facilities under the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act. On 27 September 1995 the District Court rejected her action but the Hradec Králové Regional Court (krajský soud) quashed this judgment on 17 October 1997 and sent the case back to the District Court which, in a judgment of 16 March 1999, dismissed the applicant’s action for the second time, finding that she did not meet requirements enshrined in the restitution legislation, including the requirement that the transfer or passing of the ownership of the property occurred in 1942 should have been due to racial persecution. The judgment was subsequently upheld by the Regional Court. In judgment no. 28 Cdo 1733/2000 adopted on 31 August 2000 the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud), deciding upon the applicant’s appeal on points of law, quashed both judgments. In its view, the confiscation by Germany had been due to the applicant’s Czech origin, as Czechs were regarded by the Nazis as an inferior race, and therefore amounted to racial persecution within the meaning of section 3(2) of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act. It noted that the estate had been taken under a confiscation measure that applied to Jews. Having regard also to the fact that the estate had been taken from the applicant’s family twice, first by the Nazis and then by the communist regime, the court found that the requirement of section 3(2) of the Act was met. It stated obiter dictum that any interpretation of the term of racial persecution, limiting the application of that notion only to Jews, would be contrary to Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod). The court held in particular: “Having regard to the objectives of the restitution laws, it appears unsustainable to the Supreme Court to interpret the notion of racial persecution in a restrictive manner when the Nazi administration of ... [occupied Czechoslovakia] sanctioned the applicant’s ascendant for “efforts adverse to the Reich”. On 12 June 2002 the District Court, bound by the Supreme Court’s judgment, found in favour of the applicant and ordered the defendant to conclude a restitution agreement with her and to transfer the ownership of the estate to her. On 13 May 2003 the Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 15 and 16 July 2003 the applicant concluded with the National Heritage Institute (Národní památkový ústav), successor in title to the Pardubice Heritage Institute, the restitution agreement on the transfer of the estate to her. On 17 July 2003 she was registered as the owner of the estate with the land register and during the same year entered into possession in accordance with the restitution agreement. On 4 December 2003 the Supreme Court declared inadmissible an appeal on points of law by the Heritage Institute which, on 20 February 2004, made a constitutional appeal alleging an infringement of its property rights and the right to judicial protection under the Charter. In a judgment of 16 December 2004 the Constitutional Court quashed the lower courts’ decisions and remitted the case to the District Court. It admitted that in civil proceedings, it was incumbent upon the parties to assert their rights and to allege relevant facts, but considered that the ordinary courts were nevertheless obliged to search for and take further evidence on their own initiative. It found that, not having done so, they had breached the Code of Civil Procedure. According to the court, the conclusion of the lower courts that the applicant’s late father had met the conditions set by the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act was erroneous, since he had been registered as German when filling in a questionnaire. It added that, the courts had omitted to take into consideration certain material, including an essay entitled “The Colloredo family and the Colloredo family of Opočno” of which the Constitutional Court took judicial notice, which showed that the applicant’s late father had been disloyal during the war as he had applied for German citizenship. The court also considered that the confiscation of the estate by the German occupying forces could not be regarded as constituting racial persecution of the applicant’s late father within the meaning of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act, as the Supreme Court had found on 31 August 2000. It was apparent from sections 2(1)(c) and 3(2) of this Act, from its aim and from the record on the debate preceding the adoption of Act no. 116/1994 in the lower chamber of the Parliament, that the term of “racial persecution” covered in particular Jews who were victims of the Holocaust. This was, however, not the case of the applicant’s father. The court rejected as inappropriate the Supreme Court’s obiter dictum that such a restrictive interpretation would constitute inequality among victims of the period of lack of freedom and would privilege one group of people on the ground of race contrary to Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the Charter. Indeed, the principle of equality could not be interpreted as an absolute one and equality among citizens could not be construed as an abstract category, but as a relative equality within the meaning of all modern constitutions. A restrictive interpretation of the notion of racial persecution under the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act was not contrary to the principle of equality. Apparently on 6 April 2005 the District Court asked the parties to the procedure whether they would propose further evidence. It also requested the applicant to specify whether she would propose further evidence in support of her assertions that the confiscation had taken place due to racial persecution and that the estate had been taken away and passed into the ownership of the Czechoslovak State in the relevant period within the meaning of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act. It also requested the defendant to indicate whether it would propose any further evidence to support its assertion that the Czechoslovak citizenship of the applicant’s late father had legally ceased to exist. Both parties submitted further documentary evidence. At the hearing of 12 July 2005 the District Court considered extensive documentary evidence, including a historical essay by Dr. Jaroslav Šůla called “The Colloredo family and the Colloredo family of Opočno” (Colloredové a opočenští Colloredové), the so-called administrative record and correspondence between the Municipal National Council and the Ministry of the Interior of 1947 and 1948 when these two authorities were searching for documents concerning the examination of the citizenship of the applicant’s late father. On 13 September 2005 the District Court, having held another hearing, dismissed the applicant’s action. It found that all the requirements for restitution had been met with the exception of loss of property due to racial persecution. The court underlined that when assessing that requirement it was bound by the ruling of the Constitutional Court of 16 December 2004. On 5 June 2006 the Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 6 November 2007 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law, referring to the binding interpretation by the Constitutional Court of the notion of racial persecution. On 8 February 2008 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court, asserting an erroneous interpretation of the notion of racial persecution within the meaning of section 3(2) of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act and procedural shortcomings in consequence of which she had not put forward any evidence establishing that her father’s mother was of Jewish origin. It appears that her constitutional appeal remains undecided. On 11 February 2005 the State represented by the National Heritage Institute filed against the applicant an action for determination of ownership of the estate with the District Court. In a judgment of 23 December 2005 the court granted the State’s action and found it to be the owner of the estate and decided that the Institute was empowered to maintain the estate. On 11 September 2006 the Regional Court quashed this judgment as to the District Court’s finding that the Institute was empowered to upkeep the estate, stayed the proceedings in this respect and transferred this part of the case to the Ministry of Finance. It noted that the District Court had been bound by the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 16 December 2004. The judgment became final on 11 October 2006. On 29 January 2007 the State was registered in the land register as the owner of the estate. The act provides for mitigation of injustices caused by the Communist rule in Czechoslovakia from 25 February 1948 to 1 January 1990 (“the relevant period”). Under section 2(1) property injustices caused by, inter alia, unlawful practices carried out in the relevant period, are to be mitigated, inter alia, by the surrender of the property, provided that the injustices originated in political persecution or in a practice contravening universally accepted human rights and freedoms (section 2(1)(c)). Section 3(2) extended the application of the Act to natural persons who had lost their property due to racial persecution during the Second World War and were entitled to restitution of it after the war pursuant to Decree no. 5/1945 or Act no. 128/1946 and in respect of whom the Communist regime established on 25 February 1948 had failed to grant such claims whilst pursuing its policy of political persecution or carrying out practices contrary to universally accepted human rights and freedoms. Under section 23 if a chamber comes to a legal view differing from that expressed by the court in a previous ruling, it shall submit the issue to the Plenum for its consideration. The latter’s legal view is binding on the chamber in further proceedings. Under section 72(1)(a), a constitutional appeal may be lodged pursuant to section 87(1)(d) of the Constitution by a natural or legal person, alleging that its fundamental rights or basic freedoms guaranteed by the constitutional law have been infringed as a result of a final decision in proceedings to which it was a party, a measure, or any other infringement by a public authority. The Constitutional Court rejected a constitutional appeal lodged by a group of MPs seeking to abrogate the adjective “racial” from section 3(2) of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act. In their view, the term “racial persecution” created inequality on the ground of race among those whose property was adversely affected during the occupation. They asserted that it manifestly contravened the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1965 and the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. In the court’s view the impugned provision had to be interpreted in conformity with these legal instruments. It held, inter alia: “[I]t is evident that racial discrimination under the Third Reich concerned a much larger group (groups) of people than only those concerned by the Nuremberg Laws [i.e. Jews], and that the legal terms such as “national, racial and political” used in section 1(1) of Decree no. 5/1945 are largely superfluous.” The Constitutional Court rejected a constitutional appeal lodged by the Office for the Representation of the State in Property Matters. The Office had contested the legal assessment of ordinary courts as to which State body should be held liable to pay compensation to a private individual. Having noted that that issue was governed by public law, the court ruled that the Office could not be regarded as an owner disposing freely of its property, but merely as a State body acting in its public authority, which does not have a standing to appeal to the Constitutional Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,Ganna Yudkivska;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"The applicant, Mr Lyuben Stoyanov Kemerov, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1945 and lives in Plovdiv. He is represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdjiev, a lawyer practising in Plovdiv. On 31 March 1996 the applicant, who had consumed alcohol, listened to loud music in his flat, disturbing his neighbours. At about 3.30 a.m., a neighbour asked him to cease the disturbance. The applicant apparently lowered the sound only for a while. As the disturbance continued, between 4.15 a.m. and 6 a.m. the neighbour made several calls to the police seeking assistance. Police officers P. and M. were dispatched to the address. From their statements it appears that they made two visits, the second one being at about 6 a.m. At about 6 a.m., having heard loud music emanating from the applicant's apartment, the police officers rang the doorbell and shouted “Police! Open the door!”. In reply, the applicant required to see their identity documents and a warrant authorising their entry into his apartment. The police officers insisted to be let in. According to the applicant, they started hitting the door. Fearing that they might break in, the applicant eventually opened. According to the applicant, upon entering the police officers battered him violently. According to the police officers, the applicant threatened them with a knife which necessitated the use of physical force against him. The police officers eventually handcuffed the applicant and took him to the police station. His name was entered in the detained persons' register, with a note that he had “assaulted the patrol with a knife and resisted [orders]”. He was released an hour and a half later, at about 7.30 a.m. on 31 March 1996. Later on 31 March 1996 the applicant had X-ray photographs of his body taken which confirmed that he did not have fractures. Police officers P. and M. drew up reports on offences punishable in summary administrative proceedings (акт за административно нарушение), dated 31 March 1996 and duly registered in the police reports register. According to the reports, a knife had been seized from the applicant at about 6 a.m. that day and the applicant had refused to comply with a police order to cease a disturbance to the public and had thus committed violations of the relevant regulations. According to the applicant, he never received copies of the above mentioned reports. In his view, it was possible that some of the documents allegedly documenting an assault with a knife might have been created later and backdated. On 2 April 1996 the applicant was examined by a forensic medical doctor who found numerous contusions, haematomas and scars on the applicant's head, chest, abdomen area and on his limbs. There were at least ten bruises on the applicant's head, two on his back, more on his arms and legs. The medical certificate stated, inter alia, that all injuries had been inflicted by a blunt object. It was possible that they were inflicted in the manner and at the time indicated by the applicant. The applicant was eventually fined by the municipal authorities for causing a night disturbance. On 6 April 1996 the applicant submitted a complaint to the Regional Military Prosecutor's Office (окръжна военна прокуратура) stating that he had been ill-treated by police officers. He enclosed a medical certificate. A preliminary inquiry was opened. On 4 July 1996 a prosecutor instructed local police in Plovdiv to investigate the complaints. On 22 July 1996 police officers P. and M. submitted written statements to their superior. They maintained that the applicant had assaulted them with a kitchen knife. Sergeant P. stated that he had hit the applicant several times in his chest and then used a special technique to retrieve the knife as the applicant had been trying to stab him in his right hand. On 23 July 1996 the police reported to the prosecutor, summarising the police officers' version of the facts. He added that in the absence of witnesses, it was not possible to draw up reports on offences punishable in summary administrative proceedings under the Hooliganism Act. It appears that the prosecutor did not undertake any other steps in the following months. On 24 February 1997 the applicant complained of the delay to the higher prosecutor. On 17 April 1997 the applicant's lawyer requested the examination of three witnesses – the applicant's brother who had taken him from the police station upon his release and two of his neighbours. On 15 May 1997 the applicant and the witnesses were heard by a police officer and given the opportunity to submit written statements. One of the applicant's neighbours stated that in the early morning of 31 March 1996 he had heard someone shouting for help and had seen, at the opened door of the applicant's apartment, a man delivering blows to someone inside. He had then seen the applicant being escorted by two men into a police car. Another witness gave evidence from which it transpired that the applicant's front door had not been forced by the police, as initially maintained by him. On 11 June 1998 the applicant's lawyer complained of the delay in the inquiry. On 15 July 1998 the competent prosecutor at the Regional Military Prosecutor's Office terminated the inquiry and refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers. He summarised the facts as presented by the police officers involved and then stated the blows administered on the applicant during the incident were justified under the relevant provisions which allowed the use of force and handcuffs to put an end to a rampant behaviour or other serious violation of public order. A copy of the decision was sent to the applicant. The accompanying letter advised the applicant that he had the right to appeal to the Appellate Military Prosecutor's Office (военно-апелативна прокуратура) in Sofia. The applicant did not appeal. In the meantime, on 1 July 1998 the applicant submitted an application to the former European Commission of Human Rights alleging, inter alia, violations of Articles 3, 8 and 13 of the Convention in relation to the events of 31 March 1996. By final decision of 2 September 2004 the Court, to which the competence to examine the application was transferred by virtue of Article 5 § 2 of Protocol No. 11 to the Convention, declared the application inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies, since the applicant had failed to appeal against the regional prosecutors' decision of 15 July 1998 (see Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). On 27 September 2004 the applicant filed with the Appellate Military Prosecutor's Office an appeal against the decision of 15 July 1998 of the Regional Military Prosecutor's Office. On 15 November 2004 the Appellate Military Prosecutor's Office dismissed the appeal, upholding the decision of 15 July 1998. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office. On 25 February 2005 a prosecutor from that service dismissed the appeal as the prosecution of the police officers concerned was time-barred. He commented on the substance of the complaints, noting that the applicant's allegation that the police had forced his front door had been contradicted by witness evidence and also finding that the applicant's injuries corresponded to the police officers' version of the events. The prosecutor also found that in any event the prosecution of the police officers concerned was time-barred, which excluded any possibility of pursuing the matter. Under Article 80 § 1 read in conjunction with Articles 128-131 of the Penal Code, as in force at the relevant time, the prosecution of a police officer accused of ill-treatment which had not resulted in serious permanent or life-threatening injury was precluded after the expiry of three or five years, depending on whether the ill-treatment could be characterised as having affected the victim's health or had only caused pain.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

On 1 August 2002 the Government adopted Decree no. 1151-N, approving the expropriation zones of the immovable property (plots of land, buildings and constructions) situated within the administrative boundaries of the Central District of Yerevan to be taken for the needs of the State for the purpose of carrying out construction projects, covering a total area of 345,000 sq. m. Byuzand Street was listed as one of the streets falling within such expropriation zones. 6. On 28 October and 21 November 2003 the first applicant applied to the Real Estate Registry, seeking to have his ownership right registered in respect of the house. 7. By letters of 30 October and 25 November 2003 the Real Estate Registry refused the first applicant's request. 8. On 3 December 2003 the first applicant applied to Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan (Երևան քաղաքի Կենտրոն և Նորք-Մարաշ համայնքների աոաջին ատյանի դատարան), seeking to establish a fact of legal significance, namely to have his ownership in respect of the house recognised by virtue of adverse possession. He submitted, in particular, that he had been using the house as his own property since 1989. 9. On 17 June 2004 the Government decided to contract out the construction of one of the sections of Byuzand Street – which was to be renamed Main Avenue – to a private company, Glendale Hills CJSC. 10. On 28 July 2004 Glendale Hills CJSC and the Yerevan Mayor's Office signed an agreement which, inter alia, authorised the former to negotiate directly with the owners of the property subject to expropriation and, should such negotiations fail, to institute court proceedings on behalf of the State, seeking forced expropriation of such property. 11. By a letter of 18 August 2004 Glendale Hills CJSC informed the applicant Satenik Davtyan (hereafter, the third applicant) that the house in question was situated within the expropriation zone of the Main Avenue area and was to be taken for State needs. The third applicant was offered 2,000 United States dollars (USD) as financial assistance payable under the relevant governmental decree to registered persons, since the house was an unauthorised construction and she was only registered in it. 12. It appears that a similar offer was made to the other applicants. It further appears that none of the applicants responded to the offer, not being satisfied with the amount of compensation proposed. 13. On 27 September 2004 Glendale Hills CJSC instituted proceedings on behalf of the State against the applicants, seeking to oblige them to accept the offer and to have them evicted, with reference to Government Decree No. 1151-N. 14. On 3 March 2005 the Kentron and Nork-Marash District Court of Yerevan examined jointly the first applicant's application of 3 December 2003 and the claim of Glendale Hills CJSC. The court decided to grant the latter, finding that the house was situated in an expropriation zone as identified by the Government and was to be taken for State needs. The court awarded each applicant compensation payable to persons registered in unauthorised constructions, namely USD 2,000. The court further decided to dismiss the first applicant's application as unsubstantiated. 15. On 18 March 2005 the first applicant lodged an appeal. In his appeal, he argued that the court, in dismissing his application, had incorrectly interpreted various provisions of the Civil Code, the Housing Code and the Land Code. In support of his arguments the first applicant relied on evidence which allegedly substantiated his ownership claim in respect of the house. He further argued that, even if his ownership was not formally recognised, the amount of compensation awarded to him was inadequate. He finally claimed that as a user of the expropriated property he was entitled under the law to receive other property in its place. 16. On 14 April 2005 the Civil Court of Appeal (ՀՀ քաղաքացիական գործերով վերաքննիչ դատարան) granted the claim of Glendale Hills CJSC and dismissed the first applicant's application on the same grounds as the District Court. 17. On 29 April 2005 the first applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. In his appeal, he argued that the Court of Appeal's judgment was unreasoned and was not based on the evidence in the case. The Court of Appeal had ignored and incorrectly applied various provisions of the Civil Code and the Housing Code, and had failed to establish correctly the facts. He further argued that, regardless of the formal status of the property in question, he should have received adequate compensation or a plot of land or another flat instead. He finally claimed that the house was ownerless and the court should have recognised his ownership in its respect by virtue of adverse possession. 18. On 27 May 2005 the Court of Cassation (ՀՀ վճռաբեկ դատարան) dismissed the first applicant's appeal. 19.

158,001-5588,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,SCHMELZER v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Antonio Pastor Ridruejo,"The applicant is a German national, born in 1925 and living in Heidesheim (Germany). The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Mr K. Stoltenberg, Ministerialdirigent, of the Federal Ministry of Justice. On 31 January 1994 the Bingen District Court (Amtsgericht) convicted the applicant, a recidivist offender, of having driven a motor vehicle without a driving licence and, having regard to his preceding conviction of such offences, it fixed a global sentence of one year’s imprisonment. The execution of the sentence was suspended until 3 May 1998. The court further ordered that the applicant should not be issued a driving licence before 3 November 1995. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed by the Mainz Regional Court (Landgericht) on 14 November 1994. On 20 November 1994 the applicant left Heidesheim and moved to the Netherlands, where he officially took residence in Brummen. On 14 June 1995 he was issued a Dutch driving licence. On 1 July 1995 he moved back to Germany and took residence at his previous address in Heidesheim. On 16 March 1997 the applicant was stopped by the police when driving a car. Having only the Dutch driving licence, criminal proceedings were commenced against the applicant on the suspicion of having driven a motor vehicle without a valid driving licence. In these proceedings, he was assisted by defence counsel. By indictment of 30 June 1997, the Mainz Public Prosecutor’s Office (Staatsanwaltschaft) charged the applicant of having driven a motor vehicle without a valid driving licence. It further requested the competent Bingen District Court to seize the car in question as there were strong reasons to assume that it was liable to forfeiture and to consider the question of a resale (Notveräusserung). On 16 July 1997 the Bingen District Court issued a warrant to search the applicant’s premises and his cars and to seize the applicant’s car with the registration number MZ-E6605. The court found that there was a strong suspicion that on 16 March 1997 the applicant had driven this car without a valid driving licence. In this respect the court considered that, following his conviction of driving without licence in 1994, he should not have been issued a new one before November 1997. When stopped, he had shown a Dutch driving licence, passed in the Netherlands in June 1995. This licence was, according to the court, not valid in Germany as, at the relevant time, though not having been registered in Heidesheim between 20 November 1974 and 1 July 1975, he had in fact been living there. The car was to be seized as object used when committing the offence, liable to forfeiture on account of his recidivism. The measures were carried out on 17 July 1997. On 25 September 1997 the Public Prosecutor’s Office informed the applicant that, taking into account the costs of storage and the value of the car, its resale was envisaged. The applicant’s representative objected on 17 October 1997. On 2 December 1997 the Bingen District Court committed the applicant for trial. Subsequently, it ordered an opinion as to the value of the car. On 23 December 1997 the District Court ordered the sale of the seized car under section 111 lit. l (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), as the costs of storage by far exceeded its value. In this respect, the court had regard to the opinion of a technical expert according to which the remaining value was zero, whereas at the relevant time the costs amounted to more than 800 DEM and were increasing at a daily rate of DM 5. On 5 January 1998, upon the applicant’s objection, the District Court suspended the resale. On 13 January 1998 the Mainz Regional Court (Landgericht) dismissed the applicant’s appeal, confirming the District’s Court reasoning. It added that in assessing the value of the car, objective criteria were relevant and not the applicant’s subjective impression. On 6 February 1998 the trial opened before the Bingen District Court. Having heard the applicant, an expert and several witnesses, the competent judge proposed to adjourn the proceedings in order to conduct further investigations. The same day, a decision to stay the proceedings provisionally, pursuant to section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, was issued. On 9 February 1998 the District Court ordered the seizure of the applicant’s bank statements to investigate whether he had stayed for a longer period in the Netherlands and issued checks there. The same day, the court ordered that the resale of the car be continued, as the suspicion against the applicant had not been dissipated at the hearing of 6 February 1998. The applicant’s assertion that he had repeatedly returned to Heidesheim in order to fetch his mail was not convincing. On 11 February 1998 the bailiff was instructed to proceed to the resale. Upon the applicant’s objection, the resale procedure was suspended pending the outcome of these proceedings. On 2 March 1998 the Mainz Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 9 February 1998. The Regional Court confirmed the reasons advanced by the District Court. It also found that the resale could be continued irrespective of the provisional discontinuation of the trial. It considered that the reference to section 154 had been erroneous. Section 154 provided that, upon the prosecutor’s request, proceedings could be provisionally stayed where the penalty to be expected in the case of a conviction was almost negligible in comparison with a penalty for another offence. However, the Prosecutor’s Office had not made such a request. Rather, the correct interpretation of the decision at issue was that the District Court had adjourned the proceedings sine die for the purpose of further investigations, which it had ordered the same day. The car was sold on 20 March 1998 for 100 DEM, paid to the Justizkasse. On 27 March 1998 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) refused to entertain the applicant's constitutional complaint (Verfassungsbeschwerde). On 18 May 1998, in the context of another set of criminal proceedings pending before the Mainz Regional Court, the applicant was sentenced to two years and six months’ imprisonment. He was found guilty of, inter alia, several offences in connection with having illegally run a dump for dangerous waste, offences under the Firearms Act and twelve counts of driving without licence, committed between November 1994 and April 1996. On 9 July 1998 the Mainz Public Prosecutor’s Office, referring to the applicant’s conviction of 18 May 1998, requested that the proceedings before the Bingen District Court be provisionally stayed pursuant to section 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. On 15 July 1998 the proceedings were provisionally stayed. In the meantime, on 21 April 1998, the Mainz-Bingen District Administrative Authority (Kreisverwaltung), having regard to the Dutch driving licence obtained in June 1995, issued the applicant a German driving licence. According to section 21(1) lit. 1 of the Road Traffic Act (Strassen-verkehrsgesetz), driving a motor vehicle without the requisite licence is a criminal offence punishable with imprisonment not exceeding one year or with a fine. In such cases, the motor vehicle to which the offence relates may be confiscated if the perpetrator drove the vehicle although, inter alia, his driving licence had been withdrawn (section 21(3)(1)). Driving a motor vehicle with a foreign driving licence is governed by section 4 of the Regulations on International Road Traffic (Verordnung über den internationalen Kraftfahrverkehr). According to its paragraph 1 lit. b, a person with a driving licence issued in a Member State of the European Communities is entitled to drive a motor vehicle in Germany if not permanently resident there. According to paragraph 2 lit. a are excepted from this general rule persons who had their permanent residence in Germany at the time when the foreign licence was issued. Persons have their permanent residence where they effectively live for a period of at least 185 days. Section 74 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at the material time, provided for the confiscation of objects generated by or used or intended for use in the commission of preparation of a criminal offence. Such confiscation was only permissible if, inter alia, the perpetrator owned the object in question (section 74(1) lit. 1). According to section 74b of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force at the material time, confiscation of an object under, inter alia, section 74(1) lit.1 should not be ordered if disproportionate to the importance of the offence in question. Confiscation may also be ordered in cases where, for factual reasons, no specific person can be prosecuted or convicted or where the court discontinues the proceedings under provisions granting the prosecutor’s office or the court discretion for doing so (section 76 a of the Code of Criminal Procedure). According to section 111 b, as in force at the material time, objects may be seized pursuant to section 111c, if there are compelling reasons to assume that the conditions for their forfeiture or confiscation are met. Section 111 c provides that the confiscation of movable assets is effected in taking them into public custody or indicating the seizure by seal or in some other way (section 111 c(1)); that objects so seized may be resold before a final judgment inter alia if the cost of storage is excessively expensive or difficult, the proceeds being substituted for the object in question (section 111 l (1)). Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that the public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute where the penalty to be expected if a conviction is secured is almost negligible in comparison with a penalty imposed on the defendant - or which he must expect to be imposed - for another offence (section 154(1)). Once the proceedings have been instituted, the court may provisionally stay them at any stage on an application by the public prosecutor (section 154(2)).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
159,001-4870,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,WILHELM v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää,"The first applicant is a German national, born in 1963 and living in Wiefelstede. He is a lawyer by profession. He also brings the application on behalf of his daughter, born in wedlock in 1985. A. In 1991 the applicant and his wife Mrs G. separated. The ensuing divorce proceedings before the Ludwigshafen am Rhein District Court (Amtsgericht), sitting in family matters (Familiengericht), concerned inter alia the question of custody over the spouses’ children Daria and Julian, born in wedlock in 1987, and involved the taking of psychological expert evidence. Divorce was granted on 26 March 1993. Moreover, upon the spouses’ common proposal, custody of the daughter Daria was awarded to the applicant, and custody of Julian was awarded to Mrs G. Subsequently, Mrs G. remarried. The applicant married again in 1993 and his son Malte was born in October 1993. In November 1994 Mrs G. applied to the Ludwigshafen District Court to be awarded custody of Daria. She submitted that Daria did no longer wish to live with the applicant. The applicant contested these submissions. It appears that he also requested that he be awarded custody of Julian; these proceedings were conducted separately. On 23 December 1994 the Ludwigshafen District Court, having twice heard Daria, issued an interim injunction provisionally transferring the right to determine Daria’s place of residence (Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht) to Mrs G. Daria has been living with Mrs G. since. On 30 June 1995 the applicant withdrew his appeal following a hearing before the Zweibrücken Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) which had also questioned the child. On 17 November 1995 the Ludwigshafen District Court amended the decision of 26 March 1993 and awarded the custody of Daria to Mrs G. The District Court, referring to section 1696 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) and the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), observed that decisions on custody should only be changed, if there were valid reasons seriously affecting the child. Having heard the parents and in particular Daria, the court found that the child did no longer wish to live with the applicant, but with Mrs G. It considered that Daria’s wish had to be respected. She had unequivocally expressed her wish in court on 20 December 1994 and 27 October 1995. As stated in the opinion submitted by the competent youth office, she had made the same statement when heard at the youth office. In the court’s view, the argument that this wish had been influenced by third persons was not valid. In particular, she had decided to live with her mother although she could expect the difficulties of being involved in court proceedings. Her statements in court had appeared true and genuine, and she had upheld her position over a lengthy period during which she had regularly access to the applicant, including holidays. On 23 April 1996 the Zweibrücken Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The Court of Appeal, having heard the applicant and Mrs G., Daria and an employee of the competent youth office, found that the custody decision had to be changed in the interest of the child. In this respect, it noted that, upon divorce, custody of Daria had been awarded to the applicant in accordance with the spouses’ common proposal. Following the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court in December 1994, after having heard Daria twice, she had been living with Mrs G. In this period, Daria had changed from primary to secondary school without problems. The competent youth offices had confirmed that both parents were capable of educating children. Daria was meanwhile living together with her brother Julian. Given the bonds between brother and sister, as confirmed at the hearing, it was also in Daria’s interest that they grew up together. Moreover, at least in the meantime, a closer relationship had developed between Daria and Mrs G. Daria’s repeated questioning had shown that she felt safer with her mother and had more personal care and definitively wished to live with Mrs G. There was no indication that Daria’s statements had been caused by Mrs G. and did not reflect Daria’s own wish. Although Daria had not yet completed the age of 14 and had no formal right of veto, the statement of her will had to be respected as act of self-determination. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal regarded as decisive that Daria’s future well-being and development would suffer, if her firm wish to live with Mrs G. was broken and she be forced to return to the applicant. Awarding custody to Mrs G. was, therefore, in the interest of Daria’s well-being. Furthermore, as regards the applicant’s subsidiary request for joint custody, the Court of Appeal, referring to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungs-gericht), observed in particular that joint custody presupposed both parents’ willingness to share the responsibility for the child after divorce. However, Mrs G. had refused joint custody, arguing that the applicant was not ready for cooperation and would impose his will. The Court of Appeal considered that a parent refusing joint custody was in a position to exclude the other parent from custody. However, such a refusal was not necessarily abusive and therefore irrelevant. Rather, the child’s interests were of paramount importance. In the absence of any willingness to cooperate in the child’s education, joint custody could not be regarded as being in the interest of the child’s well-being. On 23 July 1996 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicant’s constitutional appeal. B. Relevant domestic law and practice Section 1671 §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Code, as in force at the relevant time, provided that, in case of the parents’ divorce, the competent court decided on which parent should have custody of a common child, and took the decision which was in the interest of child’s well-being; the child’s bonds, especially to its brothers and sisters, were to be considered. A common proposal by the parents was only to be disregarded if necessary in the interest of the child. In a decision of 3 November 1982, the Federal Constitutional Court declared unconstitutional paragraph 4, first sentence, of Section 1671, according to which custody had to be awarded to one of the parents in case of divorce. The Constitutional Court considered that a joint right to custody was possible in case of divorce if there is a common proposal by the parents to this effect, showing their willingness to share the responsibility for their child after their divorce. According to section 1696 of the Civil Code, as in force at the relevant time, the competent courts may change their decisions relating to custody matters at any time, if necessary in the interest of the child (im Interesse des Kindes). The relevant legislation has been amended on the basis of the Government Bill of 28 February 1996 on the reform of the law on family matters. This reform of 16 December 1997, which has entered into force on 1 July 1998, harmonises the rules regarding children born in wedlock and children born out of wedlock. Section 1671 of the Civil Code, as amended, provides that, in case of a definite separation of parents who jointly exercise custody, each parent can request for a sole exercise of custody. The competent court will grant the request if (1) the other parent agrees, unless the child having completed the age of 14 disagrees, or if (2) the termination of joint custody and award to the one parent most likely serves best the child’s well-being. According to section 1696, as amended, the competent courts shall change their decisions if there are valid reasons seriously affecting the child (triftige, das Wohl des Kindes nachhaltig berührende Gründe).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Ms Zybeyde Sahin, is an Austrian national who was born in 1974 and lives in Innsbruck. She is represented before the Court by Mr L. Szabo, a lawyer practising in Innsbruck. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicant and her husband had two children: a daughter D, born in 1997, and a son S, born in 1999. Following allegations against the applicant’s husband of violence against the children and sexual abuse of D, the Innsbruck Youth Welfare Office (Jugendwohlfahrtsträger) removed both children from their home and placed them in a children’s home as a provisional measure on 20 December 2005, having found the children to be in imminent danger as required by Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code. 4. In compliance with the time-limit set out in Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code, the Youth Welfare Office thereafter, on 27 December 2005, applied to the Innsbruck District Court (Bezirksgericht Innsbruck) seeking to be awarded custody of the children for the purposes of their care and education and to have their placement in a children’s home approved. 5. The applicant and her husband denied the allegations of domestic violence or sexual abuse and requested the court to dismiss the authority’s application for custody. 6. The District Court promptly heard the applicant and her husband, the children’s teachers, other witnesses and commissioned an expert opinion. Following its investigation, on 24 February 2006 the Innsbruck District Court dismissed the Youth Welfare Office’s custody application, but ordered the parents to attend weekly psychotherapy sessions offered by a specialised association and to allow the children to receive psychological counselling if recommended by the association. 7. The children were returned to their parents on 3 March 2006. 8. The Youth Welfare Office appealed against the District Court’s decision, but on 5 May 2006 the Innsbruck Regional Court (Landesgericht Innsbruck) dismissed the appeal. 9. In addition to the above civil proceedings, the applicant applied on 29 January 2006 to the Tyrol Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat Tirol) and contested the measures taken by the Youth Welfare Office. She requested it to rule that the Youth Welfare Office had violated her rights by removing the children on 20 December 2005, complaining that the children had been taken away without the applicant having first given evidence, and arguing that until the court had issued a decision their placement in a children’s home had been without any legal basis. She also argued that the provisional removal of the children from their home on the basis of suspicions of domestic violence had been disproportionate. 10. On 29 March 2006 the Independent Administrative Panel rejected the application. It found that the measures were based on the provisions of the Civil Code and not on the administrative law. Thus, only the civil courts were competent to decide on the lawfulness of the measure. 11. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court against that decision under Article 144 of the Federal Constitution. 12. On 20 June 2007 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint confirming its case-law whereby a provisional measure implemented by the Youth Welfare Office pursuant to Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code was a measure under civil law. Accordingly, the administrative authorities had no jurisdiction to decide on the applicant’s application. 13. The Constitutional Court’s judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 12 July 2007. 14. Under Article 215 § 1 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch), the competent Youth Welfare Office must apply for court orders regarding custody measures which are necessary in order to ensure a child’s well-being. Where a child is in imminent danger, the Youth Welfare Office must also make the necessary provisional arrangements concerning care and custody until the competent court has given a decision. Such provisional arrangements have to be notified to the competent District Court immediately, at the latest within eight days. 15. Article 138 of the Federal Constitution (Bundesverfassungsgesetz) provides that the Constitutional Court decides on conflicts of jurisdiction between the courts and the administrative authorities. Under Article 144 of the Federal Constitution, an application can be lodged with the Constitutional Court alleging a violation of a constitutional right as the result of a decision of the administrative authorities, including the Independent Administrative Panels. 16. Pursuant to section 1 of the Official Liability Act (Amtshaftungsgesetz), the Federation, the Länder, districts, municipalities, other bodies of public law and the institutions of social insurance (hereinafter named “legal entities”; Rechtsträger) are liable pursuant to the relevant civil law for any damages caused deliberately or negligently by unlawful acts carried out by their officials in the execution and enforcement of the law. Sections 8 and 9 of the Official Liability Act provide that, as a first step, an injured party shall demand a written statement of the legal entity, against which a claim of damages is to be raised, indicating whether the legal entity at issue accepts or rejects the claim for damages. Such a statement shall be rendered within three months. After expiration of the delay of three months and in the event the legal entity does not accept the claim (in full), the injured party can lodge an action for damages with the competent Regional Civil Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
161,001-4904,ENG,AUT,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,WEBORA v. AUSTRIA,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, born in 1952, is an Austrian national residing in Vienna. In the proceedings before the Court he is represented by Mr. G. Grone, a lawyer practising in Vienna. A. On 23 March 1995 officers of the Vienna Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) searched the applicant’s home on the suspicion that he owned and distributed pornographic material involving minors. They informed the applicant that the investigating judge had issued a search warrant orally. A written copy of the search warrant was not served on the applicant until 16 November 1995. On 24 April 1995 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel (Unabhängiger Verwaltungssenat). He submitted that it was not clear in the circumstances whether a search warrant had been issued as claimed by the police officers. Thus, the search of his premises lacked a legal basis and violated his right to respect for his home. On 21 August 1995 the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel rejected the applicant’s complaint as being inadmissible. It found that the police had acted upon an oral search warrant from the investigating judge and the search of the applicant’s premises was, thus, attributable to the court. Consequently, the review of its lawfulness did not fall within the competence of the Independent Administrative Panel. On 9 October 1995 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Review Chamber (Ratskammer) of the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen), claiming that the search of his premises violated his right to respect for his home. He submitted in particular that no written copy of the search warrant had been served on him within the statutory twenty-four hour time-limit. On 21 December 1995 the Review Chamber of the Regional Criminal Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as being unfounded. It noted that the court had conducted criminal proceedings against a number of persons on suspicion of sexual abuse of minors. In the course of these proceedings a letter was seized which proved that a certain M. dealt with pornographic material involving minors. Subsequently, since the applicant was identified as the person using the cover name M. Thereupon, the investigating judge issued a search warrant for the applicant’s premises. At the time, a written copy of the search warrant was not issued and, thus, was not served on the applicant. The Review Chamber further noted that the search was carried out in the presence of the applicant who was first informed of the suspicion and was requested to hand over any pornographic material in his possession. As he refused to do so, the search was carried out and extensive pornographic material as well as business correspondence was seized. Having regard to its above findings, the Review Chamber concluded that there was a reasonable suspicion, as required by S. 139 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung), that objects which were of importance for specific criminal proceedings were to be found on the applicant’s premises. Moreover, the search had, in accordance with S. 140 of the said Code, been ordered by a judicial search warrant. The failure to serve a written copy of the search warrant on the applicant, though contrary to the law, did not affect the lawfulness of the search itself. On 29 April 1996 this decision was served on the applicant’s counsel. B. Relevant domestic law 1862 Protection of the Home Act (Gesetz zum Schutz des Hausrechts 1862) S. 1 of the 1862 Act provides that a search of premises may, as a rule, only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge. The search warrant has to be served on the person concerned either immediately or within twenty-four hours. Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) S. 139 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a search of premises may only be carried out if there is a reasonable suspicion that a person suspected of having committed a criminal offence is hiding in the premises concerned, or that there are objects the possession or examination of which is relevant for a particular criminal investigation. According to S. 140 § 1 a search may, as a rule, only be carried out after the person concerned has been questioned, and if the objects sought are not voluntarily handed over. S. 140 § 3 states that a search may, as a rule, only be carried out on the basis of a reasoned search warrant issued by a judge. The search warrant has to be served on the person concerned either immediately or within twenty-four hours.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

On 8 September 1996 a naked female body was found dead on the seashore in Mersin, a city on the Mediterranean coast. The same day an autopsy was conducted on the body from which hair and blood samples were taken. On 12 September 1996 the body was identified as A.Ö., the wife of a retired colonel.

The ensuing investigation led to the arrest of the applicant and his two friends (C. and Z.), who were carrying out their military service as receptionists at the officers’ guesthouse. In his police statement, dated 13 September 1996, the applicant confessed that he had been involved in the killing of A.Ö., and gave a detailed account of the events. He stated that together with his friend C., they had raped the victim, who had been staying alone in the guesthouse. He further stated that they had killed her, when she threatened to file a complaint against them. On 14 September 1996 the police conducted a survey on the scene of the crime together with the applicant and the other accused persons, and the applicant showed where they had hidden the victim’s personal belongings. A knife was found in the basement, on which there was a thread of hair. The applicant also indicated a piece of cloth stuck on the barbed wire surrounding the guesthouse, which had been torn from the victim’s dress as they carried her to the shore. The hair on the knife was later found to be identical to that of the victim. This survey was recorded on videotape. On 15 September 1996 the applicant repeated before the public prosecutor the statement he had given to the police. The attorney of the other co-accused, C., was present during the interrogation by the public prosecutor. The same day, the applicant was placed in detention on remand. On 18 September 1996 after the identification of the victim’s body, the Mersin Public Prosecutor destroyed the blood and hair samples taken from her body. He further declared lack of jurisdiction and transferred the case file to the Military Court Public Prosecutor, as the applicant was a soldier in the Turkish Army. On 1 October 1996 the Adana Military Court Public Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings in the Adana Military Court against the applicant and the other two co-accused and charged them with rape and murder. The prosecution requested that the applicant be sentenced to death pursuant to Sections 416, 417, 495 and 497 of the Turkish Criminal Code. Before the court, the applicant gave a different account of the events and blamed the other co-accused, C., for the alleged offences. According to the applicant’s defence, on the night of the incident, the applicant’s friend C. told him that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with the victim, who had been staying alone in the guesthouse for a couple of days. Together they entered the victim’s room from the balcony window, where C. attempted to rape her. Frightened of being caught by the police, C. told the applicant that they should kill the victim. According to the applicant, at that point, the victim lost consciousness. The applicant and C. carried the victim from her room to the shore, where she regained consciousness and started to struggle with the attackers. C. stabbed her in the back and the applicant also stabbed her. According to the applicant’s statement, when they returned to the guesthouse, C. collected the victim’s personal belongings, including her jewellery, from her room. The applicant further confessed before the court that he had taken a bracelet and a necklace belonging to the victim. Moreover, the applicant denied his statement taken by the police and alleged that he had been subjected to ill-treatment during police custody. He further maintained that during his interrogation by the public prosecutor, he had been told to repeat his police statement.  The court further took oral evidence from the other two defendants, and they also confessed being involved in the alleged offences. In his statement, Z. maintained that he had been working at the reception at the time of the incident. He stated that, a day before the incident, he had heard the applicant say that he wanted to rape A.Ö. In his statement Z. further explained that he had not seen the other two defendants entering the victim’s room, but had seen them carrying the victim from the guesthouse to the seashore. He confessed that he had helped them carry the victim out of the guesthouse, and that the other two had then carried her to the shore. Z. stated to the court that when they came back after forty minutes later, their clothes were wet and the applicant was holding a screwdriver and a knife. He further stated that, as he was scared, he did not talk about this incident with anyone. The applicant requested the court to take oral evidence from the victim’s husband. On 11 November 1996 the court refused the applicant’s request on the ground that the victim’s husband was not an eye witness to the crime in question and that his testimony would not in any way have an effect on the elucidation of the case. On 25 November 1996 a survey of the crime area was conducted by order of the military court. On 5 December 1996 the Adana Military Court, in view of the defendants’ confessions, the autopsy report, the survey of the crime scene, the blood sample tests and the incident reports, established the facts as follows. The applicant and his friend C., who had planned to rape the victim, entered the victim’s room from an open balcony window, leaving Z. in the reception to watch out. When they entered the room, they found the victim asleep and put a pillow over her head to prevent her from screaming, and then they raped her. When the victim started shouting, the two friends decided to kill her to prevent her from filing a complaint. They first tried to strangle A.Ö with a bathrobe belt, at which point she lost consciousness. Then they took her to the seaside, trying to drown her in the sea. However, the victim gained consciousness and tried to run away. Consequently, they started punching and hit her on the face with a stone. The applicant also stabbed the victim in her back with a screwdriver, whereas C. stabbed her with a knife in the stomach. Then C. tried to kill the victim by cutting her aorta. When A.Ö died, C. slashed the victim’s face in order to prevent the identification of the body. Then, leaving the body on the shore, they returned to the guesthouse. They packed the victim’s personal belongings, took her jewellery and hid them in the basement of the building. Accordingly, the court found it established that the applicant had acted with premeditation in order to rape A.Ö and had then killed her to avoid being caught by the police. The Adana Military Court also held that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment in police detention were unsubstantiated, as there was no evidence in support of these allegations. The court further stated that the applicant had repeated his confession before the public prosecutor in the presence of a lawyer and had not complained about ill-treatment. Consequently, the Adana Military Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to death. The applicant appealed and the Military Court of Cassation held a hearing and examined the case once again. On 20 May 1997 the Military Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding the first-instance court’s establishment of the facts and evaluation of evidence in line with the domestic and general principles of law.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
163,001-22316,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,DANCY v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Terence Dancy, is a United Kingdom national, born in 1957 and currently serving a sentence of life imprisonment in HM Prison Full Sutton. He is represented before the Court by Mr E. Abrahamson, a solicitor practising in Liverpool. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant had a history of psychiatric illness. On 28 May 1992, he went to the police station where he confessed that he had attacked a man, Mr M., in the building where he lived as he thought the man had accused him of stealing his television. Mr M. was found dead with multiple depressed skull fractures consistent with use of a hammer. On 23 September 1993, the applicant pleaded guilty to manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility and was sentenced by the judge to a term of life imprisonment. The judge declined to set a relevant period for deterrence and retribution (the “tariff”). His sentencing remarks were “... you have pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter on the basis of diminished responsibility. It was a horrendous crime committed with great violence. I bear in mind everything which I have read about you in the reports. I accept that your distress when you realised what you had done was genuine and that your remorse for it is genuine. Nevertheless, it is a very serious crime indeed and your mental state is such that though you are not a mentally sick person you present a continuing danger to the public because of your liability to fits of explosive temper unless you take regularly your proper medication. I am satisfied therefore that a sentence longer that would be necessarily appropriate to punish you having regard to the seriousness of the offence, is necessary to protect the public from serious harm. The sentence of the court upon you therefore is one of life imprisonment. [Addressing leading counsel for the applicant] I have considered the question of making it a discretionary life sentence under Section 34. I do not consider that appropriate for the reasons which I have explained.” By letter of 28 May 1998, the applicant was informed by the Home Office that as a tariff had not been set under section 34 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 by the trial judge he was to be treated as a mandatory life prisoner and the Secretary of State would proceed to fix his tariff. He was informed of the trial judge’s view, given in a recent report, that five years was an appropriate period and was given an opportunity to make written representations to the Secretary of State. In or about November 1998, the Secretary of State set the applicant’s tariff at five years. He had been advised that the applicant should originally have been treated as a discretionary life prisoner by the trial judge who should himself have fixed as tariff at trial. For that reason, he regarded himself as bound to follow the trial judge’s view. On 22 December 1998, the applicant was informed of this decision and told that as his tariff had already expired (in May 1997) it was no longer a factor in his continued detention. On 12 July 1999, the applicant lodged an appeal against sentence, alleging that the trial judge should have specified the five year tariff at the time the sentence was passed and that had the period been so specified he would have been treated as a discretionary life prisoner and not a mandatory life prisoner. Permission to appeal was granted on 5 October 1999. In its judgment of 8 November 1999, the Court of Appeal upheld the appeal. Lord Justice Rose said: “It seems to this Court, from the sentencing observations of the learned judge, that, although he referred to the gravity of the offence and the danger then presented by the appellant, he was not seeking to say that, in this case, life should mean life. Indeed, his recent recommendation to the Home Secretary that a period of five years would be appropriate for retribution and deterrence is quite inconsistent with such having been his intention at that time. It is not clear whether the judge’s attention was drawn to the Practice Direction and, in any event, he certainly did not have the advantage of the observations of this Court in Hollies, which was decided in August 1994, after the learned judge passed sentence. Had he had that advantage, it seems to us very unlikely that he would have expressed himself quite as he did in his sentencing remarks. The consequence, in our judgment, is that a period of five years ought to have been expressed by the learned judge at the time sentence was passed, in accordance with the Practice Direction and in accordance with what now appears in the judgment of this Court, in Hollies. Accordingly, this appeal will be allowed, to the extent that a five year tariff period will be specified... The consequence of this is, for the avoidance of doubt, that he will become a discretionary life prisoner and can and should be treated by the Parole Board accordingly.” The applicant was immediately re-categorised as a discretionary life prisoner by the Prison Service and Parole Board. On 1 December 1999, the applicant’s case was reviewed by the Parole Board, at an oral hearing. He appeared in person and was represented by his solicitor. He was entitled to adduce evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. It did not direct release, finding that the applicant remained a risk. It did recommend to the Secretary of State that his case be reviewed in twelve months as he had nearly completed the recommended offence related programmes and as he had been disadvantaged in not obtaining a review two years before the expiry of the tariff as his tariff had only been fixed recently. The applicant’s case was reviewed by the Parole Board at an oral hearing held on 29 November 2000. By decision dated 30 December 2000, the Parole Board declined to direct the applicant’s release as it concluded that the applicant remained a danger to the public. It recommended that the next review take place in 24 months as considerable further offence-related, treatment/work programmes still needed to be undertaken e.g. further work on anger management and relationship issues as well as attendance on an Extended Sex Offender Treatment Programme. It noted that the applicant had acknowledged during the proceedings that neither release nor transfer to open conditions was appropriate at this stage. It did recommend that he be transferred to a Category C prison (lower security) to facilitate further treatment work and this was implemented. The applicant’s next review was scheduled for November 2002. On 1 March 2002, the applicant signed the annual review board summary setting out proposals for further treatment, indicating that he fully agreed with the recommendations. The applicant has now been transferred to a Category C prison. English law imposes a mandatory sentence for the offence of murder in respect of offenders under the age of 18 known as detention during Her Majesty’s pleasure (section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933); in respect of offenders between the age of 18 and 20 years, custody for life (section 8(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982), and in respect of offenders aged 21 and over, life imprisonment (section 1(1) of the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1967). Mandatory life sentences are fixed by law, in contrast to discretionary life sentences which can be imposed at the discretion of the trial judge on persons convicted of certain violent or sexual offences (e.g. manslaughter, rape or robbery). The principles underlying the imposition of a discretionary life sentence are: Discretionary life sentences are indeterminate in order that “the prisoner’s progress may be monitored ... so that he will be kept in custody so long as public safety may be jeopardised by his being let loose at large” (R v. Wilkinson [1983] 5 Cr. App. Rep. 105, p. 108). Persons sentenced to mandatory and discretionary life imprisonment, custody for life and those detained during Her Majesty’s pleasure have a ‘tariff’ set in relation to the period of imprisonment they should serve in order to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence. After the expiry of the tariff, the prisoner becomes eligible for release on licence. Applicable provisions and practice in respect of the fixing of the tariff and release on licence have been subject to change, most notably following the coming into force on 1 October 1992 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”), which was in force at the relevant time. The provisions of the 1991 Act were replaced by the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 (the 1997 Act) from 1 October 1997. Pursuant to section 34 of the 1991 Act, the trial judge in sentencing a person to a term of discretionary life imprisonment in open court after a trial was given the power to fix the tariff. The role of the trial judge in this respect was clarified by the Court of Appeal in a Practice Direction (Crime – Life sentences) [1993 1 WLR 223]. Paragraph 3 stated: “The judge is not obliged by statute to make use of the provisions of section 34 when passing a discretionary life sentence. However the judge should do so, save in the very exceptional case where the judge considers that the offence is so serious that detention for life is justified by the seriousness of the offence alone, irrespective of the risk to the public. In such a case, the judge should state this in open court when passing sentence.” In August 1994, the case of R v. Hollies (16 Cr App R(S) LJ Stuart Smith said concerning the Practice Direction and the 1991 Act: “The scheme of the Act is that the judiciary should specify the period which the prisoner should serve, and that period should be appropriate to the punishment or retribution required and the need to deter the prisoner and others from committing similar grave offences. This period is usually referred to as the tariff period. Once that period has expired the prisoner can expect to be released on licence if the Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined (see section 34(4)b). There is thus a clear division of function. The judges are to decide the period which the prisoner is to serve by way of punishment and deterrence. The Board must decide whether he still presents a danger to the public and, if he does not, he must be released. That means, save in cases of most exceptional gravity, where the judge thinks that a prisoner should remain a prisoner for the rest of his normal life, he should specify a period under the Act.” In cases of mandatory life sentences, it is for the Secretary of State to fix the tariff after consulting the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice. He is entitled to depart from the judicial view. Pursuant to section 32 (2) of the 1991 Act, the Parole Board had a duty to advise the Secretary of State with respect to any matter referred to it by him which was connected with the early release or recall of prisoners. The Parole Board’s Chairman appointed three members of the Parole Board to consider discretionary life cases. They comprised the Discretionary Lifer Panel (“DLP”). Pursuant to the Parole Board Rules 1992 which came into force on 1 October 1992, a discretionary life prisoner was entitled to, amongst other things, an oral hearing, disclosure of evidence before the Parole Board and legal representation. He was also entitled to call witnesses on his behalf and to cross-examine those who had written reports about him. A reasoned decision by the DLP was delivered within seven days of the hearing. Prior to 1 October 1997, the duty to release discretionary life prisoners was dealt with by section 34, which provided that where a discretionary life prisoner had served his tariff and the Board had directed his release, it was the duty of the Secretary of State to release him on licence. Section 34(4) provided: “The Board shall not give a direction ... unless – (a) the Secretary of State has referred the prisoner’s case to the Board; (b) the Board is satisfied that it is no longer necessary for the protection of the public that the prisoner should be confined.” A discretionary life prisoner may require the Secretary of State to refer his case to the Parole Board, after the end of the period of two years beginning with the disposal of a previous reference to the Board (section 34 (5) (b) of the 1991 Act, now section 28 (7) (b) of the 1997 Act). The regime applicable to mandatory life prisoners was, however, preserved within section 35 of the 1991 Act. Section 35 of the 1991 Act provided insofar as relevant: “(2) If recommended to do so by the Board, the Secretary of State may, after consultation with the Lord Chief Justice together with the trial judge if available, release on licence a life prisoner who is not a discretionary life prisoner.” The provisions concerning oral hearings and the requirement for regular reviews were not extended to mandatory life prisoners and the Parole Board was not given any power to direct their release.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant has been a member of the Athens Bar since 1960. He stood in the parliamentary elections of 9 April 2000 in the first constituency of Athens as a candidate on the Nea Dimorkatia party’s list. He obtained 44,387 votes and was elected as a member of parliament for a four-year term by decision no. 799/2000 of the Athens Court of First Instance. 10. On 18 February 2003 Mrs Apostolou, a voter in that constituency, lodged a complaint against the applicant with the Special Supreme Court, the judicial body which, under Articles 58 and 100 of the Constitution, had jurisdiction, inter alia, to remove a member of parliament from office in the event of disqualification. Mrs Apostolou referred, in particular, to the incompatibility between the office of a member of parliament and the fact that the applicant was practising as a lawyer. This incompatibility had been enshrined in the Constitution for the first time on the occasion of a constitutional revision in 2001. The new Article 57 of the Constitution now states that the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with all professional activity, although it does provide for the introduction of exceptions through legislation. However, the implementing legislation was never enacted, since, according to information submitted by the applicant, the Chamber of Deputies voted against the draft law in February 2003. Article 115 § 7 of the revised Constitution indicated that the rule on disqualification in question would come into force once the implementing legislation provided for in Article 57 had been enacted and, at the latest, on 1 January 2003 (see paragraph 16 below). 11. The hearing before the Special Supreme Court was held on 7 May 2003. Before that court, the applicant alleged, inter alia, that there had been a violation of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 and argued that, until such time as the implementing legislation provided for in Article 57 of the Constitution had been enacted, the disqualification could not be applied. He also claimed that the disqualification could not be applied to members of parliament who had been elected prior to the revision of the Constitution. Submitting several documents in evidence, he added that he had ceased receiving fees as of 1 January 2003 and that he was carrying out his activities free of charge, with the result that he could not be deemed to be practising a profession within the meaning of Article 57. 12. On 3 July 2003, by judgment no. 11/2003, the Special Supreme Court allowed Mrs Apostolou’s complaint and ruled that the applicant had forfeited his seat. In particular, the court dismissed the applicant’s argument that he could not be deemed to be practising his profession because he had not received fees for his services since the rule on disqualification had come into force. However, three members of the court considered that “the concept of practising a profession is very closely linked to receipt of an income, particularly through a systematic and long-term activity carried out for the purpose of ensuring [the individual’s] livelihood”. With regard to the other arguments raised by the applicant, the Special Supreme Court found as follows: “... [A]s is clear from Articles 115 § 7 and 57 § 1, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, the constituent body, in adopting the rule whereby the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the exercise of any profession, did so not only with a view to ensuring the independence of members of parliament, but also to ensure that the latter are able to carry out their duties in the best possible conditions and without distraction ... At the same time, the Constitution delegated to Parliament the power to introduce exceptions to the [general] rule of professional disqualification, in other words, the power to list those professional activities which would be compatible with the duties of a member of parliament ... In addition, [the same provisions state that] the rule establishing the incompatibility between the duties of a member of parliament and the practising of any profession was to come into force, at the latest, on 1 January 2003 ..., even if the law indicating the professional activities that are compatible with the duties of a member of parliament had not been enacted by that date ... The only consequence of the failure to enact this legislation ... is that the rule on disqualification for members of parliament is applicable, without exception, from 1 January 2003 ... Further, the argument put forward by the applicant in his submissions to the effect that the disqualification is not applicable to members of the current Chamber of Deputies, since this would be contrary to the constitutional principle of legitimate expectation, must be dismissed as unfounded, especially since a constitutional provision cannot be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to another provision or principle of the same Constitution. This follows from the formal equality of all provisions of the Constitution and the principles arising from them, which requires that each constitutional provision be applied in a binding manner with regard to the specific area which it governs ...” 13. In July 2003 the applicant was replaced as a member of the Chamber of Deputies by the first substitute on his party’s list for the first constituency of Athens. 14. At the time of the parliamentary elections of 9 April 2000 in which the applicant was a candidate, Article 57 § 1 of the Constitution was worded as follows: “The duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the functions or position of a member of a board of directors, chairperson or director general or their deputies, or of an employee of a commercial firm or enterprise enjoying special privileges or public service concessions or receiving a regular State subsidy.” 15. The new Article 57 of the revised Constitution provides: “1. ... [paragraph 3] The duties of a member of parliament are also incompatible with the exercise of any profession. Activities compatible with parliamentary office, as well as matters relating to insurance and pension issues and to the manner in which members of parliament return to their profession at the end of their parliamentary term, shall be specified by law. ... [paragraph 4] Violation of the provisions of the present paragraph shall result in forfeiture of parliamentary office and shall render related contracts or other acts null and void, as specified by law. ...” 16. The transitional provision of Article 115 § 7 of the Constitution provides: “The incompatibility of parliamentary office with the exercise of any profession, provided for by the penultimate paragraph of Article 57 § 1, shall come into force upon promulgation of the law provided for in the same provision and on 1 January 2003 at the latest.” 17. In December 2005 the present government announced its intention to carry out a further revision of the Constitution. On 17 January 2006 Mr Karamanlis, the current Prime Minister, presented the broad outlines of the proposed revision to his party’s parliamentary group. He stated, inter alia: “recent experience shows that it is necessary to amend the constitutional provision on the professional disqualification of members of parliament; we propose lifting the absolute prohibition and replacing it with a partial prohibition.” 18. During the sittings of 13 and 20 January 1998 of the parliamentary committee responsible for preparing the revision of the Constitution, members of the opposition expressed their views as follows (extracts): Mr Souflias: “I suggest adding a provision to Article 57 which would read as follows: the duties of a member of parliament are incompatible with the exercise of any professional activity.” Mr Panagiotopoulos: “Constitutional provision: a member of parliament may not exercise any other profession.” Mr Varvitsiotis: “I believe that a member of parliament should not exercise any other professional activity during his or her term of office.” In its final report of 30 March 1998, the above-mentioned parliamentary committee proposed that Article 57 of the Constitution be amended, and expressed its opinion as follows: “It is proposed, by a large majority, to revise Article 57 in order to redefine the work, powers and activities which are incompatible with the duties of a member of parliament in order to take account of current information about the State’s role in the economy. Forfeiture of one’s parliamentary seat is also foreseen as a sanction for exceeding the limit set on election expenditure.” In its report of 23 October 2000, the parliamentary committee responsible for preparing the revision of the Constitution after the elections of 9 April 2000 made no mention of the introduction of an absolute professional disqualification. 19. At the sitting of 28 February 2001, Mr Yannopoulos, a member of the majority parliamentary party and a former Minister of Justice, spoke as follows (extract): “What type of Parliament do you want? Do you want to exclude scientists and well-known figures? ... This prohibition exists in no other country ... You will find yourselves in the dock at the European Court of Human Rights, since a legislative prohibition on being elected to Parliament on the ground of one’s profession amounts to a breach of every citizen’s personality rights ...” 20. At the sitting of 6 April 2001, Mr Pavlopoulos, a member of parliament, then spokesperson for the opposition and currently Minister of the Interior, stated (extract): “... The initial philosophy underlying the revision of this Article was that members of parliament could exercise professional activities with the exception of those prohibited by the Constitution; this is the logic of the decision [that we adopted within the revision committee]. Yet now, before a plenary sitting of the Chamber, you are putting forward a position that is the exact opposite of that ... All of a sudden, in the middle of the procedure, you are introducing an amendment which, in reality, completely overturns the content of the revision of Article 57 ... This is not a simple amendment, but a total reversal of the logic underlying the revision of Article 57.” 21. Several legislative systems make it incompatible to hold a seat in Parliament and simultaneously to hold senior office in the executive branch (Head of State, Prime Minister, Minister or Minister of State) or high office within the judiciary (president or member of a constitutional or supreme court, of an administrative court, of the Conseil d’Etat or of another specialised senior court, such as the Audit Court). This is the case, for example, in Austria (Articles 61, 92 § 2, 122 § 5, 134 § 4 of the Federal Constitutional Law), Belgium (Article 50 of the Constitution), Spain (Article 70 of the Constitution and section 6 of the 1985 implementing Law on the general electoral system), Estonia (section 7 of the Parliamentary Rules of Procedure Act), Finland (Article 27 of the Constitution), France (Chapter IV of the Electoral Code), Luxembourg (Article 54 of the Constitution), “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (section 9 of the Status of Members of Parliament Act 2005), the Netherlands (Article 57 § 2 of the Constitution) and Portugal (section 5 of the Assembly of the Republic (Elections) Act and section 20(1) of the Status of Members of Parliament Act). In some countries, however, government ministers take part in parliamentary work (Spain, Poland, Romania). 22. Certain disqualifications from holding a parliamentary seat concern positions which could jeopardise parliamentarians’ independence as a result of hierarchical relations within the government. 23. In the majority of countries, disqualifications of this type concern judges and prosecutors, police officers and members of the armed forces, and all diplomatic and consular staff. This is the case, for instance, in Bosnia and Herzegovina (section 1(8) of the Elections Act), Spain (Constitution), France (Chapter IV of the Electoral Code), Ireland (section 41 of the 1992 Elections Act), Italy (sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Elections Act), Malta (Article 54 of the Constitution), the United Kingdom (section 1(1) of the 1975 House of Commons Disqualifications Act) and Slovakia (Article 77 of the Constitution). 24. In general, such disqualifications concern civil servants or contract workers employed in the State administration or in regional bodies, autonomous State entities or institutions such as the social security service, or in public companies. This is the case, for example, in Germany (section 8 of the Members of the Bundestag Act), Andorra (section 17 of the 1993 Electoral System and Referendums Act), Belgium (Disqualifications Act of 6 August 1931), Bulgaria (Article 68 of the Constitution), Spain (section 157 of the 1985 implementing Law), Estonia (Article 63 of the Constitution), Hungary (Article 9 of the Status of Members of Parliament Act 1990), Portugal (Article 157 of the Constitution), the Czech Republic (section 12(a) of the Conflict of Interests Act) and the Russian Federation (Article 97 of the Constitution). 25. In the majority of countries, individuals affected by those disqualifications must resign if they wish to stand for election (as in Bosnia and herzegovina). In other countries (such as Austria or Belgium) they may merely request to be suspended from their professional duties during their term of office. 26. As a general rule, the disqualifications in this category concern managers or heads of companies, corporations or public or private institutions which have interests in State activities or which receive State aid or grants. They may also concern the chairpersons, general managers or members of the boards of directors of private companies involved in public construction or in property or credit operations (among many other countries, Bulgaria, Spain, France and Italy have such rules). 27. In some countries, members of parliament may not practise any professional or commercial activity or paid employment during their terms of office, except in the educational sphere, and then only in very exceptional circumstances (Spain, Lithuania, Russia). 28. The majority of countries do not lay down, in their constitutional or ordinary legislation, an incompatibility with freely practising the profession of lawyer (for example, Andorra, Austria, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, Serbia and Montenegro, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Switzerland). 29. However, restrictions or conditions may be imposed on a member of parliament who practises as a lawyer, based on the requirements of independence, professional ethics and availability. Thus, despite the absence of a legislative prohibition in this regard, the German Federal Court of Justice stated in a judgment of 26 June 1978 that the timetable of Bundestag sittings enabled a member of parliament to practise as a lawyer, subject to the prohibitions concerning conflicts of interest set out in the Lawyers Act and the legal profession’s Code of Ethics. 30. This specific concept of conflict of interest exists in several countries’ legislative provisions. Thus, in France, Article 149 of the Electoral Code prohibits any lawyer registered with the Bar who is a member of parliament from carrying out, directly or indirectly through an associate or colleague (except before the Haute Cour de justice or the Court of Justice of the Republic), any professional act in criminal cases concerning certain crimes or offences against the State or the areas of finance or the press, or to plead in civil proceedings for companies which receive State grants, financial companies or companies which use savings, companies engaged in civil engineering, construction or property development, or against the State, State-owned companies, local authorities or public establishments. 31. Similar provisions exist in the legislation of other civil-law countries, such as Italy (section 10 of the Elections Act), Portugal (section 21 of the Statute of Members of the Assembly of the Republic), Romania (section 82 of the Exercise of Public Duties (Transparency Measures) Act (Law no. 161/2003), Title IV on members of parliament, as amended by the Status of Lawyers Act) and Turkey (section 3 of the Disqualifications of members of the Grand National Assembly Act 1984 (Law no. 3069)). 32. In the common-law countries, the codes of ethics of members of parliament guarantee parliamentarians’ independence vis-à-vis possible conflicts of interest by means of administrative and procedural measures. In the United Kingdom, members of parliament must declare any work or paid employment and have this declaration entered in the register of members’ interests. Failure to register an interest may result in sanctions (Code of Conduct for Members of Parliament and Guide to the Rules relating to the Conduct of Members of Parliament). Similar provisions exist in Ireland (sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995) and in Malta (Article 5 of the 1995 Code of Ethics of Members of the House of Representatives). 33. Those procedures for declaring and registering the assets and financial interests of members of parliament have also been adopted in some countries of continental Europe. Thus, the Rules of the Italian Chamber of Deputies provide for a similar system to determine cases of incompatibility: within thirty days of the Chamber’s first sitting, each member must submit a declaration to the speaker concerning the functions occupied by him or her at the time of standing for election, and those commercial or professional activities which he or she continues to carry out. In Switzerland, members of parliament are also obliged to notify their financial interests and any other professional activity carried out by them when they take up their duties (section 11 of the 2002 Federal Assembly Act). 34. Other more practical limitations and restrictions have been added to those cited above, which are based on the concept of independence and conflict of interest. Various regulations on the status of members of parliament require that they give their parliamentary activities priority over any other private work, whether remunerated or not. In Finland, Parliament may, by a two-thirds majority, require that a member of parliament forfeit his or her seat, permanently or for a specific period, if the individual concerned neglects his or her duties in a significant and repeated manner. In practice, this obligation is reflected in a significant reduction in the time spent working in other professions, or withdrawal from them (as in Sweden). 35. In Spain, the requirement to carry out parliamentary duties on a full-time basis results in very restrictive rules on disqualification (section 157 of the 1985 implementing Law on the general electoral system); holding a parliamentary seat is incompatible with the direct or indirect exercise of any private or public profession or activity, remunerated by way of wages, salaries, dues, fees or other means (an exception is made for university lecturers). However, section 159(3) of the 1985 implementing Law permits interested parties to apply to the relevant chamber’s disqualification committee for leave to conduct private activities which do not concern public bodies or services, public companies, companies which are financed from public funds or credit or insurance companies. 36. Parliamentary committees exist in several countries. They may authorise professional activity, including in the public sector, which would otherwise be considered incompatible with the holding of a parliamentary seat (see section 6a(1) and (2) of the Austrian Disqualification Act). In certain cases, those activities must be carried out without remuneration. 37. A blanket prohibition on exercising any profession, trade or remunerated form of employment, similar to that laid down in the Greek or Spanish legislation, also exists in a more or less rigid form in other countries, especially those of central and eastern Europe, such as Lithuania (Article 6 of the Constitution), “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (section 9 of the Status of Members of Parliament Act), the Russian Federation (Article 97 of the Constitution) and Moldova (Article 70 of the Constitution). As in Spain, however, exceptions exist for teaching, scientific research and creative activities.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

ESTONIA,4,Inadmissible,Ganna Yudkivska;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Mark Villiger;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger,"The applicant, Mr Edgar Kaasik, is an Estonian national who was born in 1988. He is currently serving a prison sentence. and as they appear from the documents on file, may be summarised as follows. On 3 December 2008 the Viru County Court convicted the applicant of manslaughter, attempted murder and violent and threatening behaviour. He was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment to which an unserved sentence of seven months from an earlier judgment was added. According to the text of the judgment – which was drawn up in Russian – an interpreter participated in the hearing; the applicant was assisted by a lawyer. It would appear that the proceedings in the County Court were conducted mainly in Russian since the applicant and several other participants in the proceedings were Russian-speakers. On 15 May 2009 the Tartu Court of Appeal heard the applicant's appeal. The applicant was assisted by a lawyer; an interpreter also participated in the hearing. According to the documents submitted by the applicant, the Court of Appeal informed the participants in the hearing that its judgment would be available on 20 May 2009 at the court's office and explained that any notice of appeal against its judgment had to be submitted to the court's office within seven days of 21 May 2009. The participants in the proceedings confirmed that they had understood the appeal procedure. By a judgment of 20 May 2009 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal. It appears that the operative part of the judgment was available at the court's office on 20 May 2009. A translation into Russian of the operative part of the judgment was served on the applicant, who was in detention in Viru Prison, on 26 May 2009. According to the applicant, he had been informed after the examination of his appeal in the Court of Appeal that the court had to be notified of any intention to appeal within seven days and that only a lawyer had the right to lodge an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court. His lawyer had not come to the prison to discuss further action despite his promise to do so. On an unspecified date he had called his lawyer, who had told him to inform the court of his intention to appeal and to lodge an appeal in cassation. On 3 June and 4 June 2009 the applicant handed over to the prison authorities applications addressed to the County Court and the Court of Appeal informing them of his intention to appeal. On 8 June 2009 the Court of Appeal refused to accept the applicant's notification of appeal, finding that the time-limit for submission of any such notification had expired on 2 June 2009, that is, seven days after the applicant had received the translation into Russian of the operative part of the judgment, whereas the applicant's letters had been handed over to the prison authorities too late, on 3 June and 4 June 2009. The Court of Appeal noted that the applicant had not requested that the court restore the time-limit and had not provided any explanation why he had failed to comply with it. In the meantime, on 4 June 2009, the applicant requested the Supreme Court to restore the time-limit for appeal. By a decision of 29 June 2009 the Supreme Court rejected the application. It noted that pursuant to Article 344 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure both an appeal in cassation and a request for restoration of the time-limit for appeal had to be drawn up by a lawyer. The Supreme Court's decision was sent to the applicant on 20 July 2009. On 21 June 2009 the applicant lodged a procedural appeal with the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal's decision of 8 June 2009. On 22 July 2009 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal because it too should have been drawn up by a lawyer. The Supreme Court's decision was sent to the applicant on 21 August 2009. Article 315 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik) concerns the pronouncement of a first-instance court's judgment. Pursuant to Article 343 (see below) it also applies, mutatis mutandis, to appellate court judgments. It reads as follows: “(1) A judge or ... the presiding judge shall pronounce a judgment at the time announced pursuant to Article 304 of this Code. (2) If the accused is not proficient in the language of the criminal proceedings, the judgment shall be interpreted or translated for him or her after its pronouncement. (3) The judge shall ask whether the person acquitted or convicted understands the judgment and explain its content to him or her if necessary. (4) A court may decide to pronounce only the operative part of the judgment, in which case it shall explain the main reasons for the judgment orally upon its pronouncement. (5) After the pronouncement of a judgment or its operative part the judge or presiding judge shall: 1) upon the pronouncement of the operative part of the judgment, give notification of the date on which the judgment will be available in court for examination by the parties to the court proceedings and shall make a corresponding notation in the record of the court hearing; 2) give notification of the term for appeal against the judgment and explain the procedure for appeal provided for in Section 318 of this Code and the possibility to waive the right of appeal; 3) explain that the county court must be notified in writing of the intention to exercise the right of appeal within seven days of the pronouncement of the judgment or its operative part. (6) Waiver of the right of appeal shall be recorded in the record of the court hearing. A lawyer may waive the right of appeal only with the written consent of the defendant. (7) If all parties to the court proceedings waive the right of appeal or if during the term provided for in paragraph 5(2) of this Article none of the parties to the court proceedings gives notification of their intention to exercise the right of appeal, only the [introductory part and operative provisions] shall be set out in the judgment. (8) If the parties to the court proceedings do not waive the right of appeal, the full judgment shall be prepared within fifteen days of the date on which the county court is notified of an intention to exercise the right of appeal.” Article 317 provides that a court must send a copy of a judgment to a party who was not present at its pronouncement (§ 1). Where the defendant is under arrest, a copy of the judgment must be sent to him or her immediately after its pronouncement or immediately after it is made available at the court's office (§ 2). Article 342 § 3 (2) provides that if a court of appeal dismisses an appeal and upholds the judgment of the first-instance court, it can limit its judgment to the introduction and operative part and make reference to the provisions of procedural law pursuant to which the judgment was made. Article 343 provides that after the parties' closing statements a court of appeal must announce the date when its judgment will be available for the parties to the proceedings at the court of appeal's office (§ 1). If the court of appeal pronounces its judgment or the operative part of the judgment immediately after deliberations, the provisions of Articles 315 and 316 apply (§ 2). Paragraph 3 provides that copies of a judgment of the court of appeal must be served in accordance with Article 317. In Article 344 § 3 the persons entitled to lodge an appeal in cassation with the Supreme Court are listed. That list includes the Prosecutor's Office, a defence lawyer (advokaat) and other parties' lawyers. Article 345 lays down the rules concerning the time-limit for an appeal in cassation. It provides that a court of appeal must be notified in writing of any intention to appeal in cassation within seven days after its judgment or the operative part of its judgment has been pronounced or made available through the court's office (§ 1). An appeal in cassation must be lodged in writing with the court of appeal within thirty days of the date when the party to the court proceedings has the opportunity to examine the judgment of the court of appeal (§ 2).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
166,001-97402,ENG,POL,CHAMBER,2010,CASE OF PINKOWSKI v. POLAND,4,No violation of P1-3,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza,"5. The applicant, Mr Mariusz Pińkowski, is a Polish national who was born in 1970 and lives in Częstochowa. 6. On 9 March 2000 the Częstochowa Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Okręgowy) charged the applicant with being an accomplice to an armed robbery and murder in France. 7. On the same date the Częstochowa District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody. The court justified its decision by the strong evidence against the applicant, the likelihood of a severe sentence of imprisonment being imposed on him if convicted and the risk that he might obstruct the proceedings. 8. On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with being an accomplice to an armed robbery, murder, false imprisonment and being a member of an organised criminal gang (no. II K 55/01). All the offences in question were alleged to have taken place in France. 9. Subsequently, on 25 May 2001 the applicant was charged with being an accomplice to an armed robbery and with the imprisonment, torture and murder of a certain A.T., and with being a member of an organised criminal gang in France. 10. On 18 June 2001 the bill of indictment was lodged with the Częstochowa Regional Court. 11. The applicant's pre-trial detention was extended by the decision of the Katowice Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) of 28 August 2000 (upheld by the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) on 2 October 2000) and the decisions of the Katowice Regional Court of 14 February, 28 June and 29 November 2001 (upheld by the Katowice Court of Appeal on 14 March, 22 August and 20 December 2001, respectively). 12. The courts referred to the original grounds for the applicant's detention and, additionally, to the international dimension of the case. 13. Meanwhile, on 1 March 2002 the Nowy Sącz Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to twenty-five years' imprisonment. The reports obtained from Polish and French forensic experts in the course of the proceedings were contradictory as regards the cause of the victim's death. However, relying on the witness testimony and other evidence, the court established that the victim had died not as a result of asphyxia (when the applicant, acting together with accomplices, strangled him with a wire and put tape around his face) as claimed by some experts but as a result of being shot by the applicant in a forest where the applicant had possibly buried him with the aid of the gang. 14. On 3 October 2002 the Kraków Court of Appeal quashed the above judgment and remitted the case to the prosecution for further investigation, with a view to eliminating the major discrepancies in the evidence obtained. 15. On 21 November 2003 the Częstochowa Regional Prosecutor issued a new decision charging the applicant with, among other offences, attempting to kill A.T. by strangling him and then hiding the body. The supplementary investigation revealed that the victim had died as a result of numerous wounds inflicted on him. In addition, the applicant was found to have incited and led the other accomplices, acting on orders from a certain R.S. All the offences in question were alleged to have taken place in France. 16. Meanwhile, the preventive measure was upheld by decisions of the Kraków Court of Appeal of 21 February, 21 August, 3 October and 31 December 2002, and 26 March, 24 September and 16 December 2003. 17. Subsequently the applicant's pre-trial detention was extended by the trial court, the Nowy Sącz Regional Court, in its decisions of 29 June and 15 November 2004 and of 29 March and 19 August 2005 (upheld by the Kraków Court of Appeal on 22 July and 9 December 2004 and on 4 May and 14 September 2005, respectively). 18. The courts reiterated the original grounds for the applicant's pre-trial detention. In addition, although they acknowledged the fact that the investigation had been lengthy, the domestic courts considered it justified in the light of the international character of the case and the fact that certain witnesses had to be examined with the aid of the French authorities. 19. On an unspecified date in early-2004 a new bill of indictment was lodged by the prosecutor (no. II K 8/04) and the case was sent to the Nowy Sącz Regional Court. 20. From 17 May 2004 until 18 November 2005 the trial court held thirteen hearings. The court examined a French witness and obtained a forensic report from a French expert. The case file comprised twenty-three volumes in Polish and twenty-nine volumes in French. 21. On 18 November 2005 the Nowy Sącz Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment. That term was reduced by the period which the applicant had already spent in pre-trial detention, from 11 March 2000 until 27 March 2001 and from 14 January 2003 until 18 November 2005. 22. On 8 March 2006 the Kraków Court of Appeal acquitted the applicant of inciting and commanding the other accomplices and upheld the remainder of the first-instance judgment. 23. On 15 February 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the cassation appeals lodged by the defence lawyers. 24. In parallel to his pre-trial detention which is the subject of the instant application, the applicant served two separate prison sentences. Between 22 April and 31 July 2002 the applicant was serving a sentence of 100 days imposed on him by a judgment of the Częstochowa District Court of an unspecified date (no. III K 1554/98). On 31 July 2002 he started serving a sentence of twelve years' imprisonment, which was imposed on him by a judgment of the Nowy Sącz Regional Court of an unspecified date (no. II K 14/06). 25. During his pre-trial detention, the applicant was first held in the Nowy Sącz Prison and later in Częstochowa Remand Centre. 26. On 14 November 2001 the Penitentiary Commission of Nowy Sącz Prison (Komisja Penitencjarna) classified him as a “dangerous detainee” (“N”). That decision was based on the information about the applicant obtained from the trial court, namely that he had been suspected of a cruel crime committed while acting in an organised criminal gang. 27. On 8 May 2003 that decision was lifted by the Penitentiary Commission of Częstochowa Remand Centre. 28. The applicant did not submit any details about the conditions of his detention under the “N” regime. 29. It appears that on 19 December 2007 the applicant was released on parole. 30. The applicant did not complain about the length of the proceedings under the Act of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki) (“the 2004 Act”). 31. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (aresztowanie tymczasowe), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are summarised in several judgments concerning similar cases (see, among others, Kauczor v. Poland, no. 45219/06, §§25-27, 3 February 2009; Gołek v. Poland, no. 31330/02, §§ 27-33, 25 April 2006; Celejewski v. Poland, no. 17584/04, §§ 22-23, 4 August 2006). 32. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning remedies for excessive length of judicial proceedings, in particular the applicable provisions of the above-mentioned 2004 Act, are stated in the Court's decisions in the cases of Charzyński v. Poland no. 15212/03 (dec.), §§ 1223, ECHR 2005-V and Ratajczyk v. Poland no. 11215/02 (dec.), ECHR 2005-VIII, and its judgment in the case of Krasuski v.

The first applicant was born in 1922 and died in 2006. The other two applicants were born in 1948 and 1946 respectively and live in Bucharest. 5. In 1950, Apartments nos. 203 and 215 situated in Bucharest, Vasile Conta no. 7-9, the property of B.M., were seized by the State under Decree no. 92/1950 on nationalisation. B.M. was S.D.’s stepfather, S.D. being the husband of the first applicant and the father of the other two applicants. 6. In 1994 S.D. together with his brother B.R. sought to have the seizure declared null and void and to recover ownership of the two apartments. 7. On 8 February 1995 the Bucharest Court of First Instance allowed the action by S.D. and ordered restitutio in integrum of the two apartments. However, on the basis of an inheritance certificate, it held that B.R. had no standing in the proceedings. An appeal by the authorities was dismissed on 20 November 1995 by the Bucharest County Court, which considered the seizure as being unlawful. That judgment became final. 8. On 12 May 1997, at the request of S.D., the Bucharest Town Council, having regard to the fact that the judgment of 8 February 1995 had become enforceable, ordered the restitution of Apartments 203 and 215. 9. Although S.D. had secured judicial recognition of his property right, he was not able to recover possession of those apartments because the State had sold them on 23 December 1996 and 13 January 1997 respectively to the then tenants, under Law no. 112/1995. 10. In 1998 S.D. lodged two requests to have the sales by the State declared null and void. S.D. died in 2000 and the applicants continued the proceedings. 11. On 7 February 2001 the Bucharest Court of Appeal, by a final decision, dismissed the action regarding Apartment 215, considering that the sale had complied with the provisions of Law no. 112/1995 and that the former tenants had made the purchase in good faith. 12. On 13 August 2001 the applicants applied to the administrative authorities for restitution of Apartment 215 under Law no. 10/2001 governing immovable property wrongfully seized by the State. By a letter of 12 April 2006 the Town Council informed the Agent of the Government that the file was incomplete as it lacked some of the necessary documents. 13. On 12 December 2002 the Court of Appeal, by a final decision, upheld the other action lodged by S.D. in 1998 and declared the sale of Apartment 203 null and void. 14. On 22 February 2008 the Bucharest Court of First Instance allowed a request by the second and third applicants to have the former tenants of Apartment 203 evicted from that apartment. On 4 December 2008 the Bucharest County Court dismissed an appeal by the former tenants. The latter lodged a further appeal on points of law. The proceedings are still pending. 15. On 20 September 1999 the Bucharest Town Council, at the request of the former tenants of Apartment 203, sought the revision of the judgment of 8 February 1995 (cerere de revizuire), on the basis of alleged new documents attesting the lawfulness of the 1950 nationalisation. The former tenants also intervened in the proceedings. 16. The Bucharest Court of Appeal dismissed that request as being out of time, by a final decision of 20 September 2001. 17. On 12 June 2002 the Town Council again sought to have that judgment revised, following a request by the same former tenants of Apartment 203, alleging that there were new documents proving that S.D. was not the only heir of B.M. The former tenants intervened in the proceedings. 18. On 20 November 2002 the Bucharest Court of First Instance dismissed the action as being out of time. There is nothing in the file to say that an appeal was lodged against that judgment. 19. On 22 November 2002, at the request of the former tenants, the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the Bucharest Court of First Instance brought proceedings to have that judgment revised, on the basis of an inheritance certificate from 1958, considered to be a new document attesting that S.D. was not the only heir. 20. On 31 January 2003 the Bucharest Court of First Instance found that request inadmissible, since that certificate could have been obtained by the authorities, which were defendants in those proceedings, with minimum diligence. 21. The prosecutor, the town council and the former tenants of Apartment 203 appealed. Eventually, on 14 February 2006 the Bucharest County Court dismissed their appeals as groundless or for lack of interest. 22. All the parties lodged a further appeal on points of law. According to the documents in the file, the proceedings are still pending. 23. On 27 April 2005 the Bucharest Town Council made a fresh attempt, at the request of the same former tenants who had intervened in the proceedings, to have the judgment of 8 February 1995 revised. The former tenants informed the Town Council that the prosecutor had found that the signatures on the 1994 application form (see paragraph 6 above) were forged, since they belonged to the plaintiffs’ lawyer, although it had been alleged that they belonged to the plaintiffs themselves. However, the prosecutor acknowledged that the lawyer’s criminal responsibility had become time-barred. 24. On 30 September 2005 the Bucharest Court of First Instance upheld the action and declared null and void the action introduced by those plaintiffs in 1994, for lack of a valid signature. 25. On 18 January 2006 the Bucharest County Court considered an appeal by the applicants as being out of time. 26. On 6 November 2006 the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed a further appeal, on points of law, by the second and third applicants, quashed the previous judgment and sent the case back for fresh consideration of the applicants’ appeal against the judgment of 30 September 2005. 27. On 13 March 2007 the Bucharest County Court allowed the applicants’ appeal against that judgment and dismissed the request for revision, considering that the application form had not represented relevant evidence in delivering that judgment. 28. The Bucharest Town Council lodged a further appeal on points of law. By a letter of 18 March 2009 the Government informed the Court that the proceedings were still pending. 29. The relevant legal provisions and jurisprudence are described in the judgments Brumărescu v. Romania ([GC], no. 28342/95, §§ 31-33, ECHR 1999VII); Străin and Others v.

She was represented before the Court by Mr Mehmet Recai Bağcı and Ms Hülya Sarsam, lawyers practising in Ankara. 5. The Turkish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent. 6. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. 7. The first applicant’s husband and the remaining applicants’ father, Hasan Çiçek, lived in the village of Boydaş, which is located within the administrative jurisdiction of Tunceli, in south-east Turkey. 8. According to the applicants, on 5 October 1994 a number of soldiers took Hasan Çiçek from his home in order to use him as a guide during a military operation conducted in the area. The applicants’ neighbours witnessed the incident. Nothing has been heard from Hasan Çiçek since that date. 9. On 18 November 1994 an article was published in a daily newspaper stating that Hasan Çiçek’s corpse had been found. The applicants were not informed of this event by the authorities. 10. On an unspecified date the first applicant filed a petition with the Hozat public prosecutor’s office and requested that an investigation be initiated into her husband’s disappearance. On 1 August 1996 the Hozat public prosecutor issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction (görevsizlik kararı) and passed the investigation to the Elazığ military prosecutor’s office. 11. On 30 November 2004 the first applicant filed a petition with the Hozat public prosecutor’s office. In her petition, she stated that forty days after the disappearance of her husband, she had found a body in the vicinity of their village. She had thought that it was her husband, as she had recognised the buttons of the shirt on the body. Noting that there had been no investigation into Hasan Çiçek’s disappearance, she requested that an investigation be conducted. 12. On 11 January 2005 the Hozat public prosecutor heard the first applicant, who reiterated her request. 13. On 2 February 2005 the Hozat public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute in respect of the first applicant’s allegations. In his decision, the public prosecutor noted that the first applicant had filed a petition with the public prosecutor’s office in 1994, at which time she had also handed over a raincoat and empty cartridges which she had found in the vicinity of their village to the public prosecutor, and that there had been a previous decision not to prosecute issued on 1 August 1996 which had been based on a lack of jurisdiction. He further noted that the first applicant had not submitted any new evidence and that her previous allegations had already been dealt with by the public prosecutor’s office. The public prosecutor concluded that there was no reason to initiate an investigation into the first applicant’s complaints. 14. On 10 February 2005 Zeynep Çiçek objected to the decision of 2 February 2005. The objection was rejected by the Erzincan Assize Court on 21 November 2005. 15. In the meantime, on 22 February 2005 the Malatya public prosecutor issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction in relation to six cases of disappearance, including that of Hasan Çiçek. In his decision, the public prosecutor noted that it had been alleged that Hasan Çiçek’s body had been found. The public prosecutor referred the cases to the Hozat public prosecutor’s office. 16. On 14 April 2005 the Elazığ military public prosecutor’s office issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction in relation to the aforementioned six cases of disappearance, including that of Hasan Çiçek, holding that the military public prosecutor’s office at the General Gendarmerie Command had jurisdiction. 17. The first applicant’s husband and the remaining applicants’ father, Nazım Gülmez, lived in the village of Taşıtlı, which is located within the administrative jurisdiction of Tunceli, in south-east Turkey. 18. According to the applicants, in October 1994 Nazım Gülmez was taken from his house by a group of soldiers so that he could help them by using his familiarity with the area to act as a guide. Nine neighbours witnessed the incident. Nothing has been heard from him since that date. 19. The mayor of the town of Hozat and mayors of the nearby towns sent a joint letter to the office of the Prime Minister. In their letter the mayors stated that large scale military operations had been conducted in their areas in October 1994. During the operations a large number of houses had been burnt down and a number of villagers – including Mr Gülmez – had been taken away by the soldiers. The bodies of two of the villagers had subsequently been found but nothing had been heard from the remaining villagers. No response was given to this letter by the Prime Minister’s office. 20. In 2002 the applicant Meneş Gülmez made an official complaint to the Hozat prosecutor. However, on 13 December 2002 the prosecutor decided that military prosecutors had jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance. In January 2003 the applicants made an application to the Elazığ military prosecutor and asked for those responsible for the disappearance to be prosecuted. 21. As no response was received from the military prosecutor, the family submitted another petition on 12 January 2004. They also stated in their petition that the military prosecutors were not allowing them to consult the investigation file. 22. On 25 January 2005 the Elazığ military prosecutor’s office informed the applicants that the investigation file had been forwarded to the Malatya State Security Court’s prosecutor. 23. On 22 February 2005 the Malatya prosecutor decided that his office lacked jurisdiction to investigate the killings and disappearances of six people, including the disappearance of Mr Nazım Gülmez. The investigation files were forwarded to the prosecutor’s office in the town of Hozat. According to this decision, the first applicant, Garip Gülmez, had been questioned by the prosecutor and had stated that her husband had been taken away from their home by soldiers. 24. On 14 April 2005 the Elazığ military prosecutor decided that his office also lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearances and killings and sent the investigation files to the military prosecutor’s office in Ankara. It appears from this decision that the Hozat prosecutor had decided on 25 March 2005 that his office did not have jurisdiction either. It also appears from the decision that, according to the Hozat prosecutor’s decision, there was evidence showing that a number of villagers had been taken away from their villages by soldiers and that nothing had been heard from those villagers since. 25. According to the applicants, on 7 June 1995 the first applicant’s husband, Edip Aksoy, and the second applicant’s son, Orhan Cingöz, were bundled into an unmarked car in Diyarbakır by three plain-clothed members of the security forces and taken away to an unknown location. Two of their friends witnessed the incident. 26. In the course of the following days and years, the applicants and their families made a number of applications to various domestic authorities, including the local prosecutors, the State Security Court, local governors, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. Most of their requests for information received no response. On some occasions they were told that the two men were not in custody. The disappearance of the two men was reported in the national media. 27. On 9 August 2001 the first applicant, Ms Aksoy, submitted a written petition to the Diyarbakır prosecutor. She alleged that her husband had been arrested and detained on a number of occasions prior to his disappearance on 7 June 1995. She asked the prosecutor to inform her as to whether there had been any developments in the investigation into the disappearance of the two men. 28. On 4 September 2001 the second applicant, Ms Cingöz, also submitted a written petition to the Diyarbakır prosecutor and asked for information about the investigation into the disappearance of her son. 29. On the same date the prosecutor questioned the second applicant and recorded her statement. She gave the prosecutor the names of the eyewitnesses to the incident. 30. On 6 July 2005 the applicants were questioned by a prosecutor in the town of Silopi in the presence of their two lawyers. The first applicant gave the prosecutor a copy of a national newspaper article published in 2004, in which it was reported that the two men had been killed by members of the security forces and then buried in a river bed next to Cudi Mountain. The newspaper article was based on information given by Mr Abdülkadir Aygan, a former agent of the JİTEM (Jandarma İstihbarat Terörle Mücadele – the anti-terror intelligence branch of the gendarmerie). A number of investigations had already been instigated into Mr Aygan’s allegations and the bodies of a number of individuals had been found in the locations described by him. 31. When the applicants were shown photographs of the bodies of people killed in the area, they told the prosecutor that two of the dead men looked like their disappeared relatives. They asked the prosecutor to identify the bodies and, if it was established that the bodies were indeed those of their relatives, they asked for the bodies to be returned to them. 32. The prosecutor ordered the exhumation of the remains of two people who had been killed in 1995 and whose bodies had been buried by the local authorities that year because no relative had claimed them. A DNA analysis conducted in 2006 showed that the two men were not the applicants’ disappeared relatives. 33. On 6 August 2008 the Diyarbakır prosecutor decided to close the investigation because the statute of limitations had expired. In the prosecutor’s decision, the offence was qualified as “deprivation of liberty”, for which the prescription period was ten years. The prosecutor considered that nothing had happened in the course of the ten years to stop the running of the time-limit. According to the documents submitted by the applicants, the prosecutor’s decision was only communicated to the first applicant, Ms Aksoy. 34. On 19 September 2008 the first applicant, with the assistance of her lawyer, lodged an objection with the Siverek Assize Court against the prosecutor’s decision. She stated that a number of newspaper articles had detailed how her husband and Mr Cingöz had been killed and where they were buried. 35. The objection was dismissed by the Siverek Assize Court on 25 November 2008. The Siverek Court did not respond to the first applicant’s arguments concerning the newspaper articles. The decision was communicated to the applicants’ lawyer on 3 January 2009. 36. In July 1995 the applicant’s 30-year-old son, Ahmet Yaman, was summoned to the Uludere District Gendarmerie Station. When he failed to return, the applicant went to the gendarmerie station to look for him. She was told that her son had been handed over to the military in Şırnak. 37. After receiving no news from her son for about a week, the applicant made an official complaint at the Uludere prosecutor’s office on 11 July 1995, and asked for her son to be found. 38. In October 1995 the Uludere prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance because, according to two eyewitnesses heard by him, the applicant’s son had disappeared in Şırnak, which was outside his jurisdiction. The prosecutor therefore forwarded the file to his opposite number in Şırnak. It also appears from the prosecutor’s decision that, in a letter sent to him on 18 July 1995, the Uludere Gendarmerie Station officials denied having summoned the applicant’s son to their station. 39. The applicant claimed that for a period of almost fourteen years she had visited various prosecutors’ offices on hundreds of occasions and had asked unsuccessfully for information about her son. 40. On 1 June 2009 the applicant, with the assistance of two legal representatives, sent a letter to the Şırnak prosecutor’s office and asked for information about the investigation into the disappearance. She claimed that the failure to find and prosecute those responsible for her son’s disappearance was in breach of Articles 2, 6 and 13 of the Convention and of applicable domestic law. 41. On 4 June 2009 the Şırnak prosecutor informed the applicant that the investigation into the disappearance of her son had been closed on 18 March 1996 by a decision of his office not to prosecute on account of a lack of evidence. 42. According to the decision of 18 March 1996, the Şırnak prosecutor’s office had been informed by the Şırnak Provincial Gendarmerie Command on 7 November 1995 that Ahmet Yaman had not been detained by them. The Şırnak prosecutor had also enquired as to the accuracy of two eyewitness statements to the effect that Ahmet Yaman had been put in a helicopter in Uludere and flown to Şırnak. In their reply of 1 December 1995 the Şırnak Gendarmerie had informed the Şırnak prosecutor that, although there were no regular helicopter flights between Uludere and Şırnak, the military did use helicopters between the two locations when the need arose. Thus, it was impossible to establish whether a helicopter flight had been made to Uludere on the day in question. 43. It also appears from the prosecutor’s decision that the applicant had informed the investigating authorities that the Şırnak Regiment’s Commander had visited a café in Uludere and told those present in the café, which had included civilians and village guards, that Ahmet Yaman was in Şırnak and would soon be released. When questioned by the Şırnak prosecutor, however, the village guards present during the commander’s visit had stated that the commander had not said anything about Ahmet Yaman. 44. Upon receiving the Şırnak prosecutor’s decision of 18 March 1996 on 4 June 2009, the applicant’s legal representatives filed an objection against it. They argued that the investigation by the Şırnak prosecutor had been inadequate. They submitted that important leads had not been followed up, not all eyewitnesses had been heard, and the prosecutor had been content to accept the written replies received from the military, rather than questioning them in person. 45. The objection was rejected by the Siirt Assize Court on 13 August 2009 on the grounds that the two legal representatives “had not been representing the applicant at the time of the adoption of the prosecutor’s decision of 18 March 1996 and the objection was thus filed outside the statutory timelimit”. 46. The Assize Court’s decision was communicated to the applicant’s lawyers on 25 August 2009. 47. Unbeknown to the applicant, on 30 September 2009 the Minister of Justice asked the Court of Cassation to set aside the Siirt Assize Court’s judgment because, the Minister argued, the applicant had lodged the objection within the time-limit foreseen in the applicable statute. 48. The Court of Cassation accepted the Ministry’s request on 13 January 2010 and quashed the Siirt Assize Court’s decision of 13 August 2009. Subsequently, the Siirt Assize Court examined the applicant’s objection against the Şırnak prosecutor’s decision and accepted it. The Assize Court ordered the prosecutor to carry out a new investigation into the disappearance of the applicant’s son. 49. The new investigation started by the Şırnak prosecutor is still pending.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
169,001-88919,ENG,MDA,ADMISSIBILITY,2008,SALINSCHI v. MOLDOVA,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Mihai Poalelungi;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Victor Salinschi, is a Moldovan national who was born in 1961 and lives in Truşeni. He was represented before the Court by Mr G. Voicu, a lawyer practising in Danceni. The Moldovan Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr V. Grosu. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 16 February 1995 a private company (“T.”) bought from the State an industrial building. The contract was authenticated by a notary on 23 February 1995 and was registered with the Bureau of Technical Inventory (which later became known as the Territorial Cadastral Office (“the TCO”)) on 27 February 1995. In January 1999 that building was sequestrated by the State Fiscal Inspectorate (“the SFI”) in settlement of debts to the State. It was then offered for auction. On 2 June 1999 the applicant succeeded in that auction. In accordance with the auction conditions, the applicant paid the price of the building (212,000 Moldovan lei, equivalent to 17,274 euros at the time) and signed the “Contract for the purchase of goods sold at auction” on 2 September 1999. According to clause 1.3 of the contract, the property right over the object sold at the auction was transferred to the buyer from the moment of signing the “act for the transfer of goods”. The parties also signed the minutes of the auction, which provided, in section (4), the obligation of the buyer to register the contract of sale with the Bureau of Technical Inventory (which later became known as the Territorial Cadastral Office (“the TCO”)). In accordance with section (6) of the minutes, the seller undertook to conclude the contract for the sale of the item “in accordance with the law, the auction conditions and the present minutes”. According to the applicant, in order to observe the requirements of sections (4) and (6) of the auction minutes, the applicant and an SFI representative appeared before a notary in order to have the contract authenticated. The notary refused, however, to authenticate the contract because the seller (the SFI) had not presented documents confirming that the building had belonged to T. and that the SFI had the right to confiscate it. No evidence was submitted to support this claim. However, the applicant submitted a letter from a notary dated 20 March 2006, according to which registration of his property right was impossible in view of certain deficiencies in the contract and the absence of several documents, which had to be produced by the seller. The applicant requested the SFI to issue the relevant documents and to have the contract authenticated by a notary. On 15 September 1999 the applicant and SFI representatives signed an “act for the transfer of goods”. On 29 December 1999 T. bought from the Chişinău Municipality a plot of land dependent on the building bought by the applicant at the auction. The applicant requested the TCO to register his title to the building on the basis of the contract of sale. On 19 January 2000 the TCO refused registration because the contract had not been authenticated by a notary as required by “civil law”. The applicant claims that he has no access to his building. His request to T. to vacate it and to allow him free possession was allegedly ignored. On 9 June 2000 the SFI repeatedly sent the TCO a copy of the sequestration order concerning the building belonging to T. On 25 August 2000 the TCO informed the applicant that no real property was registered as belonging to T. on that date. On 26 September 2000 the SFI refused to issue the applicant with any additional documents or to participate in the authentication of the contract before a notary, stating that according to the contract of sale, Government Decision no. 685 and Law no. 633-XIII (see below) the applicant had become the owner of the building from the date when he signed the “act for the transfer of goods” (i.e. 15 September 1999). The SFI considered that it had fulfilled its part of the contract and had acted in accordance with the law. On 19 December 2000 the SFI rejected another request by the applicant, following which he initiated administrative proceedings against it. On 27 March 2001 the Chişinău Regional Court left the applicant’s claim unexamined because it was not subject to administrative jurisdiction. On 6 June 2001 the Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and ordered a full re-hearing of the case. On 13 August 2001 the Chişinău Regional Court rejected the applicant’s claims as unfounded. The court found that the SFI had acted in accordance with the law and duly transmitted the rights in the property to the applicant when they both signed the ‘Act for the transfer of goods’ on 15 September 1999. The court added that, according to the law, the applicant’s property right could be registered based on the auction results and the contract concluded with the SFI, without any obligation for further formalities between the parties. It considered the refusal of the TCO to register the applicant’s right to be a separate issue that could be examined in other court proceedings, which the applicant refused to initiate. On 14 November 2001 the Court of Appeal upheld that judgment, basing itself on essentially the same arguments. It added that the law expressly mentioned the rights of a successful bidder at auction, and that there was no need to register the contract with a notary. The judgment was final. The applicant requested a review of that judgment. On 29 November 2001 the same panel of judges rejected that request. In response to a letter from the applicant, the SFI replied on 20 March 2006 that T. had never challenged the SFI’s confiscation of the building which had been sold at the auction. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code in force at the relevant time read as follows: “Article 153 The owner may request the removal of any impediment to the enjoyment of his rights even if this impediment is not related to loss of possession. Article 2402 Contracts for the sale of real estate belonging to natural and legal persons shall be authenticated by a notary and registered within three months with the [Territorial Cadastral Office].” The relevant provisions of the Law on the real estate register no. 1543XIII (25 February 1998) read as follows: “Section 29 ... (3) The documents submitted for the registration of a title must ..., in the cases provided for by law, be authenticated by a notary and sealed. ... (5) The following shall not be accepted as a basis for registration of a title: a) documents which do not correspond to the requirements under (2)-(4) above; ...” The relevant provision of the regulation “Regarding the manner of sequestration and sale of goods”, adopted by Government Decision no. 685 of 23 June 1997 read as follows: “After the signing of the sales contract the fiscal authority shall obtain the possession of sequestered goods...”. The relevant provisions of the Law regarding the manner of forced collection of taxes and other payments no. 633-XIII of 10 November 1995 read as follows: “Section 6(6) (10) After signing the contract of sale at the auction, the fiscal authority shall transmit the sequestered item to the buyer. The property right passes to the buyer from the moment of signing the act for the transfer of goods.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
170,001-23209,ENG,NOR,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,P4 RADIO HELE NORGE ASA v. NORWAY,1,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Mark Villiger,"The applicant, P4 Radio Hele Norge ASA (hereinafter referred to as P4), is a radio broadcasting company established in Norway. The applicant company is represented before the Court by Mr. Kyrre Eggen, a lawyer practising in Oslo. On 5 March 2001 P4 applied for authorisation to radiobroadcast, in whole or in part, the main hearing (hovedforhandling) in a major criminal trial concerning charges against four persons of triple murder, the so-called Orderud case, scheduled to take place before the Nes District Court (herredsrett) as from 18 April 2001. According to the applicant, this was probably the most spectacular and media-focused criminal case in Norwegian history. The case involved a son and his wife, the wife’s half-sister and a friend of the latter, who were charged with the murder of the son’s parents and sister, committed in a particularly brutal manner. The district court judge (sorenskriveren), who received the application on 26 March 2001, replied by fax: “APPLICATION FOR BROADCASTING The Orderud case Hereby rejected Nobody is granted such permission” The above decision was taken under section 131A (in its version as applicable at the relevant time) of the Administration of Courts Act 1915 (domstolloven). P4 appealed against this decision to the Eidsivating High Court (lagmannsrett) and requested it to quash the District Court’s refusal to broadcast and to give a new decision. The applicant maintained that there was no justification for refusing radio broadcasting from the lawyers’ opening statements and closing arguments and from the delivery of verdict. On 4 April 2001 the High Court dismissed (avviste) the appeal. In so far the procedure was concerned, it found no error which warranted setting aside the refusal. Regarding the substance of the decision, it held that this was a matter which by its very nature could not form the subject of an appeal (uangripelig). The High Court added incidentally that, notwithstanding this limitation on its own jurisdiction, it did not find that the disputed refusal conflicted with either the Convention provisions concerning the public character of judicial proceedings or those on freedom of expression. On 23 April 2001 the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an appeal by P4 against the High Court’s decision. The Committee’s reasoning could be summarised as follows. The Committee noted the absence, in section 131 (incorporating the provision of section 131A according to an amendment in 1999, which had not yet entered into force) of the Administration of Court’s Act 1915, of an express provision on the right to appeal against a refusal to broadcast, unlike sections 129 and 130 concerning respectively prohibition on reporting from judicial proceedings (referatforbud) and publication of judicial decisions. This suggested that section 131 decisions were not intended to be open to appeal. However, the Committee did not find it necessary to consider the applicant’s argument that a right of appeal would follow from Article 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (straffeprosessloven), since such a right could in any event follow from the fact that it had been claimed that a Convention right had been violated. In this connection the Committee mentioned the provisions of the Human Rights Act on the precedence of international human rights conventions over domestic law and Article 13 of the Convention on the right to an effective remedy for “arguable claims” of violation. The Committee noted a decision by the former Commission (Atkin and Others v. the United Kingdom, application no. 13366), which concerned complaints by two journalist under Articles 10 and 13 of the Convention about judicial orders to prohibit reporting and to hear a case in camera, rejected as manifestly ill-founded. It was found that the interference was justified for the purposes of Article 10 § 2 and that, absent an arguable claim of violation, Article 13 did not apply. The Committee further observed that the “arguable claim” criterion had been criticised in legal theory and pointed out that the condition for lodging an appeal under Norwegian procedural law was that the appellant’s claim of violation did not appear entirely unfounded. As regards the decision under challenge, the Committee, noting that the High Court had dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional ground, quoted its findings on the merits and upheld those findings. As regards the latter aspect, the Committee observed: “The Committee agrees with what has been stated by the High Court and points to the fact that the principle of publicity in Article 6 § 1 is to ensure democratic control of the courts, not the right of the public to receive information, and that the principle is preserved by the provisions on public hearing and the freedom to report in ... the Administration of the Courts Act. The Committee cannot see that the prohibition in section 131A, first paragraph, of the Act on, inter alia, recording for radio transmission from the proceedings in a criminal case infringes the right to receive and impart information under Article 10 of the Convention. It is recalled that the media are not excluded from, or imposed a duty of silence about, the proceedings. The Committee finds no support in the Court’s or the [former] Commission’s case-law for interpreting the right to freedom of expression to mean that there is a right to record from criminal proceedings with a view to radio - or television broadcasting. At last, it should be noted that, under section 131A, second paragraph, a derogation from the prohibition in the first paragraph may be made during the main hearing where there are special reasons and after having heard the views of the parties.” In the meantime, on 18 April 2001 the trial started before the District Court. It was held in open court. Because of the great media interest in the case and since the hearing room was too small to host both members of the ordinary public and media representatives, special arrangements were made enabling the press to follow the trial at a press centre, set up in a sports hall, to which sound and picture were transmitted live and shown on a television screen. Section 131A, as in force at the material time, of the Administration of Courts Act 1915 (domstolloven) provided: “During oral proceedings in a criminal case, photographing, filming and radio - or television recordings are prohibited. It is also prohibited to take photographs or make recordings of the accused or the convicted on his or her way to, or from, the hearing or when he or she is staying inside the building in which the hearing takes place, without his or her consent. If there are special reasons for doing so, the court may in the course of the proceedings make an exception from the [above] prohibition if it can be assumed that it would not unduly affect the examination of the case and no other reasons militate decisively against doing so. Before authorisation is given the parties should have an opportunity to express their views.” Article 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (straffeprosessloven) reads: “An interlocutory appeal may be brought against a court order or decision by any person who is affected thereby unless it may form the subject of an appeal proper or may serve as a ground for such an appeal by the said person, or by reason of its nature or a specific statutory provision is unchallengable.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
171,001-5688,ENG,CHE,ADMISSIBILITY,2000,"MARTI AG, CELLERE AG, GEBR. BRUN AG and STUAG AG v. SWITZERLAND",1,Inadmissible,Georg Ress,"The applicants are four companies involved in building and construction works and registered in Switzerland. Before the Court they are represented by Mr E. Rüegg, a layer practising in Baden (Switzerland). A. The Official Journal (Kantonsblatt) of the Canton of Lucerne published on 24 February 1996 an invitation for tenders by the Building Department (Baudepartement) of the Canton of Lucerne in respect of “preparatory work on the N2/6 [motorway] extension constructions for the north feeder”. In the same issue, a further invitation for tenders was published by the Kriens municipality in respect of “canalisation and water construction works to be constructed in connection with the N2 extension works for the north feeder”. The date for submitting the tenders was fixed for 25 March 1996. Offers had to state any construction works to be outsourced to other companies. The applicants submitted three tenders, i.e. for the construction of the north feeder, the canalisation and the water construction works. On 27 March 1996 the tenders were examined by the authorities. The applicants were not awarded any construction works. According to notes prepared by representatives of the applicants present upon the occasion, the tenders had been as follows: in respect of the north feeder: of the three tenders made, A. AG had offered a lower and L. AG a higher price than the applicants; in respect of the canalisation and water construction works: of the two tenders made, A. AG had offered a lower price than the applicants. Shortly afterwards a meeting was held between the administration and the applicants at which it apparently transpired that A. AG was not in fact in a position to undertake the entire construction works itself and that L. AG eventually rose to the second position of bidders in view of an alleged calculation error of 400,000 Swiss Francs in their tender. As a result, the applicants, pursuant to Section 6 of the Tenders Act (Submissionsgesetz, see below, Relevant domestic law) filed a complaint with the Government (Regierungsrat) of the Canton of Lucerne. They maintained that there had been procedural defects and breaches of the Tenders Act, inter alia, in that A. AG, in its tender, had omitted to specify which constructions would be outsourced to other companies; and that the tender of L. AG contained elements of unfair competition. The Government of the Canton of Lucerne dismissed the complaint on 14 June 1996, pointing out that the award had found that A. AG would be in a position to undertake substantial parts of the construction works itself, and that the tender of L. AG had contained an error in that one particular price had been multiplied by 100. The applicants filed an administrative law appeal (Verwaltungsgerichtsbeschwerde) with the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht) of the Canton of Lucerne in which they complained that they had not had access to a court within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. They further complained that they had not been able to consult the case-file and that the law had been incorrectly applied. On 16 July 1996 the Court found that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. In particular, Article 6 of the Convention was inapplicable as the applicants had not demonstrated the existence of a “right” within the meaning of that Article. The applicants’ further administrative law appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court (Bundesgericht) on 12 November 1996, the decision being served on 22 November. In its decision, that court found that the applicants had no standing in view of its constant case-law according to which decisions on tenders did not concern legally protected rights, as would be required when filing an administrative law appeal. In respect of the applicants’ complaint about lack of access to a court within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the court considered that this provision did not itself grant new substantive rights but was applicable only if a “right” arose under domestic law. No such right existed if it could not be claimed before a court. The court then referred to Sections 18 and 19 of the Ordinance (Verordnung) completing the Tenders Act (see below, Relevant domestic law). These provisions envisaged, in principle, that tenders with lower prices would prevail, though, according to Section 18 § 2 of the Ordinance, the lowest offer is not always the cheapest. As a result, domestic law did not grant a “right” to be awarded a particular offer upon tender, for which reason Article 6 § 1 of the Convention was not applicable. B. Relevant domestic law The 1973 Tenders Act (Submissionsgesetz) of the Canton of Lucerne deals with invitations for tenders and with the award of construction works by the Canton of Lucerne and its municipalities. Section 3 determines that construction works shall as a rule be awarded following a competitive invitation for tenders. Section 6 provides for an appeal to the Government (Regierungsrat) for those applicants whose personal interests worthy of protection are at issue (in ihren persönlichen schützenswerten Interessen beeinträchtigt). The Ordinance (Verordnung) completing the Tenders Act provides, insofar as relevant: “Section 18 Principles governing award. (a) General 1. Construction works and supplies are to be awarded, based on the principle of economy, to the candidate who has made the cheapest offer (günstigstes Angebot). 2. The cheapest offer will be the one with the lowest price (tiefster Preis) as long as the implementation of the construction works or supplies corresponds to the substantive requirements and the time-limit. The lowest tender (niedrigstes Angebot) will not, therefore, always be the cheapest. Section 19 (b) In case of equal or similar tenders 1. In case of equal or similar tenders, the following criteria shall be considered: (a) proof of good performance; (b) variety among the candidates; (c) degree of employment when implementing the construction works; (d) tax domicile in the Canton of Lucerne or in the municipality concerned; (e) payment of taxes in the Canton of Lucerne or in the municipality concerned; (f) use of local construction materials and products; (g) professional qualifications of the head of enterprise (e.g. master craftsman) and of the employees; (h) training of apprentices; (i) securing and maintaining employment in the Canton of Lucerne or the municipalities concerned. 2. The order of relevance when employing the criteria mentioned in § 1 shall be determined by the awarding authority individually and according to the situation concerned, in particular in the light of the economic situation.” According to Section 22 of the Ordinance, the authority concerned is not obliged to give reasons to candidates whose tender has not been considered. Meanwhile, Section 9 of the Federal Act on a Common Market (Binnenmarktgesetz) provides for an appeal to a court in case of alleged restricted access to the common market, but this provision entered into force only on 1 July 1998.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
172,001-91528,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2009,SCHAEDEL v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger;Peer Lorenzen;Rait Maruste;Renate Jaeger;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"The applicant, Mr Bernd Schaedel, is a German national who was born in 1941 and lives in Berlin. He was represented before the Court by Ms M. Biedermann-Weist, a lawyer practising in Berlin. The applicant was a citizen of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) who absconded to West Berlin in May 1988. His real property was subsequently placed under GDR State guardianship and sold to members of the GDR nomenclature (hereinafter the “occupiers”) in December 1988. The occupiers were registered as owners of the property on 2 January 1989 and lived in the house built on the property. On 13 August 1990 the applicant applied for the restitution of the property. On 25 July 1996 the Hellersdorf-Hohenschönhausen-Marzahn Office for the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues (Amt zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen) decided, inter alia, that the occupiers had not acquired the property in good faith and ordered that the property be returned. The occupiers appealed against that decision. On 7 March 2002 the Berlin Administrative Court ordered the return of the property to the applicant, and from that date the applicant was the owner of the property. The occupiers withdrew their application for leave to appeal on points of law on an unspecified date and subsequently vacated the property in September 2002. On 29 December 2003 the Berlin Regional Court refused to grant the applicant legal aid for a claim against the occupiers to obtain compensation for use of the property as regards the period from 1990 to September 2002 on the ground that his application had no prospect of success. As to the period from 1990 to 7 March 2002, and relying on a leading judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 23 April 1999 (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below), the court noted that section 7(7) of the Act on the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues / Property Act (Gesetz zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen/ Vermögensgesetz – hereinafter the “Property Act”, see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below) excluded compensation for the remaining period when the occupiers were registered as owners and had used the property solely as a dwelling. Any claim for compensation for use of property for the period between March 2002 and September 2002 could only be raised before a district court in view of the value of the claim. On 10 February 2004 the Berlin Court of Appeal upheld that decision. On 27 September 2004 the Berlin Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant’s complaint for examination. On 12 January 2005 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant’s constitutional complaint for examination (no. 1 BvR 2852/04). Under section 7(7) of the Property Act, an owner is not entitled to claim compensation for use of property from the tenants unless otherwise agreed or in respect of rent obtained after 1 July 1994. On 23 April 1999 the Federal Court of Justice held in a leading judgment (published in that court’s official reports [BGHZ] volume 141, pp. 232 et seq.) that there were no lacunae in section 7(7) of the Property Act and hence no justification for its analogous application to claims for compensation for use of property other than those concerning rent obtained by the tenant after 1 July 1994. The court noted that the tenant was fully entitled to enjoy the property and its fruits prior to restitution. Citing the relevant legislative materials, the court further noted that the legislature had provided for the exception only to urge occupiers to use the rent to maintain the property prior to restitution.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
173,001-22288,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,GREUTER v. THE NETHERLANDS,3,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Petronella Greuter, is a Dutch national, born in 1964 and living in Amsterdam. She is represented before the Court by Mr G.P. Hamer, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s partner, Mr P., was killed on 23 March 1997 in Beverwijk during a fight between supporters of the Amsterdam soccer club Ajax and supporters of the Rotterdam soccer club Feijenoord. Following an investigation by the regional police Haarlem–Kennemerland of the killing of Mr P., a number of suspects were arrested. Shortly afterwards, the regional police Amsterdam-Amstelland opened an investigation into whether and to what extent Ajax supporters formed part of a criminal organisation specifically involved in (the organisation of) fights and/or street vandalism and violence. In this context, the Amsterdam public prosecutor (officier van justitie) opened a preliminary judicial investigation (gerechtelijk vooronderzoek) against NN (nomen nescio; i.e. against a person or persons unknown). In the course of this preliminary judicial investigation and upon the request of the public prosecutor, the investigating judge (rechtercommissaris) authorised the tapping of a telephone line, the number for which was registered in the applicant’s name. It was tapped between 28 March and 11 April 1997. In addition, the investigating judge authorised that a print-out be obtained of all telephone communications having taken place on this line between 1 January 1997 and 1 May 1997. At no point did any suspicions arise that the applicant herself had been involved in any criminal activities. The lawyer who was acting on the applicant’s behalf in the criminal proceedings against the suspected perpetrators of the killing of Mr P., and who also acted as defence counsel in criminal proceedings against a soccer supporter called W., learned of the existence of the tapping of the applicant’s telephone, as it was mentioned in W.’s case-file. With W.’s permission, the lawyer informed the applicant of the tapping of her telephone. In a letter of 9 October 1997, the applicant’s lawyer put the following questions to the public prosecutor: “a. Is it correct that the above telephone number has been tapped under your responsibility? b. If so, during which period has this taken place? c. Can you tell me when you informed my client of this, i.e. that her telephone was tapped during a certain period? d. In case this has not taken place so far, when would you have intended to do so and, if so, mentioning what grounds? e. What were the reasons for the “tapping” and of what criminal offence was she suspected? f. Is she still suspected of having committed that criminal offence? g. Would you kindly provide me, on behalf of <the applicant>, with a copy of all conversations that were recorded and listened to, in particular all the formal records of interception (processen–verbaal van opname).” In his reply of 15 October 1997, the public prosecutor informed the applicant’s lawyer as follows: “In answer to a number of your questions I could refer you to the formal record that is already in your possession in your capacity as the lawyer of the suspect W. On page 26 of that record it is set out that and why the telephone of your client <the applicant> has been tapped. I will nevertheless reply to your questions point by point. a. Yes. b. From 28 March 1997 to 11 April 1997. c. I have not informed her of this. d. I did not have the intention to inform her of this, since the tapping took place in the context of a preliminary judicial investigation against NN. e. Your client was the partner of Mr P., who was killed during the clash between Ajax and Feijenoord supporters in Beverwijk and who was formerly a barkeeper in the café U., that was owned by your client and where, according to the information of the Criminal Intelligence Service (Criminele Inlichtingen Dienst; “CID”), the hard core group of Ajax supporters gathered. On this ground it was considered plausible that as yet unknown members of the hard core group, who were involved in acts of violence, could have contacts via the telephone number at issue. Your client was not suspected of a criminal offence in this connection. f. See the last sentence under e. g. No. The tapping has – as said – not taken place in the context of criminal proceedings against your client. A number of intercepted telephone conversations have been added to the note requesting authorisation to conduct a house search in connection with one of the suspects. In consultation with the investigating judge, it has been decided to grant you access to those conversations.” In his letter of 17 October 1997 to the public prosecutor, the applicant’s lawyer pointed out, inter alia, that the applicant had sold café U. nearly three years ago and that it would have been understandable had the café’s telephone been tapped, but the fact that the applicant’s private telephone line had been tapped was incomprehensible. The lawyer requested the information which had led to the telephone tapping, and a copy of the memoranda and other evidentiary items indicating that the applicant’s telephone line would be used by members of the hard core group, and that these persons maintained contacts via this telephone. In his reply of 23 October 1997, the public prosecutor stated inter alia: “... My answer is possibly understandable ... when you see the situation as a whole and not only for a part thereof. Let me, in spite of this, formulate it differently: your client was the owner of a café where the group of Ajax hard core supporters met regularly. The suspicion that members of this hard core group would maintain contacts via the private telephone line of your client is not so incomprehensible when account is taken of the fact that your client’s partner, Mr P., apparently belonged to that group since he went along to the planned violent clash between the hard core of Ajax supporters and the hard core of Feijenoord supporters, during which clash he was killed. In any event, the investigating judge considered this sufficient to issue an authorisation for tapping the telephone number concerned. Since your client is not a suspect in this case, I will not add the ‘memoranda and other evidentiary items’ requested by you.” On 27 October 1997, the applicant’s lawyer transmitted a copy of the letter of 23 October 1997 to the investigating judge, requesting a copy of the documents he had asked for in his letter of 17 October 1997. Despite a reminder sent on 13 January 1998, it remained unanswered. Until 1 February 2000, the rules about the interception of communications made through public telecommunication networks or services were set out in Articles 125f-h of the Dutch Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering; the “CCP”). Further rules on the practical exercise of the power to intercept communications were set out in the Guidelines for the Interception of Telephone Conversations (Richtlijnen Onderzoek van Telefoongesprekken) of 2 July 1984, a copy of which could be obtained by any interested person. The text of these Guidelines had further been published in, inter alia, the Netherlands Journal for Human Rights (Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Mensenrechten) of July/August 1989. These Guidelines, which did not have the formal character of law, had been issued as a model letter from the senior public prosecutors to the police. The above rules initially only covered communications by telephone. As from 1 March 1993, when the Act on Computer Criminality (Wet op de Computercriminaliteit) entered into force, they also covered communications by fax and e-mail. On 1 February 2000, when the Act of 27 May 1999 on amendments of the CCP in relation to special methods of criminal investigation entered into force, the provisions of Article 125f-h of the CCP were replaced by Articles 126m and 126n of the CCP. Pursuant to Article 125g of the CCP, as in force at the material time, the tapping of communications can only be effected in regard to offences for which detention on remand (voorlopige hechtenis) may be imposed, i.e. offences of a certain gravity carrying a punishment of imprisonment of four years or more (Article 67 CCP). The tapping can only concern communications in which a suspect is likely to participate, and it can only be ordered where the investigation urgently requires it. It must be authorised by the investigating judge. Furthermore, a record (proces-verbaal) of the tapping must be prepared within 24 hours. Under Article 125h of the CCP, as in force at the relevant time, records without importance for the investigation must be destroyed as soon as possible by order of the investigating judge. As to the destruction of information obtained via the interception of telephone conversations, the standard practice in fact differed from the Guidelines. On the basis of, inter alia, the Court’s findings in the cases of Kruslin and Huvig v. France (judgments of 24 April 1990, Series A no. 176-A&B) as regards the possibility of inspection by the judge and by the defence, the official records and transcripts of tapped telephone conversations were not destroyed immediately but were kept until shortly after the closure of the case. Anyone requesting access to such material was required to give reasons for such a request. Where no suspect can be identified immediately and in order to obtain a tapping authorisation from the investigating judge, a preliminary judicial investigation against a person or persons unknown (“NN”) may be opened. As soon as the name(s) of the suspected perpetrator(s) can be established, the preliminary judicial investigation is to be put in the name of the suspect(s) concerned (Article 181 § 1 of the CCP). By subsequently availing him or herself of the right to be granted access to the case-file (Article 30 § 1 of the CCP), a suspect can become aware of the fact that communications have been tapped during the investigation. Until 1 February 2000, the Code of Criminal Procedure itself contained no provision on the period during which tapping of telecommunications may be carried out. However, pursuant to the Guidelines on the Interception of Telephone Conversations, a period of not more than four weeks was set. Prolongations could also not exceed four weeks. After two weeks the responsible police officer was required to submit an interim report to the public prosecutor and the investigating judge. The provisions of Articles 126m and 126n of the Criminal Code, as in force as from 1 February 2000, incorporated these four-week rules.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

UKRAINE,2,Violation of P1-1;Pecuniary damage - financial award;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings,Peer Lorenzen,"5. The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in the town of Malaya Vyska, the Kirovograd region, Ukraine. 6. On 9 April 1997 the applicant sold his house for UAH 35,000 to the Kirovograd Regional Department of Justice (hereafter “the Department”), responsible for the logistical support of the judiciary. The Department was represented in the transaction by Mr R., the President of the Malaya Vyska City Court. The contract was certified by a notary and specified that the purchase price had to be paid in two instalments: UAH 5,000 and 30,000 to be paid by 1 May 1997 and 1 September 1997 respectively. The contract also contained a clause stating the following: “In case if the exchange rate of the Hryvna depreciates the overall sum to be paid cannot be less than the Hryvna equivalent of USD 17,000.” 7. In June 1997 the applicant was paid UAH 5,000. In 1998 the Hryvna substantially weakened against US dollar. In October 1998 and August 1999 the applicant received UAH 11,000 and 20,000 respectively. 8. The applicant instituted proceedings against the Department, claiming that it had failed to fulfil its obligations under the contract, as the sum paid did not take into account the substantial depreciation of the exchange rate of the Hryvna. Thus, according to the applicant, he had lost some USD 6,553. 9. On 4 November 1999 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd (hereafter “the District Court”) rejected this claim as unsubstantiated. On 8 September 2000 the Presidium of the Kirovograd Regional Court, following the protest (extraordinary appeal) of the Deputy President of this court, quashed the judgment and remitted the case. 10. On 29 November 2000, in the course of a new hearing, the Department lodged a counterclaim seeking the annulment of the contract on the ground that Mr R. had exceeded his powers in agreeing to the dollar value clause. 11. On 24 July 2001 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd granted the applicant’s claim and rejected that of the Department. The court established that the clause in issue aimed at ensuring the stability of the contract and protecting the applicant against inflation. The court further found that the applicant had suffered increased financial losses due to the erosion of the Hryvna’s purchasing power during the lengthy delay in execution of the contract. It found that the amount eventually paid to him on the date of the final transaction had only been USD 10,457.50. The court awarded the applicant UAH 35,527.77 in compensation for the devaluation of the Hryvna, UAH 3,197.31 in statutory interest for the delay and UAH 502.13 in court costs. 12. The Department appealed against this judgment and, on 20 December 2001, the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (hereafter “the Court of Appeal”) quashed it and rejected the applicant’s claim. The court found in favour of the Department on both of their objections. It noted that Mr R. had acted ultra vires by conceding the inclusion of the disputed provision in the contract without the prior consent from the Department. The Court of Appeal further stated that, according to Article 3 of the Governmental Decree on the Regime of Currency Regulation and Currency Control 1993 (the 1993 Decree), the Hryvna was the only currency which could be used for internal transactions. The court did not find convincing the District Court’s argument that the impugned clause protected the applicant from inflation, since Article 214 of the Civil Code 1963 provided for compensation for losses incurred due to inflation if the execution of a contract was delayed. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the price for the apartment was paid with considerable delay and that the applicant, having made the relevant claim before the court, had the right to be awarded statutory interest at the rate of 3% per annum. Taking into account that the applicant had already received an extra thousand Hryvnas (paragraph 6 above), the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to award him further UAH 678.50. 13. On 30 May 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation. 14. Article 3 of the Decree provided that the currency of Ukraine (i.e. the Hryvna) was the only lawful means of payment in Ukraine. 15. According to Article 48 of the Code, a contract concluded contrary to the law should be declared invalid. If the contract is invalidated the parties should return to each other all that was received in execution of the contract. 16. Article 214 of the Code provided that a debtor who had delayed the execution of a financial undertaking was obliged, on the request of the creditor, to pay the debt taking into account the established index of inflation for the period of delay, as well as statutory interest at 3% per annum.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Inadmissible,Josep Casadevall;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr Colin Doyle, is a British national who was born in 1947 and lives in Brussels. The applicant moved to Belgium in 1983 where he has resided ever since. On 13 June 2006, he enquired about registering on the electoral role in the United Kingdom. On 11 July 2006 the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) stated that on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 2002 only nationals resident overseas for less than 15 years could register to vote in United Kingdom general and European elections. It was pointed out that he could be reinstated on the electoral role if he returned to live in the United Kingdom and that he was entitled to vote in the European elections in Belgium as a citizen of the European Union. It was also drawn to his attention that eligibility to vote in other countries generally depended on domestic law but that nationality was generally a requirement: he could therefore apply for Belgian nationality, or dual nationality if he did not wish to lose his British nationality. By way of general information, custom and practice was said to differ in European Union States, Danish citizens overseas losing the right to vote after 8-10 years and no overseas Irish citizen being allowed to vote at all. The Representation of the People Act 1985 provided for the first time for United Kingdom citizens living overseas to be able to register to vote in general and European Parliamentary elections in the United Kingdom. The applicable time-limit was five years, which was extended to 20 years by the Representation of People Act 1989 (entry into force 1990). The Representation of the People Act 2002, after debate in both Houses of Parliament, considered however that 15 years was a more appropriate period and the legislation was amended as from 1 April 2002).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He is an honorary vice-president of the State Audit Council (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο) and resides in Athens. The facts of the case as submitted by the parties may be summarised as follows. On 1 July 1984 the post of vice-president of the State Audit Court was declared vacant. At that time the applicant was the senior judge. The post remained vacant for three years and was filled by the applicant on 30 July 1987. On 28 November 1988 the applicant brought an action for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages against the State before the First Instance Administrative Court of Athens. In particular, the applicant claimed that he should have been promoted soon after the post was declared vacant and that the delay of the Administration to promote him to the post of vice-president of the State Audit Court caused him pecuniary damage and raised suspicions as to his abilities. On 6 October 1989 the Court granted the applicant’s claim insofar as it concerned non-pecuniary damage. The Court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s action on the ground that he had no enforceable claim to the vacant post. On 24 November and 29 December 1989 respectively the applicant and the State appealed against this decision. On 17 May 1990 the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and annulled the decision of the First Instance Administrative Court. The Court of Appeal referred in particular to the discretionary powers by which the competent administrative authorities organised their activity. On 15 July 1990 the applicant appealed to the Council of State. On 23 January 1995 the First Chamber of the Council of State composed of five judges decided to refer the case to a Chamber composed of seven judges. On 27 November 1995 the First Chamber of the Council of State composed of seven judges decided to refer the case to the Plenary because of the important issues it raised. On 17 October 1997 the Council of State sitting in Plenary rejected the applicant’s appeal. In particular the Council of State held that it was beyond the competence of the Court of Appeal to decide whether the decision to promote the applicant should be backdated. Therefore the Court of Appeal was right in rejecting the applicant’s appeal. The applicant obtained a copy of that decision in January 1998.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
177,001-4554,ENG,AUT,ADMISSIBILITY,1999,SAHINTÜRK v. AUSTRIA,4,Inadmissible,Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant is a Turkish national, born in 1970. He is currently living in Turkey. He is represented before the Court by Mr. R. Soyer, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The applicant lived in Austria with his parents and siblings since 1978. He went to school there and later on took up employment. His parents and one brother have meanwhile acquired Austrian citizenship. On 27 September 1992 the Vienna Federal Police Authority (Bundespolizeidirektion) revoked the applicant’s unlimited residence permit. It noted that the Vienna Regional Criminal Court, on 19 September 1990, had convicted the applicant of damage to property and burglary and had sentenced him to four months’ imprisonment suspended on probation. On 6 December 1991 the same court had convicted him of attempted theft and attempted intimidation and had sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment suspended on probation. In view of these convictions, both of which were final, the applicant no longer fulfilled the requirements for an unlimited residence permit. On 13 January 1993 the Vienna Federal Police Authority issued a residence ban of unlimited duration against the applicant on account of his convictions. On 14 July 1993 the Vienna Public Security Authority (Sicherheitsdirektion), upon the applicant’s appeal, quashed the residence ban against him. It relied on S. 20 § 2 of the 1992 Aliens Act (Fremdengesetz) according to which no residence ban may be issued against an alien if it would have been possible to grant him citizenship under S. 10 § 1 of the Citizenship Act, i.e. if he has been resident in Austria without interruption for ten years, before the offences in question were committed, except in case of offences punishable with more than five years’ imprisonment. On 17 June 1994 the Vienna Regional Government dismissed the applicant’s request for a residence permit. His appeal to the Federal Ministry for the Interior was to no avail. On 1 February 1995 the Vienna Federal Police Authority issued a deportation order against the applicant. It relied on S. 17 of the 1992 Aliens Act, according to which illegally resident aliens are to be ordered to leave the Federal territory. It noted that in addition to his convictions in 1990 and 1991, the applicant had been convicted of possession of illicit drugs by the Vienna District Criminal Court on 7 May 1992, without an additional sentence being passed. On 12 October 1992 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court had convicted him of making illicit drugs accessible to minors and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. On 3 March 1993 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court had convicted him of a number of offences including aggravated fraud, theft, assault and obstructing public authority and had sentenced him to eight months’ imprisonment. The authority acknowledged that the deportation constituted a serious interference with the applicant’s private and family life. According to S. 19 of the 1992 Aliens Act a deportation order was only to be issued if it was necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Having regard to the applicant’s repeated convictions including those for drugs offences, which involved particular dangers for public safety, the public interest in deporting him outweighed his interest in remaining in Austria. On 24 April 1995 the Vienna Public Security Authority dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 13 June 1995 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) refused to entertain the applicant’s complaint. Subsequently, it referred the case to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). On 8 February 1996 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found that the deportation order against the applicant was necessary within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the interests of public safety and the prevention of crime, having regard to his prolonged illegal residence since the withdrawal of his residence permit and the gravity of the offences, in particular the drugs offences, committed by him. The decision was served on the applicant on 15 May 1996.  On 21 July 1996 the applicant left Austria and is now living in Turkey.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
178,001-115323,ENG,AUT,ADMISSIBILITY,2012,JENIK  v. AUSTRIA AND OTHER APPLICATIONS,4,Inadmissible,Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Peer Lorenzen,"1. The applicant Mr Wilhelm Jenik, is an Austrian national who was born in 1955 and lives in Vienna. He is represented by Mr H. Pochieser, a lawyer practising in Vienna. The Austrian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ambassador Helmut Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicant is unemployed and has been receiving welfare benefits for himself and his three children for approximately ten years. Under the Vienna Welfare Act (Wiener Sozialhilfegesetz), he is entitled to monthly payments and, in addition, to certain extra allowances and non-cash benefits as specified by law and upon specific request. 4. On 4 May 2004 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority, seeking temporary pecuniary assistance (Geldaushilfe) in addition to the benefits already received, without specifying an amount. By an oral decision of the same day the Vienna Municipal Authority granted him 915.85 euros (EUR). 5. On 8 June 2004 the Vienna Municipal Authority, at the applicant’s request, provided him with a written copy of the above oral decision. The applicant, who was not satisfied with the amount granted, appealed on 29 June 2004. 6. On 15 November 2004 the Vienna Regional Government dismissed the applicant’s appeal and lowered the amount to EUR 901.20. 7. On 3 October 2005 the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with the Administrative Court and asked for an oral hearing. He argued that the Vienna Regional Government’s decision had been unlawful, in that the Regional Government had not been competent to take the impugned decision, its decision was not sufficiently reasoned and it had not applied the provisions of the Vienna Social Welfare Act correctly. The authorities should have granted him a rent allowance equivalent to the full amount of rent paid by him, because rents were high in Vienna and they had not objected to the applicant moving to a bigger apartment with his children. 8. On 15 December 2006 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. It found that the Vienna Regional Government had been competent to take the impugned decision and had decided properly on the applicant’ 9. In so far as the applicant had complained that he should have been entitled to full reimbursement of the rent paid by him, the Administrative Court found that, in accordance with the law, a rent allowance was linked to the specific size of an apartment, with a fixed maximum amount for certain sizes. Only in very special circumstances could a higher amount be granted. The applicant had, however, failed throughout the proceedings to give any specific reasons, corroborated by evidence, as to why he should receive a higher rent allowance. The mere indication that rents in Vienna were high was not a sufficient argument within the meaning of the Social Welfare Act. With regard to the applicant’s request for an oral hearing, the Administrative Court found that the present case concerned only questions of law which, in line with the Court’s case-law, did not necessitate a hearing, and accordingly dismissed the request. 10. On 15 June 2004 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority, seeking an additional allowance from June 2004 onwards, without specifying an amount. 11. On 23 July 2004 the Vienna Municipal Authority granted his request, awarding him EUR 1,422.80. On 29 July 2004 the applicant, who was not satisfied with the amount granted, appealed. 12. On 23 November 2004 the Vienna Regional Government granted the applicant’s appeal and raised the amount to EUR 2,115.30. 13. On 3 October 2005 the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against this decision and requested an oral hearing. He submitted the same arguments as in his complaint to the Administrative Court concerning his request of 4 May 2004. 14. On 15 December 2006 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint and his request for an oral hearing for the same reasons as in its decision of the same day relating to the applicant’s request of 4 May 2004. 15. On 30 June 1998 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority seeking an additional allowance from May 1998 onwards, reimbursement of the costs incurred for the repair of his washing machine and the payment of several electricity, gas and rent bills; this was granted by several decisions of the Vienna Municipal Authority, including those of 6 July 1998, 27 August 1998 and 15 December 1998. 16. On 4 July 2001 the Vienna Regional Government rejected the applicant’s request to transfer jurisdiction to the superior authority, on the ground that the Vienna Municipal Authority and the Regional Government itself had already decided on the matter and had granted the requested benefits. 17. On 6 September 2001 the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with the Administrative Court, together with an application alleging a breach of the administrative authorities’ duty to decide; he also requested legal aid and asked the court to hold a public hearing. 18. On 2 May 2002 the Administrative Court ordered the applicant to provide further information about his complaint. The applicant complied on 18 June 2002. 19. On 25 July 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint; this decision was served on his counsel on 21 August 2007. The Administrative Court listed in detail the decisions taken by the Municipal Authority and the Regional Government between 24 April 1998 and 27 August 1998 in response to the numerous requests lodged by the applicant during this period, from which the Regional Government had concluded that the applicant’s request of 30 June 1998 had been decided upon. They had, therefore, taken proper decisions, satisfying all the statutory requirements. In such a situation the applicant could not merely claim that one of his requests had not been decided upon, but had to substantiate his allegations by referring to details. Since he had not done so, the Regional Government had acted correctly in dismissing his request for transfer of jurisdiction. With regard to the applicant’s request for an oral hearing, the Administrative Court found that the present case only concerned questions of law which, in line with the Court’s case-law, did not necessitate the holding of a hearing and therefore dismissed the request. 20. On 8 February 2001 the applicant filed a request for additional allowances for cultural and education matters. 21. On 1 March 2001 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed the applicant’s request of 8 February 2001. 22. On 4 May 2001 the Vienna Regional Government dismissed his appeal against this decision. 23. On 20 June 2001 the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against the Regional Government’s decision and requested legal aid. 24. On 3 August 2007 the Administrative Court remitted the complaint to the applicant in order for procedural defects to be remedied. At the same time it dismissed the request for legal aid, finding that, in view of its caselaw, the complaint had no prospect of success. In view of the refusal of legal aid the applicant did not pursue the proceedings. 25. On 12 December 2000 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority, seeking an additional allowance, amounting to EUR 2000 for heating and electricity. 26. On 24 January 2001 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed his request, and on 20 June 2001 the Vienna Regional Government dismissed his appeal. 27. Having been granted legal aid, the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against that decision on 17 June 2002. 28. On 27 September 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. 29. On 1 March 2001 the applicant filed a request for an additional allowance for heating and electricity, amounting to EUR 63.80. 30. On 8 March 2001 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed his request, and, on 12 September 2001, the Vienna Regional Government dismissed his appeal. 31. Having been granted legal aid, the applicant filed a complaint against this decision with the Administrative Court on 17 July 2002. 32. On 27 September 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. 33. On 2 February 2001 the applicant filed a request for an additional allowance for heating and electricity, amounting to EUR 65.40 per month. 34. On 1 March 2001 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed his request, and, on 19 September 2001, the Vienna Regional Government dismissed his appeal. 35. On 14 December 2001 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s request for legal aid, considering that, in view of its case-law, the complaint had no prospect of success. 36. On 7 June 2002, having been granted legal aid, the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against the Regional Government’s decision. 37. On 27 September 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the complaint. That decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 17 October 2007. 38. On 12 June 1997 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority, seeking an additional allowance for the period from June until July 1997. 39. On 23 May 2001 the Vienna Regional Government granted the applicant’s request of 20 February 2001 to transfer jurisdiction to the superior authority on the ground of the Vienna Municipal Authority’s failure to decide; being competent to decide the matter itself, it dismissed the applicant’s request by a decision of the same day. 40. On 19 June 2002, having been granted legal aid, the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against this decision and asked the court to hold a public hearing. He argued that the authority had incorrectly applied the law and had not properly reasoned its decision, and that the facts of the case needed to be supplemented, since the calculation of his resources had taken into account alimony payments for his son W. from his former wife which he had not actually received. This point therefore needed to be further developed. 41. On 27 September 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint without having held a hearing. The Administrative Court found that the authority had properly reasoned its decision and had applied correctly the relevant provisions of the Vienna Social Welfare Act. With regard to the applicant’s argument that the authority should not have taken account of alimony payments from his former wife for his son W., the Administrative Court found that, even if it accepted the applicant’s position, namely that he had not received payments to which he had been entitled and that they should not therefore be taken into account when assessing his income, that income was still above the statutory limit (Richtsatz), so that he was not entitled to an additional allowance. Lastly, referring to the Court’s case-law, the Administrative Court found that in the present case it had only to deal with questions of law which could adequately be resolved on the basis of the case file and the parties’ written observations, and therefore dismissed the request for a hearing. 42. On 20 February 2000 the applicant filed a request with the Vienna Municipal Authority, seeking an additional allowance for heating costs from October 1999 onwards. 43. On 8 February 2001 the Vienna Regional Government granted the applicant’s request of 7 September 2000 to transfer jurisdiction to the superior authority on account of the Vienna Municipal Authority’s failure to decide, and at the same time granted an additional allowance amounting to 3,438 Austrian shillings (ATS - EUR 250). 44. On 9 May 2001, having been granted legal aid, the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court against that decision. On 27 September 2007 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. That decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 17 October 2007. 45. On 11 and 23 November 2004 the applicant filed requests for reimbursement of the expenses incurred in the purchase of a Christmas tree (EUR 35) and an Advent wreath (Adventskranz – EUR 7.90). 46. On 15 December 2004 the Vienna Municipal Authority dismissed these requests, finding that as this kind of expense was already covered by the monthly payment received by the applicant, additional grants could not be made. 47. On 17 February 2005 the Vienna Independent Administrative Panel dismissed the applicant’s appeal against this decision, but corrected the first instance’s decision to the effect that the applicant’s requests were rejected. It did not hold a hearing. 48. On 27 September 2005 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s request for legal aid of 5 October 2005, finding that, in view of its case-law on the matter, the complaint had no prospect of success. 49. On 5 August 2005 the Administrative Court granted the applicant legal aid. 50. On 21 October 2005 the applicant filed a complaint with the Administrative Court; on 15 November 2005 he filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court. 51. On 8 March 2006 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the complaint, as did the Administrative Court on 2 July 2008.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Ms Henryka Ostrowska, is a Polish national, who was born in 1956 and lives in Mielec. 2. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr J. Wołąsiewicz, succeeded by Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 11 July 2001 the applicant filed an application with the Rzeszów Social Security Board (Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych) (“SSB”) to be granted the right to an early-retirement pension for persons raising children who, due to the seriousness of their health condition, required constant care, the so-called “EWK” pension. 5. On 1 August 2001 the Rzeszów Social Security Board issued a decision granting the applicant the right to an earlyretirement pension in the net amount of 521 Polish zlotys (PLN). 6. On 30 September 2002 the Rzeszów Social Security Board issued simultaneously two decisions in respect of the applicant. By virtue of one decision, the payment of the applicant’s pension was discontinued with immediate effect. By virtue of the other decision, the Board reopened the proceedings, revoked the initial decision granting a pension and eventually refused to grant the applicant the right to an early-retirement pension under the scheme provided for by the 1989 Ordinance. 7. The applicant appealed against the respective decisions divesting her of the right to an early-retirement pension. 8. On 3 December 2003 the Tarnobrzeg Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) dismissed the appeal. 9. The applicant further appealed against the first-instance judgment. 10. On 19 May 2004 the Rzeszów Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) dismissed the appeal. This decision was served on the applicant on 22 June 2004. 11. Some 130 applications arising from a similar fact pattern have been brought to the Court. The majority of the applicants form the Association of Victims of the SSB (Stowarzyszenie Osób Poszkodowanych przez ZUS) (“the Association”), an organisation monitoring the practices of the Social Security Board in Poland, in particular in the Podkarpacki region. 12. Out of all applications lodged with the Court, about twenty-four applicants decided not to lodge a cassation appeal against the judgment of the Court of Appeal given in their case. 13. One hundred-and-four applicants lodged cassation appeals against the final judgments given in their cases. The Supreme Court entertained and dismissed on the merits fifteen appeals. In eighty-one applications the Supreme Court refused to entertain cassation appeals on the ground that they did not raise any important legal issues or require the Supreme Court to give a new interpretation to legal provisions which raised serious doubts or gave rise to ambiguity in the jurisprudence of the domestic courts. In the remaining eight cases cassation appeals were rejected for failure to comply with various procedural requirements. 14. The legal provisions applicable at the material time and questions of practice are set out in the judgment in the case of Moskal v. Poland, no. 10373/05, § 31-34, 15 September 2009.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
180,001-107110,ENG,BGR,CHAMBER,2011,CASE OF THE UNITED MACEDONIAN ORGANISATION ILINDEN - PIRIN AND OTHERS v. BULGARIA (No. 2),3,No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 14,George Nicolaou;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"7. The applicant party, based in south-west Bulgaria (in an area known as the Pirin region or the geographic region of Pirin Macedonia), was initially founded in 1998. It was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court on 29 February 2000 and, as a result, dissolved. 8. The relevant developments up to February 2000 are described in detail in paragraphs 828 of the Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 59489/00, 20 October 2005). In that judgment the Court found that the applicant party’s dissolution had been in breach of Article 11 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 5063). 9. After the Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others (cited above) became final, on 20 January 2006, the applicant party’s followers decided to apply for reregistration of the party, considering that this would be the best way of expunging the consequences of the violation of Article 11 (since under Bulgarian law there is no possibility of reopening proceedings before the Constitutional Court). 10. On 9 June 2006, in line with the procedure envisaged in the 2005 Political Parties Act (see paragraph 43 below), the party’s founding committee published a founding declaration in Dnevnik, a national newspaper, announcing that the party’s founding meeting would be held on 25 June 2006. 11. The meeting took place as planned. 12. On 20 September 2006 the applicant party’s founders applied to the Sofia City Court (“Софийски градски съд”) for registration. They enclosed with the application the original of the founding declaration and its published copy, a certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the party’s name, minutes of the founding meeting, signed by the meeting’s chairman and minutetaker, a copy of the party’s constitution, notarised signature samples of the members of the party’s representative body, notarised declarations vouching for the authenticity of the lists of the party’s founders and members and of its constitution, a sample of the party’s seal, a list of the founders having signed membership declarations and copies of those declarations, and a list of the party’s members (5,778 individuals). 13. After the application was filed, a copy of the list of the party’s founding members was apparently made available to the police and the prosecuting authorities in Gotse Delchev, Blagoevgrad, Sandanski, Petrich and some other localities in the Pirin region. The police started systematically checking the names, the identities and the personal data of the individuals concerned. They also summoned a large number of those individuals, questioned them about their involvement with the party, and obtained from some of them declarations denying any connection with the applicant party. Following this operation, the police drew up a detailed report pointing to a number of alleged irregularities in the party’s formation, such as failures to indicate the full names, full and correct addresses and personal identity numbers of the founders in some membership declarations, as well as the facts that some founders were living abroad, were members of other parties, or were minors or mentally ill. It also contained allegations, based on interviews with the individuals concerned and other inquiries by the police, that they had been put on the list without their knowledge or against the payment of money. 14. The police additionally commissioned a graphology expert to check the texts of the membership declarations and the signatures featuring on them. On 17 October 2006 the expert drew up a detailed report which said that the texts of a number of declarations had been filled in by the same people, but that the signatures were those of separate people (all of whom he identified by name and citizen identification number). He also said that the signatures of thirteen individuals on the membership declarations differed from the corresponding signatures on the list of members. 15. The Sofia City Court examined the application at a hearing held on 18 October 2006. A prosecutor of the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office, who participated in the proceedings ex officio, produced the abovementioned reports, orders by the prosecuting authorities in Sandanski and Gotse Delchev for the carrying out of preliminary inquiries, and sixtysix declarations obtained during the earlier police operation and purportedly establishing that the individuals who had made them had no links with the applicant party. 16. Some of the declarations contained the following statements: “I am not and have never been a member of UMO Ilinden – PIRIN; I made the decision to sign [the membership declaration] off the top of my head, I have not received anything in return, and I was not coerced into doing it”; “I declare I have nothing to do with the antiBulgarian organisation UMO Ilinden – PIRIN. In no way do I support their separatist ideas. The fact that I signed the petition does not in any way mean that I support their ideas”; “I declare that I have never been a member and am not a member of the illegal UMO Ilinden”. 17. Counsel for the party’s founders requested an adjournment to acquaint himself with the newly presented evidence. The court turned the request down, allowing counsel to peruse the documents during a half-hour recess. When the hearing resumed, counsel for the party’s founders objected to the admission of the two reports in evidence and sought leave to present additional evidence: the membership applications of the persons whose names featured in the declarations presented by the prosecutor, and the missing personal identity numbers and addresses of the founders. The court denied leave, saying that the evidence sought to be adduced was not required under the 2005 Political Parties Act (see paragraphs 4246 below). It also said that it would rule on the admissibility of the prosecutor’s evidence in its judgment. 18. In a memorial filed after the hearing the prosecutor argued that the registration request should be rejected as, firstly, most of the founders had not personally filled in, but merely signed, their membership declarations, as shown by the expert report. Secondly, some of the members of the party’s governing bodies featured in the minutes of the founding meeting with two names only, which made it difficult to identify them. Thirdly, there was no indication that a properly constituted ballot committee had duly checked the number of participants in the founding meeting. All of this showed that the founding meeting had been irregular and its resolutions void. Moreover, the sixtysix declarations showed that a number of the purported founders of the party were in fact no such thing. There were also a number of technical irregularities in the founding instruments. Lastly, there were indications that a number of purported founders had agreed to become members without really wanting to or understanding the implications. The party had therefore been founded in breach of, among other provisions, Article 11 of the Convention, which enshrined negative freedom of association. 19. In a countermemorial counsel for the party’s founders submitted, inter alia, that the facts the prosecutor sought to prove through the evidence he had adduced could be established only within the framework of separate contentious proceedings. Noncontentious registration proceedings were not a suitable forum for resolving such issues. Even if one were to admit that there were certain irregularities in the membership declarations or the lists, this was not reason enough to hold that the number of founders had not in fact been attained. The sixtysix declarations presented by the prosecutor had to be discounted, inter alia because their sincerity was highly doubtful as they appeared to have been made under pressure from the police. That could be seen from the content of some of the declarations. Most of the irregularities noted in the police report were trivial or irrelevant and, in view of the limited number of individuals concerned – fiftyeight – did not cast doubt on the fact that the party had more than five thousand members, as required by law. Lastly, there was no indication that the party’s formation had been in breach of Article 11 of the Convention or Articles 11 and 44 of the Constitution (see paragraph 41 below); on the contrary, it was consonant with the Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others (cited above). 20. In a judgment of 30 October 2006 the Sofia City Court refused to enter the applicant party in the register of political parties. It held as follows: “... In an application ... of 20 September 2006 the applicants Ivan Iliev Singartiyski, Stoyko Ivanov Stoykov, Angel Ivanov Bezev and Botyo Vangelov Tikov asked [this court] to enter in the register of political parties the newly founded party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN. ... The certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the name, [issued by the registry of the Sofia City Court], shows that it was issued for a political party named UNITED MACEDONIAN ORGANISATION ILINDEN – PARTY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF THE POPULATION. A founding declaration has been produced, as required under section 10(2) of [the 2005 Political Parties Act]. However, it cannot be individualised, as there is no information in the file about the ‘initiative committee’ of ‘at least 50 enfranchised Bulgarian citizens’ who have adopted it, as required under subsection 1 of this section. The declaration says that they are ‘a group’ but the evidence does not allow the court to ascertain their number. The declarations under section 11(3) of [the same Act] do not contain information about the membership of the initiative committee, i.e. such declarations are lacking. It can be seen from the enclosed minutes of 25 June 2006 that on that date a founding meeting of the ‘political party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN’ was held. At the beginning of the meeting a ballot committee was elected, whose membership cannot be ascertained, as the individuals mentioned feature with their first and family names only and there is no further information about them. In addition, there is no report by this committee relating its findings which are mentioned only in the minutes. The individualisation of persons with two names only also affects the procedures for electing a Leadership, a Central Council and an Audit Committee. The [citizen identification numbers] of the members are not set out either. An uncertified copy of the [party’s] constitution has been produced. It is not clear whether this is the constitution that was adopted at the founding meeting or the constitution mentioned in the notarised declaration vouching for its authenticity. No graphic depictions of the symbols of the party have been submitted. They have merely been described in clause 3 of the constitution: ‘the party’s flag is red, with a golden sun and a golden inscription ‘UMO Ilinden – PIRIN’, and the party’s sign, comprising two Pirin mountain peaks with a sun rising between them, yellow with a blue background, with a white edelweiss at the foot of the hills. Lists and declarations of the founding members, said by the applicants to be 530 in number, have been presented, as required under section 15(3)(4) and (3)(5) in conjunction with section 11 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act]. The expert report presented by the [Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office] shows that 116 of the declarations were filled in by the same 25 persons, so that it is logical to conclude that 91 founding members did not personally fill in their declarations, as required by law. The report was contested by counsel for the applicants. The court gives credence to this piece of evidence, as handwriting [recognition] demands special skills and, although it is clear to the naked eye that the declarations in volume 2, pages 1 to 9 [of the case file] have been filled in with the same handwriting, the court itself would not be able to make legally binding findings on this point, because this requires special qualifications and skills, which are in the experts’ province. The court also gives credence to the expert report because it was made by the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Institute of Forensic Science and Criminology, bears the Institute’s seal and the signature of Dr [S.B.] – head of the ‘Documentary offences, photography and phonoscopy’ department, and is thus an official document. The court does not take into account the 66 individual declarations presented by [the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office], although they tend to show that the procedure for the formation of the party was not especially perfect. As correctly argued by counsel for the applicants in his brief, their number could not influence the number of the [party’s] members required under section 15(3)(7) of [the 2005 Political Parties Act]. The presented list of the party’s members is inaccurate and incorrect: for instance, in volume one of the evidence – pages 27, 28, 29, 40 and 41 – the names of 100 persons are listed, but without saying for what purpose their names and personal data are listed; pages 30 to 39, listing 141 persons, are presented as an uncertified copy and do not make it clear for what purpose the names and personal data are given; pages 45 to 59 and 71 to 77, concerning 308 people, are presented in an uncertified copy, on page 310 there are two persons with incomplete addresses, page 359 features one person identified by his first name only, without a [citizen identification number] and address, the same on pages 361 and 367, and so on. On the basis of these findings of fact the court makes the following findings of law: The application was made under Article 489 of [the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure] in conjunction with section 15 of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] and has given rise to noncontentious proceedings. In such proceedings the registering court must check whether the application is formally valid and whether it is wellfounded. Article 489 of [the Code] governs the registration of all types of legal persons which by law are required to be registered by a court. According to section 15 [of the Act], a political party is registered in the special register kept by the Sofia City Court on the basis of a special application by its representative body. To determine whether the application is wellfounded, the registering court has to check whether the facts sought to be registered are indeed subject to registration and whether they have validly taken place. The application is admissible, as it was filed by the members of the leadership of the political party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN, who, according to clause 41(4) of its constitution, represent it and are therefore the proper applicants. The application is unfounded for the following reasons: Section 11 of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] provides that each enfranchised Bulgarian citizen may join the subscription, up until the founding meeting, by personally filling in and signing an individual membership declaration, based on a model adopted by the initiative committee. Through this declaration the citizens express their personal wish to be members of the political party, and declare that they accept its main principles and goals, as set out in its founding declaration, and that they are not members of another political party. The [members of] the initiative committee must also fill in such a declaration... For a valid membership to arise, there must be ‘an initiative of at least 50 enfranchised Bulgarian citizens who form an initiative committee’, which adopts the founding declaration to be signed by the founders. A founding declaration has been produced, but the available evidence does not show that the initiative committee consists of at least 50 Bulgarian citizens. The expression ‘group of citizens’, used in the declaration (page 6 of the case file) does not establish the characteristics of these individuals (enfranchised Bulgarian citizens) and thus the quorum required under section 10(1) of [the 2005 Political Parties Act]; moreover, section 11(3) [of the same Act] expressly requires the initiative committee to fill in the declaration as well. This court does not find it established that this formality, which is a necessary prerequisite for membership, has been completed. Even assuming that the founding declaration is in compliance with the law, the model declaration adopted by the initiative committee should still be filled in and signed personally – section 11(1) of [the 2005 Political Parties Act]. At least 91 of the submitted 530 declarations have not been filled in personally, i.e. one of the two cumulative prerequisites, mandatory under the law, has not been complied with. The court would not comment on the authenticity of the signatures, about which there are doubts. The expert report says that there are differences between the signatures of the same persons in the declarations and in the lists featuring their names. This logically leads to the conclusion that there are only 441 proper founding declarations, in breach of the requirements of section 15, subsections (3)(4) and (3)(5), of [the 2005 Political Parties Act]. The above shows that the founding meeting was attended by far fewer than 500 founders and that there has been no valid adoption of the [party’s] constitution, as required under section 13(1) of the [abovementioned] Act. A quorum is established on the basis of these very founding declarations, as there is no legal requirement for each founder to personally fill in his name and personal data in the lists. It can be seen from the founding meeting’s minutes that a ballot committee was elected, but it did not draw up a report; the minutes feature only the first and the family names of its members and for this reason they cannot be identified, nor their responsibility engaged. This is why the court cannot find that the statement in the minutes that a quorum was attained does not need to be proven. A quorum establishes lawful representation; it is a prerequisite for a collective body validly to adopt resolutions. Each of the members is bound to all the others who have agreed to the [party’s] constitution. This instrument binds the members of a legal person to act in a certain way, in pursuit of common goals. A legal person’s resolutions are legal acts emanating from its bodies and entailing legal consequences for all members of a given community. A necessary prerequisite for the adoption of resolutions by collective bodies (in the instant case, a political party) is the quorum – the mandatory number of persons corresponding to the requirements of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] – of Bulgarian citizens who have capacity to act, who are not disenfranchised, and who have to be present to adopt a valid resolution. To be legitimate, resolutions of collective bodies have to comprise a certain number of identical acts by persons having capacity to act. The lack of the legally required quorum leads to resolutions which have not been adopted by consensus. From a legal point of view, the entire procedure for duly forming a legal person has been vitiated. The presence of this defect is in itself sufficient to deny the political party registration; moreover, it cannot be made good without calling and holding a new founding meeting. To achieve precision and give full reasons for its ruling, this court considers that the remaining circumstances required for the lawful formation of a legal person must be analysed as well. It is questionable whether the applicants have adduced in evidence a constitution. The enclosed copy of a constitution is not certified and there is no indication that it is indeed the authentic constitution of the party, as claimed in the notarised declaration of its Central Council. Section 14 of the [2005] Political Parties Act enumerates the minimum contents of each party’s constitution: the name, the symbols, the seat, the goals, the rules governing its organisation and activities, the manner of becoming a member and ceasing to be one, the rights and the obligations of the members, and the manner in which the party is to be wound up. The party’s name or acronym cannot match those of another party. Nor is it possible to supplement these with words, letters, figures, numbers or other signs. Section 5 bars parties from using in their symbols the coat of arms or the flag of the Republic of Bulgaria or another State, or religious signs and images. In this connection, [the court must] verify compliance with both the [2005] Political Parties Act and, mutatis mutandis, the applicable provisions of the [2000] NonProfit Legal Persons Act (as stated in paragraph 2 of the concluding provisions of the [2005] Political Parties Act). Concerning the name. A certificate attesting to the uniqueness of the name UNITED MACEDONIAN ORGANISATION ILINDEN – PARTY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF THE POPULATION has been presented. This name has been written this way only in the founding declaration published in the newspaper Dnevnik and in clause 1 of the constitution. Everywhere else, in all evidence, the name features as UMO Ilinden – PIRIN. Counsel for the applicants ... says on page 3 of his brief that ‘there is a separate organisation UMO Ilinden, which, although having similar ideas to those of UMO Ilinden – PIRIN, is a separate organisation’. It can be seen from clause 3 of the constitution that the abbreviated version of the name will be written on the party’s symbol – its flag – and will also appear on the party’s seal. However, this name is contrary to section 7, subsections (1) and (2), of the [2000] NonProfit Legal Persons Act, which provides that ‘the name must clearly show the legal person’s type’ and that it ‘must not be misleading’. There is a discrepancy between the unique name featuring on the Sofia City Court’s certificate and the name used in the evidence. The shortened name could confuse third parties, firstly because it concerns ‘a separate organisation UMO Ilinden’, secondly because the acronym PIRIN could be wrongly deciphered, and [finally because] a clear indication of the legal person’s type is missing. Concerning the symbols. The failure to produce the graphic depictions of the symbols described in clause 3 of the constitution precludes a categorical conclusion about their conformity with the law. The seal, however, shows that the ‘sun’ mentioned in clause 3 is in fact the sixteenray stylised star known as the Star of Vergina or the Star of Kutlesh. It was discovered during archaeological excavations in the vicinity of the village of Vergina (formerly Kutlesh) in Northern Greece and was depicted on the golden larnax found in 1977 by Professor Manolis Andronikos in a royal tomb dating from the time of Ancient Macedonia. Professor Andronikos described the symbol as a ‘star’, a ‘starburst’ or a ‘sunburst’. Following the discovery of the larnax (box), the Star of Vergina was widely adopted by Greeks as a symbol of continuity between ancient Macedonian culture and modern Greece. Nowadays the symbol is popular in Greece. The Star of Vergina on a blue background is commonly used as an official emblem of the three peripheries, the prefectures and the municipalities of the region of Macedonia. Thus, the blue flag with the Star of Vergina appeared in the 1980s. The symbol was also adopted by the large Macedonian diaspora, and later, after the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the independent Republic of Macedonia displayed the Star of Vergina on its new flag. The Star of Vergina became a source of controversies both within the Republic of Macedonia and in its relations with neighbouring Greece. The flag – a red rectangle with the star in the middle – became a major issue and the subject of extensive political discussions between the two sides. Greek objections led to the flag being banned from use in a variety of international organisations, including the United Nations, the Olympic Games and the representations of the Republic of Macedonia in the United States of America and Australia. In February 1993 the Greek Parliament adopted a declaration designating the Star of Vergina as an official Greek national symbol. In July 1995 Greece lodged a request with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) for exclusive intellectual property rights to the Star of Vergina. From a legal standpoint, the symbols described in clause 3 of the [party’s] constitution are contrary to section 5 of the [2005] Political Parties Act. Concerning the rules governing the organisation and the activities of the political party – the [2005 Political Parties Act] does not lay down detailed regulations for this type of legal person. This calls for subsidiary application of the [2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act]. Political parties are subject to all rules in chapters I and II, concerning the types of legal persons, and, more specifically, part one, concerning associations, as well as in chapter III, concerning associations acting in the public interest. In assessing the rules governing the [party’s] organisation and activities, the court must equally take into account the provisions of the Constitution, which lay down guiding principles which are relevant for the specific areas of legal regulation or for the activities of those subject to the law. Each corporate legal person has internal rules and they are one of its essential characteristics. The enclosed constitution sets out the main structures of the party and their manner of operation. The supreme body is the National Conference, consisting of delegates (clause 34), elected by the local sections (clause 34(4)). The calling of the meetings of this body is entrusted to the Central Council, which is in turn summoned by the Leadership or on the motion of half of its members. The founders intentionally avoided a clear exposition of the manner in which the National Conference may be called, with a view to [preventing] disputes on this point. The question of delegates is not well regulated in terms of what the delegate quota is, or [what part of] the membership, nor which delegates have been duly elected. Nor is it clear on the basis of what principle the Central Council fixes the territory of each section – clause 21(1) of the constitution. This in practice prevents the court from exercising the judicial scrutiny, required by section 25(4) and (6) of the [2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act], of the lawfulness of the supreme body’s resolutions and their conformity with the [party’s] constitution, pursuant to applications made under section 25(6) of the [same Act] by the party’s members and bodies, or by the public prosecutor. In such proceedings, the court must of necessity review the procedure for calling [a meeting of the party’s bodies] and must determine its lawfulness. The [2000] NonProfit Legal Persons Act provides that there must be a possibility of calling [a meeting of] the governing body on the direct initiative of one-third of the association’s members. Where such a meeting has not been called, the Act lays down a judicial procedure for calling [a meeting of this body] pursuant to a written request by the members. The applicant party’s constitution does not provide for such a possibility. In his memorial counsel for the applicants says that ‘the registration of the party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN would be in execution of a judgment of 20 October 2005 of the European Court of Human Rights, which became final on 20 January 2006 and in which the European Court analysed in detail all aspects of UMO Ilinden – PIRIN’s activities prior to its dissolution and held that the party’s dissolution had been unlawful as it was contrary to the essential principles of freedom of association’. In their memorial the Sofia City Prosecutor’s Office submit that the breaches of Articles 11 § 3 and 44 of the [Constitution] have been unequivocally established; those provisions lay down the principle that parties facilitate the formation and the expression of the political will of the citizens, who have the right to freely associate. The prosecuting authorities argue that the evidence shows the applicant party is not based on the free will of the citizens, but that some have been made members against their will or without being aware for what purpose they had filled in declarations – i.e. without information, and in this sense ‘the party in issue is not based on the free will of the citizens, nor does it form or express their political will’. In the Prosecutor’s Office’s view, the facts point to a breach of Article 11 of the [Convention] which, when providing that everyone has the right to freedom of association, ‘undoubtedly intends this to depend on the free will of the individual, not on the decisions of others to include him in a specific association, in this case a political party’. Article 231 § 1 (h) of [the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure] provides that the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights may constitute grounds for reopening domestic proceedings which have ended in a final judgment. However, it is clear that the situation in the case at hand does not fall within the ambit of that provision. A fortiori, the violations found by the [European Court of Human Rights] should not be allowed to occur in pending proceedings. Because the possibility that the final decision (which is the ultimate goal) of a set of proceedings will be set aside would render these proceedings meaningless. The [Convention] has precedence over domestic (national) legislation that contravenes it – Article 5 § 4 of [the Constitution]. It should however not run counter to the present wording of [the Constitution]. This is because Article 85 § 4 (until 2005, § 3) of [the Constitution] provides that the concluding of international treaties requiring amendments to [the Constitution] has to be preceded by such amendments. This follows from the reasons given by the Constitutional Court in its decision no. 7 of 2 July 1992. The European Court is not competent to give instructions to the States to take specific measures to comply with their obligations under [the Convention] – [see] the judgments in the cases of Corigliano [v. Italy, 10 December 1982, Series A no. 57], Castells [v. Spain, 23 April 1992, Series A no. 236], Bozano [v. France, 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111], etc. The [European Court’s] judgments analyse a specific case (whether specific facts amount to a violation of [the Convention]). For this reason, the court does not consider that those judgments may directly determine the outcome of a future case. The instant judgment is based on new facts and evidence, gathered in line with the requirements of [the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure] in the present proceedings. In other words, only the principles emerging from the [European Court’s] judgments are binding and the applicants cannot request automatic registration merely because their fundamental rights have been restricted in the past, for which they have been awarded just satisfaction. In conclusion, freedom of association is guaranteed by [the Constitution], but only if the legal requirements for association in its various forms – [under the 1991] Companies Act, [the 2000] NonProfit Legal Persons Act, [and the 2005] Political Parties Act – have been complied with. In view of the foregoing, the court finds that the political party has not been duly formed and for this reason its application for registration is to be denied as unfounded.” 21. On 13 November 2006 the applicants appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation (“Върховен касационен съд”). They argued, inter alia, that the admission of the expert report in evidence had been a serious breach of the rules of procedure, as any doubts about the authenticity or the probative value of the documents submitted in support of the registration request should have been resolved in separate contentious proceedings. The Sofia City Court’s denial of leave to the applicants to adduce further evidence had also been in breach of the rules of procedure, had rendered the proceedings unfair, and had prevented them from proving they had complied with the requirements of the 2005 Political Parties Act. These procedural errors had had a material impact on the Sofia City Court’s findings of fact. Furthermore, that court’s ruling that membership declarations must be filled in by the member in person was too rigid and unduly restrictive of the freedom of association of the party’s founders. 22. After hearing the appeal on 8 February 2007, in a final judgment of 14 February 2007 (реш. № 87 от 14 февруари 2007 г. по т. д. № 726/ 2006 г., ВКС, I т. о.) the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia City Court’s judgment in the following terms: “... [This court] considers ... that the Sofia City Court erred by admitting in evidence the expert report contested by the applicants. This report is in fact a private expert report and not an official document, as wrongly held by the [Sofia City Court]. This entailed a breach of the rules of evidence. ... However, that breach was not material, as it was not the only ground which led to the [Sofia City Court’s] refusal to register [the party]. That court found that the produced founding declaration – the first element of the complex of events leading to a political party’s formation ... – was vitiated. The founding declaration cannot be individualised, as it does not emanate from at least fifty enfranchised Bulgarian citizens, as required by the law (section 10 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act]), but from a ‘group of citizens’, and that ‘group of citizens’ cannot be individualised, nor their number ascertained. There is no information in declarations under section 11(3) of [the same Act] about the size and the membership of the initiative committee, because such declarations are lacking. Therefore, [the Sofia City Court’s] decisive conclusion that the [applicant party] was not validly formed was based on lapses in the founding declaration presented, which fails to meet the imperative requirements of the law – sections 10(1) and 11(1)(3) [of the 2005 Political Parties Act]. The incompleteness of the lists, noted by the [Sofia City Court], was an additional and not a decisive ground for the refusal, and for this reason its being based on a breach of the rules of procedure is not material and does not vitiate the impugned judgment. By the same token, [this court] finds unavailing the arguments in the appeal about the rigid application of the rule in section 11 [of the Act] in relation to the handwritten declarations, which allegedly led to a restriction of the exercise of basic political rights. Section 11’s requirement for a personally filled in and signed declaration does not restrict or discriminate against illiterate or blind individuals, as the law deals with such eventualities in Article 151 [of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure], which is also applicable in the instant proceedings... If the law requires personally filled in and signed declarations under section 11 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act], the court is bound to apply it correctly and uniformly – Article 4 § 2 [of the above Code]. [The Sofia City Court] did precisely that; therefore, the complaints that it erred in the application of section 11 [of the Act] are unfounded. The complaints that [the Sofia City Court] breached the rules of procedure by refusing the applicants leave to adduce further evidence rectifying the irregularities in the initially submitted documents, such as wrong or incomplete addresses, [citizen identification numbers], [and] proof of the truth of circumstances required by law to be declared, are unfounded. It is true that the proceedings are noncontentious, and that the court has to check of its own motion whether the prerequisites for issuing the decision sought are in place. It is also true that the court may of its own motion gather evidence, and instruct the applicants to produce evidence in corroboration of their claims (Article 427 [of the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure]). However, the instant case concerns omissions of the founders, which may not be rectified subsequently. The complaints that the impugned judgment was wrong on the merits are likewise unfounded. As already noted, the requirement of section 11 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act] that the declarations be personally filled in and signed is a requirement of the law, and the court is bound to apply the law as it is, correctly and uniformly – Article 4 § 2 [of the abovementioned Code]. Regardless of what has been said above, [this court] reiterates that the decisive ground for refusing registration stems from the vitiated declaration of the founding committee, found defective partly because of the lack of declarations personally made by [the party’s] members. The lack of such declarations and the vitiated lists and the ensuing lack of proof that the meeting had a quorum are thus not, in themselves, independent grounds for a refusal. The lack of graphic symbols and of a report of the ballot committee are not independent grounds for the refusal [either] – they were noted by [the Sofia City Court] in addition to its decisive conclusion about the lack of a founding declaration. It is a separate issue that [the Sofia City Court] found further omissions in the [party’s] formation which were not mentioned or commented upon in the appeal. In view of the foregoing and having dealt with all grounds of appeal [raised by the applicants], [this court] finds that [the Sofia City Court’s] conclusions that [the applicant party] was not validly formed and that its registration request was unfounded are correct. For this reason, the impugned judgment is to be upheld...” 23. On 3 November 2006, a few days after the Sofia City Court gave its judgment, there was a meeting in Sofia between the Macedonian and Bulgarian Ministers of Foreign Affairs. The news agencies reported that during the meeting Bulgaria’s then Foreign Minister, Mr Ivaylo Kalfin, said: “[T]he judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg does not entail the registration of a party. Bulgaria was ordered to pay a fine; it paid it and there are no further legal consequences. I believe that Bulgaria has fully executed the prescriptions of the Human Rights Court and there are no outstanding matters”. 24. In November 2006 the group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the European Parliament proposed an amendment to the report on Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, suggesting that it should include text calling on the Bulgarian authorities “to prevent any further obstruction to the registration of the political party of the ethnic Macedonians and to put an end to all forms of discrimination and harassment visàvis that minority”. A number of Bulgarian observer members of the European Parliament objected to that amendment. The political party Attack (“Атака”) proposed a draft declaration, to be adopted by Bulgaria’s National Assembly and saying that the proposal of the Group of the Greens was a gross provocation and amounted to meddling in the country’s internal affairs. Attack’s leader, Mr Volen Siderov, was reported by the press to have said on 1 November 2006 that he saw a problem in the fact that UMO Ilinden – PIRIN’s registration request had been turned down by the courts on technical grounds. In his view, “UMO Ilinden ha[d] to be rejected because of their separatism and anticonstitutional activities, not because of formalities”. 25. In a statement published on 14 November 2006 a member of Bulgaria’s Parliament for Blagoevgrad said that “[t]he Bulgarian court showed that no Macedonian parties may be registered in Bulgaria. And in a country ruled by law judicial decisions have to be complied with.” 26. In early July 2007 the second applicant, Mr Singartiyski, and another member of the applicant party approached in turn the mayors of the towns of Gotse Delchev and Sandanski with requests to rent a municipal hall in which to hold the party’s founding meeting. After initially showing willingness to accommodate their request, in a letter of 9 July 2007 the mayor of Gotse Delchev turned it down, saying that the hall in question did not meet the safety requirements set by the local fire department. The mayor of Sandanski did not reply to the request. 27. The applicant party’s founders then decided to hold the founding meeting outdoors. It took place on 15 July 2007 in the area Popovi livadi, located in the territory of the municipality of Gotse Delchev. According to the applicants, it was attended by six hundred and eightyfive people, all of whom filled in declarations stating that they wished to join UMO Ilinden – PIRIN. 28. On 27 July 2007 the applicant party applied for registration to the Sofia City Court. It presented the founding declaration, the minutes of the founding meeting, the party’s constitution, membership declarations signed by six hundred and eighty-five founding members, a list of those founding members, the list of 5,778 members compiled in 2006 (see paragraph 12 above), and a notarised declaration of the members of the party’s management body to the effect that those lists were authentic. It also produced a copy of a letter of 11 July 2007 from the Committee of Ministers’ Secretariat to the permanent representative of Bulgaria to the Council of Europe. 29. The Sofia City Court examined the application at a hearing held on 21 August 2007. The prosecutor who was present ex officio argued that the application should be refused because the party’s goals were not those of a political party, but rather those of an ordinary association. He also said that the list of members was not authentic, as it was the same as the one presented in the previous reregistration proceedings, and that the minutes of the founding meeting had not been signed by all six hundred and eightyfive persons present. 30. In a judgment of 23 August 2007 the Sofia City Court refused the application in the following terms: “... In the course of the proceedings the court noted that the applicants have not complied with the requirements of [the 2005 Political Parties Act, whose] section 10 provides that [a political party] can be founded on the initiative of at least fifty enfranchised Bulgarian citizens, who have to form an initiative committee. This [committee] has to adopt a written founding declaration. The founding declaration of 1 July 2007 presented was signed by seventysix people, who did not however personally fill in and sign declarations under section 11 [of the above Act]. Moreover, according to section 11(1) [of this Act], the declaration has to be drawn up by the initiative committee. Since evidence to that effect has not been produced, the court cannot be certain that this initiative committee has indeed held meetings and that such resolutions have in fact been adopted. The minutes of the founding meeting of 15 July 2007 say that [it] was attended by 685 adult Bulgarian citizens who had personally filled in and signed declarations under section 11(1) [of the above Act]. The court fails to see how it was possible to obtain 685 declarations by adult enfranchised Bulgarian citizens in less than fifteen days (that is, from the committee’s declaration of 1 July 2007 to 15 July 2007), so as to allow the holding of the founding meeting on 15 July 2007. It is true that section 12(1) of [the Act] provides that a political party is formed at a founding meeting held in the territory of Bulgaria not later than three months after the date on which the founding declaration has been adopted. However, in the instant case the court cannot accept that 685 people who had personally filled in their declarations under section 11(1) [of the Act] were able to get together to hold a [founding meeting] in such a short time. Moreover, the minutes are signed by the president of the meeting and the minutetaker, whereas they should have been personally signed by all founders. As noted above, there is no evidence, under section 11(1) [of the Act], that [the initiative committee] has adopted a model declaration whereby each enfranchised Bulgarian citizen may, by personally filling it in and signing it, join the party. This declaration has to be ready before the holding of the founding meeting. It should contain the information required under section 11(2) [of the Act]. The presented lists of three names, [citizen identification numbers] and addresses do not demonstrate to the court that the persons who feature thereon are members of the party, as the lists are not accompanied by personally filled in and signed declarations (see the presented list of party founders). This court does not know whether these persons are aware that they are members of this party, or whether this is simply a list intending to prove before the court that the requirements of section 15(3)(7) [of the Act] have been complied with. It must here be noted that [the court] received from [the Ministry of Justice] a letter informing it that [the Ministry] had received a letter from the head of the department for the execution of the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, [Ms M.], in which she asked whether it was possible for the court to accept, when examining the application for the [applicant party’s] registration, the list of 5,000 members presented in [the previous registration proceedings] in which the court, whose judgment was upheld by [the Supreme Court of Cassation], refused to register the party. This letter leads the court to conclude that the list produced in the instant proceedings is the same as the one presented [in the previous registration proceedings]. The use of the same list is in breach of Articles 11 § 3 and 44 of the [Constitution, which provide that] parties facilitate the formation and expression of the political will of citizens, who may freely associate. Each application for inclusion in the register of political parties means, first, sharing the ideas of a group of enfranchised citizens who use democratic ways and means for attaining their political goals, set out in [the political party’s] platform, and, second, that the [party’s] formation, resolutions [and] activity should be in conformity with the law. The use of the same evidence in separate cases cannot therefore be accepted by the court. The evidence presented in [the previous registration proceedings] cannot be used in the instant proceedings. The presented constitution [of the party] does not make clear its political goals and tasks. The ones mentioned in clauses 4 and 5 of the constitution do not characterise the organisation as a political party within the meaning of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] and the [Constitution]. Political parties are citizens’ organisations through which they take part in the political life of the Republic of Bulgaria. The thing which sets them apart from other citizens’ associations is, according to Article 12 § 2 of the [Constitution], that only they may pursue political goals or carry out political activities. These activities are defined by Article 11 § 3 of the [Constitution] and section 1 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act] as ones facilitating the formation of the citizens’ political will, which is the citizens’ will to participate in government. The carrying out of political activities is the main criterion for distinguishing [political parties] from other citizens’ associations. In this connection, it should be observed that in their constitutions political parties must clearly declare their goals and tasks and the ways of attaining them. The goals and tasks outlined in the [applicant party’s] constitution are limited, have an optional character and do not comply with the abovementioned requirements. For the court, the goals set out in clause 4 of the constitution are rather those of a nonprofit association ..., not of a political party... It should [also] be noted that a political party bearing the same name and having the same goals was registered by the Sofia City Court in a judgment of 12 February 1999... After that [, in 2000, the Constitutional Court] declared that party unconstitutional and it was struck out of the register. The [Constitutional Court’s] judgment shows that not only the name and the political goals of this party are identical to those stated by the applicants in the instant proceedings, but that the [party’s] leadership consists of the same individuals. The court cannot therefore be sure that, having the same political goals and leaders, the party will not meet the same fate, that is, be faced with an application [for its banning] to [the Constitutional Court]. The court observes that the constitutionality of a political party must be judged on the basis of its activities. The political goals set out in clause 4 of the constitution show that this is a party which is active in a specific part of the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, which runs counter to both the [2005 Political Parties Act] and the [Constitution] (see clause 4, points 7 and 8 of the [party’s] constitution). Moreover, clause 4, point 6 of the political goals of the party mentions good neighbourly relations in the Balkans, in Europe and in all countries inhabited by ethnic Macedonians. There is no distinct Macedonian ethnos in the Republic of Bulgaria. The same goes for the party’s name. To enter a party in the register this court requires precise and clear political goals, as well as ways and means of attaining them. Moreover, [a party] must produce in evidence at least 5,000 personally filled in and signed declarations under section 11(2) [of the 2005 Political Parties Act] fully to convince the court that these citizens are truly aware that they are members of a specific political party, that they share its political goals, express their personal will to be its members and declare that they accept the party’s main principles and goals, as set out in its founding declaration, and that they are not members of another political party. These requirements apply without exception to all political parties. For these reasons, the [applicant party’s] application must be rejected and the court refuses to enter it in the special register.” 31. On 30 August 2007 the applicant party appealed to the Supreme Court of Cassation. In a brief filed on 16 September 2007 it argued, inter alia, that its registration would be consonant with the Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others (cited above). In that connection, it made reference to the relevant decisions of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. 32. After hearing the appeal on 5 October 2007, in a final judgment of 11 October 2007 (реш. № 762 от 11 октомври 2007 г. по т. д. № 753/2007 г., ВКС, IІ т. о.) the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia City Court’s judgment in the following terms: “...The impugned judgment is correct and is to be upheld. Having reviewed the evidence in the case, [this court] finds that the refusal to register [the applicant party] was lawful. Section 15 [of the 2005 Political Parties Act] contains an exhaustive list of the documents which need to be filed with the court for the registration of an association of Bulgarian citizens founded for the purpose of forming and expressing the people’s political will through elections or through other democratic means – section 2 [of the Act]. [This court] finds that by presenting a list of 5,000 members which was compiled during a previous founding meeting of [the applicant party] and was produced in [the previous proceedings for its registration], the applicants in the instant case failed to comply with the requirements of section 15(3)(7) of [the Act]. ... [T]he reason why the law requires a minimum number of documents to be produced for the registration of a political party is to allow the registering court to check whether the procedure for its formation has been followed and whether it has the minimum number of members to guarantee that [it can be] a real player on the political scene, whose goals, as endorsed by its members, have public significance and warrant its existence on the country’s political scene. [The case file of the previous registration proceedings] has not been enclosed with the present case file, but the possible similarity or even match between the goals and the principles adopted at that previous founding meeting and those laid down in the party’s constitution produced in the instant proceedings cannot warrant the conclusion that the list produced in the course of [the previous registration proceedings] shows that the requisite number of members of the party seeking registration has really been attained. The underlying idea of the abovecited provision is doubtlessly to ensure that the required number of members who have declared their wish to join the effort to attain the goals set out in the party’s constitution, adopted at the same founding meeting, has really been attained. From this vantage point, the list of members compiled during a previous founding of the party does not serve the law’s purpose. The membership of an organisation, including a political one, is a dynamic value, which may increase but also decrease, due to changes in political views – something characteristic of every individual. This dynamic, which doubtlessly also reflects natural biological processes, requires [the founders] to establish before the registering court the requisite number of members at the time of the party’s founding, or at the time when the application for its registration is lodged. It is obvious that in the instant case those requirements of section 15(3)(7) have not been complied with owing to the lack of information about the number of persons who have expressed their wish to become members of [the applicant party and work] for the attainment of its goals, as agreed at the founding meeting held on 15 July 2007 and laid down in the constitution adopted by the founders. The rule in section 15 of [the 2005 Political Parties Act] is imperative. Failure to comply with even one of its requirements constitutes sufficient grounds to refuse registration, as the impugned judgment did. Since this court shares the final conclusions at which [that judgment] arrived, it considers that it should be upheld.” 33. On 19 October 2008 UMO Ilinden – PIRIN held a national conference. On the same day the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth applicants lodged with the Sofia City Court a request for amendments in the party’s registration. The request was based on the premise that, since this Court had found the dissolution of the party in 2000 to be in breach of Article 11 of the Convention, the party had never ceased to exist. 34. The Sofia City Court held a hearing on 9 December 2008. On 19 December 2008, apparently treating the request as a normal registration request, it turned it down. It found that the party’s founders had not enclosed all the necessary documents (such as a founding declaration, individual membership declarations personally signed by the founders, and notarised samples of the signatures of the party’s representatives) showing that the party had been duly formed. It went on to say that this Court’s judgment in the case of United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others (cited above) had no bearing on the registration proceedings and could not serve as grounds for finding that the party had never ceased to exist. 35. The second applicant, Mr Singartiyski, appealed on points of law. He argued that the Sofia City Court had erred by not giving UMO Ilinden – PIRIN the opportunity to produce all the elements missing from its founding process. The court’s failure to do so, coupled with its ensuing refusal to register the party, had been in breach of Bulgaria’s obligation to abide by this Court’s judgment in United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others (cited above) and to heed the instructions given in that connection by the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. 36. After hearing the appeal on 18 May 2009, in a final judgment of 19 May 2009 (реш. № 66 от 19 май 2009 г. по гр. д. № 193/2009 г., ВКС, I т. о.) the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the Sofia City Court’s judgment in the following terms: “The subjective registration right is the legally guaranteed possibility to request facts which are subject to registration (and the changes in such facts) to be entered in the relevant register. Concrete rights and duties in that respect can arise and evolve only in the manner envisaged by the special statutes governing such matters. In the case at hand, the [2005] Political Parties Act lays down certain requirements which need to be met before an application to register a political party can succeed. One of those requirements is the obligation under section 15 [of the Act] for the applicants to enclose certain documents with their application. Those documents must be produced in order to allow the registering court to ascertain whether the application is admissible and wellfounded. It is the applicants’ duty to produce them, and they directly relate to the ascertaining of a series of legal acts leading to the formation of a political party. Therefore, the making of an irregular application – such irregularity stemming from a failure to produce the enclosures required by law – is tantamount to a failure to comply with the duty to make a proper application. Moreover, some of the irregularities cannot be rectified in the manner and timelimits envisaged by Article 129 [of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure], because they are indicative of such failures of the [party’s] founders as make the application for its registration illfounded. Although noncontentious proceedings follow the general rules of civil procedure, their specificity requires the court to assess whether the irregularities [in the application] can be rectified, and thus make the application successful, because the law requires all prerequisites for the registration of a political party to be in place. The lack of even one such prerequisite makes the application illfounded. In the case at hand, the [lower] court found that the imperative requirements of the law had not been complied with (there is no founding declaration; that declaration has not been published in a daily newspaper[, as required by] section 10 the [2005] Political Parties Act; the mandatory requirements of sections 11 and 12 [of that Act] have not been complied with). Although in their appeal the applicants said that they were ready to adduce fresh evidence, the above defects cannot be rectified in the manner and within the timelimit envisaged by Article 129 [of the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure], because they presuppose the occurring of concrete facts at the time when the party was being founded. They thus relate to the application’s wellfoundedness, not to its admissibility. Besides, [Mr] Tikov’s assertion at the hearing on 9 December 2008 that the applicants do not have any documents other than those already produced leads directly to the conclusion that the appeal is illfounded, because it conflicts with the applicants’ position before the [lower] court, where they had to make the requisite procedural steps. Therefore, the [lower] court has not breached the rules of procedure and has correctly assessed the application’s wellfoundedness based on the enclosures submitted by the applicants. The appellants argued that the above-mentioned breach of the rules of procedure was directly related to the Bulgarian authorities’ obligation, in cooperation with the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers, to determine appropriate ways of ‘registering’ the political party ‘UMO Ilinden – PIRIN’. They maintained that the Bulgarian Government was bound to execute the European Court of Human Rights judgment of 29 October 2005. As that judgment had still not been executed, it was necessary to take individual measures allowing the political party to be registered. The applicants’ position was that the Sofia City Court’s refusal [to register the party] was in breach of the European Court of Human Rights judgment and the mandatory instructions of the Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers. The complaint is illfounded. The European Court of Human Rights’ judgment of 29 October 2005 related, as correctly pointed out by the [Sofia City Court], to a breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights flowing from the Constitutional Court’s finding in its judgment of 29 February 2000 that the political party UMO Ilinden – PIRIN was unconstitutional. That has no bearing on the case at hand, because the refusal to register [the party] was based on its failure to comply with the formal requirements of the [2005] Political Parties Act. Those requirements apply to all, not only to the appellant. Therefore, the [lower] court was right to conclude that the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment is irrelevant to the registration request in the case at hand. One of the main principles of the law of registration, flowing directly from Article 4 of the Constitution, is the principle of lawfulness. It requires the authorities examining registration requests to comply strictly with their duties, and requires those who lodge registration requests to comply strictly with theirs. The application of that principle is guaranteed by the strict rules governing the facts which need to be registered, the manner of their registration, the possibility of appealing against the rulings of the registering authorities and the sanctions for failures to comply with registration obligations. Therefore, the ones responsible for complying with registration obligations are the applicants, regardless of their identity, and not other persons, and their failure to do so leads to a refusal to register the requested fact.” 37. During its 997th meeting, on 5 and 6 June 2007, the Committee of Ministers noted the continuing problems with the registration of the party and invited its Secretariat to “examine, in cooperation with the Bulgarian authorities and the applicants, the avenues at the applicants’ disposal with a view to obtaining [the party’s] registration” (CM/Del/Dec(2007)997). 38. During its 1007th meeting, held on 17 October 2007, the Committee of Ministers “took note of the complaints of the applicants in the case of UMO Ilinden – PIRIN concerning the outcome of the new proceedings concerning the registration of the political party”, “noted the different problems still raised by the issue of the individual measures in the latter case” and “invited the Bulgarian authorities in cooperation with the Secretariat to examine possible solutions to these problems within the framework of the Bulgarian legal order” (CM/Del/Dec(2007)1007). 39. The Committee of Ministers concluded the examination of application no. 59489/00 (United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others v. Bulgaria) during its 1072nd meeting, on 3 December 2009, by adopting Resolution CM/ResDH(2009)120, the relevant parts of which read: “...Recalling that the violation of the Convention found by the Court in this case concerns an infringement of the freedom of association of an organisation which aims to achieve ‘the recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria’ due to the dissolution in 2000 of its political party, based on considerations of national security (alleged separatist ideas) when the applicants had not hinted at any intention to use violence or other undemocratic means to achieve their aims (violation of Article 11) (see details in Appendix); Recalling that a finding of violations by the Court requires, over and above the payment of just satisfaction awarded by the Court in its judgments, the adoption by the respondent state, where appropriate: – of individual measures to put an end to the violations and erase their consequences so as to achieve as far as possible restitutio in integrum; and – of general measures preventing similar violations; Recalling that the obligation of the respondent state regarding the individual measures in this case, implies allowing the applicants to ask for a new registration of their political party in the framework of proceedings which are in accordance with the requirements of the Convention and in particular of Article 11 (for further details see the information document CM/Inf/DH(2007)8); Recalling that following the Court’s judgment, the applicants requested on three occasions before the domestic courts the registration of their political party and that the Committee of Ministers followed the proceedings in question up to their outcome; Recalling that it has expressed concerns more particularly as regard the fact that the decision of the firstinstance court on the second request for registration of the applicants’ political party reiterated grounds incriminated by the Court; Stressing in this respect that the judicial decisions relating to the applicants’ third request for registration do not reiterate such grounds and are exclusively based on the noncompliance with the law of the material acts for the constitution of the party and of the related documents to be submitted; Having noted with satisfaction the declaration of the government according to which it ‘sees no obstacle to the applicants’ obtaining the registration of their organisation as a political party on the condition that the requirements of the Constitution of the state and the formal requirements of the Political Parties Act are met, without any grounds such as those incriminated by the European Court being opposed to the applicants’; Underlining in this context that the [2005] Political Parties Act, as modified in January 2009, reduced from 5,000 to 2,500 the level of members required to form a political party and that this new level seems, in addition, likely to resolve the problems encountered by the applicants in forming their party in conformity of the requirement of the 2005 Political Parties Act; Having considered that in view of the above considerations, it seems that the applicants can at present apply for the registration of their party in proceedings which are in conformity with Article 11 of the Convention; Having examined also the general measures and in particular the awarenessraising measures taken by the Bulgarian authorities to ensure that applicable domestic law is interpreted in conformity with the Convention and thus to prevent violations similar to that found by the European Court (see details in Appendix); Noting that the government undertook to continue to organise awarenessraising activities in the field of application of Article 11 of the Convention, including visits to the Council of Europe of judges in particular from the competent courts; Having satisfied itself that the respondent state paid the applicants the just satisfaction provided in the judgment (see details in Appendix), DECLARES, having examined the measures taken by the respondent state (see Appendix), that it has exercised its functions under Article 46 § 2 of the Convention in this case and DECIDES to close the examination of this case.” 40. In an appendix to the Resolution the Committee described the developments set out in paragraphs 3336 above, the amendment to the 2005 Political Parties Act reducing the membership requirement for a party from five to two and a half thousand members (see paragraph 47 below), and the Government’s declaration cited in the Resolution. The appendix also contained a description of the general measures taken by the Government. Those consisted in the publication and the dissemination of the Court’s judgment and of a manual describing the Court’s case-law in the area of freedom of association, and in the organising of several training sessions for judges and prosecutors on that topic. 41. The relevant provisions of the 1991 Constitution read as follows: “The Republic of Bulgaria is a State governed by the rule of law. It shall be governed in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the country.” “International treaties which have been ratified in accordance with the constitutionally established procedure and promulgated, and have entered into force with respect to the Republic of Bulgaria, are part of the country’s domestic law. They shall have precedence over any provisions of domestic legislation which contravene them.” “3. Parties shall facilitate the formation of the citizens’ political will. The manner of forming and dissolving political parties, as well as the conditions pertaining to their activity, shall be established by law. 4. No political parties shall be formed on an ethnic, racial, or religious basis, nor parties which seek to accede to power by force.” “1. Citizens’ associations shall serve to further and safeguard their interests. 2. Associations ... may not pursue political goals or carry out political activities that are characteristic solely of political parties.” “No one may be persecuted or restricted in his rights because of his views, nor detained or forced to provide information about his or another’s convictions.” “1. Citizens may freely associate. 2. Organisations whose activities are directed against the country’s sovereignty or territorial integrity or against the nation’s unity, or which aim at stirring up racial, national, ethnic or religious hatred, or at violating the rights and freedoms of others, as well as organisations creating secret or paramilitary structures, or which seek to attain their goals through violence, shall be prohibited. 3. The law shall specify which organisations are subject to registration, the manner of their dissolution, as well as their relations with the State.” 42. The 2005 Political Parties Act (“Закон за политическите партии”), which came into force on 1 April 2005 and superseded the 2001 Political Parties Act, which had in turn superseded the 1990 Political Parties Act, regulates the formation, registration, organisation, activities and dissolution of political parties (section 1). 43. The procedure for the formation of a party is laid down in sections 1019 of the Act. A party is formed on the initiative of at least fifty enfranchised Bulgarian citizens (section 10(1)). They must set up an initiative committee, which adopts a written founding declaration setting out the party’s main goals and principles (section 10(2) and (3)). The committee then publishes this declaration in at least one national daily newspaper and opens a subscription for founding members (section 10(4)). Every enfranchised Bulgarian citizen may join the subscription by personally filling in and signing an individual membership declaration whose model must be approved by the initiative committee (section 11(1)). In these membership declarations (not to be confused with the founding declaration) prospective members express their wish to become members of the party and declare that they accept its main goals and principles, as set out in the founding declaration (section 11(2)). They must also declare that they are not members of another party (ibid.), as an individual cannot participate in the formation of a party if he or she is already a member of another party (section 8(1) and (2)). The initiative committee’s members must also fill in and sign such membership declarations (section 11(3)). After the subscription is closed, the party is founded at a founding meeting, which must be held in the territory of Bulgaria not later than three months after the adoption of the founding declaration (section 12(1)). The meeting must be attended by at least five hundred Bulgarian citizens who have signed a membership declaration (section 12(2)). The founding meeting adopts the party’s constitution and elects its managing and controlling bodies (section 13(1) and (2)). 44. The party’s constitution must set out, along with other matters, its name and symbols; its goals and the ways of attaining them; its managing and controlling bodies, the manner of calling meetings of these bodies; their appointment, removal and powers; the way to become a member and cease to be one; and the members’ rights and obligations (section 14(1)). The party’s name and symbols cannot be identical to those of another party, even if words, letters, figures, numbers or other signs have been added to them (section 14(2)). Also, the parties’ symbols cannot contain or resemble the coat of arms or the flag of the Republic of Bulgaria or of another State, or religious signs or representations (section 5(1)). 45. Not later than three months after the founding meeting the party has to apply to be entered in a special register kept by the Sofia City Court. The application must be made by the party’s managing and representative body (section 15(1) and (2)). With the application must be enclosed (a) the founding declaration; (b) the minutes of the founding meeting; (c) the party’s constitution; (d) a list containing the three names, citizen identification numbers, permanent addresses and handwritten signatures of at least five hundred founding members; (e) the individual membership declarations; (f) notarised samples of the signatures of the party’s representatives; (g) a list containing the three names, citizen identification numbers and permanent addresses of at least five thousand members; (h) a notarised declaration by the party’s leadership to the effect that the constitution and the two lists are authentic; and (i) a certificate of uniqueness of the party’s name, to be obtained form the Sofia City Court’s registry (section 15(3) and (4)). 46. The Sofia City Court has to examine the application not later than one month after it has been lodged, at a public hearing attended by the applicants and a public prosecutor. It must then rule within fourteen days, by means of a judgment (section 16). This judgment is subject to appeal before the Supreme Court of Cassation (section 18(1)), which has to dispose of the appeal within fourteen days, by means of a final judgment (section 18(2)). The party is entered in the register seven days after the judgment allowing its registration has become final (section 18(3)). At that point it becomes a legal person (section 18(4)). The judgment allowing registration is published in the State Gazette (section 19). 47. In January 2009 an amendment to section 15(1) reduced to two and a half thousand the number of people who have to feature on the list of members that needs to be enclosed with the application for registration (see paragraph 45 (g) above). 48. Paragraph 28 of the amendment’s transitional and concluding provisions provided that until 31 March 2009 the prosecuting authorities had to conduct inquiries and seek the dissolution of any political party which did not meet the requirements of section 40(1)(1)(4) of the Act. Under that section, a political party has to be dissolved if (a) its activities systematically breach the Act’s requirements, (b) its activities are contrary to the Constitution, (c) for more than five years after its latest registration it has not taken part in parliamentary, presidential or local elections, or (d) if it has failed, for two consecutive years, to submit the requisite financial reports to the Court of Auditors. 49. The 2000 NonProfit Legal Persons Act (“Закон за юридическите лица с нестопанска цел”), which entered into force on 1 January 2001 and superseded parts of the 1949 Persons and Family Act (“Закон за лицата и семейството”), and whose provisions govern all matters not covered by the 2005 Political Parties Act (paragraph 2 of the transitional and concluding provisions of this Act), regulates the formation, registration, organisation, activities and winding up of nonprofit legal persons, such as associations and foundations (section 1). Its Chapter I lays down certain general rules and principles applying to all types of nonprofit legal persons, its Chapter II prescribes more detailed rules for associations, and its Chapter III deals with nonprofit legal persons acting in the public interest. 50. According to section 7(1) and (2), a legal person’s name has to clearly designate its type, and must not be misleading or contrary to good morals. 51. Section 26(1) provides that an association’s general meeting may be called at the request of onethird of the members, if need be through an application to the competent court. 52. The general meeting’s resolutions are subject to judicial review for lawfulness and conformity with the association’s rules (section 25(4)). Applications for judicial review may be lodged by any member or body of the association, or by the public prosecutor (section 25(6)). 53. At the relevant time the 1952 Code of Civil Procedure, along with some statutes, regulated the procedure for entering legal persons, such as companies, associations, foundations and political parties, in special registers kept by the regional courts and the Sofia City Court. Such registration was made after noncontentious proceedings instituted on the application of the representatives of the legal person concerned (Articles 489 and 494). In the course of such proceedings the court could gather evidence of its own motion and take into account facts not mentioned by the applicant (Articles 427 and 429). On 1 March 2008 the Code was superseded by the 2007 Code of Civil Procedure. 54. The European Commission for Democracy through Law (“the Venice Commission”) made the following recommendations in its Guidelines and explanatory report on legislation on political parties: some specific issues (CDL-AD(2004)007rev, 15 April 2004): “B. Registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party, for a party’s participation in general elections or for public financing of a party does not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under Articles 11 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Any requirements in relation to registration, however, must be such as are ‘necessary in a democratic society’ and proportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the measures in question. Countries applying registration procedures to political parties should refrain from imposing excessive requirements for territorial representation of political parties as well as for minimum membership. ... ... a. Registration of political parties 10. ... many countries view registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political party, for participation in general elections or for public financing. This practice – as the Venice Commission has stated before in its Guidelines on Prohibition and Dissolution of Political Parties – even if it were regarded as a restriction of the right to freedom of association and freedom of expression, would not per se amount to a violation of rights protected under Articles 11 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The requirements for registration, however, differ from one country to another. Registration may be considered as a measure to inform the authorities about the establishment of the party as well as about its intention to participate in elections and, as a consequence, benefit from advantages given to political parties as a specific type of association. Farreaching requirements, however, can raise the threshold for registration to an unreasonable level, which may be inconsistent with the Convention. Any provisions in relation to registration must be such as are necessary in a democratic society and proportionate to the object sought to be achieved by the measures in question.” 55. A report adopted by the Venice Commission on 16 February 2004 on the establishment, organisation and activities of political parties on the basis of the replies to a questionnaire (CDL-AD(2004)004) reads, in so far as relevant: “23. Some countries impose on political parties an obligation to go through a registration process. Almost all countries mentioned in the first group in paragraph 2.1 have to go through a registration process or at least through deposition of their articles of association with the competent authorities of their country. This process is justified by the need of formal recognition of an association as a political party. Some of these additional requirements can differ from one country to another: a) convocation of the assembly on the establishment of the party (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Romania); b) establishing articles of association/charter (Albania, Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania and Romania); c) drafting of a programme (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania and Slovakia); d) minimum membership (Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Russian Federation, Slovakia and Turkey); e) election of the board/presidency/permanent committee (Albania, Armenia, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania and United Kingdom); f) permanent address of its offices/leaders (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania, Russian Federation and United Kingdom); g) principles of internal organisation (Czech Republic, Germany, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, Spain and Turkey); h) payment of the registration fee (Armenia and Azerbaijan); i) signatures attesting certain territorial representation (Moldova, Russian Federation, Turkey and Ukraine); and j) publication of information on the establishment of the party in mass media (Austria). 24. After these requirements are met, a competent body (Ministry of Justice, for example) proceeds with official registration. In the case of such countries as, for example, Austria and Spain, the Charter (articles of association) are just submitted to the competent authority in order to be added to a special State register. ... 28. Most countries consider registration as a necessary step for recognition of an association as a political formation. However, some countries, as it has been already mentioned, consider that State registration is a pure formality. For example, in Austria, the Ministry of the Interior cannot refuse the deposition or a registration of the Charter of a party. 29. There is another criteria of distinction as to the status given to a party. In some countries registration of such associations is required in order to give a full legal personality to such association. If such registration is not carried out, a party cannot have bank accounts, receive founding from public funds or hold property (Azerbaijan, Croatia, Georgia and Ukraine). 30. Certain States have a stricter rule as to the registration process. For example, in Moldova, current legislation on political parties imposes a duty on political parties to provide the Ministry of Justice with its membership lists every year for having its registration reeffected.” 56. The explanatory report to Protocol No. 14 (CETS No. 194) reads, in so far as relevant: “98. Rapid and full execution of the Court’s judgments is vital. It is even more important in cases concerning structural problems, so as to ensure that the Court is not swamped with repetitive applications. For this reason, ever since the Rome ministerial conference of 3 and 4 November 2000 (Resolution I), it has been considered essential to strengthen the means given in this context to the Committee of Ministers. The Parties to the Convention have a collective duty to preserve the Court’s authority – and thus the Convention system’s credibility and effectiveness – whenever the Committee of Ministers considers that one of the High Contracting Parties refuses, expressly or through its conduct, to comply with the Court’s final judgment in a case to which it is party. 99. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 46 accordingly empower the Committee of Ministers to bring infringement proceedings in the Court (which shall sit as a Grand Chamber – see new Article 31, paragraph b), having first served the state concerned with notice to comply. The Committee of Ministers’ decision to do so requires a qualified majority of two thirds of the representatives entitled to sit on the Committee. This infringement procedure does not aim to reopen the question of violation, already decided in the Court’s first judgment. Nor does it provide for payment of a financial penalty by a High Contracting Party found in violation of Article 46, paragraph 1. It is felt that the political pressure exerted by proceedings for noncompliance in the Grand Chamber and by the latter’s judgment should suffice to secure execution of the Court’s initial judgment by the state concerned. 100. The Committee of Ministers should bring infringement proceedings only in exceptional circumstances. None the less, it appeared necessary to give the Committee of Ministers, as the competent organ for supervising execution of the Court’s judgments, a wider range of means of pressure to secure execution of judgments. Currently the ultimate measure available to the Committee of Ministers is recourse to Article 8 of the Council of Europe’s Statute (suspension of voting rights in the Committee of Ministers, or even expulsion from the Organisation). This is an extreme measure, which would prove counterproductive in most cases; indeed the High Contracting Party which finds itself in the situation foreseen in paragraph 4 of Article 46 continues to need, far more than others, the discipline of the Council of Europe. The new Article 46 therefore adds further possibilities of bringing pressure to bear to the existing ones. The procedure’s mere existence, and the threat of using it, should act as an effective new incentive to execute the Court’s judgments. It is foreseen that the outcome of infringement proceedings would be expressed in a judgment of the Court.”",[],[],[],"['11', '14']",[],[],0
181,001-23548,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2003,T.C. v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää,"The applicant, Mr T.C., is a Polish national, who was born in 1953. On 2 April 1996 E.N., with whom the applicant cohabited, gave birth to X. The boy’s birth certificate did not list the applicant as a father. Shortly afterwards E.N. was legally incapacitated because of her mental illness. On 9 May 1996 X was placed in an orphanage. Between 9 May and 31 December 1996 the applicant visited X in the orphanage on the following dates: 20 May, 16 June, 21 July, 1 September, 16 October and 15 December. On 29 October 1996 the Oświęcim District Court informed the applicant that legal advice on paternity could be obtained from an advocate or prosecution service. On 16 June 1997 the Oświęcim District Prosecutor informed the applicant that he would not bring on his behalf an action for the recognition of his paternity. The prosecutor advised the applicant that he could file himself an action seeking the confirmation of his paternity. On 11 August 1997 the X’s mother was deprived of her parental responsibility for the boy. On an unspecified date in 1997 the Bielsko-Biała District Court appointed a guardian (opiekun prawny) for X. Between January and June 1998 X stayed in the Jaworz Hospital. During this period the applicant visited X on the following dates: 18 January, 1, 15 and 22 February, 8, 15, 22 and 29 March, 12, 19 and 26 April, 3, 10, 24 and 31 May. On 22 May 1998 the Bielsko-Biała Adoption Centre submitted to the Bielsko-Biała District Court an application of M.N. and S.N. for the adoption of X. It appears that at that time X suffered from numerous health problems, including attachment disorder. On 25 May 1998 the Bielsko-Biała District Court made an interim residence order requiring X to reside with M.N. and S.N. On 2 June 1998 X was placed with M.N. and S.N. On 3 June 1998 the curator (kurator sądowy) of X lodged with the Oświęcim District Court an action for determination of the applicant’s paternity. On 8 June 1998 the applicant informed the Bielsko-Biała District Court about the beginning of the paternity proceedings before the Oświęcim District Court. On 21 July 1998 the Director of the Bielsko-Biała Adoption Centre replied to the applicant’s complaint about placing X with M.N. and S.N. The reply read as follows: “In reply to your letter I should inform you that the Adoption Centre acts as an intermediary in the adoption when a child referred to us has a settled legal situation i.e. when biological parents are deprived of parental rights. Our institution does not participate in this procedure and therefore we do not have any influence on the final court judgment. I would like to assure you that in accordance with the law the child was placed with the prospective adopters, who had been earlier subjected to psychological and pedagogical examinations which qualified them for adopters. I can also assure you that that the child at last feels happy and secure in a loving and responsible family. He paid a high price with his health during two years in a Child Centre, where there is no love without which a secure and proper development of a child is impossible. During the whole two years, the child was waiting for parents, for his family, for his safe place. His development was impaired and occasional meetings with you disturbed his peace and sense of security. You have to understand that a child cannot wait for so long for its place in a family. It always has negative bearing on its development. There was a long time for fighting for him. Now it is too late. The child feels happy in a new loving family. At last, he has a sense of security and stability. I ask you to consider these arguments and think whether you are not disturbing his happiness, for which he has been waiting for so long. On the other hand, I would like to express my sincere compassion and understanding for your pain and sense of injustice. I cannot help you with this anymore.” On 23 July 1998 the applicant was interviewed by the judge in charge of the adoption case. On 23 July 1998 the Bielsko-Biała District Court stayed the adoption proceedings pending the outcome of the paternity proceedings. On 3 September 1998 E.K., a director of the orphanage, submitted to the Oświęcim District Court the request not to grant the applicant the parental rights in respect of X when the court determines his paternity. The request included the following statement: “[X], who was born on 2 April 1996, lived in the orphanage since he was one month old until May 1998. Since the beginning of the child’s presence in the centre I was telling the presumed father of the boy how important it was to settle his legal situation for the good of the child. On numerous occasions I encouraged Mr T (...) C (...) and his mother to take the boy as a foster family (until the settlement of the father’s legal situation) since it would be a better environment for the boy’s psychophysical development. Finally, Mr T (...) C (...) stated that he would take the boy when he grew up. During two years the legal situation of the presumed father was not clarified and he did not show interest in taking the child as a foster parent. (...) The presumed father and the grandparents during two years did not show any significant involvement in the boy’s affairs. It seems that the child’s presence in an orphanage was convenient for the presumed father. He did not react to my suggestions that the boy be taken in a foster family until the paternity was determined. On the basis of an analysis of the nature of the contacts of Mr T (...) C (...) with the child and his attitude to life, one can assume that the presumed father will not cope with all the pedagogical and health problems which may appear in the future development of the boy.” The applicant submitted that the above statement was not true. On 11 September 1998 the Oświęcim District Court ruled that the applicant was the boy’s father. It also granted the applicant parental responsibility for X but limited his rights by appointing a curator to supervise X’s upbringing. The court considered that the applicant had tried to obtain the recognition of his paternity since the birth of X. Initially the applicant had intended to acknowledge his paternity in a statement made before the Registrar of Births (Urząd Stanu Cywilnego) but it had proved impossible in view of the attitude of X’s mother. Subsequently he had approached the prosecution service which had refused to bring on his behalf an action for the recognition of his paternity. In addition, the prosecutor had erroneously advised the applicant that he could file himself an action seeking the confirmation of his paternity. Furthermore, the court considered that the applicant’s visits in the orphanage were “in fact not very frequent but regular”. It concluded that granting the applicant’s parental responsibility “would be in the interest of the child and society”. On 16 September 1998 the Oświęcim District Court rejected a request filed by E.K., acting as a guardian of X, to serve her with a reasoned judgment since it considered that she had no standing in the case. However, this decision was subsequently quashed by the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court and E.K. was served with a reasoned judgment and therefore could appeal it. On 6 October 1998 M.N. and S.N. applied to the Bielsko-Biała District Court for an order designating them as a foster family of X. They pointed out that they had applied for the adoption of X and had obtained an interim residence order allowing the child to live with them. The boy settled in happily with a new family. However, the ruling on the applicant’s paternity created legal problems and prompted them to lodge an application in order to protect X’s security. On 30 November 1998 the President of the Bielsko-Biała District Court replied to the letter of 25 October 1998 in which the applicant’s representative raised complaints about the adoption proceedings. He explained that the applicant was not a party to the adoption proceedings. Furthermore, the President pointed out that the judge in charge of the case had met with the applicant and had asked him whether he had been willing to take care of X if the interim residence order had been quashed. However, the applicant had not shown willingness to take X. The applicant submitted that this statement was not true. On 4 December 1998 the Bielsko-Biała District Court stayed the proceedings concerning the foster family application pending the outcome of the adoption proceedings. On 10 December 1998 the applicant asked the Katowice Court of Appeal to initiate disciplinary proceedings against the judges of the BielskoBiała District Court. On 11 December 1998 E.K., acting as a guardian of X, lodged with the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court an appeal against the judgment of 11 September 1998. She agreed with the determination of the applicant’s paternity but challenged the court’s decision to grant him parental responsibility for X. The applicant should not have been granted parental responsibility because he had applied for it only after the child had been placed with the prospective adopters. Moreover, while X was still in the orphanage the applicant had refused to take him as a foster parent either alone or together with his mother. X settled very well with M.N. and S.N. and considered them as his parents. The boy’s health improved since his placement in the new family. The applicant averred that the submissions made by E.K. in her appeal were not true and included “nasty insinuations and manipulation”. On 28 December 1998 the applicant wrote a letter to the President of the Bielsko-Biała District Court. The letter began with the following statement: “I do not agree with propositions in your letter of 30 November 1998 (...) sent to my representative (...). It is an expression of great hypocrisy to formulate nonsense like this: “that I did not show willingness to take immediate steps to take care of [X] in case the interim residence order is quashed”. This is clearly absurd because neither on 23 July 1993 nor now can I undertake such care unless the judge has in mind some extraordinary circumstances and orders which existed in this case. I expressed the wish (on 23 July 1998) that [X] returned to the orphanage (which in view of [X]’s illnesses presented by the prospective adopters could have been the best solution for him, especially as these illnesses (among others hernia) were probably caused by taking [X] to another unknown environment). I would like to underline that I expressed on numerous occasions (...) a wish to take care of [X] (...).” On 29 January 1999 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court quashed the part of the Oświęcim District Court’s judgment of 11 September 1998 concerning parental responsibility for X. The case was remitted to the District Court. On 29 January 1999 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Prosecutor rejected the applicant’s request to prosecute E.K. and the judges of the BielskoBiała District Court on charges of perjury and corruption. On 23 September 1999 the Oświęcim District Court, acting as a court of first instance in the paternity proceedings, gave judgment in which it granted the applicant parental responsibility for X but limited his rights by appointing a curator to supervise X’s upbringing. The court considered that the applicant had shown interest in taking care of X since his birth. However, his lack of confidence made him take only “hesitant steps” to obtain the custody of the boy. The court also pointed out that the applicant had denied that he had intended to take X only after he had become older. Moreover, it relied on expert evidence according to which the applicant understood the needs of the boy and accepted him. E.K. appealed this decision in her capacity of the guardian of X. On 24 November 1999 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed the request of M.N. and S.N. that they be served with a copy of a reasoned judgment of 23 September 1999. At the same time, the court rejected their appeal against the Oświęcim District Court’s decision denying them standing in the paternity proceedings. On 20 January 2000 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed the E.K.’s appeal against the District Court’s judgment of 23 September 1999. E.K. filed a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. On 7 February 2000 the applicant was granted standing in the adoption proceedings. On 8 June 2000 the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal against the judgment of 20 January 2000 lodged by E.K. On an unspecified date in 2000 the Bielsko-Biała District Court resumed the adoption proceedings. In the meantime, on 14 December 2000 the Bielsko-Biała District Court gave judgment in which it dismissed an application for adoption lodged by M.N. and S.N. It also repealed an interim residence order of 25 May 1998. The court stated, inter alia, that: “During the paternity and adoption proceedings T(...) C(...) was refusing to agree to the adoption of his son. In the court’s view, (...) one cannot find in the behaviour of T(...) C(...) an abuse of his rights even though the child has presently good conditions for his development. The motives of his behaviour did not contradict the well being of the child. The court considers that in refusing his agreement to the adoption T(...) C(...) was guided by his feelings for his son. T(...) C(...), whose paternity was determined by a court, has strong feelings for his son (...) and finds separation from him hard to bear. It should also be noted that since the birth of his son T(...) C(...) has been trying to [obtain the custody] of his son. However, due to the circumstances – for the most of which he cannot be held responsible – and his personality, he has been unsuccessful[. As a result,] an interim order was issued placing [X] with the prospective adopters.” On 12 March 2001 the case concerning the first foster family application lodged on 6 October 1998 was joined to the case concerning the second foster family application pending before the Oświęcim District Court. On 18 April 2001 the Oświęcim District Court made an interim residence order requiring X to reside with M.N. and S.N. until the end of the proceedings concerning the foster family applications. It pointed out that they had been providing care to X for three years and that taking the boy by the applicant would be shocking for X. The applicant had never taken care of the boy and had not shown interest in his well being. Therefore, it was not certain whether the applicant would cope with the responsibilities of a parent and whether he fully understood the needs of his son. On 24 May 2001 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the order of 18 April 2001. On 3 August 2001 the Oświęcim District Court granted the applicant visiting rights. He was allowed to visit X twice a month. On 9 November 2001 the Oświęcim District Court asked for an expert opinion on the emotional relationships between X on one side and the applicant and M.N. and S.N. on the other side. The opinion was submitted to the court on 5 April 2002. On 12 June 2002 the Oświęcim District Court restricted the applicant’s parental responsibility for X by placing the boy in the foster family of M.N. and S.N. At the same time it dismissed their request that the applicant be deprived of his parental responsibility and repealed the order appointing a curator. The court noted that X had been living with M.N. and S.N for four years and during that time had made up for retardation in his development. However, the boy still required special care and the applicant was unable to provide it. The applicant’s misunderstanding of the reasons for which X was afraid of him and his mother showed that he knew very little about the behaviour of children. Moreover, the applicant had failed to notice obvious health problems of X while he had been living in an orphanage, such as attachment disorder and retardation in physical development. The court further agreed with the conclusions of an expert opinion that M.N. and S.N. qualified for providing care to X while the applicant did not show understanding of the needs of the boy and would be unable to provide him with normal family life. It also observed that the applicant’s commitment to taking X was in fact limited to writing numerous letters requesting the custody of the child. Since 3 August 2001, when the applicant had been granted visiting rights, he had visited X only once. The court was of the view that the removal of X from the custody of M.N. and S.N could cause irreversible damage to him. On 3 July 2002 the applicant filed with the Cracow Regional Court an appeal against the decision of 12 June 2002. On 19 November 2002 the Cracow Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. On 7 February 2003 the Bielsko-Biała Regional Court dismissed an appeal lodged by M.N. and S.N. against the judgment of 14 December 2000 rejecting their application for adoption. In a letter of 6 May 2003 the applicant informed the Court that in view of the fact that the decision of 12 June 2002 “was based on dishonest grounds” and “gave the [foster] family even bigger advantage” over the applicant, he decided to discontinue visiting his son as visits would “create even bigger danger” for X. The custody and adoption of children is regulated by the Family Code 1964 (Kodeks Rodzinny i Opiekuńczy).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
182,001-73067,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,KOLOTKOV v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Christos Rozakis,"The applicant, Mr Mikhail Anatolyevich Kolotkov, is a Russian national who was born in 1972 and lives in Moscow. The respondent Government were represented by Mr P.A. Laptev, Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant was a civil servant in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1998 to May 2001 he was assigned to the Russian embassy in the Republic of Uganda as an attaché. By an order of 17 July 2001 he was dismissed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the ground of expiration of the term of his labour contract. On 30 July 2001 the applicant brought proceedings for reinstatement. On 19 October 2001 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow found that the applicant had been employed for an indefinite period and that his dismissal had, therefore, been unlawful. It ordered the respondent Ministry to reinstate him in his post of an attaché at the Russian embassy in Uganda and update his labour records accordingly. It stated that the judgment was subject to immediate enforcement. The Ministry appealed against the judgment. On 18 December 2001 the Moscow City Court rejected the Ministry’s appeal and upheld the judgment which came into force on the same day. On 9 November 2001 the Ministry ordered the applicant’s reinstatement in his post in accordance with the judgment of 19 October 2001. However, as the three-year term of his assignment in Uganda had been expired and no extension was possible the applicant was offered, in January 2002, posts of an attaché available in the central office of the Ministry in Moscow. He refused to accept the offers and requested the continuation of his work in the capacity of an attaché at the embassy in Uganda. On 25 April 2002 he applied to the bailiff requesting the enforcement of the judgment. On 6 May 2002 the bailiff brought enforcement proceedings. By an order of 16 May 2002 the applicant was appointed an attaché at the historical and documentary department of the central office of the Ministry as of 15 January 2002. He refused to assume his office. By letters of 16, 22 and 28 May 2002 the Ministry informed the bailiff of their efforts to enforce the judgment and to settle the situation with the applicant’s employment. They explained, inter alia, with reference to the applicable legislation and the rules of rotation of diplomatic staff that there was no legal basis for the applicant’s continued service in the embassy in Uganda. By an order of 15 August 2002 the Ministry dismissed the applicant on the ground of his refusal to work. On 3 October 2002 the bailiff imposed a fine on the head of the personnel department of the Ministry for his failure to enforce the judgment. The Ministry challenged the bailiff’s decision in the District Court which on 28 November 2002 stayed the enforcement proceedings pending its decision. The applicant’s request to join the proceedings and his appeal against the decision to stay the enforcement were rejected. On 3 June 2003 the District Court found the bailiff’s decision imposing the fine lawful. On 15 August 2003 the Ministry quashed their order of 15 August 2002 on the applicant’s dismissal and ordered his reinstatement with his place of work in the central office of the Ministry. The applicant was paid remuneration for the preceding period and compensation for the late payment. On 29 August 2003 the Ministry fixed the applicant’s remuneration which included an allowance for his diplomatic rank of an attaché and an allowance for work with information involving State secret. By a decision of 11 September 2003 the bailiff discontinued the enforcement proceedings in view of the enforcement of the judgment. On 15 September 2003 the applicant appealed against the bailiff’s decision to discontinue the proceedings. On 31 October 2003 the District Court rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the bailiff’s decision. It found that the term of the applicant’s assignment to the embassy in Uganda had expired on 10 May 2001 and that thereafter the Ministry had provided him with work in its central office in accordance with the labour law requirements. It held that the judgment of 19 October 2001 as upheld on 18 December 2001 had been fully enforced. On 2 March 2004 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 31 October 2003. On 2 December 2002 the applicant brought an action challenging the Ministry’s order of 15 August 2002 by which he had been dismissed on the ground of his refusal to work. On 22 September 2003 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow found for the applicant. The enforcement proceedings were brought on 3 October 2003 and discontinued on 14 October 2003 in view of the applicant’s actual reinstatement. The applicant’s appeal to the District Court against the termination of the enforcement proceedings is pending. The judgment of 22 September 2003 was upheld on appeal by the Moscow City Court on 26 January 2004. On 3 November 2003 the applicant was dismissed from the Ministry on the ground of his absence from work. On 20 November 2003 he brought proceedings in the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow to challenge his dismissal. On 15 June 2004 the District Court found for the Ministry. The applicant lodged an appeal against the judgment. The proceedings are pending. On 29 July 2001 the applicant brought proceedings claiming pecuniary and nonpecuniary damages caused by his dismissal in July 2001. On 19 November 2001 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow stayed the proceedings pending the outcome of the first set of proceedings concerning the applicant’s reinstatement. On 8 July 2002 the District Court granted the applicant’s claims in part and ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to pay the applicant 12,548 roubles (“RUR”) in damages, including the applicant’s salary for the period between the date of his dismissal in July 2001 and 19 October 2001. On 10 July 2002 the District Court corrected the judgment stating that the amount awarded to the applicant was RUR 12,595.11. On 22 August 2002 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the judgment. On 10 October 2002 the applicant applied for the enforcement of the judgment of 8 July 2002, as amended on 10 July and upheld on 22 August 2002. On 24 October 2002 the bailiff brought enforcement proceedings. The Ministry considered that the applicant should have submitted the writ of execution to the Federal Treasury in accordance with the procedure provided by the applicable legislation. On 17 June 2003 the bailiff ordered that the Ministry’s money on their bank account be seized in order to enforce the judgment. Following the Ministry’s appeal against the bailiff’s decision, on 7 July 2003 the District Court stayed the enforcement proceedings. By a decision of 18 March 2004 the District Court quashed the bailiff’s decision of 17 June 2003 as unlawful. On 3 March 2003 the applicant lodged a request for reopening the case in view of newly-discovered circumstances. On 3 September 2003 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow granted the applicant’s request, quashed the judgment of 8 July 2002, as amended on 10 July and upheld on 22 August 2002, and ordered a fresh examination of the case. On the same day the District Court granted the applicant’s request for withdrawing the writ of execution issued in respect of the judgment of 8 July 2002, as amended on 10 July and upheld on 22 August 2002. Hearings listed for 17 September and 12 October 2004 did not take place since the applicant, who had been duly notified of the hearings, had failed to appear. On the latter date the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow ordered that the case not be examined on the ground of the applicant’s failure to appear in court. The applicant did not appeal and the decision became final on 22 October 2004. On 14 March 2002 the applicant brought proceedings claiming his remuneration and damages for the period after 19 October 2001. On 25 July 2002 the District Court granted his claims in part and ordered the Ministry to pay him RUR 13,478.56 covering the salary arrears for the period between 19 October 2001 and 25 July 2002. Following the applicant’s appeal the Moscow City Court quashed the judgment on 26 September 2002 and remitted the case to the firstinstance court for a fresh examination. In November 2002 the applicant submitted new claims for the payment of his salary until then. In January 2003 he requested to seize the Ministry’s bank accounts. The request was dismissed by a final decision of the Moscow City Court of 18 February 2003. In October 2003 the applicant submitted new claims concerning his salary arrears. The proceedings are pending. The applicant also brought other proceedings concerning his disputes with his employer. Thus, on 23 August 2002 the applicant lodged an application with the Constitutional Court of Russia challenging the constitutionality of the Government’s regulations which laid down terms and conditions of service for State employees abroad. On 16 September 2002 the secretariat of the court informed the applicant that the court did not have jurisdiction to examine the constitutionality of by-laws, that it dealt exclusively with the issues of the constitutionality of laws, and that therefore his application could not be examined. On 19 September 2002 the applicant lodged an application before the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation challenging the lawfulness of the same regulations. On 22 January 2003 the Supreme Court terminated the proceedings because the Government had quashed the regulations in issue. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 3 April 2003.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
183,001-77386,ENG,CZE,ADMISSIBILITY,2006,KVĚTOŇOVÁ v. THE CZECH REPUBLIC,4,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Ms Eva Květoňová, is a Czech national who was born in 1934 and lives in Munich. She was represented before the Court by Mr I. Chytil, a lawyer practising in Prague. The applicant’s parents owned a family house and two lands located in Trutnov. In February 1971 the applicant’s father died. The applicant and her mother became his legal successors. In 1972 the applicant and her mother were convicted in absentia of deserting the Republic. The courts imposed a term of imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of all their property. In 1973 the Trutnov State Notary (státní notářství) determined the late father’s estate, holding that the applicant and her mother inherited the whole estate but that, bearing in mind their criminal conviction, it should be forfeited for the benefit of the State. On 12 September 1974 the confiscated property was sold by the State to Mr and Ms M., with an agreement giving them the right to make personal use of the lands attached to the house. According to the applicant, the purchase contract contained a number of legal inaccuracies which made it null and void. Actually, the State was represented by the former Trutnov National District Council (okresní národní výbor) which at the material time had three quarters of the property at its disposal, the rights relating to the remaining quarter being transferred to it on 18 November 1974. Moreover, the real estate appraisal used for the purposes of the purchase was, contrary to the law, older than one year, the property at issue was not clearly specified in the purchase contract, the identity of the contractual parties was not verified and the person acting on behalf of the National District Council was not clearly indicated. In addition, the new owners’ right to make personal use of the lands attached to the house was approved by the Trutnov National Council on 22 August 1974, so before the transfer of the administration rights regarding the property. On 20 September 1977 the applicant’s mother died. The applicant became her legal successor. On 20 August and 8 October 1990 respectively, the District Court declared that, pursuant to section 2 of the Judicial Rehabilitation Act, the applicant’s and her mother’s convictions and all ancillary decisions had been automatically quashed with retrospective effect. On an unspecified date in 1995 the applicant initiated restitution proceedings against Mr and Ms M. pursuant to the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act. However, the courts did not grant her restitution claims finding that the purchase contract had not been concluded in breach of the regulations then in force and that the new owners had not enjoyed an unlawful advantage. After the death of Mr and Ms M., their sons became the owners of the property. In January 2001 the applicant sought to recover the property in issue by means of a civil action brought against the Mr and Ms M.’s sons, alleging the nullity of the purchase contract. In a judgment of 13 September 2002 the Trutnov District Court dismissed the applicant’s action stating, inter alia: “In a judgment no. ÚS 4/97 of 11 March 1997 the Plenary of the Constitutional Court held that judicial decisions whereby decisions concerning the confiscation of property had been quashed [pursuant to the Judicial Rehabilitation Act] did not form a basis on which the ownership rights could be renewed. The applicant claimed the restitution ... under [the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act], but was unsuccessful. Having regard to the fact that [she] based her current arguments mainly on her incorrect legal opinion concerning the effects of the nullity of the confiscation decision, her [civil] action [is] not substantiated. [I]t is not decisive whether the purchase contract ... is valid or not. ... [T]he question of [its] validity or the nullity is more specific than the criteria laid down in the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act for natural persons obliged to restore immovable property to a restitution claimant .... [The court examined in the [previous] restitution proceedings whether the new owners could have acquired the property contrary to the law then in force ... or on the basis of any unlawful advantage, and found that it was not the case.] The court, therefore, did not examine in detail [the applicant’s arguments concerning] the alleged nullity of the purchase contract.” On 28 January 2003 the Hradec Králové Regional Court (krajský soud) upheld the first instance judgment. The applicant’s subsequent appeal on points of law (dovolání) was dismissed by the Supreme Court (Nejvyšší soud) on 30 October 2003, the court stating, in particular: “[N]either the appellate court nor the court of first instance erred in applying [the provisions of the Judicial Rehabilitation Act and the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act]; they rightly considered their interrelationship and took account of the [previous] restitution proceedings closed upon a final and conclusive judgment. The applicant based her claims on the substantially same arguments which she had used in the previous restitution proceedings, emphasising the [alleged] nullity of the purchase contract ... [However] it is inadmissible to circumvent the restitution law by applying the general civil law, in case that the [previous] restitution action failed. ...” The Supreme Court concluded that the applicant’s appeal on points of law did not challenge a decision which would give rise to a question of crucial legal importance as provided for in section 237(1)(c) of the Code of Civil Proceedings. The applicant challenged the lower courts’ legal opinions before the Constitutional Court (Ústavní soud) maintaining that the courts had failed to examine the validity of the purchase contract. She alleged, in this respect, a violation of her right to judicial protection under Article 36 § 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (Listina základních práv a svobod) and her property rights guaranteed by Article 11 § 1 of the Charter. On 1 July 2004 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal (ústavní stížnost) finding that the procedural steps taken by the lower courts and their interpretation of the legislation did not infringe the applicant’s fundamental rights guaranteed by the constitutional law or international treaties. Article 11 § 1 provides, inter alia, that everyone has the right to own property. All owners’ property rights are equal in the eyes of the law and enjoy the same legal protection. The right to inherit is guaranteed. Under Article 36 § 2 anybody who claims that his or her rights have been violated by a decision of a public administration organ may turn to a court for a review of the legality of such decision, unless the law provides differently. However, review of decisions affecting the fundamental rights and freedoms listed in the Charter may not be excluded from the jurisdiction of courts. Section 1 states that the purpose of the Act is to provide for the quashing of convictions that are incompatible with the principles of a democratic society respecting the political rights and freedoms enshrined in the Constitution and guaranteed by international treaties, and to ensure the social and economic rehabilitation of persons so convicted. Section 2 provides that all convictions from 25 February 1948 to 1 January 1990 that contravened those principles and related to events occurring after 5 May 1945 are to be quashed with retrospective effect, together with any ancillary decisions. Courts are to examine of their own motion all matters relating to the rehabilitation of convicted persons. Section 23(2) provides that the implementing conditions for claims arising from quashed confiscation decisions, and also the method of redress and the scope of such claims, are to be laid down in a special law. Section 1 provides that the purpose of the Act is to mitigate the effects of certain wrongs committed between 25 February 1948 and 1 January 1990 (“the period concerned”) which were incompatible with the principles of a democratic society respecting the rights of citizens as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Act also lays down the conditions for lodging claims arising from quashed confiscation decisions, and also the method of redress and the scope of such claims. Section 2 provides that infringements of property rights which occurred during the period concerned are to be redressed either by restitution of property or by pecuniary compensation. Section 4 requires the State and/or any legal entity in possession of confiscated property on the date on which the Act came into force to return the property. Paragraph 2 provides that any natural person who acquired property from the State unlawfully or by means of an unlawful advantage is likewise required to return the property. Section 19(1) provides that any person who has been rehabilitated in accordance with Law no. 119/1990 is entitled to claim restitution provided that he or she satisfies the conditions laid down in section 3(1). Section 20(1) provides that any legal entity within the meaning of section 4(1) and any natural person within the meaning of section 4(2) must return confiscated property acquired from the State where the State itself obtained it as a result of the conviction of the original owners; the central administrative authorities of the Republic are likewise required to return any confiscated property. Section 237(1)(b) provides that an appeal on points of law lay against appellate court judgments and decisions upholding first instance decisions in which the court of first instance decided differently from its previous meritorious decision, having been bound by the legal opinion of the appellate court which had quashed the previous decision at first instance. Under section 237(c) an appeal on points of law lay also against appellate court judgments and decisions upholding first instance decisions if such an appeal is not admissible under paragraph b) and if the court dealing with the appeal on points of law finds that the challenged decision gives rise to a question of crucial legal importance. In this judgment the Constitutional Court held that judicial decisions whereby decisions concerning the confiscation of property had been quashed pursuant to the Judicial Rehabilitation Act did not form a basis on which anyone thus rehabilitated was entitled to be entered in the land register as the owner. It held that such decisions did not restore previous ownership, since section 23(2) of the Judicial Rehabilitation Act provided that the conditions for implementing that Act were laid down in the Extrajudicial Rehabilitation Act. In this decision the Supreme Court held, in particular, that the provisions of the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act constitute a lex specialis in relation to the general provisions of the Civil Code. In restitution cases, it is therefore not possible to seek judicial protection under the general provisions of the Civil Code (e.g. by means of an action for recovery), but only by a special way provided for in the restitution legislation. In this decision the Supreme Court admitted that the entire removal of all wrongs committed by the former communist regime was not possible. The legislator opted, therefore, for legal means aiming to mitigate “the effects of certain wrongs”. For these purposes, it determined the “restitution border” (the period between 25 February 1948 and 1 January 1990 in which the wrongs had taken place) and fixed the conditions and the way to pursue to claim restitution of property. If other parallel procedural ways were accepted to be pursued under the general legal provisions the special restitution law would lose its sense. In this decision the Supreme Court stated that the restitution legislation demonstrates the legislator’s will to contribute to the mitigation of huge wrongs which were committed in the decisive period, i.e. between 1948 and 1989. This legislation, including the Extra-Judicial Rehabilitation Act is not based on the conception of declaration of the nullity of decisions, acts and legal actions. It indicates the special way to pursue for claiming restitution. In this decision the Supreme Court recalled its legal opinion expressed in its decision no. 28 Cdo 2343/2000 of 31 January 2001 stating, moreover, that according to the established national case-law, the restitution legislation is a lex specialis in relation to the general provisions of the Civil Code. Actually, if the restitution law is applicable in a particular case, it is inadmissible to circumvent it and, in case that the restitution action failed, to base the restitution claims on the general legal provisions. This would create a situation of legal uncertainty of the parties to the legal acts which were challengeable under the restitution law.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1985 and lives in Gorlivka in the Donetsk region. 8. On 7 May 2003 the applicant was found fit for mandatory military service and was drafted into the army. He was willing to perform his military service and had no psychiatric or psychological concerns. Nor had he previously experienced any mental disorders. 9. After a brief period in a training camp, the applicant was assigned to Military Unit А0246, subsequently renamed Т0120 (hereinafter referred to as MU1). According to the applicant, he was regularly subjected to bullying and ill-treatment by senior officers in that unit. One such incident allegedly took place in February 2004 (see paragraph 23 below). 10. On 23 February 2004 the applicant was transferred to Military Unit А0730, subsequently renamed Т0310 (hereinafter referred to as MU2). He immediately attracted the attention of the commanding officers and medical staff by what they perceived as inadequate behaviour. That is, he appeared very sensitive, was not willing to communicate with fellow servicemen and expressed thoughts that could be interpreted as indicating suicidal tendencies. As a result, on the day of his arrival, the applicant was placed in the medical station, where he was kept for ten days. According to the authorities, the purpose of that measure was to monitor the applicant’s behaviour to see whether it gave rise to doubts about his fitness for continuing with his military service. The military officials also referred to the necessity to isolate the applicant from other soldiers on account of his psychological condition. According to the applicant, who did not deny the above account of his mental state, the real purpose of his placement in the medical station was to allow time for some bruises which he had to fade. 11. The case file does not contain the applicant’s medical file for the period from 23 February to 2 March 2004. According to the Government, those documents were probably destroyed or lost during the reorganisation of the military unit in September 2004 (see paragraph 15 below). 12. On 2 March 2004 the applicant was taken to the psychiatric department of the hospital of Military Unit A4615 (hereinafter referred to as MU3) for an examination and treatment. 13. On 1 April 2004 a medical panel at MU3 examined the applicant with a view to establishing whether he was fit for further military service. It noted in its report that the applicant complained of irritability, mood swings and headaches, the intolerable nature of the army atmosphere, and being homesick. The panel further noted that he had initially been willing to serve in the army and had had no prior psychiatric problems. However, during military service his health had gradually deteriorated. The applicant had been characterised by his fellow servicemen as unsociable, slow, untidy, short-tempered and suicidal. During his conversation with the doctors he appeared sad and emotionally fragile, sometimes tearful. The panel diagnosed him with moderate neuroticism expressed over a protracted period of time following situational triggers. It stated that his illness was related to his military service. The panel reached the conclusion that the applicant was not fit for further military service in peacetime and partially fit for service in wartime. He was also found to require a carer. 14. On 19 April 2004 the applicant was discharged from the military hospital and from the army. 15. In September 2004, as part of the reorganisation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the control of MU2 was transferred from the Ministry of the Defence to the Ministry of Public Transport. 16. On 7 July 2005 the Donetsk Regional Psychiatric Expert Commission of the Public Health Ministry (“the Psychiatric Commission”) registered the applicant as “Category 2” disabled on account of his mental condition, finding that he had lost eighty per cent of his capacity to work. 17. The applicant was granted a disability pension in the amount of 310 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH) per month (then the equivalent of about fifty euros). 18. On 21 February 2007 the Gorlivka Psychoneurological Hospital issued a note, at the applicant’s request, detailing his medication needs and their costs. It specified that he required, on a regular basis, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants and nootropics amounting to UAH 580 per month, as well as some treatment which cost UAH 3,530 per year. 19. By decisions of 22 August 2007, 26 August 2008 and 7 September 2010, the Psychiatric Commission confirmed that the applicant was “Category 2” disabled on account of “an illness related to his performance of military service”. On the last-mentioned date it decided that his disability was permanent and that no future reassessments were required. 20. In February 2006 the applicant’s mother complained to the President of Ukraine, and apparently to some other authorities, that the applicant had been subjected to bullying and beatings during his military service at MU2 (she probably meant MU1 – see paragraph 22 below). 21. On 17 March 2006 the Military Prosecutor of the Dnipropetrovsk Garrison (hereafter referred to as “the Dnipropetrovsk Military Prosecutor”), to whom the aforementioned complaint had been forwarded, refused to institute criminal proceedings. He relied on the statements by the Chiefs of Staff of MU1 and MU2 and the squadron commanders in those two units, who denied that the applicant had been ill-treated or bullied, or that they had received any complaints from him in that regard. The prosecutor also questioned the chief of the medical station in MU2, who stated that the applicant had displayed “inadequate” behaviour, but had had no injuries and had not complained of any ill-treatment. After ten days of monitoring by the medical station’s doctors, it had been decided to transfer the applicant to MU3 for further examination, as that unit had a specialised psychiatric department in its hospital. Lastly, the prosecutor relied on the findings of the medical report of 1 April 2004, according to which the applicant had not raised any allegations of ill-treatment or bullying at that stage. Nor had his medical examination discovered any injuries. In sum, the prosecutor concluded that there was no case to answer. 22. On an unspecified date, the Southern Region Military Prosecutor quashed the aforementioned decision and ordered an additional investigation. 23. On 8 April 2006 the applicant gave a written statement to the Military Prosecutor of the Donetsk Garrison (near his place of residence) in respect of his alleged ill-treatment in the army. He submitted that from the autumn of 2003 he had been bullied by senior soldiers in MU1, who had extorted his military allowance and had used every possible pretext for beating him – such as allegedly inadequate cleaning or failure to accomplish a task. The applicant noted that there had been only one other junior soldier in the military unit, apart from himself, S. According to the applicant, they had often discussed their impressions of military service and had discussed the bullying incidents. The applicant admitted that he had not complained to his commanding officers, fearing that it would be considered ‘squealing’ and would trigger reprisals. Nor had he mentioned the matter to his parents, not wanting to upset them. The applicant stated that the last time he had been beaten up was by two officers, V. and another one whose name he did not know, in February 2004. On the following day he had not felt well and had sought medical assistance, explaining to the doctor what had happened. According to the applicant, the actual purpose of his placement in the medical station was to allow time for his bruises to fade. At the same time, he specified that he had not been ill-treated in MU2, where he was transferred shortly before his discharge from the army. 24. In response to a question about the delay of two years in raising the complaint of ill-treatment, the applicant submitted that he had been ashamed of his discharge from the army and that he had hoped to stay strong and to still be able to complete his military service. He stated that he had not realised how serious his condition was. The constant deterioration of his health had prompted him to complain to the prosecuting authorities. 25. As to the denial by the doctors of any injuries on the applicant at the material time, he contended that they had lied. 26. The applicant further noted in his statement to the prosecutor that his memory had seriously deteriorated. He could not remember the date of the beginning of his military service. Nor was he able to give details as to his alleged bullying prior to the last incident in February 2004. The applicant explained that he remembered clearly only the said incident, because it had been the last one and because he had been hospitalised thereafter. 27. On 28 February 2007 the applicant sent a letter to the Dnipropetrovsk Military Prosecutor, by registered post, requesting a copy of the decision refusing to open a criminal case into his alleged ill-treatment in the army (which appears to be that of 17 March 2006 – see paragraph 21 above). According to him, he received no reply. 28. On 21 March 2007 the applicant challenged the Dnipropetrovsk Military Prosecutor’s decision of 17 March 2006 before the Southern Region Military Prosecutor. He complained, in particular, that certain important witnesses had not been examined, namely S. and V. (see paragraph 23 above). 29. On 20 April 2007 the Southern Region Military Prosecutor informed the applicant by a letter that the contested decision had already been quashed in the meantime. The applicant confirmed in his submissions to the Court that he had received the letter. 30. On 4 June 2007 the Dnipropetrovsk Military Prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings against officials of MU1 and MU2, having discerned no corpus delicti in their actions. In addition to the reasoning given in the decision of 17 March 2006, the prosecutor referred to the applicant’s statements of 8 April 2006 (see paragraph 23 above). Further, the investigation had established that S., whom the applicant had mentioned in his submissions, had only served at MU1 until 31 October 2003, after which he had been transferred to another unit. S. was questioned and refuted the applicant’s allegations, as did officer V., whom the applicant had accused of ill-treating him. The prosecutor also took note of the fact that the applicant had never complained during his medical examinations of any ill-treatment or bullying. Nor had those examinations revealed any injuries on him. 31. According to the Government, on 5 June 2007 the above-mentioned decision was sent to the applicant’s mother. According to the applicant and his mother, they became aware of the decision only from the Government’s observations on the case in the proceedings before the Court. 32. On 15 February 2011 the Dnipropetrovsk Military Prosecutor destroyed 205 investigation files which had been opened in connection with various complaints dating from 2006 and 2007, as the time-limits for their storage had expired. The applicant’s case was among them. 33. On an unspecified date in 2006 the applicant’s mother enquired with the Ministry of Defence as to whether the applicant could use its medical facilities free of charge, given that he had become disabled during his mandatory military service. 34. On 28 March 2006 the Armed Forces Deputy Chief of General Staff replied in the negative. He explained that while the legislation provided for such privileges as free use of Ministry of Defence medical establishments, the applicant was not eligible because “[his] disability did not result from a wound, a contusion, maiming, or a disease related to the discharge of military service duties, but was caused by a disease related to the performance of his military service.” 35. On 28 February 2007 the applicant lodged an administrative claim against MU2 with the Kalyninskyy District Court of Gorlivka (“the Kalyninskyy Court”), seeking compensation for damage caused by his disability, which he claimed had resulted from his ill-treatment in the army. He claimed a lump sum of UAH 9,249 in compensation for lost income, a monthly disability allowance of UAH 320, and an additional monthly allowance of UAH 874 for his medical expenses. 36. On 20 February 2008 the Kalyninskyy Court rejected the applicant’s claim, finding that he had already received all payments he was entitled to. 37. On 24 April 2008 the Donetsk Administrative Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. It noted that the applicant was receiving a disability pension and that he had already received an insurance payment due to him (UAH 6,800). 38. On 14 July 2011 the Higher Administrative Court upheld the lower courts’ decisions. 39. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows: “The human being, his or her life and health, honour and dignity, inviolability and security are recognised in Ukraine as having the highest social value. ...” “Everyone has the right to respect for his or her dignity. No one shall be subjected to torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that violates his or her dignity. ...” 40. According to section 11 of the Armed Forces Act 1991, the activities of the armed forces shall be based, in particular, on the principles of the rule of law, lawfulness, respect for humanity, and respect for the individual and his or her constitutional rights and freedoms. 41. In her Report 2004, the Parliament of Ukraine’s Commissioner for Human Rights dedicated a separate chapter to the issues of “respect for human rights in the armed forces of Ukraine and other military establishments”, in which she condemned the widespread phenomena of bullying and ill-treatment in the army.",[],[],[],"['13', '3']",[],[],0
185,001-83796,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,OMWENYEKE v. GERMANY,2,Inadmissible,Peer Lorenzen,"The applicant, Mr Sunday E. Omwenyeke, is a Nigerian national who was born in 1965 and lives in Bremen. He was represented before the Court by Ms N. Mole, a lawyer working for the AIRE (Advice on Individual Rights in Europe) Centre in London. On 22 June 1998 the applicant entered Germany and requested asylum. On 12 October 1998 the Federal Office for Refugees rejected his asylum request and declared that there was no prohibition on deporting him because he did not face political persecution in Nigeria. The applicant brought an action in the Hannover Administrative Court seeking to have this decision quashed. On 29 October 1998 the applicant, who had been issued with a provisional residence permit (Aufenthaltsgestattung, see 'Relevant domestic law' below), was directed to reside and remain within the city of Wolfsburg pending the decision on his asylum request. Between 12 November 1998 and 11 January 2000 the Wolfsburg Aliens Office granted the applicant leave to quit the city of Wolfsburg on six occasions in order to attend conferences for refugees and on one occasion to meet a lawyer. In April 2000 the applicant left the city of Wolfsburg in order to help in preparations for and to attend another congress for refugees, despite the fact that the Aliens Office had refused him permission to leave the city. The applicant left Wolfsburg on three further occasions without having requested authorisation to do so. On 6 February 2001 the Wolfsburg District Court discontinued the criminal proceedings instituted against the applicant for repeated disregard of a territorial restriction of residence, since it considered the applicant's offence to be of a minor nature. On 3 May 2001 the applicant was again stopped by the police outside the Wolfsburg city limits; again, he had not requested and obtained the necessary authorisation. On 16 July 2001 the applicant was granted a residence permit (Aufenthaltserlaubnis) following his marriage to a German national and was thus no longer subject to restrictions on his movements. On 9 October 2003 the Bremen District Court convicted the applicant of repeated disregard of a territorial restriction of residence in view of his residence outside Wolfsburg in 2000 and on 3 May 2001, and ordered him to pay a fine of 112.50 euros (EUR). The Bremen District Court conceded that the application of section 56 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act (see 'Relevant domestic law' below) led to hardships for asylum seekers in many cases. Nevertheless, contrary to the applicant's view, that provision was compatible with the Basic Law. This had been confirmed by the Federal Constitutional Court, in particular, in its decision dated 10 April 1997. The legislator had restricted the right to free development of one's personality, guaranteed by Article 2 § 1 of the Basic Law in a proportionate manner. The impugned provision was intended to accelerate the treatment of asylum requests by securing the asylum seekers' availability, and to distribute between the Länder and cities the tasks and costs incurred by taking in asylum seekers. There was no milder, equally effective means to secure the achievement of the aims pursued by the provision. In particular, the option of restricting merely longer absences from the assigned district and authorising shorter absences without prior permission could not be controlled in practice and would entail considerable administrative expense. Given that section 57 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act (see 'Relevant domestic law' below) allowed for exceptions from the restriction of residence, that restriction was not disproportionate. Likewise, it was not disproportionate to enforce the restriction by means of criminal law (section 85 no. 2 of the Asylum Procedure Act). The District Court further found that the territorial restriction of residence pursuant to section 56 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act did not contravene any provisions of public international law. Both Article 26 of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and Article 12 § 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR; see 'Relevant domestic and public international law' below) granted freedom of movement only to refugees who were lawfully on the territory of the Contracting State. This was only the case where an asylum seeker was recognised by a final decision as a person being persecuted for political reasons. The applicant had resided lawfully in Germany only since 16 July 2001, when he was granted a residence permit following his marriage to a German national. On 13 February 2004 the Bremen Regional Court dismissed the applicant's appeal. It found that the appeal, which had been lodged in accordance with the formal requirements and time-limit laid down in the Code of Criminal Procedure, was manifestly ill-founded and therefore inadmissible. Endorsing the reasons given by the District Court, the Regional Court confirmed that the applicable provisions of the Asylum Procedure Act complied with the provisions of the Basic Law and of public international law. On 27 May 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant's constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 554/04). The Federal Constitutional Court found that the complaint had no prospects of success. In so far as the applicant considered sections 56 and 85 no. 2 of the Asylum Procedure Act to be unconstitutional, he had not sufficiently substantiated his complaint. He had failed to address the reasons given in the Federal Constitutional Court's decision of 10 April 1997 in which it had found that the impugned provisions complied with the Basic Law. In so far as the applicant contested the application of the impugned provisions to his case, his submissions were inconsistent. He now claimed to have travelled for the benefit of a refugee organisation on 3 May 2001, a fact which he had failed to mention in the proceedings before the criminal courts. The decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 11 June 2004. The Asylum Procedure Act (Asylverfahrensgesetz) lays down the rules which are applicable to foreigners who seek asylum on account of political persecution or who seek protection from deportation to a country where their life or freedom would be at risk. Under section 55 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act, a foreigner who requests asylum is permitted to reside on the Federal Territory while the relevant asylum proceedings are pending (provisional residence permit – Aufenthaltsgestattung). He or she is not entitled to reside in a particular Land or place. Section 56 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act provides that the provisional residence permit is territorially restricted to the district of the Aliens Office in which the institution responsible for reception of the foreigner is located. Under section 58 § 1 of the Asylum Procedure Act, the Aliens Office may grant a foreigner who is not or is no longer obliged to live in a reception centre authorisation to leave temporarily the district for which his or her provisional residence permit is valid or, generally, to reside in a neighbouring district. Leave must be granted if there is a pressing public interest or compelling grounds to do so, or if a refusal to grant leave would entail an undue hardship. Section 58 § 2 stipulates that leave is to be granted to facilitate appointments with representatives, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and with organisations providing care for refugees. Under section 58 § 3, a foreigner does not require permission to keep appointments with authorities and courts where his or her appearance in person is necessary. Section 85 no. 2 of the Asylum Procedure Act provides that anyone who repeatedly contravenes a restriction of residence imposed under section 56 § 1 shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year, or to a fine. The relevant provision of the United Nations Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, adopted on 28 July 1951, reads: Article 26. Freedom of movement “Each Contracting State shall accord to refugees lawfully in its territory the right to choose their place of residence and to move freely within its territory subject to any regulations applicable to aliens generally in the same circumstances.” Article 12 § 1 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted on 16 December 1966, provides: “Everyone lawfully within the territory of a State shall, within that territory, have the right to liberty of movement and freedom to choose his residence.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
186,001-120818,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2013,SOMICO OOD v. BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Paul Mahoney;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant company, Somico OOD, is a Bulgarian limited liability company, which was set up in 1993 and is based in Sofia. It was represented before the Court by Ms S. Margaritova-Vuchkova, a lawyer practising in Sofia. 2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 1 February 1993 the applicant company entered into a lease agreement with the Bureau for Servicing the Diplomatic Corps (“the BSDC”), a body of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, renting from it a Stateowned shop. It appears that the term of the lease agreement was periodically renewed until 31 December 1996. 5. On 30 May 1996 the applicant company submitted a proposal to the Privatisation Agency to purchase the shop under the preferential privatisation procedure available to lessees of State and municipality-owned properties, provided for in section 35 (1) of the Privatisation Act (see paragraph 31 below). 6. In a decision of 22 October 1996 the Privatisation Agency declined the proposal. It reasoned that the conditions under section 35 (1) of the Privatisation Act had not been met, because the BSDC was not a State enterprise and real property included in its assets could not be sold or exchanged. 7. The applicant company applied for judicial review of the Privatisation Agency’s refusal. In a judgment of 14 January 1997, which was considered final, the Supreme Administrative Court (“the SAC”) quashed the decision of 22 October 1996 and instructed the Agency to open a privatisation procedure. The SAC held that the shop was owned by the State and had been assigned to the BSDC for use and management only. 8. Following that judgment, on 13 March 1997 the Privatisation Agency opened a procedure for the shop’s privatisation. On 4 April 1997 its decision to that effect was published in the State Gazette. 9. On an unknown date the BSDC submitted a petition for review (преглед по реда на надзора) of the judgment of 14 January 1997. 10. On 18 September 1997 a five-member panel of the SAC quashed the judgment of 14 January 1997 and remitted the case to a three-member panel of the same court. The five-member panel noted that, notwithstanding the fact that the shop was owned by the State, it was not subject to privatisation because the BSDC did not have the status of a State enterprise. 11. Following a fresh examination, in a judgment of 2 December 1997 a three-member panel of the SAC dismissed the applicant company’s application for judicial review. However, on appeal, in a final judgment of 23 June 1998 a five-member panel of the same court quashed the decision of 22 October 1996 and instructed the Privatisation Agency to open a privatisation procedure aimed at selling the shop to the applicant company. It considered, most notably, that the shop was the property of the State and that the BSDC’s legal status was not an obstacle to the privatisation. It considered, in addition, that the applicant company met all the requirements to benefit from the preferential conditions under section 35 (1) of the Privatisation Act. 12. Following that decision, on 3 August 1998 the Privatisation Agency wrote to the applicant company proposing a price for the shop, inquiring whether the applicant company accepted to buy the shop and inviting it to propose payment conditions. 13. On 6 August 1998 the applicant company informed the Privatisation Agency that it agreed to buy the shop at the price proposed. In addition, it suggested a payment scheme. 14. The signing of the privatisation contract was scheduled for 3 September 1998; however, several hours before the meeting an employee of the Privatisation Agency informed the applicant company by telephone that it would be postponed. 15. Meanwhile, on 2 September 1998 the Privatisation Agency inquired with the Sofia municipality as to whether there were any restitution claims in respect of the shop. On 11 November 1998 the regional governor of Sofia replied that on 19 October 1998 he had decided to transfer the shop to a third party in compensation for their expropriated property (see below). 16. It transpired subsequently that on 27 July 1998 the BSDC had transferred ownership of the shop to the Sofia municipality. On the same day the Sofia municipal council included it in the assets of the municipallyowned company managing municipal real properties. It is unclear whether the Privatisation Agency had been informed of those developments at the time. 17. It also transpired that on 16 April 1998 a third party – the heirs of Ms E.P. – had requested the transfer of the shop in compensation for expropriated real property. As already mentioned, in a decision of 19 October 1998 the regional governor granted their request. 18. The applicant company applied for judicial review of that latter decision. However, on 29 December 1999 the Sofia City Court found its application inadmissible, holding that the applicant company had not been a party to the restitution proceedings and therefore had no standing to challenge the impugned decision. 19. The parties have not informed the Court whether it was possible for the applicant company to challenge the transfer of the property from the State to the municipality, or resort to any other remedy directed against the municipality. 20. On 1 February 2000 the applicant company sought judicial review of the Privatisation Agency’s failure to finalise the privatisation transaction in compliance with the judgment of 23 June 1998. However, on 19 June 2000 the SAC rejected the application for judicial review as inadmissible, holding that the impugned failure to execute a final judicial act did not represent an administrative decision in itself and therefore was not subject to judicial control. 21. On an unspecified date the applicant company requested the assistance of the Ministry of Economy to finalise the privatisation transaction. In a letter of 21 September 2000 the Minister of Economy invited the Privatisation Agency to comply with the judgment of 23 June 1998. 22. In letters of 20 October 1998, 6 April 2000 and 9 January and 22 February 2001 the applicant company also invited the Privatisation Agency to finalise the privatisation procedure. 23. On 2 March 2001 the Privatisation Agency informed the applicant company that the shop had been transferred to the Sofia municipality and that the regional governor’s subsequent decision to transfer it in compensation to a third party represented a new circumstance which impeded the finalisation of the privatisation transaction. 24. The applicant company applied for judicial review of the Privatisation Agency’s refusal. In a judgment of 11 July 2001 a threemember panel of the SAC quashed the refusal and instructed the Agency to transfer title to the shop to the applicant company. It reasoned that the applicant company had acquired the right to buy the shop and the Agency was therefore obliged to sign the privatisation agreement. However, upon an appeal by the Privatisation Agency, in a final judgment of 8 January 2002 a five-member panel of the SAC found the applicant company’s application for judicial review inadmissible. It held that the Agency’s refusal to sign a privatisation agreement had not amounted to an administrative decision because, at that stage of the privatisation procedure, the two parties had been acting on an equal footing. Thus, the existing dispute between them could not be settled in administrative proceedings. 25. On 25 June 2001 the applicant company brought a civil action against the Privatisation Agency, seeking to have declared final the preliminary contract which it considered had been reached between them. Mr Y.P. and Ms S.P., heirs of Ms E.P., intervened in the proceedings with a claim for a declaratory judgment against the applicant company and the Privatisation Agency that they were the owners of the shop on the basis of the regional governor’s decision of 19 October 1998. 26. On 23 June 2003 the Sofia City Court dismissed the action of the applicant company and declared that Mr Y.P. and Ms S.P. were the owners of the shop. Upon an appeal by the applicant company, on 23 June 2004 the Sofia Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. It considered, in particular, that following the judgment of 23 June 1998 (see paragraph 11 above) the applicant company and the Privatisation Agency had exchanged correspondence in which they had reached an agreement on the main conditions of the sale of the shop, which represented a preliminary contract. However, the Privatisation Agency had not been the owner of the shop, which meant that the preconditions for declaring the preliminary contract final had not been present. 27. Following an appeal, in a final judgment of 21 July 2005 the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the lower courts’ judgments. It considered, in particular, that the correspondence between the applicant company and the Privatisation Agency did not represent a preliminary contract. 28. In the meantime, on 5 April 2002 a notary public, acting with the assistance of the police, put Mr Y.P. and Ms S.P. in possession of the shop. It appears that by this time the applicant company, which was still holding the property, was no longer using it and it was in a state of abandon. 29. The Transformation and Privatisation of State and Municipal Enterprises Act (Закон за преобразуване и приватизация на държавни и общински предприятия: “the Privatisation Act”) of 1992 provided for the transformation of public property and the privatisation of State and municipality-owned enterprises. It was superseded by other legislation in March 2002. 30. Section 3 of the Act indicated the bodies competent to take decisions on privatisation. As concerns State-owned properties, the competent bodies were either the Privatisation Agency, or, for the most important objects, the Council of Ministers. The body competent to decide on the privatisation of municipally-owned properties was the relevant municipal council. 31. Under section 35 (1) of the Privatisation Act, lessees of State and municipality-owned property could propose to buy the property rented by them, without a public auction or competition and for a price equal to the property’s value assessed by certified experts in accordance with rules adopted by the Government. Those preferential conditions were applicable to lessees of State and municipality-owned property who had concluded lease contracts before 15 October 1993 and where the said contracts were still in force on the date of the respective privatisation proposal. 32. Section 35 (2) of the Privatisation Act, as worded after October 1997, provided that where a refusal by the competent administrative body to initiate a privatisation procedure following a proposal by the interested party had been quashed by means of a final court judgment, the relevant administrative body was obliged, within two months of the judgment becoming final, to initiate the privatisation procedure, prepare the privatisation of the property at issue and offer to sell the property to the entitled party. 33. Paragraph 6 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Privatisation Act addressed different situations of conflict of competing privatisation and restitution interests. It provided, in particular, that in cases where a privatisation contract had already been concluded, the parties claiming to have restitution rights were to be compensated through shares in the companies which had acquired the property, if any such shares were owned by the State or municipalities, or through compensation bonds.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
187,001-23082,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,NIVETTE v. FRANCE,1,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Mr James Dewayne Nivette, is an American national, born in 1942 and currently in custody in Strasbourg-Elsau Prison. He was represented before the Court by Mr D.S. Bergmann, of the Colmar Bar. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 18 November 1997 the Sacramento Municipal Court (California) issued an international warrant for the arrest of the applicant, who was suspected of having murdered his girlfriend on 16 November 1997. On 20 November 1997 the applicant was arrested at Munster (France) and taken into custody pending extradition proceedings. On 22 December 1997 the United States authorities filed an extradition request with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On 29 January 1998 the Indictment Division of the Colmar Court of Appeal ruled in favour of extraditing the applicant provided that the United States authorities gave the French government an assurance that they would neither seek nor apply the death penalty. It referred expressly to the terms of a written declaration made by the Sacramento County District Attorney on 27 January 1998, which stated: “... under California law ..., I have the exclusive right to determine whether criminal charges will be filed against any particular defendant, and ... what the charges will be. ... ... In the case of James Dewayne Nivette, I have been advised by my deputies and agree that no ‘special circumstance’ is applicable ... This affidavit may be deemed a commitment by my office to not seek the death penalty against James Dewayne Nivette.” The Indictment Division of the Colmar Court of Appeal pointed out that, while the application of the death penalty to a person whose extradition had been granted by the French government would be contrary to French public policy under the Law of 9 October 1981 abolishing the death penalty and Protocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human Rights, the same was not true of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The court also found that the question whether a limitation period applied to the crime (crime) committed did not arise because, even in France, the ten-year period had only just begun. Lastly, it found that, although the applicant had claimed to be a French national at the hearing, it could not be seriously disputed that he had American nationality only and so it declined to seek a preliminary ruling on that issue. On 12 May 1998 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law against the Court of Appeal’s decision. It held that the ruling in favour of extradition, together with its proviso, was in accordance with domestic law. It declined, however, to rule on the grounds of appeal relating to nationality and the death-row phenomenon, taking the view that they amounted to criticisms of some of the reasons given in the Court of Appeal’s judgment and were therefore inadmissible. On 25 September 1998 the applicant applied to the Colmar District Court for a declaration of nationality. On 7 September 1999, at the French government’s request, further guarantees were provided by the Sacramento County District Attorney, who stated that: (a) as District Attorney, she was authorised by law to bind the State of California by her decisions and so the undertaking she had given was binding both on her successors and on the State of California; (b) her declaration amounted to a commitment and an assurance by the State of California that the death penalty would not be sought or applied against Mr Nivette at any stage in the prosecution or the criminal proceedings instituted against him; (c) under section 190.2 of the California Penal Code a death sentence for murder could be passed only if at least one of twenty-one special circumstances listed in the section applied; (d) the laws of the State of California made it legally impossible for the death penalty to be imposed unless a special circumstance was charged by the prosecuting authorities and upheld by the trial court; (e) the District Attorney alone was entitled to charge a special circumstance; no special circumstance would be charged in this case and therefore no court would be able to impose the death penalty on Mr Nivette; (f) even if the understanding of the facts in the case were to change in the future, her decision not to seek the death penalty was irrevocable. Even where a special circumstance existed, the District Attorney had a legal right not to charge it and she would not do so in this case even if a special circumstance became apparent at a later stage; it was consequently impossible for the death penalty to be imposed. That declaration was made “under penalty of perjury”. On 17 December 1998 the United States embassy in Paris forwarded to the French government assurances made by the federal government. On 21 October 1999 the French Prime Minister issued an extradition order; the applicant appealed to the Conseil d’Etat. On 6 November 2000 the Conseil d’Etat held as follows: “The death penalty was abolished in France by the Law of 9 October 1981. Under Article 1 of Protocol No. 6 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which was incorporated into the domestic legal order following its ratification ..., ‘The death penalty shall be abolished. No one shall be condemned to such penalty or executed’. Applying the death penalty to a person whose extradition has been granted by the French government would contravene French public policy. Consequently, if any of the crimes for which extradition is sought from the French authorities is punishable by death under the law of the requesting State, extradition in respect of that crime may legally be granted only on condition that the requesting State gives sufficient assurances that the death penalty will not be imposed or will not be executed. On the other hand, extradition of a person liable to serve a life sentence without any possibility of early release is not contrary to French public policy or Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The government of the United States’ request for the extradition of Mr Nivette is based on an act of murder. Under the criminal-law provisions that apply in California, which is the State whose courts have jurisdiction in the case, an accused found guilty of murder is liable to the death penalty. On 29 January 1998 the Indictment Division of the Colmar Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Mr Nivette’s extradition provided that the relevant United States authorities gave assurances to the French government that, even if the death penalty was imposed, it would not be sought or applied. Under the impugned order of 21 October 1999, the French government acceded to the American authorities’ request for the applicant’s extradition provided that the death penalty was not sought, imposed or executed. In a diplomatic note of 17 December 1998, the United States embassy made known to the French government the United States government’s assurance that, if Mr Nivette’s extradition was granted, the death penalty would not be imposed or carried out. The United States authorities also conveyed to the French authorities the undertaking made on behalf of the State of California by the District Attorney of Sacramento County – where Mr Nivette would stand trial – that the relevant prosecuting authority would not apply for the death penalty to be imposed on the applicant, even if new facts were uncovered that could amount to special circumstances. In an affidavit the Sacramento County District Attorney gave a formal assurance that the death penalty could not be imposed unless a special circumstance was charged by the prosecuting authorities. Under these circumstances, the applicant is not justified in maintaining that the impugned order is not attended by adequate safeguards and that his extradition would contravene French public policy. Contrary to the applicant’s allegations, the United States’ legal system respects individuals’ fundamental rights and freedoms as required by the general principles of extradition law. The impugned order is therefore not in breach of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Mr Nivette maintained that he was a French national but provided no evidence to support that assertion. In the absence of any serious dispute on this subject, there is no reason to seek a preliminary ruling from the court competent to determine nationality issues. It follows that Mr Nivette is not justified in seeking to have the impugned order quashed ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He was represented before the Court by Royds Rdw, solicitors in London. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant's wife died on 2 July 2000. His claim for widows' benefits was made on 7 July 2000 and was rejected on 14 July 2000 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows' benefits because he was not a woman. On 24 July 2000 the applicant appealed and on 29 August 2000 reconsideration took place. The previous decision was upheld. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
189,001-22196,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,DE PONTE NASCIMENTO v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Inadmissible,Georg Ress;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Jose Manuel de Ponte Nascimento, is a Portuguese national, who was born in 1966, and lives in Madeira. He is represented before the Court by Mr Andrew Christodoulou, a solicitor, and Mr David Williams, counsel, both practising in London. The respondent Government are represented by their agent, Ms J Foakes of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. On 4 June 1994, the applicant was knocked off his bicycle by a car. He started proceedings against the driver of the car on 3 June 1997. The applicant returned to live in Madeira. On 22 October 1997, the Clerkenwell County Court ordered the applicant to file further medical evidence in support of his claim within 28 days, failing which any particulars of injury not substantiated by a medical report would be struck out. Further medical evidence was filed on behalf of the applicant, some within 28 days and some later. The defendant to the proceedings made an application that the particulars of injury be struck out for failure to comply with the order of 22 October 1997. The application was heard on 29 January 1998 by District Judge Southcombe, who struck out the particulars of injury. The practical effect of striking out the particulars of injury was that the applicant could no longer claim general damages or damages for loss of earnings, which represented by far the major part of his claim. The applicant appealed against the decision of District Judge Southcombe. On 19 June 1998, the appeal was heard by Recorder Knowles. She dismissed the appeal. The applicant applied to the Court of Appeal for leave to appeal. The hearing began on 15 April 1999 and continued on 22 April 1999. The Court of Appeal reserved its judgment. On 15 June 1999, the Court of Appeal handed down a judgment refusing permission to appeal. Each of the three Lord Justices of Appeal gave a separate judgment. Sir Iain Glidewell considered that the Recorder had applied the proper test and exercised her discretion correctly, and that permission to appeal should accordingly be refused. Lord Justice Clarke considered that the District Judge and the Recorder had failed to apply the relevant legal principles correctly, and that permission to appeal should be granted, because otherwise no court would have considered the exercise of its discretion on correct principles. Lord Justice Chadwick considered that the Recorder had identified the applicable principles but failed to apply them, but that this failure did not raise any question of principle within the terms of either paragraph 20 of the practice direction of 17 November 1998 or paragraph 2.19.1 of the consolidated practice direction of 26 April 1999 (see below). He further considered that the case was not one which for some other reason (practice direction of 17 November 1998), or some other compelling reason (consolidated practice direction of 26 April 1999), should be considered by the Court of Appeal. Lord Justice Chadwick stated at pp. 39-40: “Personal injury litigation should not be conducted on the basis that the rules peculiar to it can be treated as of no importance. To do so is to put at risk one of the objects which those rules are intended to promote; that is to say, that the medical evidence on which the plaintiff relies can be properly assessed by the defendant at as early a stage as possible. Failure to make early disclosure of the plaintiff’s medical condition puts a fair trial at risk. I can see no basis upon which to hold that justice demands that the defendant should suffer the risk that any trial which could now be held would be less than fair. On the contrary, it seems to me that the balance of justice lies in upholding the orders which have been made.” Lord Justice Chadwick concluded that permission to appeal should be refused. He declined to take a view on the merits which he regarded as finely balanced. On 17 November 1998, Lord Woolf, Master of the Rolls, issued a practice direction relating, inter alia, to leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal (reported at [1999] 1 Weekly Law Reports 2). Practice Directions do not have formal legal effect but are followed by the judiciary, representing as they do the collective view of senior judges and, in time, the terms of Practice Directions become embodied in decisions of the higher courts, which do have binding effect. Paragraph 10 of the practice direction provided, under the heading “The General Test for Leave”: “The general rule applied by the Court of Appeal, and thus the relevant basis for first instance courts deciding whether to grant leave, is that leave will be given unless an appeal would have no realistic prospect of success.” Paragraph 20 of the practice direction contained new guidance, in the following terms (so far as material): “Where there has already been one unsuccessful appeal to a court ... against the decision being challenged, for example from a District Judge to a Circuit Judge or from a Master to a High Court Judge, and the application is for permission for a further appeal to the Court of Appeal, a more restrictive approach to the test for permission to appeal should be adopted. Permission should be granted only if the case raises an important point of principle or practice or the case is one which for some other compelling reason should be considered by the Court of Appeal.” On 26 April 1999, the Court of Appeal issued a practice direction consolidating, with some amendments, all of the principal practice directions which applied to proceedings in the Court of Appeal (Civil Division). Paragraphs 10 and 20 of the practice direction of 17 November 1998 were reproduced in similar terms in the consolidated practice direction, with one significant change: in paragraph 20 (new paragraph 2.19.1), the word “important” was omitted from the final sentence.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

At the material time the applicant was the deputy principal of the St Pölten seminary, where future Roman Catholic priests are trained. In addition, he was private secretary to the bishop of the St Pölten diocese, Bishop Krenn. He resigned from his post as deputy principal in July 2004 and is currently living in Munich. 6. In the issue of the weekly news magazine Profil of 5 July 2004 an article was published on searches carried out by police in the St Pölten seminary. According to the article, police had searched the seminary on suspicion of someone having downloaded child pornography from the Internet. The article further stated that, according to rumours, police had also found photographs showing seminarians engaging in homosexual activities, and that there were rumours of unwanted homosexual advances towards seminarians involving abuse of authority. The article was accompanied by a photograph of the principal of the seminary, showing him standing in a garden, and by an interview with him in which he said that he did not believe that there had been any unwanted sexual advances by superiors and that the rumours were part of an intrigue or a revenge plot by a former seminarian. He denied involvement in any such incidents. 7. In its issue of 12 July 2004 Profil published an article entitled “Go on!” (Trau dich doch), with the sub-heading “Porn scandal. Photographic evidence of sexual antics between priests and their students has thrown the diocese of St Pölten into disarray. First the principal and now the deputy principal have resigned. High-ranking dignitaries expect Kurt Krenn [the bishop of the diocese] to be removed from office.” 8. The article stated that the applicant and the principal of the seminary had had sexual relations with seminarians, but clarified that there was nothing to corroborate the rumours of unwanted homosexual advances which had been reported earlier. The article further reported that some seminarians had downloaded pornography and child pornography onto their computers. According to the article, the existence of homosexual relations was well known within the seminary and was even known to the bishop, who had tried to “hush up” the case at first. The article contained two photographs of the applicant, one on which he was about to embrace a seminarian, Mr K., and another one on which he and Mr K. were about to kiss each other. On this photograph the applicant’s eyes are closed and his mouth is half open. The photographs had been taken by one of the seminarians at a Christmas party in the applicant’s private apartment on 24 December 2003. In the article the applicant was identified by name while the seminarian’s identities were not disclosed. Likewise, on the published photographs, the applicant’s face was visible while that of the seminarian was blurred. The article quoted the applicant as saying that the photographs could be interpreted in different ways and that, at the Christmas party in question, all the participants had embraced each other in a friendly manner. 9. On 6 August 2004, the applicant initiated proceedings under the Media Act (Mediengesetz) against Verlagsgruppe News GmbH, the publisher of Profil, in respect of the article published on 12 July 2004. Relying on sections 6 and 7 of the said Act, he requested compensation for defamation (üble Nachrede) and for the violation of his strictly personal sphere (höchstpersönlicher Lebensbereich) caused by the publication of the photographs and the impugned article, especially the following passages: “Porn scandal. Photographic evidence of sexual antics between priests and their students has thrown the diocese of St Pölten into disarray.”; “A painful truth: Krenn’s principal engaged in sex with subordinates, also Krenn’s private secretary and legal adviser ...” ; “Photos showing, among others, seminarians from St Pölten in kinky situations, in some cases with their superiors ... and because they were doing it with the boss and his deputy too, it was all quite normal and they felt perfectly safe ...” 10. The publisher of Profil replied that the content of the article was true. The company also argued that in the light of the Roman Catholic Church’s position condemning homosexuality, and the fact that the applicant was responsible for the training of future priests in the seminary, the public had an interest in knowing about the situation at the seminary. Moreover, the applicant was the private secretary of Bishop Krenn, who had repeatedly and publicly condemned homosexuality as being a sin and an aberration. Consequently, there was a connection with public life. The article was thus lawful by virtue of the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 10 of the Convention. 11. On 15 September 2005, after holding several hearings at which evidence was heard from a number of witnesses, the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht, hereinafter “the Regional Court”) dismissed the applicant’s request for compensation. 12. The Regional Court observed that a large percentage of readers of the weekly Profil that had published the impugned article and the photographs would read the news magazine in only a cursory manner and would also consult other media before forming their opinion. Those readers would learn that there had been homosexual contacts between the applicant and seminarians and also among seminarians, and that there existed photographs to support this. The published photographs showed not merely a kiss on the cheek but a French kiss. The sexual nature of the kiss was visible from the fact that the applicant had his eyes closed and his mouth open with his tongue visible. Since the article had also stated that previous rumours about sexual coercion of seminarians by their superiors had not been confirmed, it was made clear that the two men had had a consensual relationship. 13. Giving a detailed assessment of various witness statements, the Regional Court found it established that the applicant had had a homosexual relationship with a seminarian, K., in which he had openly engaged at the priests’ seminary. One witness had stated, for instance, that the two men were wearing rings with each other’s names engraved on them together with the date of the beginning of their relationship. Moreover, one of the published photographs showed the applicant exchanging a French kiss with the seminarian K. The photograph had been taken in the applicant’s apartment, which was placed at his disposal by the diocese, during a Christmas party attended by a number of seminarians. The statement by the applicant quoted in the article, according to which the photographs could be interpreted in different ways, would lead the reader to conclude that the photographs had not been manipulated before publication. The Regional Court thus held that the publisher had succeeded in proving that the facts contained in the article were in essence true. 14. A request by the applicant to obtain the opinion of an expert in photographic analysis was rejected, as expert opinions were only to be taken if the resolution of a question of fact required expert knowledge which the court did not possess. Where the judge was able to assess the evidence on the basis of his or her own knowledge, no expert opinion was required. The Regional Court noted that the applicant had not alleged that the photograph had been manipulated. It could therefore be assessed without the help of an expert. 15. Owing to the considerable importance of the Roman Catholic Church as a role model, the public had a great interest in knowing what was going on within the Church. The public also had an interest in what happened in the seminary, especially since it had become known that pictures containing child pornography had been downloaded from the Internet. The circumstances leading to such incidents were a subject of public interest and had a direct connection with public life. The applicant, as the deputy principal of the seminary, was a public figure in that capacity. Even though the impugned pictures had been taken in his private residence there was a connection to his public life. While accusing a dignitary of the Roman Catholic Church of having homosexual contacts constituted the actus reus of defamation within the meaning of section 6 of the Media Act and exposed his strictly personal sphere within the meaning of section 7 of the said Act, the publisher had proved that the reported facts were essentially true. Thus, the applicant’s claim for compensation had to be dismissed. 16. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and fact with the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht). The Court of Appeal, after holding a hearing, dismissed the appeal in a judgment of 28 June 2006. 17. The Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of the Regional Court, holding that the said court had not erred in fact or in law and had rightly held that the newspaper publisher had managed to prove that the content of the article was true. Regarding the applicant’s complaint that the publisher had not proved that there had been a homosexual relationship between him and a seminarian, the Court of Appeal found that the photographs of the two men hugging and kissing, together with the evidence from a witness who stated that he had seen them repeatedly exchanging French kisses at the Christmas party, was sufficient to prove that such a relationship had existed. As to the complaint that the first-instance court had refused to obtain an opinion from an expert in photographic analysis, the Court of Appeal found that the judge had rightly held that she could interpret the photographs for herself. Furthermore, the finding that the applicant and the seminarian K. had had a homosexual relationship was based not only on the photographs but first and foremost on a witness statement. The court further held that, in reporting on photographic evidence of seminarians in “kinky situations”, the publisher had provided proof that the statements were true. The average reader of the magazine would understand the term “kinky” to mean a deviation from what was considered normal, which would include photographs of priests and seminarians in a sexual pose wearing clerical clothing, especially as the persons concerned belonged to a group who publicly spoke out against homosexuality and denounced homosexual contacts as sinful. The Court of Appeal went on to state as follows: “The appellant argues that the substantive law was also incorrectly applied ... because the court found that the published material was connected with ‘public life’. In his view, the public interest in occurrences within an institution did not warrant a report which identified individuals, particularly when the report dealt with their strictly personal sphere and the individuals concerned had not been in the public eye. He had merely been deputy principal of the St Pölten seminary, a purely internal function within the Church which had no external dimension; accordingly, there had been no grounds for any interference with the intimate sphere of his private life. The court is not convinced by this argument. The Catholic Church, to which the majority of the Austrian population belongs and which, according to Article II of the Concordat (BGBl. II No. 2/1934), has public-law status, has a level of importance in Austria going beyond that of a small association, as is clear from the overall content of the Concordat and the circumstances in which it was ratified. Accordingly, conduct on the part of Church dignitaries which is in flagrant contradiction with Catholic teachings may very well be of public interest, particularly where – as in the present case – homosexual contacts take place and are maintained, albeit on a consensual basis, between staff and students in an educational establishment and between students themselves. The Catholic Church strives for acceptance and credibility among the public at large, and the activities of a principal and a deputy principal, as the persons in charge of a training college for future priests, have a public dimension. The Catholic Church is engaged in public relations work in many spheres and regularly makes its views on (sexual) morality known to the population as a whole, with the result that the general public is also entitled to be informed if individual officials are failing to practise what they preach, condemning homosexuality as a sin in public while practising it in private, even between staff and students. It should also be taken into consideration that the teachings of the Catholic Church on the subject of homosexuality are contrary to the fundamental right to sexual self-determination under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and to the prohibition on discrimination; hence, on this basis also, there is a public interest in the publication of specific allegations that Church dignitaries are failing to observe their Church’s teachings on sexual morals. This is even more so where the reports concern homosexual contacts between a teacher and his students. Such relationships of dependency call for particular vigilance in order to avoid potential breaches of a fundamental code of conduct designed to protect the physical and psychological integrity of the students. The media have a vital role in publicly exposing misconduct in a democratic society governed by the rule of law. The exposure and public condemnation of such misconduct is thus in any event in the public interest; the same is true of the reports identifying those concerned, without which it would not be possible to express credible criticism of specific inadmissible situations and thus fulfil the role of “public watchdog”. The weighing of interests in the present case should undoubtedly lead to the conclusion that the public right to information prevails. The professional activity of an ordained priest who is active in public life, as a clergyman, as deputy head of a seminary and as a close adviser and secretary to the bishop, does not take place merely within the Church; the Catholic Church has an important and, in some respects even a State role, and the credibility of its officials, who demand moral standards from the population and compliance with the Church’s rules of community life, occupies an important position in that regard. In particular, the fact that the events involved students who, as future officials of the Catholic Church are supposed to be taught these moral precepts by example, lends those events a public-interest dimension extending beyond the Church itself and affects all sections of the population. Furthermore, the applicant was widely involved in public relations work not just through the training of priests but also through his role as secretary and legal adviser to the bishop; this serves as further justification for lending greater weight to the report identifying him than to his interest in preserving his anonymity, and for holding that there was a direct connection with public life. ...” 18. The Court of Appeal concluded that, since the article had reported essentially true facts and there was a public interest in their being reported, the Regional Court had rightly rejected the applicant’s request for compensation. The judgment was served on the applicant’s counsel on 13 July 2006. 19. Section 6 of the Media Act provides for the strict liability of the publisher, inter alia in cases of defamation. The victim can thus claim damages from the publisher. Section 6 provides as follows: “(1) Where a medium publishes statements which constitute the actus reus of disparagement, insult, derision or defamation the victim shall have a claim against the owner of the medium (publisher) for damages for the injury suffered ...” (2) The right referred to in paragraph 1 above shall not apply ... 2. in the case of defamation (a) [where] the statements published are true or ... (3) Where the publication concerns the strictly personal sphere, a claim under subsection 1 shall be excluded only on the grounds set forth in ...subsection 2(2)(a) ...; the case of subsection 2(2)(a), this shall not apply where the published facts are directly related to public life.” 20. Section 7 of the Media Act provides a claim for damages in cases of interference with the strictly personal sphere of an individual’s life. It reads as follows: “(1) If the strictly personal sphere of an individual’s life is discussed or portrayed in the media in a way liable to publicly undermine the individual concerned, he or she shall have the right to claim compensation for the damage sustained from the media proprietor (publisher). ... (2) The right referred to in paragraph 1 above shall not apply where (i) ... (ii) the statements published are true and are directly related to public life; (iii) ...” 21. For the purpose of Section 6 of the Media Act “defamation” is to be understood as defined in Article 111 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), which reads as follows: “(1) Anybody who, in such a way that it may be noticed by a third person, attributes to another a contemptible characteristic or sentiment or accuses him of behaviour contrary to honour or morality and such as to make him contemptible or otherwise lower him in public esteem shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding six months or a fine ... (2) Anyone who commits this offence in a printed document, by broadcasting or otherwise in such a way as to make the defamation accessible to a broad section of the public, shall be liable to imprisonment not exceeding one year or a fine ... (3) The person making the statement shall not be punished if it is proved to be true. In the case of the offence defined in paragraph 1 he shall also not be liable if circumstances are established which gave him sufficient reason to believe that the statement was true.” 22. Section 78 of the Copyright Act, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “(1) Images of persons shall neither be exhibited publicly nor in any way made accessible to the public where injury would be caused to the legitimate interests of the persons concerned or, if they have died without having authorised or ordered publication, those of a close relative.” 23. Article 1330 of the Austrian Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides as follows: “(1) Anybody who, as a result of defamation, suffers real damage or loss of profit may claim compensation. (2) The same shall apply if anyone disseminates allegations which jeopardise a person’s reputation, income or livelihood, the untruth of which was known or should have been known to him or her. In this case there is also a right to claim a retraction and the publication thereof ...” 24. The Court refers to this resolution, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 26 June 1998. Its relevant passages are reproduced in Von Hannover v.

191,001-79212,ENG,TUR,ADMISSIBILITY,2007,ERIK v. TURKEY,4,Inadmissible,,"The applicant, Rahime Erik, is a Turkish national of Kurdish ethnic origin who was born in 1950 and lives in Diyarbakır. She was represented before the Court by Mr M. Muller, Mr T. Otty, Ms L. K. N. Claridge, and Mr K. Yıldız of the Kurdish Human Rights Project in London. may be summarised as follows. In late November or early December 1995, a large team of police officers forcibly entered the applicant’s house and arrested her son, Hakan Erik. The applicant claims that, during arrest, they were ill-treated and that for a long time she was unable to discover the whereabouts of her son. She further claims that the police threatened her that if her son was not conscripted for military service he would be killed. On 7 December 1995 the applicant’s son, Hakan Erik, commenced his compulsory military service. He was stationed in Nazilli Military Headquarters. The applicant submits that her son had told her that some of the soldiers, namely M.A.S., B.Y.Ö and I.O., had threatened to kill him because he was from Lice and, therefore, a terrorist. On 29 April 1996 Hakan Erik was found shot. He was taken to the SKK Hospital, where he died. A post mortem examination was conducted on the deceased. The doctor considered that no autopsy was needed since the cause of death was internal bleeding from a single shot gun wound to the chest. No bruises were found on the body. The authorities were of the opinion that the applicant’s son had committed suicide. On 1 May 1996 Hakan Erik’s body was transferred to Diyarbakır for burial. The applicant claims that she was told several times not to uncover the body and to bury it within ten minutes. She further submits that when she uncovered the body she discovered that apart from the gun wound there was bleeding coming from the right eye, right ear and nose. On 2 May 1996 the applicant’s husband complained to the Diyarbakir public prosecutor’s office that his son had been killed by two soldiers and claimed that his son’s body had suspicious injuries. He requested an autopsy. On 2 and 3 May 1996, the prosecutor heard the applicant’s husband, who reiterated his previous submissions. In May 1996 the prosecutor decided that he lacked competence to investigate the complaints and transferred the case file to the İzmir military prosecutor. On 10 May 1996 the body of Mr Erik was exhumed. The autopsy confirmed that the cause of death was internal bleeding from a single shot gun wound to the chest. The autopsy report also found that there was a scaled graze of 1x0.5 cm on the right ankle and that there were no other signs of bruises on the body. Finally, the report indicated that due to putrefaction of the body there was swelling, blood-clots and a change of colour in some parts of the body. Acting by proxy, the Diyarbakir public prosecutor heard the applicant and her husband on 13 May 1996. By a decision dated 19 December 1996, the Izmir military prosecutor decided to discontinue the proceedings. In her decision, the prosecutor, relying on the testimonies of other conscripts, two civilians, the ballistic report and the autopsy report, concluded that there was no indication which would lead her to conclude that the death of Mr Erik had been caused by someone else’s intent or negligence. In the same decision the prosecutor filed an indictment against Mr I.O. for the ill-treatment of subordinates. She submitted that, independent of the death of Hakan Erik, it had been established by witness testimony that Mr I.O. had slapped the deceased and two other conscripts for not keeping a proper guard. She requested that Mr I.O. be charged and convicted under Article 117 § 1 of the Military Criminal Code. On 8 January 1997 the applicant objected to the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the proceedings. In her petition, the applicant submitted, in particular, that her son had not committed suicide but had been killed. She claimed that her son had told her that he had been threatened by Mr M.A.S. and Mr B.Y.Ö. She further complained about the contradictions between the post mortem examination and the autopsy report. In this regard, she submitted that the autopsy report had found a graze on her son’s right ankle whereas the post mortem report had found no bruises on his body. On 31 January 1997 the applicant’s objections against this decision were dismissed by the İzmir Military Court. This decision was served on the applicant on 19 February 1997. In the meantime, Mr I.O. was convicted under Article 117 § 1 of the Military Criminal Code and sentenced to a fine. This decision became final on 4 February 1999 as no one appealed. The applicant was not a party to the proceedings. The first letter concerning the application was submitted by the applicant’s lawyers on 13 June 1997 to the European Commission on Human Rights. After giving a brief description of the events and submitting without further specification that the applicant alleged a violation of Articles 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Convention, the lawyers informed the Commission that they were assembling the necessary documentation in order to submit the full application. A number of official documents were attached to the first letter. The Registry of the Commission acknowledged receipt and the case was given a provisional number. On 28 October 1999 the applicant’s lawyers submitted the completed application form together with documents. On 14 December 1999 the Registry of the Court informed the applicant’s lawyers of certain shortcomings in the application, namely that the full application form had been submitted 2 years, 4 months and 15 days after the first letter and requested that they provide an explanation of the reasons for the delay. The applicant’s lawyers’ attention was drawn to the Convention organs’ case-law on this point. On 4 January 2000 the applicant’s lawyers submitted that the applicant and her family were subjected to constant intimidation and threats by the authorities, that the failure to investigate Mr Erik’s death constituted a continuing violation and that there were considerable delays in obtaining the documents pertaining to the domestic investigation. On 27 March 2000, upon the receipt of a revised authority form, the application was registered. The applicant’s lawyers were informed that the date of introduction of the application would be considered as having been 13 June 1997 unless the Court decided otherwise.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
192,001-6024,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2001,HADZIC v. CROATIA,3,Inadmissible,Georg Ress,"The applicant, Dragomir Hadžić, is a Croatian citizen, born in 1931 and living in Zagreb. He is represented before the Court by Mr Milorad Lukač, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. The respondent Government are represented by their Agent Ms Lidija Lukina-Karajković. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant served as a dentist in the Yugoslav People’s Army (YPA) from 1959 to 1991. His post was in Zagreb, Croatia. By an order of the Commander of the Fifth Military Zone of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of 4 June 1991 it was decided that, due to his age, the applicant’s military service would end on 31 December 1991. Subsequently, by a decision of the Belgrade Military Social Security Fund (Zavod za socijalno osiguranje vojnih osiguranika) of 25 December 1991, the applicant’s right to an old-age pension was recognised as from 1 January 1992. The applicant’s pension was subsequently paid from the Yugoslav Federal Military Social Security Fund in Belgrade until 31 December 1993. According to the Government the payments stopped on that date at the applicant’s personal request, as he had decided to file an application for a pension in Croatia. According to the applicant on 4 January 1994 he obtained Croatian citizenship and, consequently, only then fulfilled the requirements to apply for a pension in Croatia. On 4 January 1994 the applicant filed an application for an old-age pension in Croatia. As a reason for this request the applicant submitted that he had previously fulfilled the conditions for an old-age pension and also obtained the Croatian citizenship. By a decision of 25 February 1994 the Croatian Social Security Fund - Zagreb Office (Republički fond mirovinskog i invalidskog osiguranja radnika Hrvatske - Područni ured Zagreb) rejected his request, stating that the applicant did not fulfil the requirements for a pension as he had failed to join the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991. The applicant unsuccessfully appealed against that decision and after his appeal was rejected on 5 April 1994, he instituted proceedings before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske). He maintained that the decision to reject his request for an old-age pension had not been adequately reasoned and had failed to state laws on which it had been based. He maintained also that the law requesting the former YPA officers to make themselves available for the service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991 had been enacted on 24 July 1992, after he had already fulfilled the conditions for an old-age pension. Furthermore, as that law had been enacted only in 1992 he could not have known the above requirement prior to his retirement form service. On 22 December 1994 the Administrative Court rejected his claim. It noted that the applicant’s active military service in the YPA had come to an end on 31 December 1991 and that at that moment he fulfilled the requirements for the old-age pension according to the Yugoslav Federal law. It found furthermore that the applicant had failed to make himself available for service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991, as prescribed by the 1993 Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act. Therefore, he had failed to fulfil the requirements for recognition of his pension rights in Croatia, as prescribed by law. On 1 March 1995 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint claiming that his right to property was violated by the Administrative Court’s decision in so far as his right to pension in Croatia was denied. He argued in particular that the 1993 Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act had not required that he join the Croatian army. On 30 June 1998 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) rejected the applicant’s complaint. It followed the reasoning set out in the Administrative Court’s decision of 22 December 1994 and found that the applicant’s constitutional rights had not been violated. The relevant parts of the Former Yugoslav People’s Army Officers’ Pensions Act (1993 - Zakon o ostvarivanju prava iz mirovnskog i invalidskog osigurnja pripadnika bivše JNA, Official Gazette no. 96/1993) read as follows: “A person whose status as an active officer in the former YPA in the territory of the Republic of Croatia ended prior to 31 December 1991, and who had not until that date obtained rights from pension and invalidity insurance may obtain such rights if he fulfils the conditions required of army personnel in order to obtain rights concerning pension and invalidity insurance in accordance with the Military Personnel Pensions Act (Zakon o mirovinskom i invalidskom osiguranju vojnih osiguranika – Official Gazette no. 53/91, 73/91, 18/92 and 71/92) and if: ... – he had made himself available for the service in the Croatian army prior to 31 December 1991...” By its decision of 16 October 1991 the Croatian Government, inter alia, guranteed to the Yugoslav People’s Army officers and soldiers who voluntarily left the YPA troops based on Croatian territory prior to 10 November 1991 at midnight the following: personal safety, the same status as they had in the YPA and an organised and unhindered possibility to leave the territory of Croatia for those who wished to do so.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
193,001-82447,ENG,AZE,CHAMBER,2007,CASE OF AKIMOVA v. AZERBAIJAN,4,Violation of P1-1,Christos Rozakis,"6. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Baku. 7. By an order of the Narimanov District Executive Authority (“NDEA”) of 2 June 1993, the applicant was issued, under the state housing policy, an occupancy voucher (yaşayış orderi) to a three-room apartment in a state-owned residential building in Baku. The applicant did not move into her new apartment at that time, because the construction of the building had not been completely finished and the tenants had to undertake the repair works in their respective apartments at their own expense. 8. In 1997, pursuant to an oral agreement, the applicant allowed R., an acquaintance of hers, to use the apartment temporarily, free of charge. Under the arrangement reached by the parties, R. was to use the apartment in exchange for certain repair works that he would perform using the materials provided by the applicant. In addition, R. agreed to vacate the apartment whenever the applicant made such a demand. 9. Some unspecified time later, in breach of the existing oral agreement, R. allowed his relative H. and his family (hereinafter to be collectively referred to as “H.”) to move into and live in the apartment. H. were internally displaced persons (“IDP”) from Agdam, a region under control of Armenian military forces following the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. 10. When the applicant found out that her apartment was occupied by people unknown to her, she requested that they vacate it. However, H. refused to do so, stating that they had no other place to live. The applicant filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to evict H. from the apartment. 11. On 29 March 2000 the Nizami District Court granted the applicant's request. The court found that, prior to moving into the disputed apartment, H. had been living in the Barda Region and in the Khatai District of Baku where they had been registered as IDPs. They did not dispute the fact that they had settled in the apartment in 1997. The court further found that the applicant was the lawful tenant of the apartment and, as such, had a right to demand H. to vacate it. The court ordered that H. be evicted. H. appealed. 12. On 30 September 2002 the Court of Appeal quashed the district court's judgment. The court held that NDEA's order to issue an occupancy voucher to a partly constructed building had been in breach of the requirements of the domestic law. The court further held that the applicant had not concluded a social tenancy agreement concerning the apartment and, therefore, she could not have a valid claim to it. The court therefore quashed the first-instance court's order to evict H. from the apartment. 13. The applicant filed an appeal in cassation. On 13 December 2002 the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeal's judgment and partially upheld the applicant's request. The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeal erred in judging on the validity of the applicant's occupancy voucher. It held that the applicant's tenancy rights were undisputed and that the proceedings only concerned H.'s right to remain in the applicant's apartment. The Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal's decision in this part. 14. The Supreme Court further ruled that H. should vacate the applicant's apartment. However, taking into account the fact that H. could not return to their permanent place of residence in Agdam and, in the meantime, had no other place in which to reside, the Court held that the execution of its decision should be postponed until they could return to Agdam. 15. Thereafter, based on the applicant's additional cassation appeal, the proceedings were reopened and on 27 January 2005 the Plenum of the Supreme Court quashed the Supreme Court's decision of 13 December 2002. The Plenum noted that, having found errors in the Court of Appeal's judgment, the Supreme Court had no competence under civil procedure law to deliver a new judgment on the merits and, instead, was obliged to quash the Court of Appeal's judgment and refer the case for re-examination by the Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the Plenum found that, although the conclusions reached by the Supreme Court were essentially correct, it had breached the procedural rules by delivering a new judgment on the merits. The Plenum remitted the case to the Court of Appeal. 16. On 7 April 2005 the Court of Appeal delivered a judgment identical to the Supreme Court's decision of 13 December 2002. It ruled that H. should vacate the applicant's apartment. It further held as follows: “... the claim of V.B. Akimova must be upheld; however, having regard to the fact that the defendants are internally displaced persons from the Agdam Region and do not have another place in which to reside, the execution of the judgment shall be postponed until the Agdam Region is liberated from occupation.” 17. At present, Agdam remains under the control of Armenian forces and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict remains unresolved. At the time of the latest communication with the parties, H. was still living in the applicant's apartment. 18. The Housing Code provides that Azerbaijani citizens are entitled to obtain a right of use of apartments owned by the State or other public bodies, under the terms of a tenancy agreement (Articles 10 and 28). 19. A decision on granting an apartment is to be implemented by way of issuing the citizen with an occupancy voucher (yaşayış sahəsi orderi) from the local executive authority (Article 48). The voucher serves as the sole legal basis for taking possession of the apartment designated therein (Article 48) and for concluding a tenancy agreement (yaşayış sahəsini icarə müqaviləsi) between the tenant and the housing maintenance authority (Article 51). 20. The right of use of apartments is granted for an indefinite term (Article 10). The tenant can terminate the tenancy agreement at any moment, with the consent of his or her family members (Article 87). The landlord (the housing maintenance authority) can terminate the agreement only on the grounds provided for by law and on the basis of a court decision (Articles 88-89). If the agreement is terminated because the house is no longer fit for living in, the tenant and family must be provided with a substitute apartment with full amenities (Articles 90 and 96). Tenants or members of their family can be evicted without provision of substitute accommodation only if they “systematically destroy or damage the apartment”, “use it for purposes other than residence” or “systematically breach the [generally accepted rules of conduct], thus making cohabitation with others impossible” (Article 97). 21. Individuals residing, pursuant to a tenancy agreement, in apartments owned by the State and other public bodies have a right to transfer these apartments into their private ownership (Article 1). Such privatisation is voluntary and free of charge (Article 2). The right to privatise a State-owned apartment free of charge may be exercised only once (Article 7). 22. Article 2 of the Law provides as follows: “Persons displaced from the places of their permanent residence in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan to other places within the territory of the country as a result of foreign military aggression, occupation of certain territories or continuous gunfire, shall be considered as internally displaced persons subject to the provisions of this Law.” 23. Article 5 of the Law provides as follows: “The relevant executive authority [the Cabinet of Ministers, State Committee on the Refugees' Affairs and local executive authorities, within the scope of their respective competence] shall deal with the housing of internally displaced persons. Residential, administrative and auxiliary buildings, as well as other buildings, shall be used for such housing purposes. Where there is no possibility to house internally displaced persons in such buildings or where the density of population in a specific settlement does not allow such a possibility, they shall be settled in camps specially set up for internally displaced persons. ... The internally displaced persons may be allowed to temporarily settle on their own only if the rights and lawful interests of other persons are not infringed. Otherwise, the relevant executive authority must ensure re-settlement of the internally displaced persons to other accommodation...” 24. Article 4 of the Regulations provides: “In order to prevent the eviction of the internally displaced persons from dwellings in which they settled during the period of 1992-1994, the legal force of the occupancy vouchers issued by the relevant authorities to individual citizens in respect of those dwellings shall be temporarily suspended...” 25. In cases where the temporary settling of internally displaced persons breaches the housing rights of other individuals, the former must be provided with other suitable accommodation (Article 4). 26. The judge examining a civil case may, upon a petition by a party to the case, decide to postpone or suspend the execution of the judgment or change the manner of execution, due to the parties' property situation or other circumstances (Article 231).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
194,001-60507,ENG,POL,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF WIERZBICKI v. POLAND,3,No violation of Art. 6-1,Elisabeth Palm,"6. In issue No. 4 of a newspaper “Gazeta Polska”, of which the applicant was an editor-in-chief, a list of informants of the communist secret police was published. This list had been submitted to Parliament (Sejm) in June 1992 by the Minister of Internal Affairs, following a resolution of the Parliament. The list was originally meant to remain strictly confidential, but its contents were subsequently immediately leaked to the public. In the same issue of the newspaper, apart from the list, the following text, entitled “Deleted at the Last Minute” (“Wykreśleni w ostatniej chwili”), was published: “[The Minister of Internal Affairs] was until the last minute verifying data which he had to submit to Parliament, pursuant to its resolution. A few hours before the list was submitted to [Parliament] he had deleted several names from the list, for lack of conclusive evidence. It transpires from our information that these names were: [...]”.The names of three well-known politicians followed. 7. In issue No. 5 of the same newspaper, a text entitled “The List of Informants - a Supplement” (“Lista konfidentów - uzupełnienie”) was published, which read as follows: “As a result of a misunderstanding, we did not include the following name in the list of persons deleted at the last minute from the Minister of Interior's document, which was published in issue No. 4 of the Gazeta Polska: S.N, and belonging to a category of TW (an informant), with a pseudonym [...,] who had been recruited [by the secret police] during his stay in prison.” (“Z wydrukowanej w nr 4 Gazety Polskiej listy <Wykreslonych w ostatniej chwili> wypadło nam w wyniku nieporozumienia nazwisko S.N., kategoria TW, kryptonim [...], który został zwerbowany do współpracy w więzieniu.”) 8. On 30 June 1993 S. N., who was also a candidate for Parliament in elections scheduled for September 1993, brought a court action against the applicant before the Warsaw Regional Court in accordance with Article 139 of the Election Act. He submitted that the newspaper of which the applicant was an editor-in-chief had published information that he had been an informant of the secret police of the former communist regime. He contended that this was false. He demanded that the applicant publicly revoke this statement and apologise for it by placing paid announcements in numerous newspapers. 9. On 1 July 1993 the Warsaw Regional Court declared itself incompetent to deal with the matter and transmitted the case to the Łódź Regional Court. 10. On 22 July 1993 the Łódź Regional Court decided that the case should be considered in ordinary contentious proceedings applicable to claims for protection of reputation under Article 24 of the Civil Code and transmitted the case to the Warsaw Regional Court. Upon appeal, the Łódź Court of Appeal on 4 August 1993 quashed this decision as it considered that the case should be dealt with by the Łódź Regional Court in special proceedings governed by Article 139 of the Election Act. 11. On 6 August 1993 the Łódź Regional Court summoned the applicant by fax sent to his work address to attend a court hearing scheduled for 7 August 1993. On the same day the applicant's lawyer sent a letter to the court in which he protested against the despatch of the summons to the applicant's place of work instead of to his private address and informed the court that the applicant should be considered as not having been duly summoned. He requested that the hearing be adjourned. 12. At the hearing on 7 August 1993 the Łódź Regional Court summoned the applicant to adduce evidence to show that the information concerning the plaintiff S. N. and his alleged involvement with the communist secret police was true. 13. On 12 August 1993 the applicant submitted a power of attorney in favour of his representative and requested that the case be pursued by way of ordinary contentious proceedings as the proceedings provided for by Article 139 of the Election Act had not led to a decision on the merits within three-day period stipulated in this Act. He requested the court to call as witnesses the former and current Ministers of Internal Affairs as well as J.K., a well-known politician, and to request the Ministry to submit various documents in evidence. 14. On 24 August 1993 the Łódź Regional Court summoned the applicant and his lawyer by notifications sent by fax to their respective work and office addresses to the hearing fixed for 25 August 1993. 15. At the hearing on 25 August 1993 before the Łódź Regional Court the applicant's lawyer was present, but the applicant was not. The court pronounced its decision on the same day. It upheld the plaintiff's claim and ordered the applicant to publicly revoke his statements by placing relevant announcements in numerous newspapers. 16. In reaching this decision, the Łódź Regional Court considered that in the proceedings in question the time-limits for serving summonses set out in the Code of Civil Procedure did not apply. The applicant's lawyer had been aware that the proceedings had been instituted since 6 August 1993; he had been given a power of attorney on 11 August 1993 and had submitted the request to produce evidence on 16 August 1993. Thus, he had had enough time to prepare his arguments. The court indicated that it had requested the Ministry of Internal Affairs to produce the documents requested by the applicant. On 20 August 1993 the Ministry had refused to do so as those documents were subject to official secrecy and could only be produced in court in criminal proceedings, in accordance with the Bureau of State Security Act. The court further observed that it could not call the witnesses proposed by the applicant; they could only have given evidence as to whether S. N. had been put on the list of informants prepared by the Ministry, but not as to whether S. N had in fact been an informant. Moreover, in view of the serious nature of the allegations advanced against S.N. by the applicant's newspaper, in the absence of any documentary evidence these allegations could not have been considered proved, even if they had been confirmed by the witnesses. Thus, as the applicant had not adduced any other evidence to prove that the information concerning S. N. was true, the court found against him. 17. The applicant appealed against this decision, invoking, inter alia, Article 6 of the Convention. He contended that the proceedings were null and void as neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been summoned to the hearing on 25 August 1993 with at least three-days' notice, as provided for by Article 149 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Furthermore, the applicant's interests could not be protected properly as he did not have sufficient time to prepare his arguments between the date of receipt of the summons and the date of the hearing. The applicant further argued that, as all his requests to call witnesses and evidence had been refused, he had been denied a reasonable opportunity to prove the facts essential for the merits of the decision. 18. On 31 August 1993 the Łódź Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The court considered that the complaint concerning the summons was unfounded. Both the applicant and his lawyer had been summoned one day before the hearing, which was justified, given the special nature of the proceedings under Article 139 of the Election Act. The court recalled that, although this provision provided for such cases to be decided within 48 hours, failure to do so did not oblige the court to deal with the case according to the normal procedures for contentious civil proceedings laid down in the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. Moreover, the applicant, being aware of the special nature of the proceedings, should have expected that he might be summoned from one day to the next and should have taken effective measures to ensure that the summons reached him in time. These considerations were especially relevant as the applicant was represented by a lawyer who was under a professional obligation to take appropriate measures to this end. In any event, the lawyer received the summons in time to appear at the hearing, even though he contended, unconvincingly, that he had learned about the date of the hearing from a journalist. As to the merits, the court noted that the lower court had requested the Ministry to submit documents requested by the applicant. However, this request had been refused. In the light of Article 12 of the Bureau of State Security Act, the refusal had to be considered lawful. Moreover, the very fact that an individual's name had been included in the list prepared by the Ministry could not be deemed proof that this person had in fact been an informant. The veracity of information contained in the list had been repeatedly called into question both by interested parties and, more widely, in numerous press articles. It had been emphasised that the list had been prepared and used as a weapon in a political battle, intended to discredit the persons concerned. Therefore, the veracity of a claim that a particular person had been a police informant could not possibly be established solely on the basis of the list itself and without prior verification of the list and, in particular, without some legally established means whereby the rights of persons branded as police informants could be defended. The court accordingly considered that the burden of proof lay with the defendant, who had failed to demonstrate that, at the time of the publication of the information at issue, he had possessed sufficient evidence that S.N. had been an informant as alleged. 19. Article 139 of the Election Law of 28 June 1991 provided that a candidate in parliamentary elections could bring a court action seeking rectification of information published about him/her during the election campaign and claiming compensation. The court was required to decide the case within 48 hours. The court could order the publisher of the information to rectify the information immediately and to apologise publicly to the plaintiff, if the information proved to be false or inaccurate. The court could order the defendant to pay compensation to the plaintiff. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure were applicable to proceedings brought before the courts on the basis of this provision. 20. Article 6 of the Civil Code provides that the person who relies on a fact relevant to his or her case bears the burden of proving that fact. Pursuant to Article 232 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the parties to civil proceedings are under an obligation to adduce evidence to establish the facts relevant to their claim. Under Article 227 of the Code of Civil Procedure, evidence can be taken as to the facts which are of relevance for the outcome of the case. 21. As regards the burden of proof, the case-law of the Polish courts in proceedings instituted on the basis of Article 139 of the 1991 Election Law was inconsistent. In certain cases the courts held that an analysis of Article 139 read together with the general principle of Article 6 of the Civil Code led to the conclusion that the burden of proof, in cases in which the information concerning a candidate was harmful to his or her good reputation, lay on the person who had published the information in question. The courts argued that in such cases the approach taken in Article 24 of the Civil Code should be followed, in that there was a presumption that attacks on the personal rights of the plaintiff were unlawful. Consequently, it fell to the defendant to prove their lawfulness, in particular by pointing out that the information published about the plaintiff, and which was deemed to be harmful to him or her, was true. Thus the plaintiff was exempted from the obligation to demonstrate that the allegations against him were untrue (the Kielce Regional Court, I Ns 60/93, Dec. of 11.09.1993; the Krakow Court of Appeal, I Acz 406/93, Dec. of 16.09.1993). In another decision, the Katowice Court of Appeal held that the plaintiff in Article 139 proceedings could not be required to adduce evidence in order to prove that something had not occurred (the Katowice Court of Appeal, I Acz 590/93, Dec. of 30.08.1993). In a further case in which the court ordered the defendant to prove that statements about the candidate were true, the court emphasised that, in conformity with the principle ei incumbit probatio qui dicit, non qui negat, it was not possible to require the plaintiff to produce evidence to prove that certain facts had not occurred (the Gdańsk Court of Appeal, Acz 632/93, Dec. 19.08.1993). 22. On the other hand, in certain decisions given on the basis of Article 139 of the Election Law, the courts held that that provision in conjunction with Article 6 of the Civil Code required the plaintiff to prove that the statements contained in the contested publications were untrue (the Katowice Regional Court, II Ns 88/93, Dec. 10.09.1993; the Katowice Regional Court I Acz 660/93, Dec. 18.09.1993). 23. The applicant lodged his application with the Commission, alleging a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. 24. The Commission declared the application partly admissible on 26 February 1996. In its report of 21 October 1999 (former Article 31 of the Convention) it expressed the opinion, by thirty votes to one, that there had been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on account of the fact that the court refused to take all evidence proposed by the applicant.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

On 5 January 2001 the Social Insurance Institution (kansaneläkelaitos, folkpensionsanstalten) of Lahti decided that as of December 1999 the Finnish social security legislation did not apply to the applicant as he was not considered to be permanently resident in Finland. The applicant appealed to the Appellate Board for Social Insurance (tarkastuslautakunta, prövningsnämnden) which rejected the appeal on 12 October 2001. The decision of the Appellate Board was sent to the applicant’s address in Estonia, but allegedly the applicant never received it. He had allegedly requested the authorities to send the decision to his address in Finland. The applicant alleged that he became aware of the decision of the Appellate Board in February 2002 when the Social Insurance Institution asked him to return some wrongly paid social benefits. By that time the decision of the Appellate Board had already gained legal force and he was not able to appeal against it to the Insurance Court (vakuutusoikeus, försäkringsdomstolen). At that time he allegedly asked advice from the Appellate Board and the Insurance Court, without any helpful response. Under section 61 of the Administrative Judicial Procedure Act (hallintolainkäyttölaki, förvaltningsprocesslagen 586/1996) an expired time-limit may be restored to a person who has a legal excuse or who for another strong reason was unable to observe a prescribed time-limit in lodging an appeal against a decision. Under section 62 of the said Act an application for the restoration of an expired time-limit shall be lodged with the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) within one year of the expiry of the original time-limit, at the latest. For a very strong reason the time-limit may be restored even after that period. In a decision of 16 November 2001 (no 2862) the Supreme Administrative Court decided to restore an expired time-limit for A in order to lodge an appeal to the Administrative Court against a decision of the Environmental Board in a case where the decision of the Environmental Board was not given to him as required by section 54, subsection 1 of the Environmental Protection Act (ympäristönsuojelulaki, miljöskyddslagen).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He was represented before the Court by Mr R. Schlierer, a lawyer practising in Stuttgart. The applicant is a member of the political party “the Republicans” (Partei der Republikaner, in the following Die Republikaner). The party is considered as populist and right-wing and has therefore been under scrutiny by the offices for the protection of the constitution (Verfassungsschutzämter) in various German States (Länder). In the general elections in September 2005, Die Republikaner achieved 0.6 % of the votes. The party has not been declared unconstitutional by the Federal Constitutional Court in accordance with Section 21 (2) of the German Basic Law. The applicant stood for the party as a candidate in local elections in 1994 and as a substitute candidate in regional elections in the State (Land) Baden-Wuerttemberg in 1996. Moreover, he contributed to activities of the party’s county association on a regular basis. The applicant had been employed as a civil servant with the BadenWuerttemberg police since 1968. He was promoted several times, lastly in 1993 to the position of detective superintendent (Kriminalkommissar). He retired in 2002. Although the applicant received above-average appraisals at work, he was not considered for a further promotion to chief inspector (Kriminaloberkommissar) despite the fact that there were such openings as from 1 July 1994. Following his inquiry about the reasons for not having been promoted, the Tübingen Regional Council informed the applicant in a letter dated 7 February 1995 that promotions were generally based on suitability, capabilities and professional qualifications. Regarding his suitability, the Regional Council expressed severe doubts due to his active membership of Die Republikaner, a party which was suspected to pursue anti-constitutional goals. Therefore, his promotion process had been stayed until further instructions by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of the interior would be received regarding the matter. The applicant subsequently instituted proceedings against the lack of promotion to the position of chief inspector. On 12 December 1996, the Sigmaringen Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s claim, finding that the decision not to promote the applicant had been lawful. The court noted that public servants were generally not entitled to a promotion which was subject to the employer’s discretion with regard to suitability, capabilities and professional qualifications. The employer enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this respect. That margin had not been overstepped by basing unsuitability for promotion of a public servant on active membership in a political party seeking to undermine the free democratic constitutional system. Having regard to a judgment by the Baden-Wuerttemberg Administrative Court of Appeal of 11 March 1994, the court considered Die Republikaner as a party with unconstitutional goals. Both before and during the proceedings, the applicant had failed to dissociate himself from right-wing fundamentalist utterances of party officials. Moreover, the fact that only the Federal Constitutional Court could declare a prohibition of a political party with unconstitutional goals (and had not yet done so with regard to Die Republikaner) was no obstacle. Whereas the German constitution granted every citizen the right to work the free democratic constitutional system as a member of a party which is not prohibited, the duty of loyalty required from public servants (which is laid down in Section 33 (4) of the German Basic Law) would demand that every public servant defend this order. Lastly, the court found that the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Vogt v. Germany (judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323) would not require a different ruling. That case concerned the dismissal of a public servant as opposed to non-promotion in the present case. Hence the question of proportionality had to be considered differently. On 4 October 1999, the Baden-Wuerttemberg Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and refused to grant leave to appeal on points of law. The court found that the applicant’s employer had not overstepped his margin of appreciation as the suitability of public servants could lawfully be assessed with regard to their duty of loyalty. Membership in a party which pursued goals which were not in accordance with the free democratic constitutional system was sufficient to cast doubt on whether a public servant was a suitable candidate for promotion. Since the party in question had been scrutinised by various offices for the protection of the constitution in Germany, and this scrutiny had been found lawful by numerous Administrative Courts of Appeal in Germany, the court did not itself have to establish whether or not the activities of Die Republikaner were unconstitutional. With regard to the proportionality of the decision not to promote the applicant, the court found that the judgment in the case of Vogt v. Germany (above-mentioned) did not demand a different ruling since the applicant in the present case had already been promoted several times and had not been deprived of his professional and economic basis by the decision not to promote him further. The applicant’s appeal against the refusal to grant leave to appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Federal Administrative Court on 19 May 2000. On 17 December 2001, the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint. It held that the administrative courts’ assessment concerning the unconstitutional goals of Die Republikaner was in line with the jurisprudence of various Administrative Courts of Appeal in different German States (Länder). The courts had rightly granted the employer a margin of appreciation when assessing the applicant’s suitability for promotion. The Federal Constitutional Court found that the domestic authorities and courts had lawfully taken into account the applicant’s political activities even though it had not yet itself declared Die Republikaner an unconstitutional party in accordance with Section 21 (2) of the German Basic Law. The relevant provisions of the Basic Law are worded as follows: Section 21 “2. Parties which, through their aims or the conduct of their members, seek to damage or to overthrow the free democratic constitutional system or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be held to be anticonstitutional. The Federal Constitutional Court shall determine the question of anti-constitutionality.” Section 33 “2. All Germans shall have an equal right of admission to the civil service according to their suitability, capabilities and professional qualifications. 4. The exercise of sovereign authority on a regular basis shall, as a rule, be entrusted to members of the public service who stand in a relationship of service and loyalty defined by public law.” The relevant provision of the Baden Wuerttemberg Public Servant Act is worded as follows: Section 11 (1) “Nominations shall be carried out on the basis of suitability, capabilities and professional qualifications regardless of sex, race, religious or political beliefs, origin or relationships.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

GERMANY,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Art. 5-1,Angelika Nußberger;Dean Spielmann;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Karel Jungwiert;Mark Villiger,"5. The applicant was born in 1959 and is currently detained in Aachen Prison. 6. Between 1974 and 1990 the applicant was convicted of sexual offences including attempted rape, sexual abuse of children, sexual assault, attempted sexual assault and dangerous assault in six judgments and spent some eleven years in prison. 7. On 14 February 1990 the Cologne Regional Court convicted the applicant of two counts of sexual assault. It sentenced him to five years and six months’ imprisonment and ordered his (first) preventive detention under Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 20-21 below). It found that in June and July 1989 the applicant, acting with full criminal responsibility, had sexually assaulted two hitchhikers whom he had taken with him in his car. Having consulted a neurological expert, it further found that owing to his criminal tendencies, it was very likely that the applicant would commit further serious sexual offences comparable to those he was found guilty of on release and was dangerous to the public. Therefore, his preventive detention was necessary. 8. The applicant served his prison sentence until 17 January 1995 and was then held in preventive detention until 29 March 1995, when the preventive detention order was suspended on probation and the applicant released. 9. On 11 November 1996 the Cologne Regional Court convicted the applicant of attempted sexual assault and falsification of a driving licence. It sentenced him to four years and nine months’ imprisonment and ordered his (second) preventive detention under Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The Regional Court found that in August 1995 the applicant, acting with full criminal responsibility, had again attempted to sexually assault a hitchhiker. He had threatened her with a gas pistol, but she had succeeded in wresting the pistol from him and making good her escape. Having regard to the facts that the applicant had begun to reoffend almost immediately after spending some seventeen years in detention and that, according to the convincing view expressed by an expert, it would take many years to rehabilitate the applicant, if ever, the court further considered its second order of preventive detention to be proportionate. 10. On 20 June 1997 the Bonn Regional Court revoked the suspension on probation of the applicant’s first preventive detention, ordered in the Cologne Regional Court’s judgment of 14 February 1990, as the applicant had reoffended and had not diligently continued his therapy. 11. The applicant served his full prison sentence imposed in the judgment of 11 November 1996 until 25 May 2000. Since 26 May 2000 the applicant has been in preventive detention in Aachen Prison as ordered both in the judgment of the Cologne Regional Court of 14 February 1990 and in the judgment of that same court of 11 November 1996. 12. On 5 June 2002 the Aachen Regional Court, reviewing the applicant’s preventive detention, refused to suspend his preventive detention on probation. 13. On 11 June 2003 the applicant requested the Aachen Regional Court to order his release from preventive detention, arguing that preventive detention violated Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. 14. On 23 July 2003 the Aachen Regional Court, examining the applicant’s request under Article 458 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 24 below), decided that his objections against the admissibility of the execution of his preventive detention were ill-founded. The applicant’s preventive detention, ordered by the Cologne Regional Court in 1996 under Article 66 of the Criminal Code, constituted lawful detention after conviction by a competent court within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (a) of the Convention. 15. On 10 September 2003 the Cologne Court of Appeal, endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It added that preventive detention under Article 66 of the Criminal Code, which was to be qualified as a measure of correction and prevention and not as a penalty, neither violated the Convention nor the Basic Law. Moreover, Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force since 31 January 1998 (see paragraph 23 below), was constitutional. 16. On 15 March 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court, referring to its leading judgment of 5 February 2004 in the case of M. (file no. 2 BvR 2029/01; application no. 19359/04 to this Court), declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 1838/03), in which he had complained that his preventive detention of an indefinite duration had violated Article 5 and Article 7 of the Convention. 17. On 19 July 2004, 19 July 2006 and 2 July 2008 the Aachen Regional Court, reviewing the applicant’s detention, refused to suspend the applicant’s preventive detention on probation. It considered that it could not be expected that the applicant, who refused to make a therapy with an external psychologist offered to him, would not reoffend on release. 18. The applicant was in his first preventive detention as ordered in the judgment of the Cologne Regional Court of 14 February 1990 until 15 March 2010. From 16 March 2010 onwards, the applicant’s preventive detention as ordered for the second time in the judgment of the Cologne Regional Court of 11 November 1996 is executed. 19. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, and the making, review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court’s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, §§ 45-78, 17 December 2009). The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows: 20. The sentencing court may, at the time of the offender’s conviction, order his preventive detention, a socalled measure of correction and prevention, under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence, a penalty, if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public (Article 66 of the Criminal Code). 21. In particular, the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to at least two years’ imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already, to at least one year’s imprisonment in each case, for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence. Secondly, the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for at least two years. Thirdly, a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public (see Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force at the relevant time). 22. Under Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force prior to 31 January 1998, the first placement in preventive detention may not exceed ten years. If the maximum duration has expired, the detainee shall be released (Article 67d § 3). 23. Article 67d of the Criminal Code was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other Dangerous Offences Act of 26 January 1998, which entered into force on 31 January 1998. Article 67d § 3, in its amended version, provided that if a person has spent ten years in preventive detention, the court shall declare the measure terminated (only) if there is no danger that the detainee will, owing to his criminal tendencies, commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims. Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender. The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished. Pursuant to section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, the amended version of Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis. 24. Article 458 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a court decision must be obtained if objections are raised to the execution of a sentence. 25. On 4 May 2011 the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the complainants’ preventive detention beyond the former ten-year maximum period (compare the provisions in paragraphs 22-23 above) and about the retrospective order of the complainants’ preventive detention respectively (file nos. 2 BvR 2365/09, 2 BvR 740/10, 2 BvR 2333/08, 2 BvR 1152/10 and 2 BvR 571/10). The Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty. 26. The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention because those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment (Abstandsgebot). These provisions included, in particular, Article 66 of the Criminal Code in its version in force since 27 December 2003. 27. The Federal Constitutional Court ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with the Basic Law remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until 31 May 2013 at the most. In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court’s case-law. If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released. 28. In its judgment, the Federal Constitutional Court stressed that the fact that the Constitution stood above the Convention in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and European dialogue between the courts, but was, on the contrary, its normative basis in view of the fact that the Constitution was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law (völkerrechtsfreundliche Auslegung). In its reasoning, the Federal Constitutional Court relied on the interpretation of Article 5 and Article 7 of the Convention made by this Court in its judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above).",[],[],[],['5'],['5-1'],[],0
198,001-105448,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2011,SHEIKH v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Lech Garlicki;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Sverre Erik Jebens;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Miss Anal Sheikh, is a British national who was born in 1960 and lives in Stanmore. She was not legally represented. 2. The applicant is a solicitor who joined the firm Ashley & Co. as an assistant solicitor in 1987. In 1993 she became the sole proprietor and practitioner in the practice. Between 1987 and 2005, she was the subject of sixteen successful complaints to the Law Society, of which five related to overcharging. 3. In February 2004, the Law Society commenced an inspection of and investigation into Ashley & Co. On 16 February 2004 the head of forensic investigations at the Law Society wrote to the applicant stating that the books of Ashley & Co. were to be investigated and that officers of the Law Society would be attending her office for that purpose. The letter said that it was not the policy of the Law Society’s Compliance Board to authorise staff to disclose the reasons for inspections. The applicant was therefore not advised of the reasons for the inspection. 4. Two different departments of the Compliance Board were involved in the investigation: forensic investigations, which dealt with concerns about compliance with the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules; and multiple complaints investigation, which dealt with all other complaints. The inspection commenced with a visit to the applicant’s office on 23 February 2004, which lasted around two or three days. Five further visits took place, the last on 21 July 2004. The Law Society’s inspectors from the multiple complaints investigation department also wrote six lengthy letters to the applicant asking for further information in connection with the investigation. Although the applicant co-operated with the investigators in attendance at her offices, she did not reply in writing to any of the letters. 5. Following the final visit, the investigative officers compiled a report on the applicant’s practice, intended for internal consideration within the Law Society, in order to determine whether any of the powers contained in the Solicitors Act 1974 (“the 1974 Act”) should be exercised in relation to Ashley & Co. The report (“the FI Report”) was prepared in the form of a letter dated 22 November 2004 from the head of the forensic investigations department to the head of investigation and enforcement in the Law Society’s Compliance Directorate. The FI Report was 33 pages long, with between 70 and 80 pages of appendices. 6. On 10 December 2004 a member of the multiple complaints investigation department wrote a 19-page letter to the applicant. She did not enclose a copy of the FI Report at that time. The letter set out allegations of professional failures by the applicant and invited her to reply by 4 January 2005. The allegations related generally to alleged failures to comply with provisions of the Solicitors’ Practice Rules (see paragraph 68 below). 7. The applicant, despite being reminded in the letter that she had a professional obligation to reply to the Law Society, did not reply. 8. On 23 December 2004 the Law Society wrote to the applicant again, this time enclosing the FI Report. She was asked to comment on the report by 10 January 2005. A covering letter contained several allegations of breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules (see paragraphs 66-67 below) and invited comments on these allegations. In addition, the letter stated that the investigators were satisfied that the applicant had failed to comply with provisions of those rules, and that therefore the power to intervene (essentially, to take control of the applicant’s practice – see paragraphs 55-61 below) was exercisable. 9. On the evening of 23 December 2004 the applicant received a telephone call from one of the investigators telling her that there would be a large and important parcel waiting for her at her office the next day and that she should collect it and read it in order to reply by 10 January 2005. The applicant told the investigator that she was going on holiday with her mother to India the following day and that she could not deal with a large communication from the Law Society by 10 January 2005. She accordingly asked for an extension of time. No extension was granted. The applicant went on holiday without collecting the parcel. Upon her return, the parcel was waiting for her. However, she did not open it. She subsequently explained that the reason she did not open it was “because she could not deal with it”. 10. On an unknown date, the FI Report was forwarded to the Adjudication Panel of the Compliance Board (“the Panel”). It was accompanied by a recommendation that stringent and immediate conditions imposed on the applicant’s practising certificate would be sufficient to protect the public and the conclusion that intervention was not necessary, although the matter was “finely balanced”. 11. On 17 February 2005 the applicant received funds in the sum of GBP 254,000 in respect of a mortgage on her own home. As she intended to invest the funds in a client’s business, she instructed her secretary to pay the funds into the firm’s client account, intending to deal with the necessary paperwork later. However, her secretary instead credited the firm’s office account. The applicant was not made aware of the error. 12. The Panel met on 17 February 2005. Following consideration of the FI Report, the Panel decided that there should be an intervention in the applicant’s practice. It adopted several resolutions, the most significant of which being: “1. The Panel were satisfied that grounds for intervention existed under paragraph 1(1)(a)(i) of Part I of Schedule 1 Solicitors Act 1974 (as amended), namely that the Panel were satisfied that they had reason to suspect dishonesty on the part of Ms Anal Sheikh practising as Ashley & Co ... in connection with her practice as a solicitor. 2. The Panel were also satisfied that grounds for intervention existed under paragraph 1(1)(c) of Part I of Schedule 1 Solicitors Act 1974 (as amended) namely that Ms Anal Sheikh failed to comply with the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules. 3. The Panel balanced the need to exercise powers of intervention in order to protect the public and the serious consequences of intervention for a solicitor. The Panel were satisfied that it was necessary to exercise powers of intervention in this case in view of the nature of the matters identified in the Forensic Investigations Report dated 22 November 2004. 4. The Panel were further satisfied that it was necessary to exercise powers of intervention in order to protect the public. 5. The Panel RESOLVED to intervene into Anal Sheikh’s practice at Ashley & Co ...” 13. No particulars were given in the resolution of why the Panel suspected dishonesty on the part or the applicant or why it concluded that she had breached the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules. 14. The Council of the Law Society also passed resolutions providing that the applicant’s practice monies vest in the Law Society and that the applicant be required to deliver practice documents to its nominated agent. In accordance with the applicable legislation, the applicant’s practising certificate was automatically suspended (see paragraph 61 below). 15. That afternoon a representative of the Law Society called Ashley & Co. to speak to the applicant but she was out of the office. He faxed a copy of the intervention resolution to her at her office, informing her that the intervention team would arrive at 10.30 the next morning and that an intervention had been ordered as a result of breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, with reference to paragraphs 6 and 9 of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 58-59 below). 16. On the morning of 18 February 2005 the applicant did not go to her office as she had client meetings scheduled. However, her secretary called her to inform her of the fax and the Law Society’s pending visit. According to the applicant, she was not made aware that an intervention had been ordered. She asked her secretary to reschedule the visit as she did not intend to be in the office that day. Her secretary telephoned the Law Society to relay the message. She was advised that it was imperative that the applicant attend the meeting that morning and that her practising certificate had in any case been suspended. She then called the applicant back and explained the position. The applicant made arrangements to go immediately to her office. 17. At some point during the second phone call, or possibly during a third phone call with her secretary prior to arriving at the office, the applicant instructed her secretary to transfer the GBP 254,000 from the client account to her personal bank account and to sign the transfer form on the applicant’s behalf. The secretary effected the applicant’s instructions, with the result that the client account was debited in the sum of GBP 254,000, leaving it heavily overdrawn. 18. In due course the intervention team arrived at the applicant’s office to commence the intervention. The applicant was there to meet them and asked for, and was given, time to take legal advice before the intervention proceeded. She instructed a well-known firm of solicitors. It appears that they did not recommend that she take immediate action to halt the intervention but advised her to exercise her statutory right of challenge under the 1974 Act (see paragraph 62-63 below). She permitted the intervention team to have access to the premises. She had still not opened the parcel sent to her by the Law Society on 23 December 2004 (see paragraphs 8-9 above). 19. On 25 February 2005 the applicant issued an application to the High Court to request the withdrawal of the intervention under paragraphs 6(4) and 9(8) of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 62-63 below). Realising that it could be some time before the matter was heard by the High Court, the applicant’s solicitor wrote two letters to the Law Society proposing measures to allow the applicant to continue to have conduct of a limited number of specific matters on conditions intended to protect clients against the risk perceived by the Law Society to exist. One of the conditions was that she would not issue any bills to clients. The Law Society refused to accommodate the requests; no reasons were provided for the refusal. However, in accordance with usual practice where a challenge to an intervention is lodged with the High Court, the Law Society put in place arrangements to mitigate the damage to the goodwill in the practice pending the outcome of proceedings. An experienced firm of solicitors took possession of the practice and files and passed to other solicitors only those files requiring immediate action which the applicant herself was not able to take, which amounted to just over ten per cent of her files and the client and office accounts were frozen. 20. On or about 7 March 2005 the applicant sought case management directions. In particular, she sought directions for a speedy trial. The Law Society did not oppose the request. The applicant also sought, by way of interim relief, an order for the restoration of her practising certificate. However, the application was incompetent as it ought to have been made, in the first instance, to the Law Society itself (see paragraph 64 below). 21. On 9 March 2005 the application for case management directions came before the court, which made an order for an expedited trial. It also considered the arrangements put in place by the Law Society to mitigate the effect of the intervention pending the resolution of the applicant’s challenge (see paragraph 19 above). The applicant did not challenge these arrangements. 22. The applicant subsequently applied to the Law Society under section 16(3) of the 1974 Act to have her practising certificate restored (see paragraph 64 below). The outcome of the application was that the Law Society granted the applicant a new practising certificate for 2004/2005 with conditions to protect her clients, namely that she did not act as sole principal, as a partner or as a salaried partner. She was therefore unable to resume the Ashley & Co. practice. 23. The application for withdrawal of the intervention came before the High Court on 4 May 2005 and the trial lasted eight days. On 9 June 2005, Park J directed that the intervention be withdrawn, reserving his full judgment until 1 July 2005. Following Park J’s notification of his decision on 9 June 2005, the intervention was ordered to be withdrawn by order of the same date. By order of 16 June 2005, all the conditions, apart from one preventing the applicant from seeking the payment of fees for probate work without the prior approval of the Law Society, were lifted from the applicant’s practising certificate as of 16 June 2005. 24. In his subsequent written judgment, Park J explained that he had chosen to announce his decision before handing down judgment because every day which passed was potentially damaging to the applicant even if her application succeeded in the end. In short, Park J’s reasons for ordering the withdrawal of the intervention were that he did not think that there was reason to suspect the applicant of dishonesty and that while he accepted that there had been some breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules and other aspects of the firm’s practice about which the Law Society could legitimately feel concern, he did not think that they were serious enough to merit intervention. 25. Park J noted that where a decision to intervene resulted in the vesting of practice monies in the Law Society, the delivery up of practice documents and the suspension of the solicitor’s practising certificate, the consequences were very severe for the solicitor and, in the case of a sole practitioner like the applicant, it effectively meant the total destruction of the practice. However, he accepted that the powers accorded to the Law Society under the 1974 Act were both valuable and desirable to ensure public confidence in the honesty of solicitors and to ensure a quick and effective response in cases where there were grounds to suspect dishonesty on the part of a solicitor. He noted that it was possible, in the applicant’s case, that the intervention action which the Law Society had already taken might already have done substantial damage to the practice of her firm, but considered that such a consequence might be a risk which had to be accepted in the wider interests of preserving public confidence in the solicitors’ profession as a whole. However, he criticised the unexplained rejection by the Law Society of the applicant’s solicitor request that she be allowed to continue some limited practice under conditions (see paragraph 19 above). 26. Concerning the scope of the court’s review under paragraphs 6(4) and 9(8) of Schedule 1 to the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 62-63 below), Park J considered that the jurisdiction of the court was not to be exercised on grounds analogous to judicial review. Accordingly, he was not required to limit his consideration of the application to the question whether the notice was one which no reasonable body in the position of the Law Society could have decided to serve but was able to decide himself whether the notice of intervention should be allowed to stand. In this respect, the Law Society’s own view that the circumstances merited intervention was a relevant factor for consideration. Park J also emphasised that the relevant legislation referred to a “suspicion” of dishonesty and it was therefore not necessary for a positive finding of dishonesty to be made. Finally, the court was not limited to reviewing the evidence before the Law Society at the time when the decision was made to intervene but could consider the whole of the evidence, including incidents or discoveries post-intervention, in deciding whether to withdraw the intervention. In this regard, he noted: “...[the applicant] acknowledges that she had been deficient in providing explanations to the Law Society’s officers in the course of the inquiries which preceded the decision to intervene. She can, however, put before me evidence which she failed to present to the Law Society at the earlier stage, and submit (as Mr Treverton-Jones has done on her behalf) that, even if the Law Society’s Panel which decided to intervene could understandably have thought that there was reason to suspect dishonesty given the absence then of answers from her to questions about matters which had caused the Society’s officers concern, the position now is different: I should, taking account of her evidence, conclude that there is no reason to suspect dishonesty in any respect which could rationally justify the drastic (and effectively terminal) step of intervention.” 27. He then went on to consider the events which preceded the intervention. Regarding the letter of 10 December 2004, he noted that the letter requested comments on eight different alleged failures. In general they were categorised as failures to comply with particular provisions of the Solicitors’ Practice Rules and with associated principles in the Guide to the Professional Conduct of Solicitors. He continued: “As far as I can see there is no reference to the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules in it, nor do I find anything which could be regarded as an allegation of actual dishonesty on [the applicant’s] part.” 28. Similarly, Park J observed that he could not find any specific allegation of dishonesty in the letter of 23 December 2004 enclosing the FI Report. 29. Park J noted the absence of any details as to why the Panel had reached its conclusions and ordered the intervention, saying: “... In this particular case I consider that the absence of particulars causes considerable difficulty, especially as regards the finding of suspected dishonesty. What precisely was the dishonesty, and what precisely were the grounds which raised a suspicion of it? The Panel does not say. This is, I understand, in line with standard practice for Law Society Panels. In normal cases (which in my opinion this case is not) the absence of particulars in a Panel’s finding of grounds to suspect dishonesty may not particularly matter, because the nature of the dishonesty and of the grounds of suspicion is perfectly obvious to anyone ... In all the earlier cases of interventions which I was shown the alleged dishonesty was clear for all to see. Similarly, in so far as the intervention may also have been founded on breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, the breaches were equally obvious, and almost always consisted of solicitors either not having client accounts at all ... or taking money off client account and using it for private purposes or for their own professional purposes (like reducing the office overdraft or paying the office rent) in circumstances where the taking of the money was prohibited ... Furthermore as far as I can ascertain, although the members of the Panel in Miss Sheikh’s case presumably did know what sort of dishonesty they suspected and what their grounds for suspecting it were, nobody else in the Law Society knew. The Law Society officers [involved in the investigation and preparation of the FI Report] who gave evidence before me ... did not know ... This has caused substantial difficulties in the case, and in my view has had an unfortunate effect on the nature of the proceedings. Miss Sheikh did not know any detail of what sort of dishonesty was being alleged against her, and in her first witness statement could do little more on this aspect of the case than to say that she utterly refuted any suggestion that there was reason to suspect dishonesty on her part. She has always accepted that she failed to reply to correspondence and that there have been some technical infringements of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, but she denies any kind of dishonesty. Since she does not know what specific kind of dishonesty the Panel suspected, she has great difficulty in doing more than making a general denial. Her legal team in this case ... could only speculate as to the case which they had to meet. In a criminal case an indictment which merely charged that there was reason to suspect dishonesty would never survive. The same would apply to a pleading in a civil claim.” 30. He noted that even the Law Society’s legal team were unaware of the reasons for the Panel’s suspicion of dishonesty and concluded: “In the circumstances it seems to me that [counsel for the Law Society] have had to do the best they can to find in the extensive documentation in the case any features which, as it seems to them, might have given rise to a suspicion of dishonesty, to present them to me as giving rise to such a suspicion, and to cross-examine Miss Sheikh and Mr Sampat [an Ashley & Co. staff member] in a way which entails alleging dishonesty in numerous different respects.” 31. He noted that the applicant’s case had not come before the court quickly, and that it had not proceeded speedily. He continued: “... I may be wrong, but I think that it was primarily the Law Society which had problems with an earlier commencement [of the trial].” 32. As to the breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, Park J noted that, unlike in virtually all other cases of interventions of which he was aware, there was no evidence that any client money had gone missing. Further, regarding the allegations of dishonesty, he observed that the applicant had been searchingly cross-examined for a little more than two days and that she had not remotely struck him as the “dishonest, grasping, incompetent” implied by the Law Society’s multiple attacks upon her. 33. Park J expressed doubt at the proposition by counsel for the Law Society that, once intervention had been commenced by the Law Society, the subsequent review by the High Court of whether to withdraw the intervention could take into consideration all matters relating to the solicitor’s conduct, even those which, under the 1974 Act, did not justify intervention. He concluded: “... I accept that I should look at the evidence as it exists when the case is presented to me, and that I am not limited to considering only the materials which were before the Panel when, some months previously, it resolved to intervene ... Thus, if there is new evidence of the existence of reasons to suspect dishonesty or of breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, I can certainly take account of it. It is far from clear, however, that I should take account of new evidence (or for that matter old evidence) of alleged shortcomings on the part of Miss Sheikh which do not bear on any suspicion of dishonesty or on breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules ... [A] Panel cannot resolve that a practice be intervened upon on the basis of a general opinion that the practice is unsatisfactory, and that it will be in the public interest for the Law Society to intervene. That being so, I am unconvinced that a general opinion of that nature should carry any substantial weight when it comes to deciding whether the court should order an intervention to be withdrawn. Suppose that it had appeared to the Panel that there was no reason to suspect dishonesty and that, although there had been breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, they were not themselves of the sort which could justify the drastic step of intervention. Could the Panel nevertheless have decided that the Law Society should intervene in Ashley & Co because there were other aspects of the firm’s practice which the Panel considered to be unacceptable? I think not. Is it, therefore, any different at the stage when the court is considering whether an intervention should be withdrawn? Again, I think not ...” 34. Park J considered in some detail the matters raised in the FI Report. He concluded in relation to each that they were insufficiently serious to merit intervention. He further considered the matters raised by the Law Society as regards the applicant’s alleged dishonesty and concluded that the evidence before him supported no such suspicion. He noted that some of the matters to which the Law Society referred might be relevant to any disciplinary proceedings which could be taken against the applicant, but were not relevant to the question of intervention. As to the failure of the applicant to respond to the Law Society’s letters, Park J noted that the letters were very demanding and that the applicant was a busy sole practitioner with clients to look after and without much in the way of high grade supporting staff in her office. He considered that she would have been unable to deal with the letters in the detail which the Law Society required without neglecting her current clients and risking failing in her duty to them. 35. In relation to the pre-intervention material put before him, Park J concluded: “On the basis of matters as they stood before the intervention (and taking account of evidence which I had of such matters, whether the Panel had it or not), I believe that the intervention should be set aside.” 36. He reviewed the events of 17 and 18 February and accepted the applicant’s account that she had been unaware that an intervention would take place. He continued: “... To an extent her lack of awareness of what might happen was her own fault. I have described ... how she never even opened the parcel which had arrived at the office on 24 December 2004 and which contained, among other things, the Law Society’s letter of 23 December. If she had opened the parcel and read that letter it would have put her clearly on notice that an intervention was a possibility.” 37. In respect of post-intervention issues, the only matter considered to be of significance by Park J was the transfer, on the morning of the imposition of the intervention, of GBP 254,000 from the client account to the applicant’s personal bank account (see paragraph 17 above). Park J found that the applicant was not aware, at the time when she instructed the transfer, that there had been an intervention. However, he accepted that she gave the instructions to her secretary because of a general feeling that she did not want the money to be in the client account when the Law Society arrived. He continued: “The more general point is that I cannot find it in me to condemn Miss Sheikh for wanting to get the money out of an Ashley & Co bank account before the Law Society arrived. She did not (in my view) know that the Law Society was coming to effect an intervention into her practice, but after the second telephone call from [her secretary] she apprehended that something of a serious nature was quite likely to happen, and she must have felt deep concern about what might happen to this large sum of money which she had borrowed personally only the day before. It must have been a desperate anxiety to her that, because the money had gone into an Ashley & Co bank account, it might become entangled with the problems which it seemed that she was going to have with the Law Society. Feelings of that nature would surely have been enhanced by the reflection that the money might be regarded as still really being hers and not as belonging to a client yet. She was of course under the erroneous impression that the money was being held in the firm’s client account ... She did not realise that the money was in fact in the firm’s office account, but I comment that it was not appropriately held there. The £254,000, if (as I suspect was correct) it did not yet belong to Red River but still belonged to Miss Sheikh , did not belong to her in her capacity as the sole proprietor of the practice. On 18 February the £254,000 did not really have anything to do with the practice. She had just borrowed it on a mortgage of her private house, and it was intended to be invested in a commercial project in which she ... would be participating as an investor and not in her solicitor capacity. In retrospect Miss Sheikh might have been better advised just to leave the money alone and wait fatalistically to find out what was going to happen to it, but I can well understand that it did not seem that way to her at the time. I repeat that I cannot find it in me to say that wanting to remove the money from (as she thought) the Ashley & Co client account was so objectionable a thing that I should leave in place an intervention upon her practice which otherwise I would direct to be withdrawn.” 38. The applicant’s remaining files and all monies from the client and the office accounts, plus interest, were subsequently returned to her. She resumed practice at Ashley & Co. 39. On 5 April 2006 the Law Society was given permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal on three grounds: first, that Park J had inappropriately assessed whether the applicant had in fact been dishonest, rather than addressing whether the statutory test of suspicion of dishonesty had been met; second, that Park J had applied too high a threshold as regards whether the breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules could justify an intervention; and third, that, in exercising his discretion as to whether to withdraw the intervention, Park J had wrongly failed to take into account other matters relating to the applicant’s conduct which were not directly related to her alleged dishonesty and breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules. The judgment granting leave noted that the Law Society was not minded to re-intervene in the applicant’s practice at that time but was considering disciplinary proceedings against her. The appeal was heard between 3 and 5 July 2006. 40. On 23 November 2006, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment. As regards the scope of the appeal proceedings, Chadwick LJ, giving judgment for the court, noted: “The Law Society has made it clear that, whatever the outcome of these appeals, it does not seek to re-intervene in [the applicant’s] practice on the basis of the intervention notices served in February 2005. Its concern is that the findings of fact made by the judge – almost all of which it regards as wrong – present serious difficulties in relation to the exercise of its powers to impose conditions on [the applicant’s] practising certificate. Put shortly, the Society fears that those findings of fact, if not reversed, make it impossible for it to impose the conditions on [the applicant’s] practising certificate which it considers necessary for the protection of the public. It is concerned, also, that it may not be able to go behind those findings of fact in disciplinary proceedings against [the applicant] in which it may wish to allege actual dishonesty. And, further, the Society is concerned that the judge’s approach to the issues which were before him in this case gives rise to uncertainty as to the proper scope of the summary procedure which Parliament must have intended should follow from an application to withdraw under paragraphs 6(4) and 9(8) of schedule 1 to the 1974 Act: uncertainty which, unless resolved, will lead to problems in future cases ...” 41. Chadwick LJ considered the various matters relied upon by the Law Society before the High Court as evidence that continued intervention was justified. As regards the allegations of breaches of the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules, he reached different conclusions from Park J as to the honesty of the applicant in her dealings with the client account. In particular, he commented on the failure of Park J to deal with certain anomalies as regards the applicant’s charging practice: “For my part, I find it surprising that the judge was able to attribute [certain aspects] of the Society’s complaint ... to ‘mistakes’ and ‘an error of judgment’ without a more rigorous analysis of the material which had led the Society to take the view that those matters gave rise to suspicion of dishonesty. It is, I think, difficult to avoid the conclusion that he did so because he had already persuaded himself, from his observation of Miss Sheikh and [her employee] as witnesses, that they were not dishonest; so that matters which, objectively, were capable of giving rise to suspicion of dishonesty had to be explained in a way which avoided a finding of dishonesty ...” 42. He further highlighted the failure of Park J to explain why, in relation to one particular matter, he had rejected the Law Society’s submission that client funds had indeed gone missing contrary to his general finding that the applicant’s case did not involve missing client funds. Chadwick LJ pointed to various other aspects of the Law Society’s complaints concerning the applicant’s conduct in respect of client funds and charging which, in his view, had not been fully addressed by Park J. He referred to Park J’s observation that a client benefitted from clear protections, notably the possibility of requiring the solicitor to obtain a remuneration certificate from the Law Society where he considered that he was being overcharged by his solicitor, and that intervention was therefore not required in such circumstance. He concluded: “The Law Society submits that that is too narrow a view of the circumstances in which it may be appropriate to use its intervention powers. It points out that an honest solicitor should be endeavouring to charge no more than he (or she) believes is due ... I agree: a fortiori where the solicitor, as sole executor, is himself (or herself) the client [as in a number of the examples in the applicant’s case], it seems to me that evidence of persistent and deliberate overcharging in probate matters of that nature might well justify intervention on the basis of suspected dishonesty.” 43. As to the transfer of the GBP 254,000 (see paragraph 17 above), Chadwick LJ agreed with Park J that at the time she ordered the transfer, the applicant did not know of the intervention. However, like Park J, he found that she had, nonetheless, realised that the impending visit of Law Society officials was more serious that just another inspection. He concluded that in the circumstances, the applicant must have known that intervention was a real possibility, and that she had for that reason transferred the money. He further considered that there was no evidence to allow Park J to conclude whether beneficial ownership of the money remained with the applicant. In light of the instructions that she had given to her secretary, Chadwick LJ considered that she could not claim that she thought it was still her money. That the applicant had requested her secretary to sign the bank transfer form on her behalf was a clear attempt to deceive the bank. In the circumstances it was not difficult to understand why the Law Society took the view that the incident gave rise to particular concern as to the applicant’s fitness to carry on her practice. He noted: “... What took place is a significant demonstration of the way in which this solicitor was prepared to act in the face of what she must have seen as an impending (if not actual) crisis in her practice. She was prepared to act in a way which – as she must have appreciated and intended – involved a deception.” 44. Chadwick LJ disagreed with Park J’s approach to the question whether the intervention notices should be withdrawn. In his view, the correct approach was to look at the matter as a whole and in this regard, the conduct of the solicitor at the time of, and immediately following, intervention could well affect the way in which pre-intervention conduct should be viewed. In the applicant’s case, her conduct in relation to the GBP 254,000 demonstrated that she was willing to deceive and Park J ought to have asked himself whether his impression of her as a witness required re-evaluation in the light of her willingness to deceive in relation to that transfer. 45. Chadwick LJ referred to the distinction between an application to the court to withdraw the intervention (as in the present case) and a challenge to the use by the Law Society of its intervention powers: “Plainly, if there is a challenge to the exercise of the intervention powers, the court will need to ask itself whether the grounds under Part I of schedule 1 to the 1974 Act upon which the Society relied at the time of the resolution to intervene were made out on the basis of the information available (or, perhaps, reasonably available) to the Society at that time. If that question is answered in the negative, then (as it seems to me) the resolution under paragraph 6(1) is of no effect and notices served under paragraph 6(3) or 9(1) are ‘fundamentally flawed’ ... That is because the powers under Part II of schedule 1 are exercisable only in circumstances within Part I. So, if the Society is to exercise intervention powers in reliance on paragraph 1(1)(a), the Council must have reason to suspect dishonesty at the time when it passes the resolution under paragraph 6(1) or serves the notice under paragraph 9(1). Cases in which there is a challenge to the validity of the resolution under paragraph 6(1) or to the service of intervention notices are rare. Where the Society relies on paragraph 1(1)(a) of schedule 1, the solicitor may well find it impossible to contend that, on the material available to the Society at the time when the resolution was passed and the intervention notices served, the Society did not have reason to suspect dishonesty. That was the position in the present case. And it is pertinent to keep in mind that, in many cases (as in the present case), the Society will rely, in addition, on paragraph 1(1)(c) (breaches of the accounts rules) and will have given a notice under paragraph 1(2) – thereby providing an opportunity for challenge in advance of intervention. In such cases a challenge to the validity of the resolution under paragraph 1(1) or to the service of intervention notices on the grounds that the condition in sub-paragraph (a) was not met will serve little purpose: the Society will be able to rely (in relation to validity) on sub-paragraph (c). In such cases the solicitor will usually focus his (or her) submissions on seeking to persuade the court that, whether or not the Society had reason to suspect dishonesty on the material available to it at the time, the court should hold, on the basis of additional material deployed at the hearing of the application under paragraph 6(4), that suspicion of dishonesty has been dispelled. That, again, was the position in the present case. What is not open to doubt is that, absent a challenge to the validity of the resolution under paragraph 6(1) of schedule 1 or to the service of intervention notices, the single issue for the court on an application under paragraphs 6(4) or 9(8) is whether the notices should be withdrawn ...” 46. The sole issue for the court, therefore, in the present case being whether the intervention notices should be withdrawn, Chadwick LJ noted: “In addressing that question ... the court must, indeed, weigh the risks of re-instating the solicitor in his (or her) practice against the potentially catastrophic consequences to the solicitor (and the inconvenience, and perhaps real harm, to his or her existing clients) if the intervention continues. In weighing the risks of re-instatement the court must have regard to the views of the Law Society as the professional body charged by statute with the regulation of solicitors ... and as the body whose members are obliged, through the compensation fund, to underwrite those ... In a case where the Society has taken, and continues to take, the view that there are reasons to suspect dishonesty on the part of the solicitor, the court may well need to address those reasons in the context of weighing the risks of re-instatement; although ... that will not always be the case. It is important to keep in mind that (in cases where there is no challenge to the validity of the resolution or to the service of the notices) there is no free-standing requirement for the court to decide whether there are grounds for suspecting dishonesty; a fortiori, no requirement for the court to decide whether the solicitor is or has been dishonest. The issue arises (if at all) in the context of deciding whether the intervention needs to continue.” 47. Accordingly, all matters could be taken into account in reaching the decision whether to withdraw the intervention, including conduct falling outside the statutory grounds for its original imposition, such as the applicant’s poor regulatory history and her failure to respond to proper requests for information from the Law Society. Chadwick LJ considered that Park J had erred in seeking to determine whether or not the applicant was dishonest as the question to be decided was simply whether the suspicion of dishonesty had been dispelled, and Chadwick LJ was satisfied that it had not, bearing in mind the serious inconsistencies between the applicant’s oral evidence at the trial on the one hand and the answers which she had given at interview, the explanations in her witness statements and the documentary material on the other hand. 48. Finally, as regards the Law Society’s criticism of Park J’s approach to whether intervention should continue, Chadwick LJ found: “... First, as it seems to me, past regulatory history is plainly relevant to a consideration whether it is realistic to think that future compliance can be enforced by regulatory powers short of intervention. The Society was entitled to take the view that the history of successful complaints in relation to Miss Sheikh’s conduct of probate matters demonstrated that there could be no basis for confidence that (absent intervention) her practice in relation to such matters could be altered by tighter regulation. Second, on an application under paragraph 6(4) of schedule 1, the court is required to have regard to all matters before it: it is not confined to the grounds which led to the exercise of the intervention powers ... As I have sought to explain, the court’s task on an application under paragraph 6(4) of schedule 1 is not constrained by the statutory grounds on which the Society can exercise intervention powers. Third, on an application under paragraph 6(4) which does not include a challenge to the validity of the resolution under paragraph 6(1) of schedule 1 to the 1974 Act or to the service of intervention notices, past ‘misconduct’ is relevant if, and only in so far as, it informs an assessment of future risk ... The question, in each particular case, is whether the experience of past conduct should lead to the conclusion that the risks of reinstatement are, or are not, acceptable.” 49. The court made the limited orders sought by the Law Society regarding the lifting of limitations on its ability to impose conditions on the applicant’s practising certificate. 50. Chadwick LJ also commented on the intervention procedure and the possibility to challenge an intervention. He noted that it was not in doubt that intervention in a solicitor’s practice, without advance notice, was likely to have the most serious consequences for the solicitor. However, Parliament had provided the solicitor with a summary process by which the matter could be brought before the court and had imposed short time limits within which that process had to be commenced. He observed that in Holder v. Law Society (see paragraphs 69-74 below) the Court of Appeal had rejected an argument that the intervention procedure was incompatible with the solicitor’s Convention rights, on the basis that the court’s power to consider whether a fair balance had been struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights met the requirements of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. However, he continued: “... it is clear that, unless the matter can be determined by the court within a short time of the intervention, the solicitor is likely to be denied an effective remedy. That is because the consequences of intervention – if the intervention continues for more than a short time – are likely to be irreversible. The solicitor’s clients will have to take their affairs elsewhere; the staff will have found other employment; and the practice will be destroyed in any event.” 51. He referred to Park J’s criticism of the resolution of 17 February 2005 on the basis that it failed to disclose the reasons which had led the Panel to decide that intervention notices should be served, and noted: “... The true vice, in my view, is that the reasons which were disclosed – ‘it was necessary to exercise powers of intervention in this case in view of the nature of the matters identified in the Forensic Investigations Report dated 22 November 2004’ – were stated in so general and unspecific terms. Disclosure of reasons in those terms is calculated to make it difficult for the solicitor to know and address the real concerns which had led to the exercise of intervention powers. The Society should, I think, give thought to the need for Panel resolutions to identify, with much more specificity than in this case, the reasons which (in the Panel’s view) make intervention necessary. If those reasons are not identified at an early stage, there is a danger that the solicitor will be denied the effective protection which Parliament plainly intended a summary process to provide. There will, of course, be many cases in which the solicitor who has suffered intervention will be in no doubt as to the Society’s concerns. And, as I have said, there will be cases where the solicitor wishes to challenge the validity of the resolution on public law grounds. But, in cases where, although the solicitor knows what material was before the Panel, there is genuine doubt as to the matters which the Society regards as sufficiently serious to justify intervention, it seems to me that the court should be ready to assist – on an early application for directions following the issue of an application under the schedule 1 procedure – by requiring the Society to state the grounds upon which (on the material then known to it) the application will be resisted. Such a statement would enable the solicitor to address the Society’s concerns in a focussed response. And, in the light of that response, the Society can explain to the court why it takes the view (if it does) that the concerns have not been met. I appreciate that the process suggested in the previous paragraph may require the court to adopt a more pro-active role on applications under schedule 1 to the 1974 Act than hitherto; and that the need for an early determination of such applications will place demands on the court’s resources which it may be difficult to meet. But, as it seems to me, the court will be ready to meet those demands in order to ensure that the solicitor does obtain the effective protection which the Convention requires and which the 1974 Act was plainly intended to provide.” 52. The applicant applied for leave to appeal to the House of Lords. In her petition for leave to appeal, she identified as a matter of general public importance requiring examination by the House of Lords the question whether the intervention provisions in the 1974 Act were compatible with the Convention. The House of Lords refused the applicant’s request for leave to appeal on 22 May 2007. 53. On 14 March 2008 a second intervention was effected into the applicant’s practice. Her High Court challenge in respect of that intervention was dismissed. 54. Disciplinary proceedings against the applicant before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal followed. The case was heard on 5 May 2009 and on 29 June 2009 the findings of the tribunal resulted in the applicant being struck off as a solicitor. 55. The Law Society is the governing body of the solicitors’ profession. It has a regulatory function and regulatory powers under the Solicitors Act 1974. Under section 35 of the 1974 Act, the Law Society is given the power to intervene in a solicitor’s practice in circumstances specified in Part I of Schedule 1 to the Act by exercising any or all of the powers set out in Part II of Schedule 1 to the Act. 56. Paragraph 1(1) of Part I to Schedule 1 of the Act provides that the Law Society may exercise its right of intervention inter alia where the Council of the Law Society have reason to suspect dishonesty on the part of a solicitor in connection with that solicitor’s practice or in connection with any trust of which that solicitor is or formerly was a trustee; or where the Council are satisfied that a solicitor has failed to comply with the Solicitors’ Practice Rules, the Solicitors’ Accounts Rules or rules requiring solicitors to hold professional indemnity insurance. 57. Paragraph 1(2) provides that the intervention powers shall only be exercisable in cases concerning a suspected breach of the solicitors’ rules if the Society has given the solicitor notice in writing that the Council are satisfied that he has failed to comply with rules specified in the notice and that the intervention powers are accordingly exercisable in his case. 58. Part II of Schedule 1 sets out the powers available to the Law Society upon intervention. Under paragraph 6, the Law Society has the power to take control of the practice’s accounts pursuant to a resolution passed by the Council. 59. Under paragraph 9, the Law Society has the power to take possession and control of the firm’s documents. 60. Paragraph 10 allows the Law Society to intercept the firm’s mail. 61. Finally, section 15 of the 1974 Act provides for the suspension of the solicitor’s practice certificate in the event of an intervention. 62. The 1974 Act allows an intervened-upon solicitor to apply to the High Court to request the withdrawal of an intervention. Under paragraph 6(4) of Schedule 1, a decision to take possession of the practice monies can be challenged within eight days of the service of the notice by application to the High Court for an order directing the Law Society to withdraw the notice, with not less than 48 hours’ notice to the Law Society. Paragraph 6(5) provides that upon an application under paragraph 6(4), the Court may make such order as it thinks fit. 63. Under paragraph 9(8) and (9), a solicitor can, within eight days of receiving the notice that the Law Society has taken possession of the firm’s documents and on not less than 48 hours’ notice to the Law Society, apply to the High Court for an order directing that the documents be delivered to such person as the applicant may require. Paragraph 9(11) provides that upon an application, the Court may make such order as it thinks fit. 64. Under section 16(3), a solicitor may, at any time before the expiry of her practising certificate, apply to the Law Society to have the suspension of the certificate terminated. Under section 16(4), upon receipt of an application: “... the Society may in its discretion— (a) by order terminate the suspension either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as the Society may think fit; or (b) refuse the application.” 65. If the Law Society refuses the application or terminates the suspension subject to conditions, the solicitor may appeal against the decision of the Society. At the relevant time, an appeal was to be made to the Master of the Rolls, who could, under section 16(5): “(a) affirm the decision; or (b) terminate the suspension either unconditionally or subject to such conditions as he may think fit.” 66. The Solicitors’ Accounts Rules govern the treatment of client and practice monies by solicitors. They set out a number of general principles, including that a solicitor must keep client money separate from money belonging to the solicitor or the practice; keep client money safe in a bank or building society account identifiable as a client account; establish and maintain proper accounting systems, and proper internal controls over those systems, to ensure compliance with the rules; keep proper accounting records to show accurately the position with regard to the money held for each client and each controlled trust; and account for interest on other people’s money in accordance with the rules. 67. Detailed rules exist concerning bank accounts and require in particular that solicitors to keep at least one client account for the holding of money belonging to clients. They define the circumstances in which transfers can be made from the client account to cover payment of the solicitors’ fees. The rules also provide that the client account must not be overdrawn and that interest must be allocated to monies held in client accounts. Finally, the rules impose strict accounting obligations on solicitors. 68. The Solicitors’ Practice Rules are the principal set of rules governing the practice of solicitors in England and Wales. 69. In the case of Holder v. Law Society ([2003] EWCA Civ 39) the Court of Appeal considered an appeal by the Law Society against the grant of permission by the High Court for an application for withdrawal of an intervention to go to trial on the basis that the intervention violated the claimant’s rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. 70. The Court of Appeal discussed the possibility of obtaining an injunction, noting: “16. Where necessary the procedure can operate very quickly. By way of illustration, we were referred to one case (Wilson Smith v. Law Society, 29th March 1999) where the Judge gave a temporary injunction by telephone on the day before the proposed intervention to enable the matter to be considered in Court the following morning. In another recent case to which I shall return (Wright v. Law Society, 4th September 2002), an interim injunction was granted to preserve the position pending the full hearing a few days later. The Judge recorded the speed with which all the parties had worked, including the submission of skeleton arguments by e-mail over the weekend.” 71. In overturning the decision of the High Court and restoring the order of the Master to dismiss the claim, Carnwath LJ explained: “17. Before the judge it was submitted by Mr Engelman (appearing then as now for Mr Holder) that the intervention power, either generally or as applied in this case, infringed Mr Holder’s right to ‘peaceful enjoyment of his possessions’ under article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as applied by the Human Rights Act 1998 ... ... “29. Mr Engelman referred to the principles laid down by the Strasbourg court for the application of the public interest test: ‘the court must determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights’ (Sporrong and Lönnroth v Sweden (1982) 5 EHRR 35 , 52, para 69); ‘There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realised by any measure depriving a person of his possessions’: Holy Monasteries v Greece (1994) 20 EHRR 1 , 48, para 70. He submitted that if, as the judge found, the more draconian features of the intervention procedure were not ‘necessary’, the requirement of ‘proportionality’ was not satisfied.” 72. He continued: “30. With respect to the submission, and to the judge, this approach ignores the ‘all important’ factor, when considering issues of proportionality, of the ‘margin of appreciation or discretion’ or ‘area of judgment’ allowed to the legislator and the decision-maker ... This aspect was not mentioned by the judge, although it was referred to in Mr Engelman’s written submissions to him. [The judge] appears to have approached the matter on the basis that it was for the court to determine what was ‘necessary’ in the public interest, and in doing so to compare other possible procedures devised by the court. In my view, this was fundamentally wrong.” 73. He concluded that the legislation itself and the approach taken by the Law Society and the courts in carrying out a balancing exercise was no different from the requirement in Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that a fair balance be struck, noting: “31. In the present case, the ‘margin’ arises at two stages: first, the discretion allowed to the legislature in establishing the statutory regime, and, secondly, the discretion of the Law Society as the body entrusted with the decision in an individual case. (In the former case, the only remedy for exceeding the ‘margin’ may be a ‘declaration of incompatibility’ under the 1998 Act.) The intervention procedure, now contained in the Solicitors Act 1974, is long-established (dating back to 1941, in its earliest form), and has been reviewed by the court on many occasions. As appears from the cases to which I have referred, it has been recognised as ‘draconian’ in some respects, but necessary for the protection of the public interest; and the courts have repeatedly emphasised the ‘balancing exercise’ which it involves. I see no material difference between this and the ‘fair balance’ which article 1 requires ... I see no arguable grounds for thinking that the margin allowed to the legislature has been crossed, particularly having regard to the deference which is properly paid to an Act of Parliament, as compared to an administrative decision ... 32. Having reached that point, the Law Society’s actions must be judged by reference to the procedure laid down by Parliament, not to some hypothetical alternative procedure ... 33. The Law Society also has a ‘margin of discretion’, but the court has a separate duty to consider the merits of the case, in accordance with the principles I have discussed, while paying due regard... to the views of the Law Society, as the relevant professional body. As I have said, this meets any ‘fair balance’ requirement ...” 74. Sir Christopher Staughton agreed that the appeal should be allowed, adding: “38. In the exercise of its powers of intervention the Law Society must of course comply with the Human Rights Convention. I can imagine circumstances where the Law Society might be found not to have complied with the Convention, or with the Human Rights Act 1998. After all, a solicitor whose practice is the object of an intervention loses his practising certificate, and in all probability his livelihood as well. The provisions for bringing an intervention to an end are very unlikely to restore the solicitor’s goodwill and his prosperity. If it comes about that the intervention was mistaken or unjustified, there is a risk that the solicitor will suffer a substantial loss without recourse to any remedy. In practice this may never happen; but it is a cause for concern. However, not in this case.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Lech Garlicki;Ledi Bianku;Nicolas Bratza,"The applicant, Mr David Lloyd, is a British national who was born in 1938 and lives in Wirral. He was represented before the Court by Mr Stephen Cussack, Wirral Citizens Advice Bureau. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr C. Whomersley of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. The applicant’s wife died on 9 September 1987, leaving two children born in 1975 and 1981. His claim for widows’ benefits was made in November 2002 and was rejected on 26 August 2003 on the ground that he was not entitled to widows’ benefits because he was not a woman. The applicant did not appeal further as he considered or was advised that such a remedy would be bound to fail since no such social security benefits were payable to widowers under United Kingdom law. The applicant was not in receipt of child benefit at the time of his claim. The domestic law relevant to this application is set out in Willis v. the United Kingdom, no. 36042/97, §§ 1426, ECHR 2002-IV and Runkee and White v. the United Kingdom, no. 42949/98, §§ 40-41, 25 July 2007.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
