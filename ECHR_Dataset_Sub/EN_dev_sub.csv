0,001-161542,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2016,CASE OF ZHEREBIN v. RUSSIA,3,Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention;Reasonableness of pre-trial detention);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction),Dmitry Dedov;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Ksenija Turković,"4. The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Tula. 5. On 9 March 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of a flagrant breach of public peace and order, committed in concert by an organised group. The events in question took place in December 2008. 6. On 10 March 2009 the Taganskiy District Court of Moscow remanded the applicant in custody during the investigation. In particular, the court noted as follows: “When deciding whether a preventive measure should be imposed, the court takes into consideration whether [the applicant] has been charged with a serious offence which entails a custodial sentence of up to seven years’ imprisonment. [The offence in question] was committed against public peace and public order. Further, the court takes into consideration the fact that, at the time of the arrest, [the applicant] did not reside in Moscow, did not reside at his registered address and, according to him, was staying at his friend’s place in the Moscow Region; and that he had applied for two years’ leave of absence from his studies at university. During that period he did not have a permanent place of residence and did not reside at his registered address. [The applicant] is not employed. The source of his income or means of subsistence for his family are not known. Earlier [the applicant] was found liable for administrative offences against public order and public safety. The court also takes into consideration the motive for and the specific circumstances of the offence with which [the applicant] has been charged. The perpetrators used improvised weapons and acted in an organised group during the late hours of the day. Regard being had to the circumstances described above, the court concludes that, if at large, [the applicant] may abscond or otherwise interfere with the administration of justice by, inter alia, putting pressure on [witnesses].” 7. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 10 March 2009. He argued that the District Court had failed to justify its decision to remand him in custody and had not considered the possibility of using a less restrictive preventive measure in his case. He further noted that there was no evidence that he had ever tried to put pressure on witnesses, to interfere with the administration of justice or to abscond. Lastly, he pointed out that he was residing at the address known to the authorities together with his wife, who was pregnant. 8. On 30 March 2009 the Moscow City Court found the decision of 10 March 2009 justified and upheld it on appeal. 9. On 27 April 2009 the District Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention until 15 June 2009. The court reasoned as follows: “As can be seen from the materials submitted to the court, [the applicant] is charged with a serious offence which carries a custodial sentence of up to seven years. The crime was committed in concert with other persons. Some of them have not been identified by the investigating authorities to date. The others have been arrested. [The applicant] was not residing at his registered address. He does not have a registered address in the Moscow Region. He is unemployed. Under Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a preventive measure can be imposed if there is evidence that a defendant might abscond or interfere with the administration of justice in his case. Neither [the applicant] nor his lawyer presented evidence to show that the existence of such a risk could not be justified. Furthermore, it can be seen from the documents submitted to the court that there is a risk that [the applicant] might engage in unlawful acts as defined in the above-mentioned provision of the law, regard being had to the nature and seriousness of the offence with which he is charged, to and to his character ... Accordingly, the court concludes that the circumstances justifying the [applicant’s] remand in custody have not changed. There is no reason to change or lift the preventive measure imposed earlier. The statements of guarantee submitted by the [applicant’s] lawyer cannot be taken into consideration by the court because they were not submitted to the investigator or presented by the signatories in person. ... Some of the statements are not duly authorised and the court has doubts as to their authenticity.” 10. On 18 May 2009 the City Court upheld the decision of 27 April 2009 on appeal. 11. On 29 May 2009 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow scheduled the trial for 10 June 2009. The applicant argued against the extension of his pre-trial detention. He submitted that he was a student, that he was married and that his wife was pregnant. He further pointed out that the investigation in the case had already been completed and that he could not interfere with the administration of justice or put pressure on witnesses. He had no intention of doing so or of absconding. The court ruled that the applicant should remain in custody pending trial. In particular, the court stated as follows: “Having examined the prosecutor’s request to detain [the applicant and two other defendants] pending trial, the court grants it. It discerns no grounds on which to change the preventive measure imposed on the defendants, regard being had to the seriousness of the charges, the factual circumstances and the defendants’ character. In particular, G. and [the applicant] do not have a registered address in Moscow or the Moscow Region. They were not living at their registered address. They are unemployed. The circumstances underlying their remand in custody have not ceased to exist or changed. The fact that the investigation in the criminal case has been completed has no effect to the contrary. Regard being had to the foregoing, the court discerns no grounds on which to change the preventive measure imposed earlier on the defendants and apply a less restrictive measure, including the [applicant’s] release upon a statement of guarantee signed by a surety.” 12. On 24 June 2009 the applicant asked the District Court for release. He submitted that on 16 June 2009 his wife had given birth to their child. He also relied on the statements of guarantee submitted by his sureties. The court dismissed the applicant’s request noting as follows: “... the court considers that the request cannot be granted. The court discerns no circumstances that would allow it to change the preventive measure imposed on [the applicant], regard being had to the seriousness of the charges, the factual circumstances and his character. In particular, [the applicant] does not have a registered address in Moscow or the Moscow Region. He is unemployed. Nor was [he] residing at his registered address. The reasons justifying the [applicant’s] remand in custody have not ceased to exist or changed. ... the birth of his child has no effect to the contrary and cannot justify the decision to replace [pre-trial detention] with a less restrictive measure, including the [applicant’s] release upon a statement of guarantee signed by a surety.” 13. On 22 July 2009 the City Court upheld the decision of 29 May 2009 on appeal. 14. On 28 October 2009 the District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment. 15. On 22 December 2009 the City Court upheld, in substance, the applicant’s conviction on appeal.",['5'],['5-3'],[],[],[],[],1

BULGARIA,4,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life);Violation of Article 13+8 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life),Nona Tsotsoria;Síofra O’Leary,"5. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Kiev. 6. The applicant came to Bulgaria in 1995. In 1996 he started a relationship with Ms M., also a Ukrainian national. In 1997 the two of them had a son. In 2003 the applicant was granted permanent resident status. 7. On 6 November 2006 the head of the Ministry of the Interior’s National Security Service issued an order withdrawing the applicant’s residence permit, ordering his expulsion and imposing a ten-year ban on his re-entering Bulgaria, on the ground that his presence in the country represented a “serious threat to national security”. Factual grounds justifying the order were not indicated; it was merely noted that it was based on “proposal no. B4923”. 8. That proposal, drawn up by National Security Service and also dated 6 November 2006, was submitted to the Court. It stated that the applicant had allegedly been involved in acts of extortion, smuggling, arms deals and money laundering, that he operated with large amounts of illegally obtained money, that he had established contacts with Bulgarian officials, including police officers, who had been providing him with illegal services, and that he had been in contact with presumed terrorists. While enumerating the applicant’s presumed illegal activities, the proposal referred to specific dates and names, but to no evidence to support the allegations. Lastly, it was stated that the applicant had left Bulgaria on 29 October 2006. 9. Unaware of the ministerial order of 6 November 2006, on 15 November 2006 the applicant attempted to re-enter the Bulgarian territory but was stopped at the border and not permitted entry. Since then he has been living in Kiev, while Ms M. and his son remained in Bulgaria. 10. Through his lawyer, the applicant submitted an appeal to the Bulgarian Minister of the Interior against the order of 6 November 2006. The appeal was dismissed on 22 December 2006, the Minister pointing out, in particular, that he considered irrelevant the applicant’s argument that he had settled in Bulgaria with his family. 11. After that the applicant applied for judicial review of the order of 6 November 2006. In particular, he pointed out in his application that his family resided in Bulgaria and that their separation had been unjustified. 12. In the course of the judicial proceedings the applicant’s lawyer was shown proposal no. B4923. 13. In a decision of 30 October 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court held that it was competent to examine the application, with reference to the Court’s judgment in the case of AlNashif v. Bulgaria (no. 50963/99, 20 June 2002) and Article 13 of the Convention, even though, at the time the impugned order had been issued, judicial review had not been available under the legislation then applicable (see paragraph 16 below). 14. The judicial proceedings ended on 19 March 2009 with a final judgment of the Supreme Administrative Court, which upheld the order of 6 November 2006. After enumerating the applicant’s alleged unlawful activities described in proposal no. B4923, it stated merely that the impugned order did not breach the law. Furthermore, it dismissed the applicant’s arguments relating to his family and private life, stating: “any restriction of the rights under the Convention is justified [when based] on national security considerations, in cases where foreign citizens’ behaviour threatens the national security and the public order of the State where they reside.”","['13', '8']",['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1
2,001-157532,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2015,CASE OF KHARLAMOV v. RUSSIA,3,Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction),András Sajó;Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"5. The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Orel. At the time of the events the applicant, a Ph.D. in Physics and Mathematics, was a tenured professor in the physics department of the Orel State Technical University. 6. By Order no. 383 of 14 December 2006, the president (ректор) of the Orel State Technical University convened a university-wide conference for the election of the university’s academic senate (ученый совет), its standing governing body. The date of the conference was fixed for 26 December 2006. According to the Regulation on the Composition of the Academic Senate of the Orel University, candidates to the senate were to be nominated at staff meetings in structural entities by open majority vote (section 3 of the Regulation of 12 December 2006). 7. Unhappy about the fact that neither he nor his colleagues in the physics department had been consulted or informed about the nomination and discussion of candidates to the academic senate, the applicant took the floor at the above public conference and spoke as follows: “... the elected academic senate may not be considered a legitimate body and its decisions likewise cannot be considered legitimate. All of them can be challenged in courts. The problem is that the staff or departments did not know anything about the candidates to the academic senate or of their academic achievements; no one nominated those candidates. This is some kind of a private party that is going on, some people have gathered and elected themselves. My rights have been violated: I, as a member of the faculty, have been excluded from the procedure which is of great importance both for me and for the university as a whole – the election of the academic senate. My rights have been breached, and I will complain to courts about the breaches of my rights. The rights of ordinary university employees, ordinary lecturers, have been breached, too: they were removed from the election to the academic senate, this is discrimination. Any discrimination is a form of war; you have declared war to the people, and sooner or later you will get the results of this war in some way or another, in your own families.” 8. The Orel University sued the applicant in defamation, claiming that his speech had undermined the professional reputation of the university and of its academic senate. The statement of claim was signed by the university president. 9. The Sovetskiy District Court of Orel reviewed the university statutes and regulations on the procedure for the election of the academic senate and took oral evidence from witnesses. Four witnesses testified that the physics department had not held a meeting for the election of delegates to the conference or nomination of candidates to the senate because the delegates and candidates had been elected and nominated at the meeting between the heads of departments. The staff had been informed about the meeting several days in advance and anyone could attend it. 10. By judgment of 27 February 2007, the District Court found the applicant liable for defamation of the Orel University and its academic senate. According to the judgment, the applicant “publicly accused [them] of a violation of applicable laws [and] commission of a dishonest act”. It also held as follows: “The court cannot agree with the respondent party’s argument that the statements [he had] disseminated at the conference were an expression of an opinion. The statements were made in the affirmative form which is apparent from the minutes of the conference of 26 December 2006, the audio recording of the conference, and testimony by witnesses. The witnesses K. and Sh. who had attended the conference on 26 December 2006 explained that they understood the statements as an affirmation which produced a negative impression on them ... Every legal entity has the right to require that a public appraisal of its activities reflect the real state of affairs. Any negative appraisal of the activities of a legal entity affects its reputation and undermines it. The activity of a legal entity can only be potentially successful if its business reputation in the eyes of other organisations and ordinary citizens is maintained at a certain level, especially in a market economy.” 11. The District Court awarded the Orel University 20,000 Russian roubles (RUB) in damages and RUB 2,000 in court fees and directed that the applicant read the refutation at the following university conference. 12. The applicant filed an appeal, relying in particular on Article 10 of the Convention. He also pointed out that the award in respect of damages exceeded his monthly salary. 13. On 11 April 2007 the Orel Regional Court upheld the District Court’s judgment on the merits but partly amended it. Firstly, it considered that the sentences “All of them can be challenged in courts ... Any discrimination is a form of war; you have declared war to the people, and sooner or later you will get the results of this war in some way or another, in your own families.” did not contain any statements about the plaintiff and could not therefore be damaging for its reputation. Secondly, it noted that the sentence “no one nominated those candidates [in the departments]” was actually true because candidates had been nominated at the meetings of department heads. Thirdly, the Regional Court considered it appropriate that the operative part of the District Court’s judgment be read out at the following conference by the president rather than by the applicant. Finally, it offered a more nuanced characterisation of the disputed phrases as a statement of fact: “Mr Kharlamov’s speech contained a statement of fact: the elected academic senate may not be considered a legitimate body and all of its decisions are likewise illegitimate, in other words, the academic senate was unlawfully elected and its decisions are unlawful. This is a verifiable statement. Accordingly, this information is not a subjective opinion of the defendant but a factual allegation.”",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

De Gaetano,"6. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Weinheim. 7. On 18 and 19 July 2005 the applicant, who campaigns against abortion, distributed leaflets in the immediate vicinity of the medical practices of anesthetists Dr M. and Dr R., who run a day clinic. Furthermore, the applicant deposited leaflets in all letterboxes in the vicinity of the day clinic. 8. The front page of the leaflets contained the following text in bold letters: “In the day clinic Dr M./Dr R. [full names and address] unlawful abortions are performed” (“In der Tagesklinik Dr.M./Dr.R. [...] werden rechtswidrige Abtreibungen durchgeführt”) 9. Followed by an explanation set in smaller letters: “which are, however, allowed by the German legislator and are not subject to criminal liability. The attestation of counselling protects the “doctor” and the mother from criminal responsibility, but not from their responsibility before God.” (“die aber der deutsche Gesetzgeber erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe stellt. Der Beratungsschein schützt „Arzt“ und Mutter vor Strafverfolgung, aber nicht vor der Verantwortung vor Gott.“) 10. A box below contained the following text: “According to international criminal law: murder is the intentional “bringing-to-death” of an innocent human being!” (“Sinngemӓβ aus den internationalen Strafgesetzen: Mord ist das vorsӓtzliche “Zu-Tode-Bringen” eines unschuldigen Menschen!”) 11. On the back of the folded leaflet, the applicant quoted the Federal Constitutional Court’s leading judgment with regard to abortion (see paragraph 28 below) as well as a statement by ChristophWilhelm Hufeland, the personal physician of Goethe and Schiller, dealing with the role of doctors in relation to voluntary euthanasia and abortion. He also cited section 12 § 1 of the Law on Conflicts in Pregnancy (see paragraph 27 below) and asked readers to make use of their influence on those performing and assisting in abortions. Furthermore, the following text appeared on the back of the folded leaflet: “The murder of human beings in Auschwitz was unlawful, but the morally degraded NS-State allowed the murder of innocent people and did not make it subject to criminal liability.” (“Die Ermordung der Menschen in Auschwitz war rechtswidrig, aber der moralisch verkommene NS-Staat hatte den Mord an den unschuldigen Menschen erlaubt und nicht unter Strafe gestellt.”) 12. Below this sentence the leaflet referred to the website “www.babycaust.de”. This website, which was operated by the applicant, contained, inter alia, an address list of so-called “abortion doctors”, in which the day clinic and the full names of Dr M. and Dr R. were mentioned. This list was accessible on the website under the link “death or life”/“request for prayers for Germany” (Gebetsanliegen für Deutschland). 13. Dr M. and Dr R. filed a request for a civil injunction against the applicant. They submitted that only legal abortions were performed at their day clinic. The applicant’s leaflet created the erroneous impression that the abortions performed were contrary to the relevant legal provisions. 14. On 22 January 2007 the Ulm Regional Court granted the requested injunction and ordered the applicant to desist from further disseminating in the immediate vicinity of the day clinic leaflets containing the plaintiffs’ names and the assertion that unlawful abortions were performed in the plaintiffs’ medical practice. The Regional Court further ordered the applicant to desist from mentioning the plaintiffs’ names and address in the list of “abortion doctors” on the website “www.babycaust.de”. 15. The Regional Court considered that the statements in the applicant’s leaflet made the incorrect allegation that abortions were performed outside the legal conditions. This was not called into question by the further explanation that the abortions were not subject to criminal liability, as the whole layout of the leaflet was intended to draw the reader’s attention to the first sentence set in bold letters, while the further additions were set in smaller letters with the intent of dissimulating their content. The Regional Court further considered that by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given him any reasons to do so, the applicant had created a socalled “pillory effect”. The allegations raised by the applicant seriously interfered with the plaintiffs’ personality rights. It followed that the applicant’s right to freedom of expression had to cede. 16. The Regional Court considered that the same principles applied to the mentioning of the plaintiffs’ names on the website entitled “babycaust.de”. This implied a connection between the plaintiffs and crimes which were, according to the applicant, comparable to the crimes committed by the Nazis during the Holocaust, and was not covered by the applicant’s freedom of expression and had thus not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs. 17. On 27 October 2007 the Stuttgart Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. It did not find it necessary to examine whether the text of the leaflets had to be qualified as a statement of facts or as an expression of opinion as, in any event, the applicant’s freedom of opinion had to cede. The Court of Appeal confirmed the Regional Court’s assessment that the text in the leaflet implied that the plaintiffs performed unlawful actions. This was not called into question by the further explanations, as the average reader could not be expected to draw the distinction between the act of abortion which was justified under Article 218a § 2 of the Criminal Code and the act of abortion which was merely exempt from prosecution under Article 218a § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 26 below). Seen from a layman’s point of view, the text of the leaflet created the impression that the act of abortion, as permitted by the German legislator, amounted to unlawful homicide, or even to murder. The statement was at the very least ambiguous and had not to be tolerated by the plaintiffs. 18. Even if one were to assume that the leaflet did not contain a wrong statement of facts, the applicant’s freedom of expression had to cede. The Court of Appeal reiterated that freedom of expression conveyed the right to express an opinion even in an offending, shocking or disturbing way. If the expression of opinion was part of a debate on matters of public interest, there was an assumption militating in favour of freedom of expression. However, in the instant case the applicant had created a massive “pillory effect” by singling out the plaintiffs, who had not given the applicant any reason to do so. The performance of abortions was criticised with harsh and rigid words. This was further aggravated by the Holocaust reference. The Court of Appeal further noted that the applicant was not under any specific pressure to express his general criticism of the facilitation of abortions with such a massive violation of the plaintiffs’ personality rights. 19. The Court of Appeal further considered that it had not been necessary for the plaintiffs to submit the exact content of the website, as this website was generally accessible and its content was thus known. It then went on to state: “The content of the webpage is likewise characterised by the fact that the defendant labels individuals, including the plaintiffs, “abortion doctors” and puts their actions on a level with the national-socialist Holocaust and with mass murder. Therefore, the plaintiffs’ claim to compel the defendant to refrain from performing the impugned action must be granted. In that connection, the court refers to its above reasoning. Furthermore, the defendant himself admitted that he had, on the webpage, labelled the plaintiffs “abortion doctors” who are directly or indirectly involved in the performance of abortions.” 20. The Court of Appeal did not grant leave to appeal on points of law. 21. On 12 February 2008 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant’s request for legal aid, on the ground that the applicant’s intended appeal on points of law lacked sufficient prospect of success. 22. On 17 March 2008 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the judgments of the Ulm Regional Court, of the Stuttgart Court of Appeal and against the decision of the Federal Court of Justice. He complained, in particular, that the impugned decisions violated his right to freedom of expression. 23. On 2 July 2009 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, refused to admit the applicant’s complaint for adjudication for being inadmissible, without providing reasons (no. 1 BvR 671/08). This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 18 July 2009. 24. On 8 June 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a Committee of three judges, granted a further constitutional complaint of the applicant dealing with another set of proceedings before the Munich Regional Court and the Munich Court of Appeal (no. 1 BvR 1745/06). In this set of proceedings the courts had granted a civil injunction against the applicant, as the Ulm Regional Court and the Stuttgart Court of Appeal had done in the present case. They had ordered him, inter alia, to desist from disseminating leaflets similar to the ones now in dispute in the immediate vicinity of another gynaecological practice and to desist from publishing on his webpage the information that the doctor in question had performed or assisted in “unlawful” abortions. 25. The Federal Constitutional Court held that the civil injunction had violated the applicant’s right to freedom of expression as provided in Article 5 § 1 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz) because the civil courts had not sufficiently taken into account that the doctor, who had himself publicly announced on the Internet that he performed abortions in his gynaecological practice, had not been confronted with an extensive loss of social reputation as a result of the applicant’s activities. Furthermore, it underlined that the applicant had only blamed the doctor for having carried out allegedly immoral acts, but had not reproached him for having committed acts which were subject to criminal liability or forbidden by law in a wider sense. The Federal Constitutional Court moreover insisted on the fact that the applicant had contributed to a highly controversial debate of public interest and pointed out that, against the factual background of that case, the courts had not sufficiently clarified why and to what extent the special relationship between the doctor and women searching for counselling and medical treatment in the practice might have been jeopardised.",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in the town of Feodosiya, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. 7. On 19 September 2000 the Prosecutor’s office of the NorthWestern Administrative District of the city of Moscow (“the Prosecutor’s office”) opened a criminal investigation into the murder of a businessman. 8. By a decision of 30 October 2000 the Prosecutor’s office ordered the applicant to appear as a witness in this case. Since at that time the applicant resided in the town of Feodosiya in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, the prosecutor also ordered the police to take measures with a view to ensuring the applicant’s attendance. It appears that the relevant summons was sent to the applicant’s only known address in Russia, that of his sister, who resided in Moscow. The applicant denied having received the summons at that time. 9. On 1 and 2 November 2000 the Prosecutor’s office ordered the applicant’s apartment in Feodosiya to be searched, requested the cooperation of the Ukrainian authorities in conducting the search, and also dispatched a team of police officers from the Department of Criminal Investigations of the Moscow City Department of the Interior to Ukraine. In his letter dated 1 November 2000 a prosecutor from the Prosecutor’s office specifically mentioned that he had decided to send two police officers from that Department to Feodosiya for “operative follow-up”. 10. Two Russian police officers, Ti. and Go., were entrusted with this operation and at once sent to Ukraine. It appears that they had secured the support of the head of the Department of Criminal Investigation of the Feodosiya Department of the Interior, lieutenantcolonel Mir., who had apparently instructed his subordinate, police officer Kov., to assist the Russian police officers in their task. The exact mandate of police officer Kov. is unclear. 11. On 3 November 2000 police officer Kov. and the two Russian police officers, Ti. and Go., located and arrested the applicant. He was handcuffed and his apartment was searched. The search took place in the presence of the applicant’s mother, B.N., and her neighbours K.M. and P.N. acting as witnesses; it was documented in a report drawn up by Kov. on 3 November 2000. The report stated that the applicant had been given a copy of the report on the day of the search. 12. According to the applicant, after the search he remained in the custody of the Ukrainian and Russian police, who the next day escorted him to a local airport. The Russian officers and the applicant took the first flight to Moscow. On arrival, the applicant was formally arrested by the same two officers and detained on suspicion of murder. 13. The applicant submitted a copy of the passenger manifest for Aeroflot flight Su-200 dated 4 November 2000. The document showed that the applicant and police officers Go. and Ti. had travelled on the same flight and occupied seats nos. 5 (Go.), 6 (the applicant) and 7 (Ti.). 14. According to the Russian Government, after the search the applicant had been taken to the Ukrainian police and shortly thereafter had been released. The next day he had bought a ticket and took a flight to Moscow. Two police officers, Ti. and Go., had been tipped off about the applicant’s decision to buy a ticket and managed to buy tickets for the same flight. When the applicant arrived at a Moscow airport, he had been arrested by Ti. and Go. and brought before an investigator from the Prosecutor’s office. 15. The Ukrainian Government did not submit their own version of these events. 16. After the events of 3 and 4 November 2000 the applicant’s parents made a number of complaints to various Ukrainian officials and bodies about the actions of the Ukrainian policemen and requested assistance from the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in repatriating the applicant to Ukraine from Russia. 17. More specifically, on 25 November 2000 the applicant made a criminal complaint to the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office, alleging abuse of power and the unlawfulness of the search, arrest and detention. 18. In response to one of the complaints of the applicant’s parents’, on 8 December 2000 a prosecutor from the Feodosiya Prosecutor’s office initiated administrative proceedings regarding the events of 3 November 2000 against the Ukrainian officials involved. The decision stated that: “... On 3 November 2000 police officers from the Moscow department of criminal investigations arrived at the town of Feodosiya with a warrant to carry out a search at [the applicant’s home address], this decision having been authorised by [a] prosecutor from the Moscow North-Western District. The head of the criminal investigation department of the Department of the Interior ... police lieutenant-colonel Mir., seriously breached the requirements of Article 177 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Ukraine and Article 80 of the Minsk Convention ... according to which contact concerning questions of extradition, criminal prosecution, and the execution of investigatory missions ... is to be made by the Prosecutor General’s offices of the respective parties. He directed his [subordinates] to render assistance [to the Russian police] in carrying out their search. Before the start of the search the Moscow police officers, in the presence of Ukrainian police officers Kov., Ga., and Bol., arrested [the applicant] and handcuffed him: this was confirmed by [the applicant’s parents and witnesses] K.M. and P.N. After the search, a Ukrainian national [the applicant] was apprehended by the Russian police and taken to an unknown location ...” 19. On 9 December 2000 the head of the Feodosiya Department of the Interior, lieutenant-colonel Mir., issued order no. 478, in which he reprimanded police officer Kov. who had taken part in the events of 3 November 2000, for “incorrect and unathorised actions while assisting the police of other states”. 20. On 22 December 2000 the same official from the Feodosiya Department of the Interior issued order no. 501, in which he mentioned that the initial authorisation given to police officer Kov. had only included the instruction “to locate [the applicant] and indicate that location to the police officers from Moscow”. 21. By a letter dated 30 December 2000 the Ukrainian authorities informed the applicant’s mother that police officer Kov. had been reprimanded and that the question of the disciplinary liability of lieutenantcolonel Mir. would be decided when he returned from holiday. 22. On 22 January 2001 a prosecutor from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office wrote a letter to the applicant’s father and informed him that they “had requested legal assistance [from the Russian authorities] in resolving [the applicant’s complaint] about his unlawful arrest ... and his ... subsequent transfer to [Russia]”. By the same letter the applicant’s father was informed that the applicant’s complaint about unlawful actions on the part of the Ukrainian policemen had been forwarded to a prosecutor’s office for further investigation. 23. By a letter dated 23 April 2001, in response to one of the complaints from the applicant’s family, a prosecutor from the Feodosiya Prosecutor’s office informed the applicant that the Russian lawenforcement bodies had never formally asked the Ukrainian authorities to conduct a search at the applicant’s address in Ukraine. 24. By a letter dated 7 February 2002 a prosecutor from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s office informed the applicant’s mother that the inquiry into the events conducted by the Prosecutor’s office of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea revealed that officers from both the Russian and the Ukrainian police had been present during the search. The inquiry resulted in the decision to bring administrative proceedings in respect of the Ukrainian police officers who had breached the rules of criminal procedure and the Minsk Convention. 25. In July 2004 the applicant’s mother lodged a complaint about the events of 3 November 2000 with the Feodosiya Town Court. This complaint remained unexamined and on 19 August 2004 it was forwarded instead to the Feodosiya Town Prosecutor’s office. A covering letter signed by the President of the Feodosiya Town Court explained to the applicant’s mother that the complaint had been forwarded to the Prosecutor’s office for examination. 26. The applicant’s parents appealed against the Town Court’s failure to examine his mother’s arguments on the merits before the Appeal Court of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea on 29 November 2004. 27. On 8 December 2004 the President of the Appeal Court explained that on 6 April 2001 an investigator had already refused to bring criminal proceedings in respect of the events of 3 November 2000. 28. It is unclear whether the applicant or his family received a copy of the decision of 6 April 2001. According to a certificate submitted by the Ukrainian Government, the inquiry case file was destroyed owing to expiry of the retention period on 4 May 2006. 29. On 6 December 2000 the applicant lodged a similar complaint with the Russian Prosecutor General, stating that his arrest in Ukraine, subsequent transfer to Moscow and detention in custody by the Russian authorities had been unlawful. 30. On 22 December 2000 an investigator from the Prosecutor’s office questioned officer Ti. in connection with the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest in Ukraine. Ti. stated: “... on 1 November 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the Northern Western Administrative District issued an international request for the search of [the applicant’s apartment] and the applicant’s arrest. Whether it reached the police of Feodosiya I am not sure, but as far as I understood it [did]. In order to execute the request, [officer] Go. and I set off for Feodosiya in possession of a copy of the international request. Having arrived in Feodosiya, we contacted the Department of the Interior of Feodosiya and asked them to be present during the search and other activities within the framework of the request. On 3 November 2000 we attended the search at [the applicant’s] place of residence. The search of [the applicant’s] apartment was conducted by the [Feodosiya] police officers and they drew up a record in this respect. Go. and I were present at the search, but did not actively participate in it. After the search [the applicant] was invited by the [Feodosiya] police officers to the premises of the Department of the Interior for questioning. I was informed by one of the [Feodosiya] police officers that [the applicant] refused to answer any questions concerning the matter. No documents were given either to me or to Go. We were only given a copy of the search record. I knew that we had no right to carry out any operative search activities on the territory of Ukraine, and therefore we did not personally participate in the verbal exchanges with [the applicant]. Having refused to make any statements, [the applicant] was released. The next day, 4 November 2000, the [Feodosiya] policemen – I don’t remember who exactly – informed Go. and myself that [the applicant] had bought a ticket for a plane to Moscow and told us the flight and seat number. At once we set off for the sales office and, since very few tickets were sold, managed to buy tickets for seats close to [the applicant] so as to be able to observe him. The plane was not full, since few people were flying to Moscow. We did not show any interest or attention towards [the applicant]. I don’t know whether [the applicant] recognised us. In any event, had he had any concerns, he could have expressed them to the officers [of the law enforcement agencies in the airport]. [The applicant] did not do this, from which I deduce that he was not aware of either me or Go., nor had he recognised [us], and he expected to go into hiding in Moscow. We knew about the investigator’s decision to arrest [the applicant] because he had no place of residence in Moscow. Upon his arrival in Moscow, we decided to arrest [the applicant] and bring him [to the police station of the Northern Western Administrative District] for investigative actions ...” 31. On 22 December 2000 an investigator from the Prosecutor’s office questioned officer Go. in connection with the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest in Ukraine. Go. repeated word for word the statements given earlier by Ti. 32. By a decision of 26 December 2000 an investigator from the Prosecutor’s office rejected the applicant’s complaint on the grounds that the applicant had travelled to Moscow of his own free will and had been detained on arrival in accordance with domestic law. The prosecutor relied principally on the evidence given by the two Russian police officers, who explained that they had happened by mere chance to be on the same plane to Moscow as the applicant. They denied that they had taken an active part in the events in Ukraine and stated that the applicant had been released after the search and had then bought a plane ticket to Moscow on his own. The officers had been tipped off by an undisclosed source within the Ukrainian police and had managed to buy tickets for the same flight, “sitting not very far from the applicant’s seat”. On arrival in Moscow the officers arrested the applicant in the airport terminal and took him to the investigating authorities. 33. On 28 December 2000 an investigator from the Prosecutor’s office questioned the applicant in connection with the circumstances of his arrest in Ukraine. The applicant stated: “... I was arrested on 3 November 2000 in the town of Feodosiya, in the Krym Region. The arrest was carried out by five police officers from the Feodosiya Town Police and two other police officers, who I later learned were from Moscow. Once the policemen had identified me I was handcuffed. Thereafter they conducted a search of my home. I was shown a search warrant signed by the Prosecutor from the Northern-Western Administrative District of Moscow but no other documents were provided. After the search I was brought to the police station in Feodosiya. I was not shown any documents justifying my arrest. I was refused a phone call. After that I was transported to hotel “Sailor” in Feodosiya where the policemen from Moscow were staying and where I was handcuffed to a radiator. We spent about an hour in the hotel but after that I was taken to the police station because the hotel manager objected to the presence of three men in a room designed only for two. The rest of the night I spent in an office belonging to the police, attached by handcuffs to the radiator. The next morning the policemen from Moscow took me to the passport office of Feodosiya Police Station to collect my ID card and thereafter we went by car to the airport. At the airport I was in the car with the policemen from Feodosiya. The policemen bought a ticket in my name. Then we took flight 200 from Simferopol to Moscow. Before boarding we went through the customs and border control. As we were passing it, my handcuffs were removed and the policemen showed their licences to use special devices. Upon landing in Moscow, the policemen and I did not go through the border and customs control, but went out through [a special] exit. Thereafter I was put in a car and brought to the [police station] of the Northern-Western Administrative District of Moscow ...” 34. In decisions of 16 February and 16 April 2001, in response to further complaints by the applicant, the prosecutor reiterated his earlier findings. 35. By a judgment of 2 September 2002 the Khoroshevskiy District Court of the city of Moscow confirmed the prosecutor’s decision to dispense with criminal proceedings in respect of the allegedly unlawful arrest, search and detention. Among other things, the court referred to the Minsk Convention. 36. The Moscow City Court quashed this judgment on 31 October 2002 on the grounds that the questions of the lawfulness of the applicant’s arrest and the search of his apartment were inextricably linked to the merits of the applicant’s criminal case and could not be decided before the trial court judgment. 37. The case was remitted for fresh examination at first instance and on 27 November 2002 the Khoroshevskiy District Court of Moscow rejected the applicant’s appeal. This judgment was upheld on appeal by the Moscow City Court on 9 January 2003. 38. It appears that the applicant subsequently tried to institute court proceedings in respect of the same questions before the domestic courts. By a judgment of 18 July 2003, given in the applicant’s absence, the Khoroshevskiy District Court of Moscow rejected these arguments. The court held, in particular, that: “... as is apparent from the case file, [the applicant] was arrested by the [police officers] Go. and Ti. on 4 November 2000 at Sheremetyevo airport as ordered by the investigator in his decision of 30 October 2000 ... When questioned in this connection, Go. and Ti. stated that they did not arrest [the applicant] in Ukraine and did not take any part in the search of his apartment, but were simply in attendance. According to the search record of 5 November 2000, the search was carried out in [the applicant’s] apartment in Feodosiya by the local police and the request to carry it out had been made to the Feodosiya prosecutor by the prosecutor of the North Western Administrative District of Moscow. The order to execute the request is defined by the party to which the request is addressed. In accordance with the Criminal Procedure Code of RSFSR and the Law on Operative and Search Activities, the said norms applied only on the territory of RSFSR but they did not contain any rules preventing [investigation and operative] activities on the territory of another state. The [Minsk] Convention sets out the possibility of legal assistance and does not contain a ban on procedural actions on the territory of Contracting States, recognising the lawfulness of such actions if they are authorised by the law of the party to which the request was addressed (Article 6 of the Convention). According to part 3 of Article 8 of the Convention, the presence of officers acting for the requesting party during such actions is possible. In the view of the above, the court considers that the search was carried out fully and properly. In the present case the prosecutor’s office was only competent to assess the events which took place on the territory of Russia, as the norms of the code of criminal procedure of RSFSR only applied there, and any decision concerning events which took place on the territory on Ukraine could only be taken by the competent body in Ukraine and the corresponding investigation could only be initiated upon a request from the party to which the request was addressed, that is to say Ukraine. However, no such request was ever made, and, as is apparent from the letter from the Feodosiya prosecutor, the request to bring a criminal case in this connection had been refused ...” 39. According to the applicant, he received only a copy of the judgment on 28 July 2003 and tried to appeal against it on 30 July 2003. His request for restoration of the time-limits for appeal, submitted on 31 October 2003, was refused by the Khoroshevskiy District Court of Moscow on 19 November 2003 for the applicant’s failure to justify the filing of the appeal outside of the ten days’ statutory time-limit. The Moscow City Court upheld the decision of 19 November 2003 on 13 January 2004. 40. After the Court had communicated the case to the Russian Government on 30 November 2005, police officers Ti. and Go. wrote explanatory reports to their superiors dated 13 March 2006 concerning the events of 3 and 4 November 2000, with the following content: “... After the search had been carried out, [the applicant] went to the Police Department along with [the Ukrainian police officials] to give The next day officer Go. and I departed for Moscow by air. We were told by one of the Ukrainian police officers that [the applicant] had bought a ticket to Moscow; we managed to buy tickets for the same flight. Upon arrival in Moscow, after going through customs and border control in the airport terminal, we ... approached [the applicant and arrested him]. No physical or psychological pressure was exercised on [the applicant] ...” 41. At around 9 p.m. on 4 November 2000 an investigator from the Prosecutor’s Office in Moscow drew up a report on the applicant’s arrest, having ascertained that the applicant was wanted on suspicion of murder. The report noted that the applicant had the status of an accused in the case and confirmed that he had been notified of his rights. 42. It appears that the applicant’s detention was first authorised by a decision of 7 November 2000 taken by the District Prosecutor of the Prosecutor’s office in Moscow. The decision stated that the applicant had been detained on 4 November 2000. It further referred to the gravity of the charge against him, the risk of his fleeing or interfering with the course of the investigation, and the fact that he had no permanent residence in the Moscow region. The decision neither specified the term of the applicant’s detention nor commented on the lawfulness of his arrest in Ukraine, his transfer to Moscow and his subsequent detention in custody by the Russian authorities. 43. The detention was subsequently extended by order of the prosecutor on 7 December 2000. The order described the course of the investigation into the case and mentioned the progress achieved so far. More specifically, the investigation identified and located Sm. and Ko., two other persons allegedly directly implicated in the murder of the businessman in question. It also included a number of expert examinations, a forensic examination of the body of the businessman, two ballistic examinations and a dactylographic examination. The investigator had mentioned that he still needed to study the network of the applicant’s and Ko.’s connections and to bring new versions of charges against the applicant, as well as against Sm. and Ko. The order extended the applicant’s detention until 2 February 2001. 44. By order of 23 January 2001 the applicant’s detention was extended until 19 March 2001. It was based on the same reasoning as the detention order of 7 December 2000. 45. On 22 March 2001 the prosecution concluded the investigation and remitted the case for examination on the merits. It does not appear that there was any procedural decision authorising the applicant’s detention between 19 March and 4 April 2001. 46. On 4 April 2001 the Moscow City Court conducted a preliminary examination of the applicant’s case and, without examining the question of the lawfulness of his detention between 19 March and 4 April 2001, further remanded the applicant in custody. No time-limit was indicated. 47. Thereafter the court again extended the applicant’s detention on 24 July, 2 August, 4 September and 17 December 2001 as well as on 1 July 2002, without specifying any time-limit for his detention. All these decisions were taken with reference to the gravity of the charge against the applicant and the fact that the proceedings in the case had not been completed. 48. The applicant and his counsel were not invited to attend the hearing of 1 July 2002. 49. It does not appear that the applicant lodged any complaint about the repeated extension of his detention by the prosecutor or by the court prior to the decision of 1 July 2002. The applicant’s complaints of 1 and 22 July 2002 against that decision were rejected by the Supreme Court on 24 October 2002. 50. According to the applicant, he and his counsel were not invited to attend the hearing of 24 October 2002. However, the Government submitted that the applicant and his counsel had been informed about the hearing of 24 October on 15 October 2002. The applicant’s counsel had not given the appeal court any reasons for her failure to appear, and did not ask for the hearing to be postponed. At the same time, the applicant’s request to attend in person remained unexamined. 51. It appears that on 16 September and 16 December 2002 the trial court extended the applicant’s detention once again. The applicant submits that he challenged these decisions on 17 September and 17 December 2002 respectively but received no reply. 52. According to the Government, the applicant’s appeals against the decision of 16 September 2002 were dated 30 December 2002 and 22 January 2003, whilst the decision of 16 December 2002 was appealed against on 13 January 2003. The Government were unable to specify the reasons for the domestic courts’ failure to examine these appeals. 53. On 22 March 2001 the preliminary investigation was concluded and the prosecutor remitted the applicant’s criminal case to the Moscow City Court for trial. 54. On 4 April 2001 Judge N. listed the case for a hearing on 16 April 2001. 55. On 16 April 2001 the court adjourned the hearing until 21 June 2001. On the latter date the hearing was adjourned until 25 July 2001 since a lawyer for one of the co-accused failed to appear. 56. Judge M. took over the case on 24 July 2001 and scheduled the hearing for 1 August 2001. 57. On 1 August 2001 the court adjourned the case until 2 August 2001, when the case was again suspended until 3 September 2001 because of the failure of some witnesses to appear. 58. On 4 September 2001 the hearing was postponed until 8 October 2001 for the same reasons. 59. By a decision of 8 October 2001 the court fixed the next date of the hearing for 30 November 2001. 60. Between 30 November and 17 December 2001 hearings were held regularly. 61. On 17 December 2001 the case was adjourned on grounds of witnesses’ absence and the need for a psychiatric examination of the applicant. The examination was carried out on 4 April 2002. 62. In July 2002 the case was transferred to Judge Z. The next hearing took place in August 2002, when the case was yet again postponed until 17 October 2002 due to witnesses’ failure to appear. 63. On 30 January 2003 the Moscow City Court convicted the applicant of conspiracy to murder and sentenced him to eight years and six months’ imprisonment. The court did not address the question of the lawfulness of the applicant’s arrest and detention until his arrival in Moscow on 4 November 2000. 64. On 27 November 2003 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment on appeal.","['5', '8']","['5-1', '5-3', '5-4', '8-1']",['5-1-f'],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1989 and 1954 respectively and live in Kazan. 7. On 9 June 2009 the first applicant was arrested in connection with a drug-related offence, and on 10 June 2009 he was detained in custody. 8. On 29 July 2009 a forensic psychiatric examination found that the first applicant was suffering from schizophrenia requiring compulsory psychiatric treatment. 9. On 3 August 2009 the Sovetskiy District Court of Kazan (“the District Court”) extended the first applicant’s detention until 9 September 2009. 10. On 28 August 2009 the District Court further extended the first applicant’s detention until 9 October 2009. On 8 September 2009 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Tatarstan (“the Supreme Court”) upheld the above extension order on appeal. 11. On 15 December 2009 the District Court relieved the first applicant of criminal responsibility, finding that he was mentally incapacitated. The District Court ordered the application of compulsory measures of a medical nature to the applicant and his admission to a general psychiatric hospital (психиатрический стационар общего типа). The District Court further decided that he should remain in custody until the entering into force of its decision and his admission to the psychiatric hospital. 12. On 19 January 2010 the first applicant was admitted to V.M. Bekhterev Republican Clinical Psychiatric Hospital (Республиканская клиническая психиатрическая больница им. Бехтерева – hereinafter “V.M. Bekhterev Psychiatric Hospital”). 13. After attempting to escape from the hospital on 21 April 2010, he was held for a week, until 28 April 2010, in a ward measuring approximately 5 sq. m, with no windows, no ventilation, around-the-clock artificial lighting, and a bucket instead of a lavatory pan, emptied twice every twenty-four hours. 14. On 21 May 2010 the administration of V.M. Bekhterev Psychiatric Hospital submitted a request for the first applicant to be transferred to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision (психиатрический стационар специализированного типа с интенсивным наблюдением). The request was supported by a report of the same date drawn up following an examination of the first applicant by a panel of three of the hospital’s psychiatrists. The report read as follows: “... [The first applicant] suffers from a chronic psychiatric disorder in the form of pseudo-psychotic schizophrenia aggravated by multiple drug addiction. While under compulsory psychiatric treatment, [the latter] systematically breaches hospital rules, surrounds himself with antisocial patients, sets them against hospital personnel, disrupts the work of the department, [and] refuses treatment. [The first applicant] escaped from hospital and incites other patients to do so; [he] smuggles in prohibited items, including [those for] cutting. In view of the foregoing, the panel considers it necessary to recommend changing the form of compulsory medical treatment in respect of the [first applicant] from compulsory treatment in a general psychiatric hospital to [treatment in] a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision.” 15. Basing its decision on the report prepared by the hospital’s psychiatrists, on 4 June 2010 the District Court granted the hospital’s request. The first applicant was not taken to the hearing. His legal guardian (the second applicant) and his lawyer were not informed of the hearing. 16. On 16 June 2010 the first applicant was transferred to Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital under Intensive Supervision (Казанская психиатрическая больница специализированного типа с интенсивным наблюдением – hereinafter “Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital”). 17. On 29 July 2010 the first applicant had a dispute with another mental health patient of Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital during which he hit that patient. 18. On 30 July 2010 the first applicant was isolated and physical restraints were used to attach him to his bed for twenty-four hours. 19. In the meantime, on 17 June 2010 the second applicant appealed against the decision of 4 June 2010. 20. On 30 July 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 4 June 2010 on appeal, because the applicants had not been duly notified of the hearing. The case was remitted for fresh consideration by a different bench. The first applicant remained in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. 21. On 23 August 2010 the District Court again ordered the first applicant’s transfer to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. The first applicant was not allowed to attend the hearing, but the second applicant and the lawyer were present. 22. On 5 October 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 23 August 2010 on appeal, as the hearing had taken place in the first applicant’s absence. The case was remitted for fresh consideration by a different bench. 23. On 25 October 2010 the District Court held an off-site court hearing at the premises of Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. The court once again ordered the first applicant’s transfer to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. Both applicants and the lawyer were present. They submitted that the first applicant’s confinement in the hospital had been unlawful in the absence of a final court decision and asked the court to order an independent forensic medical examination to determine the effect of intensive therapy on his mental condition, but to no avail. The court decided that there was consistent evidence that the first applicant’s disorder persisted and that its aggravation required treatment in a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. 24. In the meantime the second applicant challenged before the prosecutor’s office the lawfulness of the first applicant’s confinement in the specialist psychiatric hospital in the absence of a final court decision on the matter. 25. On 3 November 2010 she received a reply from the Republic of Tatarstan Prosecutor’s Office (no. 12-672-10), acknowledging the unlawfulness of the first applicant’s confinement in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital since 16 June 2010 in the absence of a final judicial decision on his transfer. 26. On 13 December 2010 the first applicant was transferred back to V.M. Bekhterev Psychiatric Hospital. 27. On 24 December 2010 the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 25 October 2010 on appeal. The case was remitted for fresh consideration by a different bench. 28. On 20 January 2011 the District Court decided not to order the first applicant’s transfer to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision, as there was insufficient evidence that he represented any particular threat to himself or society. 29. On 4 March 2011, however, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of 20 January 2011 on appeal and remitted the case for fresh consideration. 30. On 5 April 2011 the District Court again ordered the applicant’s transfer to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. A request for the court to order independent comprehensive medical and psychiatric examinations in respect of the first applicant was dismissed. 31. On 20 May 2011 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 5 April 2011 on appeal. 32. On 9 July 2011 the first applicant was transferred to Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. 33. On 8 June 2011 the District Court extended the application of compulsory measures of a medical nature to the first applicant and his treatment in a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. The court relied on a report of a medical examination of the first applicant, carried out on 10 November 2010 by Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. 34. On 9 August 2011 the Supreme Court quashed the above decision on appeal, having noted that the District Court had failed to obtain the first applicant’s medical file and to address arguments by the second applicant as to the validity of the report drawn up over six months earlier. 35. On 9 September 2011 the District Court, having complied with the instruction of the Supreme Court, extended the application of compulsory measures of a medical nature to the first applicant and his treatment in a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. 36. On 21 October 2011 the Supreme Court quashed the above decision on appeal and remitted the matter for fresh consideration, on account of the absence of a more recent medical report in respect of the first applicant. 37. On 22 November 2011 the District Court, having examined, inter alia, the newly prepared report of 10 November 2011, extended the application of compulsory measures of a medical nature to the first applicant and his treatment in a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision. The request submitted by the second applicant for the court to order an independent forensic psychiatric examination in respect of the first applicant was dismissed. 38. On 10 January 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the above decision on appeal. 39. On 27 May 2011 the second applicant brought a compensation claim on behalf of her son and herself against the Ministry of Finance, alleging that the proceedings concerning the first applicant’s transfer to a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision had been excessively lengthy, having lasted from 21 May 2010 until 20 May 2011 (see paragraphs 14-31 above). 40. On 26 July 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants’ claim as groundless. 41. On 22 September 2011 the Appeal Section of the Supreme Court upheld the above judgment on appeal. 42. On 25 October 2011 the second applicant brought a compensation claim on behalf of her son and herself against Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital for damage incurred as a result of the first applicant being unlawfully confined in the hospital between 16 June and 13 December 2010 (see paragraphs 16-26 above), unlawfully administered intensive therapy in the above period, and unlawfully tied to his bed from 30 July to 31 July 2010 after an incident with another patient (see paragraphs 17-18 above). She also alleged that her son’s correspondence had been censored, that she had been refused access to his medical file, and that the conditions of his confinement had been substandard. 43. On 23 December 2011 the District Court dismissed the applicants’ claim as unsubstantiated. The court established that until October 2010 the administration of Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital had not been aware that the decision of 4 June 2010, pursuant to which the second applicant had been transferred there, had been quashed on appeal. The court held that on 25 October 2010 the first applicant had undergone a medical examination by a medical panel, who had concluded that he needed continued compulsory treatment in that hospital. It held that the first applicant’s somatic state remained satisfactory and that he received medication allowed in the Russian Federation. The court further held that psychiatric patients’ medical documents had only been accessible to hospital medical staff, hospital administration, representatives of supervising health authorities, prosecution and investigation authorities and the court. The remaining aspects of the first applicant’s confinement in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital remained unaddressed by the court. 44. The second applicant appealed against the above decision, noting in particular the domestic court’s failure to address her complaints regarding the conditions of the first applicant’s confinement in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital, the incident involving him being tied to his bed, and censorship of her and her son’s correspondence by the hospital administration. 45. On 6 February 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the above judgment on appeal, without addressing the issues which had remained unexamined by the first-instance court. The hearing was held in public, although the second applicant had not agreed to public disclosure of the first applicant’s medical diagnoses and the contents of her correspondence with him. 46. On 21 November 2012 the District Court granted the application lodged by Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital and changed the form of the first applicant’s compulsory psychiatric treatment from confinement in a specialist psychiatric hospital under intensive supervision to outpatient compulsory monitoring and psychiatrist treatment. 47. On 3 December 2012 the first applicant was discharged from Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. 48. As indicated above, from 16 June to 13 December 2010 and from 9 July 2011 to 3 December 2012 the first applicant was detained in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. 49. The first applicant claimed to have been confined in a ward measuring 20 sq. m with between eleven to thirteen other mental health patients at one time, the majority of whom had suffered from severe psychiatric disorders accompanied with symptoms such as delirium and hallucinations. He claimed to have been confined to the ward for most of the day (except for approximately five hours when inmates were taken to eat, walk or watch TV). 50. The first applicant alleged that there had been no lavatory or sink in the ward. He submitted, in particular, that the inmates had had to use a bucket for a toilet which had been emptied by the hospital staff twice a day and which had caused a disgusting smell in the ward. 51. Shower use had been restricted to once a fortnight. 52. The first applicant’s correspondence with his mother, the second applicant, had been opened and subjected to censorship by the hospital administration. 53. Throughout his stay in Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital the first applicant had been held for treatment in five different wards: ward no. 8 of department no. 1, ward nos. 56 and 57 of department no. 6, ward no. 102 of department no. 8, and ward no. 140 of department no. 12. The dates of the first applicant’s stay in these wards, the size of the wards and the number of patients held with the first applicant are given in the table below: 54. The Government noted with regret that the measurements of the wards where the first applicant underwent inpatient treatment indeed failed to meet the statutory standards, namely a minimum of 7 sq. m per patient in wards of a specialist psychiatric facility (see paragraph 59 below). 55. The Government further noted that the number of beds per ward considerably exceeded the domestic requirement of no more than four per ward (see paragraph 60 below). 56. Throughout his stay in the hospital the first applicant, like all other hospital patients, had been confined to the ward for most of the day. He had been taken out of the ward to undergo medical procedures, consult a psychologist, have a bath, help out at a concert, eat, watch TV and go for a daily walk outside (1.5 hours twice a day during summer and 1.5 hours a day during autumn and winter). 57. All the departments where the first applicant had been confined had separate lavatories, but were not equipped with shower rooms. 58. The Government informed the Court that, in connection with the present application, in October 2012 a committee consisting of representatives of the Republic of Tatarstan Prosecutor’s Office, the Department of Federal Public Health Service and the Department of Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare had inspected Kazan Specialist Psychiatric Hospital. Following this inspection, which confirmed the applicant’s allegations of overcrowding in the wards, the Russian Ministry of Public Health and Social Development granted 4,935,000 Russian roubles to extend building no. 3 of the hospital, so that an additional forty-four beds could be accommodated.","['3', '6', '8']","['6-1', '8-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Koper. 5. On 17 November 1995 the applicant instituted civil proceedings before the Koper District Court concerning the division of joint property. 6. On 24 September 1997 the Koper District Court rejected the applicant’s claim on procedural grounds. The applicant appealed. 7. On 18 February 1998 the Koper Higher Court partially upheld the appeal of the applicant and remitted the case back to the first instance court. 8. On 14 August 2001 the Koper District court issued a partial judgment. Both parties appealed. 9. On 22 October 2002 the Koper Higher Court dismissed the appeals. 10. On 1 March 2007 the Koper District Court issued a judgment concerning the remainder of the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed. 11. On 18 November 2008 the Koper Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal concerning the decision on the main issue. The court however annulled the decision on the costs of proceedings and remitted that issue back to the first instance court. 12. On 18 August 2008 the Koper District Court issued a decision on the costs of proceedings. The applicant appealed. 13. On 18 November 2008 the Koper Higher Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 10 December 2008. 14. On 29 September 2008 the applicant lodged an application for settlement with the State Attorney’s Office with a view to reaching an agreement on just satisfaction on account of the delays in the civil proceedings. 15. On 26 May 2008 the State Attorney’s Office dismissed the applicant’s claim. 16. On 25 November 2009 the applicant, relying on Act on the Protection of the Right to a Trial without Undue Delay (“the 2006 Act”), lodged a claim with the Koper Local Court seeking compensation in the amount of EUR 5,800 for non-pecuniary damage incurred as a result of the length of the civil proceedings. 17. On 25 November 2010 the Koper Local Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. The applicant appealed. 18. On 17 January 2011 the Koper Higher Court upheld the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case back to the first instance court. 19. In the course of proceedings, the State on 5 April 2011 acknowledged the claim of the applicant in the amount of 1,200 EUR. 20. On 16 November 2011 the Koper Local Court gave a judgment. The court found that the applicant’s right to a trial within a reasonable time had been breached and that, in addition to the 1,200 EUR, the State was to pay a further EUR 420 to the applicant for non-pecuniary damages and to reimburse the applicant EUR 275 in respect of costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings. In determining the amount of compensation, the court considered that the applicant had contributed to the duration of the proceedings by amending her claim several times and submitting written observations directly at the hearings which had as a consequence the adjournment of three hearings. Accordingly it deducted 10% from the amount to be awarded. The applicant appealed. 21. On 17 April 2012 the Koper Higher Court partially upheld the applicant’s appeal and modified the decision, ruling that the State was to pay the applicant in total EUR 2,500 as non-pecuniary damages and further EUR 586 in respect of costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings.

The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Iğdır. 5. On 14 January 2005, while the applicant was serving as a conscript in the army, he fell from the roof where he was on guard. Subsequently, he was treated in various civilian and military hospitals. According to a medical report dated 4 May 2005, the applicant was diagnosed as suffering from a left parietal craniotomy and was declared unfit for military service. 6. On 8 July 2005 the applicant applied to the Ministry of Defence for compensation for his injury. 7. Following a tacit dismissal of the claim by the administrative authorities, the applicant initiated compensation proceedings in respect of the injuries he had sustained during his military service before the Supreme Military Administrative Court on 1 November 2005. He sought 20,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (approximately 12,400 euros (EUR)) in respect of pecuniary damage and the same sum in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 8. An expert report dated 4 October 2007 assessed the applicant’s pecuniary damage at TRY 58,384 (approximately EUR 36,260). 9. On 19 October 2007 the applicant asked the court to increase his initial claim via an amendment (ıslah), stating that he had only become aware of the true extent of his pecuniary damage when he had received the expert’s report. 10. On 28 November 2007 the Supreme Military Administrative Court ruled in favour of the applicant and awarded him the full amount of his initial claim in respect of pecuniary damage, namely TRY 20,000. It awarded him a further TRY 12,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage. However, the court dismissed the applicant’s application for an amendment, considering itself bound by the initial claim. The court stated in particular: “The purpose of an amendment is to rectify a procedural act. Having regard to the judgment of the Constitutional Court published in the Official Journal of 4 November 2000, we must conclude that, in civil law, injured persons are entitled to seek additional compensation once an expert report has been issued. However, in the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court, the time-limits of one year [from the date when a claimant becomes aware of the impugned act] and sixty days from the date of referral of the administrative authorities apply. Under section 46(4) of the Supreme Military Administrative Court Act, the amount claimed cannot be rectified once those deadlines have passed. Consequently, the applicant’s amendment claim must be rejected for being out of time ...” 11.

The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Riga. 6. He is currently on trial in criminal proceedings instituted on 30 December 2005 for an attempt to take a bribe, together with A.B. and A.S. At the time the applicant was the head of a division in the Economic Crime Bureau (Ekonomikas policijas birojs) in the Main Police Department in Riga (Rīgas galvenā policijas pārvalde). 7. According to the applicant, during his trial before the appellate court, he learned that an operational investigation (operatīvās uzskaites lieta) had been opened in respect of his co-defendant A.S. 8. According to the Government, on 27 December 2005 the operational investigation had been opened on the basis of information provided by a private person. On 28 December 2005 the relevant authority, the Bureau for the Prevention and Combating of Corruption (Korupcijas novēršanas un apkarošanas birojs – the “KNAB”), had informed the prosecutor’s office about this. On the same date, a Supreme Court judge had authorised the interception of A.S.’s telephone conversations and the prosecutor’s office had authorised an undercover operation (operatīvais eksperiments). On 29 December 2005 the Head of the KNAB had authorised the interception of A.B.’s telephone conversations on the basis of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, and they included conversations with the applicant. On 30 December 2005 the KNAB had informed the prosecutor’s office about the operational measures under the same provision. The Government did not adduce any evidence in this connection. 9. On 22 January 2009 a judge of the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Krimināllietu tiesu palāta), in the context of the criminal proceedings against the applicant, requested information about the operational investigation. 10. On 18 February 2009 a specialised prosecutor, having examined the material in accordance with section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities, replied that the operational investigation had been opened on 27 December 2005. In respect of the applicant, no interception of telephone conversations had been carried out in the context of that operational investigation. However, she noted that “his conversations were recorded if he was speaking to [a person], whose conversations were intercepted in accordance with the Law on Operational Activities”. According to the applicant, he learned about this information during the appellate court hearing on 22 October 2009. 11. On 22 October 2009 the applicant requested the prosecution authorities to review the lawfulness of the operational measures which had been carried out and asked specific questions concerning these measures. 12. On 4 November 2009 the specialised prosecutor replied, among other things, that on 28 December 2008 an undercover operation had been approved on the basis of section 15(3) of the Law on Operational Activities in the context of the operational investigation to record the manner in which the sworn attorney A.S. would proceed upon receipt of 19,500 Latvian lati (LVL), to be handed over to the officials of the economic crime police, to find out whether he would continue arranging for a bribe and to ascertain his possible accomplices. She also noted that the domestic law did not provide for independent judicial supervision of operational activities; such supervision was carried out by the Prosecutor General and specially authorised prosecutors in accordance with section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities. Finally, she noted that the operational investigation measures in respect of the applicant and his co-defendants had not been illegal and that there had been no breaches of the general principles governing operational activities contained in section 4 of that Law. 13. On 6 November 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint about the specialised prosecutor’s reply. 14. On 27 November 2009 a higher-ranking specialised prosecutor rejected the applicant’s complaint. She referred to section 35(1) and section 5 of the Law on Operational Activities. By reference to section 7(5) the prosecutor also explained that the authorities had learned during the interception of telephone conversations of A.S. that an offence was being planned for 30 December 2005 – the act of arranging for and taking a bribe – which would also involve officials from the State Police. In order to prevent further participation of officials in corruption-related offences, a decision was taken to intercept the telephone conversations of A.B. on the basis of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities. The competence of the prosecution authorities did not include examination of whether that or other provisions were compatible with the Latvian Constitution; these issues could be determined by the Constitutional Court. 15. The applicant lodged a further complaint with the Prosecutor General, which was rejected by a final decision of 29 December 2009. With reference to sections 35(1) and 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, it was reiterated that no breaches of that Law had been found. 16. On 29 June 2010 the applicant lodged an individual constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Satversmes tiesa). He alleged that (i) section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities was incompatible with Articles 89 (protection of human rights) and 96 (right to private life) of the Constitution (Satversme) and also with Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention, and (ii) the first and second sentence of section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities were incompatible with Article 89 and the first sentence of Article 92 (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and also with Article 6 § 1 and Article 13 of the Convention. 17. On 16 July 2010 the Constitutional Court initiated proceedings in case no. 2010-55-0106 with regard to the compatibility of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities with Article 96 of the Constitution and Article 13 of the Convention and the compatibility of the first sentence of section 35(1) of that Law with Article 92 of the Constitution alone. The Constitutional Court rejected the remainder of the applicant’s complaint. 18. On 6 September 2010 a judge dismissed the applicant’s request, among other things, to see the case materials, since it was contrary to the procedure laid down in the Law on the Constitutional Court. It was for the judge to take the necessary steps to prepare a case for adjudication (lietas sagatavošana izskatīšanai) in accordance with section 22 of the Law on the Constitutional Court. He also referred to section 22(9), section 24 and 22(2)(1) of the Law on the Constitutional Court (see paragraphs 34-35 below) to explain that the parties were entitled to see the case materials after the decision concerning adjudication had been taken and that it was for the judge to decide which institutions or officials were to be requested to submit additional information or documents. 19. On 5 November 2010 the judge dismissed the applicant’s request to see the written submissions filed by the Latvian Parliament (Saeima) in the proceedings on the grounds that such request had already been dismissed given that these submissions formed part of the case materials. 20. On 2 December 2010 the applicant requested permission to see at least the judge’s preliminary opinion (atzinums par lietas sagatavošanu izskatīšanai) before the preparation of the case was completed and before the preparatory meeting had taken place. The applicant sought the possibility of expressing his opinion on the proceedings and, in particular, on whether or not the case could be decided by means of an oral procedure, which was his preference. 21. On 17 December 2010 the President of the Constitutional Court replied to the applicant that the parties could see the case materials only after the decision concerning adjudication had been taken. That decision had been taken on 14 December 2010. Consequently, the applicant could see the case material. As regards the possibility of the proceedings being conducted orally or in accordance with a written procedure, he explained that this issue was to be determined by the Constitutional Court in accordance with section 22(8)-(10) of the Law on the Constitutional Court. This issue was first to be considered by the relevant judge, then by the President of the Constitutional Court and, subsequently, by all other judges in the preparatory meeting. The parties could express their opinion on this matter after they had seen the case materials. 22. On 21 January 2011 the applicant filed an opinion with the Constitutional Court and noted, among other things, that the case could not be decided through a written procedure and that an oral hearing should be held. He admitted that the written procedure before the Constitutional Court as such did not infringe his rights to be heard, but submitted that it had to be examined in each particular case and that the court was not allowed to reject a request in connection with the gathering of evidence without examining its necessity, significance or procedural legal grounds. 23. On 25 January 2011, in a closed preparatory meeting, the Constitutional Court examined the case materials and found that the documents contained therein were sufficient for the purposes of examining the case by means of a written procedure (sections 22(10) and 281 of the Law on the Constitutional Court). On 26 January 2011 the applicant was informed about this decision and was given 15 days to see the case materials and to give his opinion in connection with them (section 281(2) of the Law on the Constitutional Court). The applicant used this possibility. 24. On 11 May 2011 the Constitutional Court delivered its ruling in case no. 2010-55-0106 and held that the contested legal provisions complied with the Constitution and the Convention. The relevant part reads as follows: “11. ... It follows from the case materials that, on 27 December 2005, the KNAB opened an operational investigation. Interception of the Applicant’s telephone conversations was carried out from 29 to 31 December 2005, that is, for three days under section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 85 – 86). There is no dispute that the Applicant also participated in the telephone conversations which were intercepted. ... 13. The Applicant and the Ombudsman argue that the restriction of rights established in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities is unclear. It is impossible to understand the meaning of ‘to prevent’. Nor can it be understood what preconditions need to be fulfilled in order to take operational measures under the special procedure where immediate action is required. Therefore, the restriction of rights established in the above-mentioned legal provision has not been provided for by a properly adopted law (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 7 – 8, and Vol. 3, pp. 4648). ... 13.2. The Applicant argues that the provisions of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities must be applied only when necessary to prevent serious or especially serious crimes. Consequently, the operational measures contained in this provision cannot be performed for the purpose of detecting (atklāt) a criminal offence. ... The first sentence of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities provides that ... operational activities may be carried out to react immediately to threats of criminal offences as referred to in this provision and [that] corresponding operational measures [may be taken] to prevent these offences. However, the fact that detection of criminal offences has not been mentioned expressis verbis in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, does not exclude the obligation to observe the purpose of operational activities. [The Constitutional Court] can agree with the arguments of Parliament and the KNAB, namely, that when carrying out activities mentioned in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, a criminal offence can be prevented and detected as well. When taking operational measures to prevent criminal offences, some [other] criminal offence may also be detected. For instance, in the case of the taking of a bribe, operational measures may prevent a criminal offence, as well as identifying the persons involved in giving such a bribe. Therefore, it can be concluded that the term ‘to prevent’ in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities includes not only prevention of crime, but also detection of other criminal offences. 13.3. ... [The Constitutional Court] does not agree with the opinion by the Ombudsman that section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities is unclear as it fails to establish preconditions which are necessary to allow immediate action to be taken in the form of operational measures under the special procedure. Section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities establishes two preconditions which allow ... operational measures. First, section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities enumerates specific circumstances ... Operational measures may be taken when required to prevent acts of terrorism, murder, banditry, riots, or other serious or especially serious offences. They are permissible also in circumstances of a real threat to the life, health or property of an individual. [The Constitutional Court considers that] this enumeration ... is exhaustive and sufficiently precise. Consequently, it excludes any possibility of operational measures under the special procedure in relation to the prevention of such criminal offences which are not indicated in the legal provision. Second, operational measures ... may be taken ... only when an immediate action is required. Interpreting this legal provision in conjunction with section 17(3) of the Law on Operational Activities, [the Constitutional Court] concludes that covert interception of non-public conversations is allowed only when [there is] reliable information (pamatotas ziņas) about persons’ involvement in a criminal offence, as well as a threat to important interests of the State, its security or defence. Consequently ... operational measures ... may be taken if [there is] reliable information regarding the involvement of an individual in a criminal offence. Section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities provides for an exceptional procedure, namely, it allows ... immediate operational measures to be taken because any delay might significantly influence their results. Taking into account the seriousness of the offences referred to in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, it is important to provide a timely and effective response to prevent all threats related to such crimes. Section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities establishes the preconditions for its application [with sufficient precision]; consequently, the restriction on the fundamental rights has been established by law. ... 17. The Applicant indicates that section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities does not provide an obligation ... to receive approval by a judge in cases where operational measures are terminated within ... 72 hours (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 26 – 27). 17.1. Sections 7(2) and 7(3) of the Law on Operational Activities establish two procedures for taking operational measures, namely, under the general and special procedures. Such classification is closely related to the nature of operational measures and their impact on the fundamental rights of persons. In the cases established in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, operational measures must be taken under the special procedure as they significantly impinge on the fundamental rights of persons. The Constitutional Court considers that the grammatical wording of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities [does not clearly indicate] whether it is necessary to obtain approval by the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge in cases when operational measures are terminated within ... 72 hours. 17.2. In order to determine the content of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, it must be interpreted in conjunction with other provisions of the same section regulating operational measures to be taken under the special procedure. Section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities contains a reference to section 7(4) setting out the operational measures to be taken under the special procedure. These measures, including monitoring of correspondence and covert interception of non-public conversations, must be taken with the approval of the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge. Although section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities provides for exceptional circumstances where ... immediate action may be taken, it also establishes the obligation ... to obtain the approval of the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge for operational measures under section 7(4). Already when the draft of the Law on Operational Activities was being drawn up ... the need to receive a judge’s approval was emphasised in cases where operational measures would be taken under the special procedure (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 171 and 173). The third sentence of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities indicated that the operational measures had to be discontinued where no approval by a judge was obtained. According to the KNAB, this indication confirms that a judge’s approval must be sought only in cases where operational measures have not been terminated within ... 72 hours (see Case materials, Vol. 3, pp. 45). However, the Ministry of Justice and the Ombudsman indicate that such an interpretation ... would not comply with the essence of the Constitution (see Case materials, Vol. 3, pp. 48 and 54 – 55). Section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities contains no reference to the fact that no approval by the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge is necessary for operational measures to be taken under section 7(4) in the event that it is planned to terminate them within ... 72 hours. Consequently, [the Constitutional Court] cannot agree with the opinion by the KNAB that a judge’s approval does not have to be obtained if operational measures are terminated within ... 72 hours. ... 17.3. ... Consequently, section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities provides that a prosecutor must always be informed of the operational measures taken; this provision also obliges ... [the seeking of] approval by the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge. The restriction established in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities must be regarded as the most lenient measure for fulfilling the legitimate aim because monitoring by a prosecutor and subsequent judicial scrutiny of the lawfulness of operational measures ensures effective protection of the rights of persons. 18. ... It is not possible to agree with the Applicant’s statement to the effect that the infringement of his right is greater than the benefit gained by society. By means of a lawful restriction of a person’s right to respect for his or her private life, the State helps to combat crime and permits ... immediate reaction to threats of criminal offences that are particularly dangerous for society, serving to prevent them and identifying the persons involved. When intercepting non-public conversations in the cases established in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities, the protection of public safety is ensured. Consequently, operational measures taken to prevent criminal offences referred to in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities must be regarded as proportionate and compliant with Article 96 of the Constitution only if approval by the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge has been obtained irrespective of the time when the operational measures are terminated. 19. The Applicant indicates that the [prosecutor’s office] cannot be regarded as an effective remedy in respect of his rights within the meaning of Articles 8 and 13 of the Convention (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 17 – 18). The Constitutional Court has already established in its case-law that [an application to] the prosecutor’s office in Latvia may be regarded as an effective and available remedy, because the status and the role of the prosecutor in the supervision of law secures independent and impartial review of cases in compliance with Article 13 of the Convention (see Judgment of 11 October 2004 by the Constitutional Court in the case No. 2004-06-01. Para 19). In the present case it is necessary to examine whether section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities provides a person with protection compliant with Article 13 of the Convention in cases where the right to the inviolability of private life and correspondence guaranteed in the Convention is infringed. The Constitutional Court concludes that section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities establishes circumstances ... where operational measures may be taken immediately, as well as the procedure in accordance with which this has to be notified to a prosecutor and approval by a judge is to be obtained. However, this provision is not related to the right to an effective remedy under Article 13 of the Convention. Consequently, the compliance of section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities with Article 13 of the Convention must be assessed in conjunction with the first sentence of section 35(1) of that Law, the latter establishing a mechanism for monitoring operational measures and being contested by the Applicant as to its compliance with Article 92 of the Constitution. 20. The Applicant indicates that the first sentence of section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities fails to comply with Article 92 of the Constitution because it has no legitimate aim and it is not necessary in a democratic society. The provision fails to establish a procedure according to which the supervision and monitoring of performance of operational measures would be carried out. In the monitoring of operational measures, the first sentence of section 35(1) of the Law on Operational Activities confers on the prosecutor’s office a broad margin of appreciation (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 20 – 21). 21.1. ... The Constitutional Court has already concluded in paragraph 17 above that [there is] an obligation to request, in any event, the approval of the President of the Supreme Court or a specially authorised judge in relation to operational measures. Consequently, the legislature has established such a regulatory framework for operational measures that requires not only monitoring by a prosecutor but also judicial supervision or at least subsequent judicial scrutiny of the lawfulness of the measures taken and their compliance with the requirements of the law. 20.2. ... The Constitutional Court has already indicated in its case-law that the prosecutor’s office, as a judicial institution, has a twofold nature. On the one hand it is a single, centralised three-level institutional system, under the management of the Prosecutor General, but – on the other – prosecutorial functions are carried out independently and solely by officials of the prosecutor’s office, that is, the individual prosecutors (see Judgment of 20 December 2006 by the Constitutional Court in the case No. 2006-12-01, Para 12.2). ... As to the taking of operational measures referred to in section 7(4) of the Law on Operational Activities, in cases established in section 7(5), ... a prosecutor, that is, the Prosecutor General or specialised prosecutors, must be notified within ... 24 hours (see Kavalieris A. Operatīvās darbības likuma komentāri. Rīga: Raka, 2002, pp. 26). Consequently, the Prosecutor General or specialised prosecutors also supervise the lawfulness of operational measures. Pursuant to section 22(2) of the Law on Operational Activities, operational proceedings (operatīvā izstrāde) are opened by a decision approved by a head or deputy head of the operational activities authority and a prosecutor is informed about this. Consequently, operational measures established in section 7(5) of the Law on Operational Activities ... must be notified to the Prosecutor General or a specialised prosecutor. The Constitutional Court indicates that in the event of receipt of such notice, the public prosecutor must monitor the compliance of the investigative operational measures with the requirements of the law, thus ensuring the observance of the rights of the person concerned. 20.3. The Applicant indicates that the possibility of securing protection for one’s rights is limited in cases where one’s telephone calls are intercepted (see Case materials, Vol. 1, pp. 10, 13, 18 and 22). ... It follows from the afore-mentioned that the Prosecutor General and specialised prosecutors review operational activities and, based on the results of such review, provide an opinion on the lawfulness of operational activities ... Review is necessary for the Prosecutor General and specialised prosecutors to ensure that operational measures have been lawful. However, the effective regulatory framework also establishes judicial supervision, including subsequent scrutiny. Consequently, [the Constitutional Court does not] agree with the opinion that the effective regulatory framework fails to provide independent subsequent scrutiny in respect of operational measures. Pursuant to section 29(3) of the Law on Operational Activities, if in the course of operational activities the rights and interests of persons have been unlawfully infringed and damage has been caused, the obligation of the relevant officials (prosecutor or court) shall be to restore such rights and to compensate for or avert the inflicted pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage in accordance with the law. Consequently, it can be concluded that the Law on Operational Activities establishes the responsibility of the officials of [the relevant body] in the case of any infringement of fundamental rights. ... Consequently, the investigating authority and the court ensure the review of the admissibility of information obtained by means of operational measures. However, the Prosecutor General and specialised prosecutors, by monitoring the conformity of operational activities with the law, as well as the court in carrying out subsequent scrutiny, ensure effective protection of a person’s rights. ...”",['8'],['8-1'],[],['13'],[],[],1

TURKEY,4,Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-4 - Review by a court),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Ledi Bianku;Paul Lemmens,"5. The applicant, who was born in 1992, was detained at the Gaziantep Prison at the time when the application was lodged. 6. On 26 December 2011 the Mersin Magistrates’ Court decided to restrict access to the file regarding an ongoing investigation against a terrorist organisation. 7. On 29 December 2011 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organisation and making its propaganda. 8. On the same day the applicant’s police statement was taken at the Anti-Terror Branch of the Mersin Security Directorate, in the presence of his lawyer. He was mainly questioned about several records of telephone conversations as well as allegations about the burning of vehicles and throwing Molotov cocktails. He was questioned at length about the telephone conversations that had been intercepted. The police read out the transcripts of the telephone conversations and asked the applicant to comment on them. He was further asked questions about the incriminating statements of one of his co-accused. The applicant used his right to remain silent. 9. On 30 December 2011 the Mersin Magistrates’ Court ordered the applicant’s detention on remand. 10. On 16 March 2012 the applicant’s representative lodged an objection against the decision on the applicant’s detention, and requested his release. She also asked the court to lift the restriction of access to the investigation file. On 19 March 2012 the Mersin Magistrates’ Court dismissed the objection, without holding a hearing. The applicant’s representative filed a further objection against that decision. 11. On 26 March 2012 the Mersin Assize Court dismissed the objection on the basis of the case file, without holding a hearing. 12. On 20 April 2012 the Mersin Magistrates’ Court ex officio examined the applicant’s detention on remand on the basis of the case-file and decided to extend it. 13. On 10 September 2012 the Adana public prosecutor filed a bill of indictment against the applicant, accusing him mainly of being a member of a terrorist organisation, making propaganda in its favour, illegal possession of explosives, causing damage to property and having participated in an illegal armed demonstration. 14. On 1 October 2012 the Adana Assize Court accepted the indictment. On the same date the restriction on the investigation file was lifted. 15. According to the latest information in the case file, the proceedings against the applicant are still pending before assize court.",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[],1

TURKEY,3,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life;Respect for private life);Non-pecuniary damage - award,András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Guido Raimondi;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Nebojša Vučinić;Robert Spano,"5. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Istanbul. 6. In a decision of 22 May 2007, which became final on 20 July of that year, the Üsküdar Family Court (Istanbul) authorised the applicant, who was then single, to adopt a child, E., born on 5 November 2003 to Ms S.Ö. Consequently, under Article 314 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code (no. 4721), “Gözüm” was registered as the surname of E. in the register of births and on the child’s identity documents. However, the registrar refused to indicate the applicant’s forename under the heading “mother”, where the name “S.” was retained, this being the forename of the child’s biological mother. 7. On 23 November 2007 the applicant applied to Üsküdar District Court seeking the replacement of the forename “S.” by her own. In her view, the fact that her forename had not been given as that of the mother of her adopted son was both discriminatory and unconstitutional, likely to undermine their personal, family and social development, and thus constituting a violation of, among other provisions, Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. She argued that in relation to single-parent adoptions there was a lacuna in the Civil Code which required the court to make provision for such a situation of its own motion, pursuant to Article 1 of that Code or, failing that, to request a preliminary ruling of the Constitutional Court. 8. On 26 February 2008 the court dismissed the applicant’s request on the ground that it had no legal basis. It found that the Civil Code, in choosing to regulate only two-parent adoptions – those granted to a couple jointly –, intended to treat the legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child as “a biological relationship”, which was not possible in the case of single-parent adoptions, where either a mother or a father was absent. Thus the legal situation obtaining in the present case could not be regarded as unconstitutional. On 14 April 2008 the applicant appealed on points of law. 9. On 15 March 2009, when those proceedings were still pending, a new regulation entered into force entitled “Regulation on the implementation of mediation services for the adoption of minors” (“the Regulation”), enabling a single adoptive parent to have his or her forename registered in the place of that of the biological parent ... 10. On 5 November 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the decision of the court below in a judgment which made no mention of the legislative reform. 11. On 14 December 2009 the applicant was notified of that judgment. 12. On 9 November 2010 she applied to the registry office for the registration of her forename as that of the mother of E., relying on Article 20 § 4 of the new Regulation. That request was granted on the same day and the record entries concerning the child were consequently amended with immediate effect. ...",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Vilnius. 6. From 2 March 1992 to 2 January 2006 the applicant worked at the Swedish embassy in Vilnius. 7. She began as a receptionist and translator and was later promoted to be cultural, information and press officer. 8. On 9 February 2001 the applicant wrote a letter to the Swedish ambassador in Vilnius. She stated that since 1998 a major change had been made to her work description – she had started managing cultural affairs, enjoying partial independence in decision-making and a high degree of responsibility for financial matters. She was considered as being responsible for certain categories of business because she had to draft budgets for cultural projects. Unfortunately, up to that point no adjustment in her contract had been made. 9. The contract drawn up by the Swedish embassy in Vilnius on 19 November 2001, which the applicant and the ambassador signed, read as follows: “Work description – Sniege Naku – information officer (cultural affairs, social secretary etc.) Ms Naku’s work description is as follows: - handles cultural and information matters in consultation with the Ambassador and the Cultural Attaché in Riga - programme-maker for visitors from Swedish Government Offices as well as for other Swedish authorities - social secretary – mainly to the Ambassador but if needed also to the Counsellor, First and Second secretary’s - replacement for D.Z. and I.N.” 10. The applicant submitted several letters of recommendation to the Court which were written between 1994 and 2006 by her Swedish colleagues at the embassy, including the ambassador to Lithuania between 1991 and 1994. The letters attested to her loyalty, dedication, communication skills and good working record. The applicant also submitted another letter, signed on 30 June 2011 by her former Swedish colleague, Ms G. F. In the letter Ms G. F. stated that between 2003 and 2004 she had been posted as cultural attaché to the Baltic states, stationed in Riga, but also accredited to Vilnius, where she worked approximately one week a month. Ms G. F. stated that during that time she had worked closely with the applicant and that they had planned and carried out various projects. All the major projects had been cleared with the ambassador. The budgets had been relatively modest. Ms G. F. also stated that for the four years she had worked with the applicant she had never felt that the applicant had made a single payment without asking her, or without clearing them with the ambassador. 11. According to the Swedish Government, in 2003 and 2004 a new routine was introduced at the Vilnius embassy by which diplomatic staff had to take decisions on financial support payments, and the applicant lost her authority to deal with those matters independently. It was around that time that a new ambassador, Mrs M. K., was appointed. 12. The accreditation certificate issued to the applicant by the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry on 6 October 2004 stated that the applicant was “part of the administrative technical staff at the embassy of the Kingdom of Sweden (Švedijos Karalystės ambasados administracinio techninio personalo narė)”. The other page of the certificate stated that the applicant “did not enjoy any diplomatic immunities or privileges (asmens imunitetai ir privilegijos: NĖRA)”. It also said that pursuant to Article 38 § 2 of the Vienna Convention jurisdiction over the applicant was to be exercised so that the functioning of the embassy would not be disturbed (see paragraph 53 below). 13. On 3 November 2004 the applicant and the Swedish ambassador M. K. signed a document entitled “Terms and conditions of employment for locally engaged personnel at the Embassy of Sweden in Vilnius”. The document read that Lithuanian laws applied to the employment relationship between the applicant and the embassy regarding conditions such as the payment of tax, social security contributions, overtime, sick leave, the right to leaves of absence or severance payments. Pursuant to section 17 of that document, Lithuanian legislation was to be complied with as regards dismissal from work and the employer had to have “objective grounds for dismissal”. Under section 18, an employee could be dismissed for committing a criminal act, seriously neglecting his duties, or committing further breaches of the requirements of his duties despite warnings having been given. 14. The applicant was also the chairperson of the trade union for locally employed staff at the embassy, which was registered in 1999. Between October 2004 and June 2005 the trade union made several written complaints to the embassy about working conditions. The letters complained of a deteriorating and oppressive working atmosphere, the confused delegation of tasks, incomplete job descriptions or changes in job descriptions without local employees being consulted, a lack of clear communication, and a lack of trust. The union expressed the view that a collective agreement between the locally employed staff and the embassy could resolve such issues. 15. The applicant’s job description of 21 March 2005, although not signed by either the Swedish ambassador or the applicant, gave her title as “Cultural, Information and Press Officer”, who worked “in cooperation with and under the guidance of the Counsellor for Political Affairs/Cultural Attaché or in relevant matters with the Second Secretary”. The applicant’s functions were described as follows: “Operates, coordinates and assists in cultural/information events and general promotion projects; Coordinates the annual and long-term cultural/information and general promotion planning; Coordinates the cultural and information budget; Operates and assists in matters regarding press, TV and radio; Assists the Second Secretary with the communication strategy; Handles and prepares correspondence and inquiries related to cultural, information and press matters Responsible for the ‘cultural calendar’ on the home page; Prepares and Processes applications for financial and other support; Processes the annual report on culture and other relevant reports; Responsible for the Head of Missions newspapers’ review and certain translations; Prepares and makes drafts of speeches on certain occasions; Acting as interpreter on certain occasions; Responsible for collecting, filing and translating various cultural and other adequate information; Handles customs’ matters, as well as relevant notes, and setting arrangements for other proceedings including transportations of individuals and exhibitions; Setting arrangements for cultural events in cooperation with the Counsellor for Political Affairs/Cultural Attaché for lunches, dinners and receptions, including making guests lists writing invitation, bookings and other general assistance; Responsible for the information material from the Swedish Institute - including ordering, filing and distribution and as well the information room; Responsible for the ‘interpreters’ list’ and the ‘cultural board’; Handles the annual ‘book list’; Accepts and performs other duties assigned by the Head of Mission.” 16. By a letter of 17 May 2005 the Lithuanian State Civil Servants’ Trade Union (Lietuvos valstybės tarnautojų profesinė sąjunga) also wrote to the Swedish ambassador to Lithuania. The letter expressed concern that local personnel at the embassy were treated unfairly. The union also considered that diplomatic immunity in labour relations applied only to diplomats and their families. In contrast, labour relations between a diplomatic representation and staff who were permanent residents of Lithuania were regulated by Lithuanian law. This also flowed from the 1961 Vienna Convention, which did not grant diplomatic immunity from the civil jurisdiction. 17. On 14 July 2005 the ambassador replied to the union that the embassy was “very anxious to be a good employer”. However, the embassy “had not signed, and would not sign, collective agreements. The embassy as a diplomatic representation is subordinated by the Vienna Convention and thus does not have to adhere to the Lithuanian Labour Code”. 18. On 26 July 2005 Swedish radio announced and other media published articles about a report by the Swedish Labour Inspector that locally employed staff at Swedish embassies received less pay and had worse working conditions than their Swedish colleagues. The Swedish trade unions also stated that although there was no lack of legal regulation, locally employed staff would often not assert their rights for fear of losing their job. 19. According to the Swedish Government, in the autumn of 2005 a new post of counsellor for cultural affairs was established at the embassy, which was taken up by a Swedish diplomat, Mr T. S., who became the applicant’s immediate superior. The Swedish Government also stated that according to internal embassy memorandums drafted by T.S. the applicant was a source of conflict at the embassy. There were long but fruitless discussions concerning the applicant’s work description. According to T.S., the applicant ignored his decisions and instructions, took decisions on her own on granting financial support, failed to follow agreed plans and lacked skills in a number of areas. 20. On 8 November 2005 the embassy drafted a new job description for the applicant. She was named “Officer for Cultural and Information Affairs”, and was to handle “cultural matters in consultation with the Counsellor for Cultural Affairs T.S.”. Her functions were essentially identical to those given in the job description of 21 March 2005 (see paragraph 15 above). The same day, the applicant informed the embassy in writing that she did not agree with that job description because it lacked a clear definition of her responsibilities and those of T.S. She expressed a wish to involve a neutral person in negotiations over her working duties. 21. The following day, 9 November 2005, the ambassador presented the applicant with a “Letter of caution”. According to the letter, the ambassador saw no future for the applicant at the embassy, due to the applicant’s “difficulties to cooperate”, “lack of performance”, “constant questioning and arguing over duties to be performed” and “inability to cope with changes in [the] Embassy’s and/or [the applicant’s] own tasks”. The applicant was given two days to hand in her resignation, or the embassy would “take other action”. 22. According to a statement written by one of the applicant’s former Lithuanian colleagues at the embassy, D.K., on 9 November 2005 the applicant was asked to hand over her keys to the embassy and leave the premises immediately. The following day the applicant came to work as usual but was not let into the embassy. According to D.K., he saw the applicant “waiting in terrible cold for around one hour outside until the reception opened for visitors. Then she walked in, sat for a while and then left. The next day she fell seriously ill and never returned [again]”. 23. On 11 November 2005 the applicant went on sick leave. The sick leave certificates, issued by the Central Polyclinic (Centro poliklinika) in Vilnius, confirm that she was on sick leave as of that date. The leave was prolonged on a weekly basis and without interruption until 2 March 2006. At one point during that time, in January 2006, she was admitted for two weeks to Vilnius University Hospital’s neurology unit, where she was diagnosed with reversal ischemic neurological deficit in the vertebrobasilar basin. The applicant was also on sick leave in December 2006 and for some months in 2007. 24. Whilst the applicant was on sick leave, on 21 November 2005, the Lithuanian trade union confederation (Lietuvos profesinių sąjungų konfederacija) organised a protest in front of the Swedish embassy building in Vilnius against the applicant’s dismissal. The protest was covered by news outlets in Sweden. According to a statement by one of the applicant’s former Lithuanian colleagues at the embassy, K.M.P., the local staff of the embassy did not attend the protest for fear of negative repercussions. 25. On 23 November 2005 the Swedish embassy sent a decision to the applicant’s home address which stated that a disciplinary sanction would be imposed on the applicant – dismissal from work for gross misconduct. The ambassador stated that she had been informed on 4 and 9 November 2005 that the applicant had accused her Swedish colleague T.S. of being “unbalanced”, that on several occasions the applicant had breached security rules at the embassy by opening a window on street level that had no bars, and that she had conducted a private meeting at the embassy, which was an unacceptable use of her working time. 26. In written replies of 5 and 8 December 2005, the applicant noted that she had indeed called T.S. “unbalanced” during an employee meeting at the embassy, but that that had been because he had earlier shouted at her and had never apologised. The applicant also stated that staff at the embassy had never signed any safety or security regulations. Lastly, the meeting referred to by the ambassador had concerned asking a cleaning company to come to the embassy, and that such a practice had been begun by Swedish staff and had been used continually during previous years. The applicant noted that she had never received any prior warning of the accusations against her, which were a pretext to get rid of her because of her trade-union activities. 27. On 20 December 2005 the embassy sent a letter to the applicant’s home, stating that the embassy had had confirmation of the applicant’s sick leave from the social insurance office (Sodra), attesting that the applicant had been ill up to 3 December. The applicant was asked to present a continuous or new doctor’s certificate no later than 30 December, including an indication of when she would recover. 28. On 30 December 2005 the Swedish embassy dismissed the applicant from her post, effective as of 2 January 2006. The order referred to Article 136 § 3 (2) of the Lithuanian Labour Code, which permits an employer to terminate an employment contract without giving prior notice to the employee if the latter has committed an act of gross misconduct. The embassy referred to its decision of 23 November 2005 in order to impose such a sanction on the applicant (see paragraph 25 above). The embassy also stated that on 5 December 2005 it had received a sick leave certificate from the applicant that was valid until 3 December, but that no medical certificates had been presented thereafter, despite a written request. According to the applicant’s version of events, and as attested in writing by her former Lithuanian colleague D.K., in November and December 2005 she had kept the Swedish embassy informed of her illness, with her husband also taking sick leave certificates to the embassy in person. An internal embassy memorandum shows that on 5 January 2006 the applicant’s husband had taken a sick leave certificate to the embassy for the period up to 2 January 2006. 29. The applicant’s dismissal was subsequently mentioned on the internet site of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions as one of the mistreatments which had taken place in 2005. The report stated: “the explanation given by [the ambassador], when interviewed by Swedish radio, was that Ms Naku was dismissed for not doing her job properly, but she declined to give further details. However, before the new ambassador took office, Ms Naku had not received any complaints about her work during her fourteen years of service. Meanwhile, [the ambassador] explained to the Baltic Times newspaper ... that, as a diplomatic representation, the embassy did not have to comply with Lithuanian labour legislation, that the tone of trade union letters was rude and that there could not be any collective agreements in a diplomatic mission.” 30. Arguing unlawful dismissal, the applicant brought proceedings against the Swedish embassy in the Vilnius Regional Court. She submitted that “for the last seven years I have been the Head of Culture and information projects at the embassy (pastaruosius septynis metus esu ambasados Kultūros ir informacios projektų vadovė)”, and asked to be reinstated to her former post. She also sought pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. The applicant argued that she had been dismissed while on sick leave, which was a clear breach of Lithuanian law (see paragraph 48 below). She also challenged the allegation that she had committed acts of gross misconduct as the grounds for her dismissal, contrary to what had been suggested by the embassy. Lastly, she noted that as a result of her arbitrary dismissal she had suffered loss of reputation and her health had significantly deteriorated. She stated that she had been destroyed, both psychologically and physically. 31. On 19 May 2006, the Kingdom of Sweden claimed immunity from the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts: “Reply to civil claim – re Mrs Sniege Naku With reference to the Court’s letter/announcement of March 6, 2006, regarding civil case No. 2-1479/41/06, the Swedish Government demands that the plaintiff’s case is refused with reference to acknowledged case law of the Republic of Lithuania (V.Stukonis vs. US Embassy and A.Cudak/Senkevic vs. the Embassy of the Republic of Poland).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 2001 and lives in St Petersburg. 6. In August 2004 the applicant started attending public pre-school educational institution no. 42 (“the nursery school”). His teachers were Ms K., Ms P. and an assistant teacher, Ms Ch. 7. In the spring of 2005 the applicant’s parents noticed a change in his behaviour. In particular, he became nervous and unwilling to go to nursery school. During the summer holidays of that year the applicant’s physiological state significantly ameliorated and his mood returned to normal. However, as soon as he resumed nursery school in September 2005 he again became nervous and frightened of the dark and noises. He resisted going to school and refused to discuss school with his parents or sisters. 8. On 7 November 2005, when picking him up from the nursery school, the applicant’s mother noticed that his eyes were twitching and that he had a bruise on his left temple. The applicant complained that his neck and eyes were aching. The teacher, Ms P., told the applicant’s mother that the children had been given eye drops containing an antibiotic. According to her, one of the children in the class had an eye infection and it was necessary to take preventive measures against its spreading among the children. 9. On 8 November 2005 the applicant was examined by an ophthalmologist, who noted a bruise on his temple. She found no symptoms of any eye infection or disease. She recommended a consultation with a neurologist in order to verify whether the eye tics could have neurological causes. 10. On the same day the applicant started to display mouth tics. 11. On 14 November 2005 the applicant’s mother lodged a complaint with the local department of the Federal Authority for Consumer Protection and the Supervision of Public Well-being. She complained that the teachers at nursery school no. 42 had administered eye treatment to her son without her consent and had used physical force against him. Her son had developed nervous tics as a result. 12. On 15 November 2005 the applicant was examined by a neurologist and was diagnosed with hyperkinesia (a state of excessive restlessness which is manifested in a wide variety of disorders that affect the ability to control motor movement and which is mainly psychological in nature). 13. On 16 November 2005 the applicant’s mother complained to the local department of education about the incident of 7 November 2005 and asked that the applicant be transferred to another nursery school. 14. By a letter of 23 November 2005 the local department of the Federal Authority for Consumer Protection and the Supervision of Public Wellbeing informed the applicant’s mother that the director of nursery school no. 42 had been disciplined for breaching sanitary standards. 15. By a letter of 29 November 2005 the local department of education replied to the applicant’s mother, stating that the facts described in her complaint had been confirmed in part and that the director of the nursery school, teachers Ms K. and Ms P. and medical nurse Ms Pt. had been disciplined. It had been decided to transfer the applicant to another public nursery school. 16. When the applicant learnt that he would not have to return to nursery school no. 42, he was happy and told his parents that he had been mistreated by Ms K. and Ms P. In particular, he had been punished for a failure to sleep during the afternoon sleeping hours. Sometimes he had been made to lie on a folding bed in the toilets. The lights in the toilets had been switched off and the teachers had told him that he would be eaten by rats. The applicant had felt very frightened as he had once seen a rat in the toilets. On other occasions he had been forced to stand in the entrance hall, barefoot and wearing only his underpants, for the entire duration of the sleeping hours. He had been very cold. The applicant had also on occasions been hit on the back with a fist. On one occasion the teachers had taped his mouth shut with sellotape. After he had started to suffocate, he had tried to remove the sellotape. The teachers had then taped his hands behind his back. Some other children had also been subjected to similar punishments. They had been threatened that if they complained to their parents about the teachers they would be punished. 17. The applicant also told his parents in detail about what had happened on 7 November 2005. He had been given eye drops twice. In the morning Ms K. had bent his head back with such force that his neck had ached. In the afternoon, she had sat on the applicant’s legs and tried to force his eyes open with her hands. Frightened, the applicant had resisted. Ms K. had then slapped his face. 18. On 23 November 2005 the applicant’s father was questioned by the police in connection with a complaint lodged by Ms K. and Ms Pt. that he had assaulted them. The applicant’s father stated to the police that his conflict with Ms K. and Ms Pt. had arisen because his four-year-old son had been mistreated by the staff of the nursery school. He denied assaulting them. The criminal proceedings against the applicant’s father were discontinued after one of the nursery school staff members stated in writing that Ms Pt. had attempted to convince her and other staff members to falsely accuse the applicant’s father of assaulting Ms K. and Ms Pt. 19. On 21 December 2005 the local department of education informed the applicant’s mother that the director of nursery school no. 42 had been dismissed. 20. By a letter of 13 March 2006 the local department of education informed the applicant’s father that an internal inquiry had established that teachers Ms K. and Ms P. had made some of the children sleep outside the sleeping quarters. That fact, although denied by Ms K. and Ms P., had been confirmed by assistant teacher Ms Ch. and by the grandmother of one of the children. Ms K. and Ms P. had been disciplined. 21. By a letter of 17 July 2006 the Vice-Governor of St Petersburg informed the applicant’s mother that medical nurse Ms Pt. had been disciplined. 22. On 21 February 2006 the applicant’s mother sued nursery school no. 42 for compensation for the damage sustained by the applicant to his health. 23. On 30 June 2006 the Kirovskiy District Court of St Petersburg approved a friendly settlement agreement between the applicant’s mother and nursery school no. 42. Under that agreement, the nursery school was to pay the applicant’s mother 5,000 Russian roubles (RUB) (approximately 150 euros (EUR)) in compensation for medical expenses. 24. On 29 September 2006 the applicant’s mother complained to the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office about her son’s ill-treatment by the staff of nursery school no. 42. She described the incident of 7 November 2005, complained that during the sleeping hours her son had been occasionally locked in the toilets with the lights off, and submitted that as a result of such treatment he had developed nervous tics. She also submitted that she had not received an adequate response to her complaints to the local department of education and the local department of the Federal Authority for Consumer Protection and the Supervision of Public Well-being. 25. By letter of 27 October 2006 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office informed the applicant’s mother that an inquiry had been opened into her allegations of ill-treatment. It also noted that the local department of education had failed in its obligation under section 9 of the Minors Act to inform the district prosecutor’s office of the applicant’s ill-treatment (see paragraph 134 below). 26. On 2 November 2006 the investigator questioned several of the parents of the children who had attended nursery school no. 42 with the applicant. Some of them stated that their children had never complained about being mistreated by teachers Ms P. or Ms K. Others stated that their children had told them about being locked in the entrance hall or in the toilets, where they had on occasion seen rats. They also confirmed that on 7 November 2005 eye drops had been given to the children without the parents’ consent. 27. Assistant teacher Ms Ch. stated to the investigator that on 7 November 2005 two children had shown symptoms of eye infection. Teacher Ms K. had consulted medical nurse Ms Pt., who had decided to give eye drops to all children in order to prevent the spread of the infection. The parents’ consent had not been obtained. The drops had been given by the teacher herself rather than by the medical nurse. Ms K. had used physical force against those children who had resisted. Many of them had been frightened and had cried. Immediately after that the applicant’s eyes had started twitching. Ms Ch. also stated that both Ms K. and Ms P. had many times made certain children, including the applicant, sleep on folding beds in the toilets or in the entrance hall. Ms K. and Ms P. had often shouted at the children and had punished them by sending them to the toilets. She had once seen a child tied with string to his chair. 28. The investigator also questioned Ms K., who denied mistreating the applicant or other children. She stated that on 7 November 2005 the children had been given eye drops by the medical nurse. The children had submitted to the treatment without any resistance or stress. No physical force had been used against the applicant or other children. The applicant had already had nervous tics before 7 November 2005. 29. On an unspecified date at the beginning of November 2006 the applicant was questioned by the investigator. The applicant’s mother and a psychologist were present during the questioning. The applicant described the incident of 7 November 2005. He also stated that he and some other children had often been made to sleep on a folding bed in the entrance hall or in the toilets with the lights turned off or left standing in the entrance hall with few clothes on. They had been frightened and cold. 30. On 8 November 2006 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal investigation against the teachers of nursery school no. 42, finding no evidence of a criminal offence. The applicant’s parents were not given a copy of that decision. 31. On 12 January 2007 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office cancelled its decision of 8 November 2006 and resumed the preinvestigation inquiry. 32. The investigator then questioned Ms P. and medical nurse Ms Pt., who gave the same testimony as Ms K. 33. During the following year the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office issued two more decisions (on 22 January and 6 July 2007 respectively) refusing to open a criminal investigation against the teachers of nursery school no. 42 on the ground that there was no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed. 34. The applicant’s mother challenged those decisions before the Kirovskiy District Court. However, before the District Court could examine her complaints against the decisions, the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office annulled them (on 20 June and 24 December 2007 respectively) and resumed the pre-investigation inquiry. No investigative measures were performed during this one-year period. 35. On 27 September 2007 the applicant’s medical documents were examined by a child psychiatrist at the request of the applicant’s mother. The psychiatrist found that before November 2005 the applicant had not suffered from any neurological or psychiatric disorders. He had, however, on occasions suffered allergic reactions. The psychiatrist further noted that in 2005 the applicant had been subjected to a prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience at the nursery school. Against the background of that prolonged, traumatic experience, the incident of 7 November 2005 involving the use of violence had served as a trigger for his present neurological disorder. An allergic reaction to the eye drops could have also contributed to the development of the disorder. The psychiatrist concluded that there had been a causal link between the traumatic experience suffered by the applicant in the nursery school from September 2005 to November 2005 and his persistent neurological disorder. 36. On 24 December 2007 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office noted that the pre-investigation inquiry was incomplete and that it was necessary to question the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant and their parents, to obtain an expert opinion on the contraindications and side-effects of the eye drops given to the children, and to question other teachers at the nursery school. 37. On 17 January 2008 the case was transferred to the Kirovskiy district police department for further pre-investigation inquiry. 38. In February 2008 the investigator questioned the parents of some of the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. They stated that they did not have any complaints against teachers Ms P. and Ms K. None of them gave the investigator permission to question their children. 39. The investigator also questioned one of the teachers at nursery school no. 42. The teacher stated that she could not give any useful information. 40. On 29 February 2008 the Kirovskiy district police department refused to open a criminal investigation against Ms P. and Ms K., having found no evidence of a criminal offence. The applicant’s parents were informed about that decision on 4 May 2008 and received a copy of it on an unspecified later date. 41. On 23 May 2008, after being criticised by the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office for delays in the conduct of the pre-investigation inquiry and for its ineffectiveness, the Kirovskiy district police department cancelled the decision of 29 February 2008 and resumed the preinvestigation inquiry. 42. On 11 June 2008, in reply to a complaint by the applicant’s mother, the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office again criticised the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office for delays in the conduct of the pre-investigation inquiry and for its ineffectiveness. 43. On 26 June 2008 the Kirovskiy district police department informed the staff of nursery school no. 42 that criminal proceedings into the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment would not be opened because the prosecution had become time-barred. 44. On 30 June 2008 the Kirovskiy district police department refused to open a criminal investigation into the allegations of ill-treatment, finding no evidence of a criminal offence. On 4 July 2008 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office quashed that decision and ordered a further inquiry. 45. On 11 July 2008 the Kirovskiy district police department refused to open a criminal investigation against Ms K. It found that, although there was evidence that Ms K.’s actions amounted to cruel treatment of minors, an offence under Article 156 of the Criminal Code, the criminal proceedings had become time-barred. 46. On 29 July 2008 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 11 July 2008, finding that the inquiry had been incomplete. It noted that it was necessary to question the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant and with their parents; to establish the seriousness of the damage sustained by the applicant to his health; to obtain and analyse the documents regulating the actions of the staff of public nursery schools; and to investigate Ms P.’s actions. 47. On 9 August 2008 the investigator questioned the father of a child who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. He stated that his son had never complained of being ill-treated by the nursery school teachers. 48. On 11 August and then again on 11 September 2008 the Kirovskiy district police department refused to open a criminal investigation against Ms K. on the ground that there was no evidence of a criminal offence having been committed. Those decisions were cancelled on unspecified dates. 49. In reply to new complaints lodged by the applicant’s mother, on 21 November 2008 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office again criticised the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office for the delays in the conduct of the pre-investigation inquiry and for its ineffectiveness. 50. On 1 December 2008 the investigator questioned the mother of another child who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. She stated that her daughter had never been mistreated by the staff of the nursery school. 51. On 19 January 2009 the Kirovskiy district police department opened a criminal investigation against Ms K. and Ms P. 52. On 4 March 2009 the applicant was granted the procedural status of victim. The applicant’s mother was recognised as his representative. 53. In the course of the criminal investigation, which lasted at least until December 2014, the police department collected the following evidence. 54. On 4 March 2009 the applicant was questioned by the investigator in the presence of his counsel, his mother and a teacher. The applicant stated that Ms K. and Ms P. had often punished him and some other children. In particular, on many occasions they had made him sleep in the toilets and had threatened that he would be eaten by rats. Ms K. had once taped his mouth and hands with sellotape. She had also slapped him on the face when he had refused to open his eyes to receive eye drops. On another occasion Ms K. had splashed paint over his friend’s face because she had not liked his drawings. The applicant also stated that Ms K. and Ms P. had forbidden him from telling his parents about those punishments. 55. On 24 March 2009 the applicant was taken by the investigator to nursery school no. 42, where he repeated his previous statements. In particular, he showed the investigator the spot in the toilets where his folding bed had been placed and the place in the entrance hall where he and other children had been forced to stand wearing only their underwear and Tshirts and keeping their arms up and apart during the entire duration of the sleeping hours. He further showed the investigator where and how he had been bound with sellotape and where and how he had been given eye drops. He also showed the investigator a closet in which he had been locked in the dark. Lastly, he told the investigator that if he did not sleep during the sleeping hours Ms K. and Ms P. would hold his head against the bed until it started to ache. The applicant’s lawyer, the applicant’s mother, a psychologist and a teacher were present during the questioning. 56. On 9 June 2009 the applicant was questioned again. He repeated his previous statements. He also added that Ms K. had hit him on the back. 57. Ms P. was questioned by the investigator on 6 February and 21 May 2009, 23 August 2011 and 13 March 2014. She initially cited her right to remain silent and refused to testify. She then denied ill-treating the applicant or other children. She stated that the applicant had had nervous tics since September 2005. During the last round of questioning she asked that the criminal proceedings be discontinued as time-barred. 58. Ms K. was questioned on 5 February and 22 June 2009 and 13 March 2014. She also initially refused to testify. She then denied illtreating the applicant or other children. She stated that the applicant had had nervous tics since the summer of 2005 and that assistant teacher Ms Ch. had given false testimony against her in revenge for critical remarks she had made in respect of Ms Ch.’s unsatisfactory work. During the last round of questioning she again refused to testify and asked that the criminal proceedings be discontinued as time-barred. 59. On 10 April 2009 medical nurse Ms Pt. was questioned. She stated that she had been the one who had administered eye drops to the children on 7 November 2005 because one of them had had an eye infection. When she had learned from the applicant’s mother that the applicant had eye tics, she had talked to Ms K. and Ms P., who had affirmed that the applicant had had nervous tics before 7 November 2005. She had never seen Ms K. and Ms P. mistreating the children. However, when questioned on 24 October 2011 and 24 July 2012 Ms Pt. stated that she had lied during the previous rounds of questioning about having given the eye drops to the children on 7 November 2005. In fact the eye drops had been given by Ms K. without her (that is to say Ms Pt.’s) permission. She had lied about that fact because she had had felt sorry for Ms K. and had not wanted her to be punished. 60. On 19 June 2009 and 21 October 2010 assistant teacher Ms Ch. was questioned. She stated that on 7 November 2005 Ms K. had given eye drops to the children on the advice of the medical nurse. Ms K. had used physical force against those children who had resisted. Many of them had been frightened and had cried. Immediately after that the applicant’s eyes had started twitching. Ms Ch. also stated that on many occasions she had seen Ms K. and Ms P. make the applicant and some other children sleep on folding beds in the toilets or in the entrance hall. Ms K. and Ms P. had often shouted at the children and had punished them by locking them up in the toilets. She had once seen a child tied with string to his chair. She added that she had never talked to the applicant’s parents except at the nursery school. 61. On 30 June 2009, 24 and 30 August 2011, and 12 and 13 March 2014 the investigator held confrontations between Ms Ch. and Ms P., between Ms Ch. and Ms K., and between Ms Pt. and Ms Ch. They all reiterated their previous statements. 62. In April and May 2009, October and November 2011 and July 2012 the investigator questioned six teachers from nursery school no. 42. They stated that they had never seen Ms K. or Ms P. mistreating the children. Some of them also stated that the applicant had already had nervous tics before the incident of 7 November 2005. One of them stated that assistant teacher Ms Ch. had sometimes taken the applicant home in the evenings because she lived in the same block of flats as the applicant. Ms Ch. had often shouted at the children in the nursery school and the children had been afraid of her. 63. On 21 September 2009 the investigator questioned the former director of nursery school no. 42. She stated that Ms K. and Ms P. had been competent and affectionate teachers who had been appreciated by the children and their parents. She had never received any complaints about them. 64. On 12 December 2011 and 16 July 2012 the investigator questioned the then director of nursery school no. 42, who had taken up that position in December 2005. She gave positive references for Ms P. and Ms K. She stated that she had never seen them mistreating the children or received any complaints from the parents in respect of her. 65. In April, May and September 2009, September and November 2011, and July 2012 the investigator questioned the parents of several children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. Most of them stated that their children had never complained of having been mistreated by Ms K. or Ms P. One of them stated that her son had on occasions been punished by the teachers; in particular he had been made to sleep outside the sleeping quarters, in the changing room. Her son had also told her that he had seen a rat in the toilets. She had, moreover, seen some children carrying heavy folding beds from one place to another upon the instruction of the teachers. Lastly, she stated that her son had told her on 7 November 2005 that Ms K. had used force against the applicant (who had resisted and cried) when administering eye drops to him. Another parent stated that Ms K. had locked her son up in the toilets on two occasions and had once made him sleep outside the sleeping quarters, near the toilets. Another parent stated that her daughter had told her about the applicant and another boy being made to sleep separately from the others. She however did not know the details. 66. Between 16 November and 2 December 2011 the investigator questioned four of the children who had attended the nursery school with the applicant. They all stated that Ms K. and Ms P. had been kind to them and had never mistreated them or other children. 67. The applicant’s mother was questioned on 10 March and 9 April 2009 and on 14 October 2010. She described the applicant’s change in behaviour and mood after he had started to attend nursery school. She described the incident of 7 November 2005 and her son’s subsequent development of nervous tics. She also related a conversation she had had with her son during which he had for the first time told her about being mistreated by Ms K. and Ms P. She also stated that her son continued to suffer from nervous tics and to undergo treatment for them. Lastly, she told the investigator that although Ms Ch.’s sister was her neighbour she did not have any friendly relationship with her. 68. On 24 November 2011 and 28 February 2014 the applicant’s father was questioned. He made similar submissions as the applicant’s mother. 69. On 7 December 2011 and 28 February 2014 the investigator held confrontations between the applicant’s mother and one of those teachers at the nursery school who had already been questioned in November 2011. They both reiterated their previous submissions. 70. On 13 December 2011 and 12 March 2014 the investigator held confrontations between Ms Ch. and one of the teachers of the nursery school. Ms Ch. confirmed her previous submissions, while the teacher stated that Ms P. and Ms K. had never mistreated the children, that Ms Ch. had shouted at the children, that Ms. Ch. had sometimes babysat the applicant and that the applicant had had nervous tics before November 2005. 71. On 17 March 2014 the investigator questioned the applicant’s neighbour who lived on the same landing, who stated that the applicant’s tics had started in November 2005. She also stated that the applicant’s parents were on good terms with Ms Ch.’s sister but that she had not noticed any kind of relationship between the applicant’s parents and Ms Ch. herself. 72. On 12 March 2014 the applicant’s mother produced material from the civil case file and asked that it be included in the criminal case file. In particular, she asked for the inclusion of the written statement by one of the staff members of nursery school no. 42 (see paragraph 18 above) that medical nurse Ms Pt. had attempted to convince her and other staff members to give false testimony against the applicant’s family. On 17 March 2014 the investigator refused the requests, finding that the documents from the civil case file were irrelevant to the criminal case. 73. On 10 April 2009 a panel of psychiatrists and psychologists examined the applicant and issued an expert opinion. They found that the applicant continued to suffer from nervous tics. Given that such tics could have had both organic and neurological causes, it was impossible to establish a causal link between the events of November 2005 and the applicant’s current neurological disorder. Given the applicant’s age at the material time and the time that had passed since the events in question, the applicant could not accurately recall those events. He was therefore psychologically incapable of testifying within the framework of the criminal proceedings. 74. On 9 October 2009 a panel of medical experts examined the applicant’s medical records and issued an expert opinion. They noted that his nervous tics could have had both organic and neurological causes. It was therefore impossible to establish a causal link between the events of September-November 2005 and the applicant’s current neurologic disorder. 75. On 14 January 2011 a panel of experts in psychiatry and psychology examined the applicant and analysed his medical records. When interviewed by the experts, the applicant stated that he wanted to forget about what had happened to him in the nursery school but he was constantly being reminded of those events because of the investigation. He affirmed that his tics were aggravated each time that he remembered, or had to discuss, the treatment to which he had been subjected in the nursery school. The experts confirmed that the aggravation of the tics was indeed related to the applicant’s memories of the nursery school. The experts found that before November 2005 the applicant had not suffered from any psychiatric disorder. There had been a causal link between his nervous disorder and the prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience to which he had been subjected in the nursery school from September to November 2005. Many years later he still continued to suffer from nervous tics. He had therefore suffered damage of medium severity to his health. The experts further noted that the applicant did not suffer from any memory or intellectual disorder and that his intellectual development corresponded to his age; he was therefore capable of understanding and relating the relevant events accurately. However, his ability to remember the events had decreased with time. If in 2006 he had been still capable of remembering the events in question accurately, with the passage of time his memory of the events had become unrealistic and distorted. His statements – both in 2009 and at that current moment – could not therefore be relied upon in the criminal proceedings. Moreover, given that each discussion of the relevant events revived his memories of the traumatic experience and prevented him from moving on, his further participation in investigative measures was inadvisable. 76. On 6 April and 2 November 2011 the investigator questioned a psychiatric expert chosen by the applicant’s mother. The expert stated that she disagreed in part with the expert opinion of 14 January 2011. In her opinion, the applicant had suffered severe damage (rather than damage of medium severity) to his health. 77. On 25 and 26 October and 23 December 2011 and 28 February 2014 the investigator questioned some of the experts who had participated in the expert examinations mentioned above. They confirmed the findings contained in the respective expert opinions. 78. On 11 March 2009 the psychologist treating the applicant stated to the investigator that the applicant had been suffering from a neurological disorder since November 2005. His health had improved as a result of the treatment. 79. On 17 July 2009 the applicant’s mother submitted to the investigator a copy of a medical certificate showing that the applicant did not have any anomalies in the brain. She argued that the certificate proved that the applicant’s neurological disorder was psychological rather than organic in nature. 80. On 11 November 2009 the investigator questioned a child psychiatrist who, after examining the applicant’s medical records, stated that there was a causal link between the traumatic experience suffered by the applicant in the nursery school from September until November 2005 and his persistent neurological disorder. 81. On 22 April 2010 a psychiatrist and a psychologist analysed the applicant’s medical records at the applicant’s mother’s request. They found that in the absence of any anomalies in the applicant’s brain, his neurological disorder could not be organic in nature. It was highly probable that they had been caused by psychological trauma. Given that the nervous tics had appeared for the first time in November 2005, there was a causal link between the ill-treatment in the nursery school to which the applicant had been subjected from September until November 2005 and his nervous tics. Finally, the experts noted that the applicant was of normal intellectual development and did not suffer from any memory or intellectual disorders. His statements to the investigator had been detailed and consistent. There were therefore no reasons to consider that the applicant could not remember the relevant events accurately and was psychologically incapable of testifying within the framework of the criminal proceedings. 82. The investigation was suspended from 2 until 16 September, from 23 until 30 September, from 9 until 12 October, from 15 October until 5 November and from 6 until 11 November 2009; from 15 September until 11 October, and from 22 October until 28 November 2010; from 15 December 2010 until 11 January 2011, from 15 January until 28 March, from 28 until 29 July, from 16 June until 4 August, and from 5 until 6 September 2011; and from 30 December 2011 until 9 July 2012. The decisions to suspend the investigation were taken by the investigator on the basis of medical certificates showing that Ms K. was on maternity leave and could not therefore participate in investigative measures. All those decisions were annulled by the investigators’ superior as unlawful. 83. On 17 July 2009 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms K. and Ms. P., finding that their actions in the period from September to November 2005 amounted to battery or other violent acts causing physical pain and cruel treatment of minors, offences under Article 116 § 1 and 156 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The prosecution of those offences was time-barred. There was insufficient evidence of premeditated infliction of damage of medium severity to health, an offence under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. Moreover, according to the experts, the applicant could not remember the relevant events accurately and was psychologically incapable of testifying within the framework of the criminal proceedings. 84. On 27 July 2009 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 17 July 2009, finding that the investigation was incomplete, and ordered further investigative measures. 85. On 29 August 2009 the applicant’s mother complained to the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office that, despite her having lodged numerous requests, she had still not been given copies of the decisions of 17 and 27 July 2009. 86. On 11 November 2009 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms K. and Ms. P. for the same reasons as those set out in the decision of 17 July 2009. 87. On 25 June 2010 the Kirovskiy District Court found that the decision of 11 November 2009 had been unlawful because the findings contained in that decision had been contradictory. It held, in particular, that in order to resolve those contradictions it was necessary to perform a new psychiatric examination of the applicant. 88. On 19 July 2010 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office quashed the decision of 11 November 2009 and ordered further investigative measures. 89. By a letter of 26 August 2010 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office criticised the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office for the delays and the ineffectiveness of the investigation. On the same day the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office gave instructions to the Kirovskiy district police department as regards further investigative measures to be performed. 90. On 5 December 2011 Ms K. asked the investigator to discontinue the proceedings. She was suspected of inflicting damage to health of medium severity, an offence under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. The statutory limitation period for that offence was six years. The proceedings had therefore become time-barred. On the same day the prosecutor refused Ms K.’s request, finding that the previous expert examinations had yielded contradictory results. It was therefore necessary for a new expert examination to be performed in order to establish the severity of the damage sustained to the health of the applicant. The investigation could not therefore be discontinued. 91. On 15 December 2011 Ms P. also asked the investigator to discontinue investigations as time-barred. On the same day the prosecutor refused the request for the same reasons as those for which Ms K.’s similar request had been refused. 92. On 8 February 2012 the Kirovskiy District Court examined Ms K.’s complaint against the decision of 5 December 2011 and dismissed it. It found that it was necessary for an additional expert examination to be performed in order to establish the severity of the damage sustained by the applicant to his health. If experts were to find that the applicant had sustained severe damage to his health, the limitation period would be ten years and the proceedings would not have become time-barred. 93. On 13 July 2012 Ms K. again asked the investigator to discontinue the investigation because the proceedings had become time-barred. On the same day the investigator refused the request for the same reasons as those above. 94. On 7 August 2012 the investigator found that after 16 June 2011 the investigation had been extended in breach of the procedure and time-limits provided by law. The investigative measures carried out between 16 June 2011 and 9 July 2012 had therefore been unlawful and all evidence collected during that period was inadmissible. 95. On 10 August 2012 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms K. and Ms P., finding that there was insufficient evidence of a criminal offence under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. It noted that only four witnesses had confirmed that illtreatment had occurred: the applicant, the applicant’s mother, Ms Ch. and Ms Pt. (in her statements of 24 July 2012). The experts had found that, because of his young age at the material time, the applicant’s description of the events was unreliable and his further participation in investigative measures was inadvisable. There were therefore doubts about the credibility of his statements. The applicant’s mother’s statements were equally unreliable because she had learned about the events from the applicant. Ms Pt.’s statements of 24 July 2012 contradicted her previous statements and statements by other witnesses. They could not therefore be considered reliable either. The expert opinions establishing a causal link between the alleged ill-treatment and the applicant’s neurological disorder could not serve as evidence of ill-treatment because it was not within the experts’ remit to establish whether or not ill-treatment had occurred. The expert opinions had been made on the assumption that such ill-treatment had indeed taken place. Ms Ch.’s statements therefore constituted the only evidence of such ill-treatment. The investigator considered that those statements were insufficient to prove that ill-treatment had indeed taken place. The investigator further noted that all evidence collected between 16 June 2011 and 9 July 2012 had been declared inadmissible. Given that that evidence did not contain any proof of ill-treatment, it was not necessary to collect it again. 96. The applicant’s parents learned about that decision on 24 August 2012 and received a copy of it on 27 August 2012. 97. On 9 October 2012 the applicant’s mother challenged the Kirovskiy district police department’s decision of 10 August 2012 to discontinue the criminal proceedings before the Kirovskiy District Court against Ms K. and Ms P. On 23 October 2012 the applicant’s mother also challenged that decision before the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office. 98. On 23 November 2012 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office found that the decision of 10 August 2012 had been lawful. 99. On 2 August 2013 the Kirovskiy District Court rejected the complaint lodged by the applicant’s mother on 9 October 2012. It found that the investigation had been thorough and effective. The breaches of procedure committed during the investigation – such as the failure to promptly notify the applicant’s mother about certain procedural decisions taken by the investigator or the investigator’s failure to comply with the prosecutor’s instructions – were insufficiently serious as to warrant the quashing of the decision of 10 August 2012. 100. On 24 December 2013 the St Petersburg City Court quashed the decision of 2 August 2013 on appeal and found that the decision of 10 August 2012 to discontinue the investigation had been unlawful. It found that the investigation had been ineffective. In particular, given that all evidence collected between 16 June 2011 and 9 July 2012 had been declared inadmissible, it was necessary to undertake anew the investigative measures carried out during that period and to carry out further investigative measures. The court also noted that although, according to the experts, the statements that the applicant had given after 2006 were unreliable, the statements that he had given before then could be taken into account in the assessment of evidence. The City Court also criticised the District Court for the delays in the examination of the complaint lodged by the applicant’s mother on 9 October 2012 and the resulting excessive length of the judicial proceedings. 101. On 5 March 2014 the applicant’s mother applied to the investigator, asking that Ms P. and Ms K. be charged with the premeditated infliction of severe damage to health. The investigator refused her request, finding that there was no evidence of the premeditated infliction of severe damage to health. 102. On 18 March 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms P. and Ms K., finding that their actions did not amount to a criminal offence under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. 103. On 20 March 2014 the applicant’s mother challenged that decision before the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office, submitting that the investigation had been incomplete. On 18 April 2014 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office found that the decision of 18 March 2014 to discontinue the criminal proceedings had been lawful. 104. On 23 May 2014 the Kirovskiy District Court held that the decision of 18 March 2014 had been unlawful, finding that the investigator’s assessment of evidence had been selective and that he had disregarded some facts and evidence (such as a bruise on the applicant’s face), some witness statements, and expert opinions. It also found that the investigation had been excessively long. 105. On 9 June 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department annulled the decision of 18 March 2014 and resumed the investigation. After two written requests for a copy of that decision, the applicant eventually received it on 30 June 2014. 106. On 19 July 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms P. and Ms K. The investigator found that although they had indeed given eye drops to the applicant, thereby causing damage of medium severity to his health, there was no evidence of intent to cause such damage. The infliction of damage to health had not therefore been intentional or premeditated. The police department further added that although the applicant had indeed had a bruise on his face, it was not possible to establish how he had received that bruise. The applicant’s testimony was unreliable due to his young age and mental development at the time of his giving it, while the allegations of illtreatment made by the applicant’s mother and by Ms Ch. had been countered by the statements of all other witnesses – namely the staff of the nursery school and the parents of other children – that Ms P. and Ms K. had never mistreated the applicant or other children. The investigator concluded that the evidence collected was contradictory and that it was not possible to resolve that contradiction. Any further investigative measures would be useless. Given that suspects should benefit from any doubt, it could not be found that Ms P.’s and Ms K.’s actions amounted to a criminal offence under Article 112 of the Criminal Code. 107. On 29 August 2014 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office annulled the decision of 19 July 2014, finding that the investigation had been ineffective and incomplete. In particular, the criminal proceedings had been unlawfully discontinued even though it had been established that Ms P. and Ms K. had mistreated the applicant and had caused damage to his health. 108. On 12 September 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms P. and Ms K. for the same reasons as those given in the decision of 19 July 2014. 109. On 15 October 2014 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office annulled the decision of 12 September 2014, finding that the investigator had not complied with the prosecutor’s decision of 29 August 2014. 110. On 10 November 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department discontinued the criminal proceedings against Ms P. and Ms K., repeating verbatim the decision of 12 September 2014. 111. On 4 December 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department again refused to open criminal proceedings against Ms P. and Ms K. under Article 156 of the Criminal Code (cruel treatment of minors), finding that the prosecution had become time-barred. 112. The applicant’s mother several times asked the investigator to declare the expert opinions of 10 April 2009 and 9 October 2009 inadmissible as evidence. She argued in particular that the panel of experts of 10 April 2009 had not included an expert in child psychiatry. The investigator refused the requests made by the applicant’s mother, finding that the expert opinions of 10 April 2009 and 9 October 2009 had been obtained in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and had contained clear findings. 113. The applicant’s mother lodged numerous complaints about the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigation with the Kirovskiy district police department, the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office, the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office, the Prosecutor General and the Kirovskiy and Krasnogvardeyskiy District Courts of St Petersburg. She complained that the investigation had been flawed by delays, in particular on account of the numerous unlawful suspensions of the investigation, and that she had often been denied access to the case file. She also complained that, although sufficient evidence of ill-treatment had been gathered, Ms P. and Ms K. had still not been charged with a criminal offence. She further argued that the applicant had sustained severe damage to his health (rather than damage of medium severity) as a result of the ill-treatment he had suffered. She also challenged the investigator’s refusals to declare the expert opinions of 10 April 2009 and 9 October 2009 inadmissible as evidence. 114. By letters of 16 and 18 November 2011 the St Petersburg prosecutor’s office informed the applicant’s mother that the investigator and the officials of the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office responsible for supervising the case had been disciplined for the delays during the investigation and its ineffectiveness. 115. On 2 December 2011 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office noted that the investigation had been conducted with serious delays and shortcomings. In particular, the investigator had not performed all requisite investigative measures, such as an additional medical examination of the applicant. 116. On 12 January 2012 the Kirovskiy District Court found that it had no authority to assess whether the evidence was sufficient for charges to be brought. It was for the investigator to assess the collected evidence and to decide whether charges were to be brought. 117. On 3 February 2012 the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office found that the investigator’s refusals (see paragraph 112 above) to declare the expert opinions of 10 April and 9 October 2009 inadmissible as evidence had been lawful. 118. On 7 February 2012 the Kirovskiy District Court found that the rights of the applicant’s mother had indeed been breached by the failure to provide her with copies of the numerous decisions to suspend the investigation. However, given that all of those decisions had been annulled, it was not necessary to examine the applicant’s complaint relating to those decisions. Moreover, given that the decisions had been annulled by the investigator’s superiors, the court concluded that those superiors had exercised effective supervision over the course of the investigation. On 18 April 2012 the St Petersburg City Court quashed that decision on appeal for procedural defects. 119. On 13 August 2012 the Kirovskiy District Court found that the investigator had still not organised an additional expert examination of the applicant, even though he had been instructed to do so in August 2010 and again in August 2011. It also found that the applicant’s mother had been unlawfully denied access to some documents in the case file. On 16 October 2012 the St Petersburg City Court quashed that decision on appeal for procedural defects. 120. On 24 August 2012 the Krasnogvardeyskiy District Court of St Petersburg found that the complaints lodged by the applicant’s mother about the delays and the ineffectiveness of the investigation were wellfounded. However, given that on 10 August 2012 the investigation had been discontinued for lack of evidence of a criminal offence, they had to be dismissed. On 15 November 2012 the St Petersburg City Court quashed that decision on appeal. It found that some of the complaints lodged by the applicant’s mother had not been examined, that the decision had been based on certain documents that had not been examined during the hearing and that the court, even though it had found some of the complaints to be wellfounded, had nevertheless dismissed them. 121. On 14 February 2013 the Kirovskiy District Court found that the investigator’s decisions issued between 15 September 2010 and 6 October 2011 to suspend the investigation had been unlawful. The rights of the applicant’s mother had, moreover, been breached by the investigator’s failure to inform her about the suspensions of the investigation. Her complaint that the investigator had intentionally delayed the investigation with the aim of rendering the proceedings time-barred was, however, unsubstantiated. The investigation had been discontinued for lack of evidence of a criminal offence rather than on the ground that the proceedings had become time-barred. 122. On 24 April 2013 the Kirovskiy District Court found that the applicant’s mother had been unlawfully denied access to certain documents in the case file. It however rejected the remainder of her complaints relating to the alleged ineffectiveness of the investigation. In particular, the court established that the investigator had not complied with the prosecutor’s instructions as to additional investigative measures to be performed. However, the prosecutor had later confirmed the investigator’s decision to discontinue the investigation, thereby agreeing that it was no longer necessary to comply with his previous instructions and to undertake the investigative measures in question. The investigator’s actions had therefore been lawful. On 6 August 2013 the St Petersburg City Court upheld that decision on appeal, finding it lawful, well-reasoned and justified. 123. On 17 March 2014 the Kirovskiy district police department replied to the applicant’s mother that all necessary investigative measures had been performed and that all relevant facts had been established. It was therefore not necessary to carry out any further investigative measures. On the same day the Kirovskiy district prosecutor’s office also replied to the applicant’s mother that the investigation had been thorough and complete and that there was no need for any further investigative measures. 124. The applicant is regularly examined by a neurologist. After the initial diagnosis of hyperkinesia on 15 November 2005 (see paragraph 12 above), he was examined by a neurologist on 2 February, 24 April and 10 October 2006 and 26 January, 25 April, and 18 and 22 May 2007. He complained of nervous tics, sleeping difficulties, nervousness and fears. The neurologist noted that the symptoms had been caused by a prolonged, psychologically traumatic experience at the nursery school in 2005. The applicant was prescribed treatment. 125. From September 2007 until June 2008 the applicant followed a course of treatment for nervous tics. 126. On 22 October 2008 the applicant’s medical documents were examined by a child psychiatrist, who found that the applicant continued to suffer from a neurological disorder of medium severity. 127. From March until June 2009 the applicant underwent a new course of treatment for nervous tics. He underwent a further course of treatment between January and April 2010. 128. Further medical certificates stated that in 2014 the applicant was still suffering from a neurological disorder and was following treatment for it.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1991 and lives in Zakan-Yurt, Chechnya. 6. The facts of the case are connected to Isayeva v. Russia, no. 57950/00, 24 February 2005, and Abuyeva and Others v. Russia, no. 27065/05, 2 December 2010. These two applications were lodged by residents of Katyr-Yurt, Chechnya, who alleged that their relatives had been killed or wounded, and that they had suffered injuries and lost their property during the attack on the village from 4-7 February 2000. In the Isayeva case, cited above, the applicant and her relatives were trying to flee the fighting on 4 February 2000 when an aviation bomb exploded near their minivan, wounding the applicant and killing three of her relatives. In the Abuyeva and Others case, cited above, the applicants described how they had been trapped in the village during intense shelling and had tried to leave through what they had perceived to be a safe exit route. The Court has established a number of facts relevant to the present case, which can be summarised as follows. 7. Ever since the start of operations by the Russian military and security forces in Chechnya in the autumn of 1999, the village of Katyr-Yurt, situated in the Achkhoy-Martan district, had been considered a “safe zone”. By the beginning of February 2000 up to 25,000 persons were living there, including local residents and internally displaced persons from elsewhere in Chechnya. In the period leading up to 4 February 2000 the residents of Katyr-Yurt were not informed by the State authorities about the possible advance of illegal fighters into the village, even though such information was available to the military commanders. On 4 February 2000 the village was captured by a large group of Chechen fighters escaping from Grozny. The Russian military forces carried out an assault, using indiscriminate weapons such as heavy, free-falling aviation bombs, artillery, missiles and other weaponry. Although the operation was not spontaneous and involved the use of indiscriminate and highly lethal weaponry, the residents of the village were provided neither with sufficient time to prepare to leave nor with safe exit routes to escape the fighting. The two exits from the village were controlled by the military by means of roadblocks. The residents were allowed to leave through the roadblock on the road leading towards the district centre of Achkhoy-Martan, but the other one, on the road leading towards Valerick, remained closed during most of the fighting. The shelling of Katyr-Yurt continued until 7 February 2000 inclusive (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, §§ 8 and 197-201). 8. The applicant and her family had been living in the village of ZakanYurt, situated about thirteen kilometres from Katyr-Yurt. In November 1999 the applicant turned eight years old. She had lived with her mother, father, two elder brothers and a younger sister. She could remember the events of winter 1999-2000 when the hostilities erupted. On 1 February 2000 a large group of insurgent fighters entered Zakan-Yurt, walking into houses and asking for clothes and food. On the same day airstrikes started. The applicant’s family went into hiding in a cellar. 9. On 2 February 2000 the applicant’s family decided to travel to KatyrYurt, which the applicant’s father described as a “peace zone”. The applicant’s father drove his black Volga car; her mother and brother Magomed sat in front, while the applicant, her sister Madina and brother Ruslan, as well as two cousins, Khava and Luiza Abakarovy, were in the back seat. On the same day they arrived in Katyr-Yurt and stopped in the centre of the village. 10. According to the applicant, they did not know anyone in the village and an unknown man invited them to stay at his house, as did many other villagers. The family stayed with this man for two nights and everything was calm. On the morning of 4 February 2000 airstrikes started, and there were a lot of explosions. The applicant’s family went into the cellar under their host’s house. Many other people also arrived, including relatives and acquaintances from Zakan-Yurt. They stayed in the cellar throughout the day, while the shelling of the village continued. 11. Later in the afternoon the applicant’s father said that it was too dangerous to stay in Katyr-Yurt and that they would drive to AchkhoyMartan. The applicant’s father, mother, two brothers and two cousins, as well as the applicant herself, got into the car. The applicant remembered seeing a lot of people on cars, tractors and on foot trying to get out of KatyrYurt. There were explosions. 12. At some point the applicant lost her conscious awareness of what was happening and found herself lying in the road. Their car was burning. She could see her sister Madina, brother Ruslan and cousin Luisa. They were all alive but wounded and burned. The applicant could not see her parents. An old man brought the applicant into the courtyard of a house. Sometime later the applicant, her sister, brother and cousin were put on a bus. The applicant lost consciousness and woke to find herself in hospital in Urus-Martan. Her legs were covered with plaster, and her face and hands were burned. She also saw her sister Madina in the same room. 13. On 5 February 2000 the applicant and her sister were brought by ambulance to Nazran, Ingushetia. The following morning the applicant did not see her sister and she did not know at that time where her family was. 14. On 4 March 2000 the applicant was discharged from the Nazran hospital, with her legs still in plaster. She was diagnosed with fractures of the left hip and right shin, and thermal burns. The circumstances of the wounding were indicated as “shelling, direct hit on the car in which the family was travelling”. The applicant went to live with her grandmother in Zakan-Yurt. There she learnt that her whole family had died. As a result of the air-strike, the following relatives of the applicant were killed: - Mr Mansur Abakarov, born in 1955, the applicant’s father; - Mrs Khava Zaumayeva, born in 1954, her mother; - Mr Ruslan Abakarov, born in 1987, her brother; - Mr Magomed Abakarov, born in 1985, her brother; and - Mr Madina Zaumayeva, born in 1994, her sister. 15. The applicant’s cousin Ms Khava Abakarova was also killed. 16. In March and April 2000 the Achkhoy-Martan district civil registration office recorded the deaths of the applicant’s mother, father and three siblings which had occurred in Katyr-Yurt on 4 February 2000. The cause of death was recorded as splinter wounds and burns. 17. On 16 September 2000 the prosecutor’s office of the AchkhoyMartan district (the district prosecutor’s office) initiated an investigation into the events of 2-7 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt in response to a complaint by the applicant in the Isayeva case, cited above. 18. On 19 February 2001 the investigation into the criminal case was transferred to the military prosecutor’s office of the North-Caucasus Military Circuit (the military prosecutor’s office). The case file was assigned number 14/00/0004-01. 19. It appears that in 2000-2001 the investigation questioned most of the applicants in application no. 27065/05, as well as other individuals who had been in Katyr-Yurt at the time. 20. At that time the investigation found it established that 43 civilians had been killed and 53 wounded as a result of the operation. 62 individuals were granted victim status in the proceedings. The applicant’s relatives and the applicant herself were not listed among the victims. 21. On 13 March 2002 the military prosecutor’s office terminated the proceedings in criminal case no. 14/00/0004-01. The decision referred to a large quantity of documents and statements from dozens of witnesses, including local residents, servicemen from various units, and commanding officers. The decision also referred to the results of the military experts’ report of 11 February 2002, which established that the actions of officers from the Internal Troops involved in the special operation in Katyr-Yurt on 4-6 February had been appropriate to the circumstances and in line with the applicable legal provisions. On this basis the investigation concluded that command corps’ actions were absolutely necessary and proportionate to the resistance put up by the insurgent fighters. It found an absence of corpus delicti in the actions of the servicemen. By the same decision the victim status of 62 individuals was withdrawn. The individuals in question were to be informed of the possibility of seeking redress through civil proceedings. 22. It appears that the victims were not informed by the prosecutor’s office about the termination of the proceedings and nothing happened until January 2005, when they learnt that the proceedings had been terminated. 23. Between January and March 2005 the applicants in application no. 27065/05 contacted the military prosecutor’s office in writing, seeking information about the progress of the investigation in case no. 14/00/000401. They referred to the circumstances of the deaths and wounding of their family members and asked to be granted formal status of victims in the proceedings. 24. In response to these requests, between January and April 2005 the military prosecutor’s office informed the applicants of the results of the military experts’ report, the termination of proceedings in criminal case no. 14/00/0004-01 and the withdrawal of victim status in 2002. The letters also confirmed that the investigation had established the deaths and injuries of which they had complained and informed them that they could apply to a civil court to obtain compensation. Some of these letters contained the decision of 13 March 2002 as attachment. 25. On 6 June 2005 26 applicants in Abuyeva and Others case lodged a claim with the military court of the North-Caucasus Military Circuit. They complained about the ineffectiveness and incompleteness of the investigation. In particular, the applicants noted that some of their relatives’ deaths had not been recorded by the investigation and that these persons had not been listed amongst those who died in Katyr-Yurt in February 2000. They asked the court to quash the decision to terminate the criminal proceedings and to oblige the military prosecutor’s office to resume the investigation in the criminal case, to grant each of them the status of victim in the criminal proceedings, and to issue them with copies of the relevant decisions. These complaints did not directly refer to the situation of the applicant’s family. 26. The applicants’ request was granted and the case was reopened in 2007 under the number 44/00/0026-05. However, on 14 June 2007 the investigation was closed, with the same conclusions as in March 2002, on the basis of Article 39, part 1 of the Criminal Code. The decision confirmed the deaths of 46 and the wounding of 53 local residents, without listing their names. An additional expert report was produced by the Military Academy of the Armed Forces in June 2007, which found that the actions of the command corps in planning and executing the operation had been reasonable and in line with domestic law. No copy of that report has ever been disclosed to the applicants or submitted to the Court. The decision stated in this respect: “... The actions of the fighters (the occupation of Katyr-Yurt by a group of fighters numbering three to four thousand persons, the fighters establishing strongholds in the houses, [their] fierce resistance and their using local residents as a “human shield”) ... represented a real danger to the lives and health of the local residents, and could have entailed unnecessary losses by the federal forces ... These circumstances required the taking of adequate measures by the command corps in order to prevent the danger of armed assault against the citizens and their lives and property (residents of Katyr-Yurt and military servicemen), in addition to [the need to safeguard] the interests of society and the State which are protected by law (the reinstatement of the constitutional order in Chechnya). After issuing a preliminary notification and giving the civilians a real opportunity to leave the village, the subsequent extermination of pockets of the fighters’ resistance by means of artillery and attack aircraft, employing area-point method (“зонально-объектовый метод”), did not exclude deaths among civilians. At the same time, the use of such means of extermination was consistent with the circumstances and with the measures taken in order to minimise losses among civilians. The actions of the command corps (commanders) during the preparation and carrying out of the special operation aimed at the liberation of Katyr-Yurt between 4 and 7 February 2000 were in line with the requirements of relevant field manuals, internal regulations and instructions, were lawful and did not contain elements of criminally ”. 27. The decision to grant victim status to 95 people was quashed. The military prosecutor of the United Group Alliance in the Northern Caucasus (UGA) forwarded the decision to the head of the Government of Chechnya, asking it to identify the victims’ places of residence and to inform them of the closure of the investigation, as well as the possibility of seeking compensation through the civil courts. 28. The name of the applicant in the present case was not listed among the 95 individuals who had been granted victim status. 29. After discharge from hospital, the applicant had to keep plaster on her legs for three months. Because the hostilities in Chechnya were still ongoing, her relatives took her to the Volgograd Region to continue her treatment. In 2002 the applicant was taken to Norway for treatment for one week. In 2002 her paternal grandmother, with whom she had been living after her parents’ deaths, died. After that the applicant lived with her maternal grandparents in Zakan-Yurt. 30. In their observations of September 2010, the Government stated that in 2001 a witness had told the investigators about the deaths of six people in a Volga car (see Isayeva, cited above, § 56) but their identities were unknown at that time. It was not until the applicant’s questioning in March 2007 (see below) that the investigation obtained this information. 31. In December 2006 a distant relative of the applicant’s took her to a human rights organisation, at her request, where she found out for the first time that a criminal investigation had been opened into the attack at KatyrYurt. 32. On 18 December 2006 the applicant wrote a letter to the military prosecutor of the UGA and informed him about the deaths of her five relatives and the injuries she suffered on 4 February 2000 in Katyr-Yurt. She attached five death certificates and her discharge papers from the Nazran hospital dated 4 March 2000. 33. On 19 March 2007 the applicant was questioned and granted the status of victim in criminal case no. 34/00/0026-05. At that time the applicant was a minor but the questioning took place in the absence of legal guardian or representative. According to the parties, there is no information indicating the establishment of guardianship over the applicant up to the age of majority. 34. She was not informed of the decision to close proceedings of 14 June 2007 (see paragraphs 26–28 above). The Government submitted in their observations that this had been an omission on the part of the investigator which had been due to the large number of victims in the case. 35. As is apparent from subsequent documents submitted by the applicant, the investigation into the attack upon Katyr-Yurt was reopened in September 2012. The investigators commissioned an additional expert report into the lawfulness and reasonableness of the military intervention. Neither party submitted to the Court the decision to commission the expert report, the questions put to the experts, or a copy of the report itself, nor is it clear which documents were made available to the experts. The applicant’s knowledge of and involvement in this procedural step has not been clarified. It appears that the document, as most other documents in the file, has been classified. A summary thereof and summaries of other documents are contained in a twenty-page-long extract from the decision to close the criminal investigation issued by a senior investigator of the Military Investigations Unit of the Investigative Committee in the Southern Federal Circuit on 9 March 2013 (extract dated 16 March 2013). 36. The aforementioned extract opensat that time. According to the text, on the night of 3 to 4 February 2000 a group of between three and four thousand fighters under the command of field commander Gelayev had entered Katyr-Yurt (also spelled Katar-Yurt). They were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine guns, flame-throwers, portable anti-aircraft launchers and armoured vehicles. On 4 February 2000 the head of the operations centre (OC) of the Western Zone Alignment in Chechnya gave orders to block the village to carry out a special operation. By that time, most inhabitants had left the village and others were hiding in their houses. The decision to evacuate the civilians was taken between 7 and 11 a.m. on 4 February. The population had been informed of this possibility through the head of the administration and by means of a loudspeaker device mounted on a helicopter. Following skirmishes on the outskirts of Katyr-Yurt and casualties suffered by the security forces, at 9 a.m. artillery started to carry out pin-point strikes aimed at clusters of fighters in the centre and on the periphery of the village. After sustaining casualties, a reconnaissance group retreated from Katyr-Yurt on the morning on 4 February, following which attack aircraft were called in. Due to the fierce fighting and the artillery and air strikes upon the clusters of fighters, the residents started to leave, and by midday on 4 February “their outflow had become significant”. The extract stated that the special operation had continued for two days, although the strikes continued until 7 February. On the third night [presumably the night of 6 to 7 February] a significant proportion of the fighters, numbering about 800 in all, had left the village under cover of poor visibility and escaped into the mountains; 386 had been killed during the operation. The commanders of the special operation had taken measures to arrange the evacuation of civilians but their plans had been upset by the fighters, especially in the initial stages of the operation. Many residents trying to leave the village had been caught in the crossfire between the fighters and the security forces. Most residents had been killed or injured in the initial stages of the operation, in the central part of the village where the most intense fighting had taken place. No conclusive figure of injured or dead civilians, fighters or security forces was given in the extract. 37. The extract then states that the latest decision to terminate proceedings had occurred on 28 September 2012. That decision was quashed on 9 October 2012 and the investigation was extended until 9 March 2013. 38. The extract goes on to cite statements from various military and civilian witnesses, without indicating their names or ranks or the dates when these statements were taken (see Isayeva, cited above, §§ 42-92). 39. The document also refers to an additional operational-tactical expert report (“дополнительная комиссионная оперативно-тактическая судебная экспертиза”) produced on 24 September 2012 by unnamed “external experts from the military faculty of the Southern Federal University” (“внештатные эксперты факультета военного обучения Южного федерального университета”) based in Rostov-on-Don. As summarised in the extract, the experts’ conclusion did not differ from the findings reached by the previous expert reports commissioned by the investigation (see paragraphs 21-27 above). The expert report is cited as follows: “In early February 2000 the operational situation in the area of the counter-terrorist operation in Chechnya was extremely tense and difficult. ... After the defeat suffered in the plains of Chechnya and in Grozny, [the illegal insurgents] attempted to move into harsh southern mountainous regions where they would be able to take rest and recover, in order to organise further military action. ... A very difficult situation developed in the area covered by the Western Zone Alignment. Their main task was to prevent the illegal insurgents from breaking through from the mountainous areas of Chechnya to the plains, to identify, disarm and detain members of the illegal armed groups, and to destroy them in the event of armed resistance ... ... In early February 2000 reconnaissance information was received about the taking of Katyr-Yurt by a large group of fighters. The exact number of fighters was unknown. In order to prevent any further gathering of the fighters, it was decided to surround the village and carry out a special operation there ... A plan for the special operation was worked out. The plan detailed the detachments responsible for blocking and searching, the order of fire contact in the event of armed resistance by the fighters, the location of the command headquarters and control points ... The artillery targets were established in advance along the lines of the fighters’ possible escape routes from Katyr-Yurt and potential arrival of reinforcements, outside of the village. Two control points (roadblocks) were established at the two ends of the village to ensure the exit of civilians – one towards Achkhoy-Martan and the other towards Valerik. The civilians left the village through the two roadblocks, along ‘humanitarian corridors’. The head of Katyr-Yurt was informed of the decision to carry out a special operation. He requested postponement in order to ascertain the situation with his own resources and to drive the fighters out of the village. The special operation was postponed for one day. However, the following morning the fighters attacked OMON [special police forces] based in Katyr-Yurt and attempted to break through the lines of the security forces. The security forces sustained casualties. As became apparent during the clashes, the fighters were armed not only with firearms, but also with grenades and fire-launchers, large calibre machine guns, mine-launchers and anti-tank rocket launchers. The fighters were well prepared and were able to use artificial and natural hiding places in order to deliver combat in a populated area. The number of fighters greatly exceeded the security forces (by 4-6 times).” 40. The decision goes on to cite the report’s conclusion that the use of fighter jets, artillery and mine-launchers upon fortified positions had been justified and that the refusal to employ them would have resulted in heavy losses among the security forces and failure to achieve the goals as set. Over a period of three days most fighters present in the village were killed (one military unit had reported 386 killed fighters). 41. The report cited military field manuals and concluded that the actions of the commanders had been in full compliance with those acts. The commanders had organised and planned the enforcement of the objectives set. The pin-point air strikes upon previously agreed targets, the direct strikes by artillery and anti-tank rocket launchers, and the tank and anti-tank guns had been directed by forward air controllers and artillery pointers upon clearly established and observed targets. 42. Page 12 of the extract contains the following citation from the decision: “the evidential material in the criminal investigation file ... shows that over 1,000 fighters who entered Katyr-Yurt were armed with automatic firearms, large-calibre machine-guns, grenade-launchers and armoured vehicles; fortified firing points had been established in the captured houses. [In such circumstances] the use of artillery and airborne weapons between 4 and 7 February 2000 was justified ...” 43. As cited in the extract, the experts focused on the use of artillery and aircraft. From the operative military documents referring to the use of artillery it was impossible to discern where and when exactly, and at what targets the artillery had been employed, since all the documents reviewed by the experts were judged by them as either irrelevant to the operation in question or not containing any relevant information. As to the aircraft, they had used aviation bombs and unguided and guided missiles of undisclosed types. The number of aircraft involved and the number and timing of the mission sorties, as well as the number of missiles and bombs used, was not specified. As cited, the report established that during the mission sorties the pilots had received information from the forward controllers, because the missions were taking place in the vicinity of, or within, the populated area. The target selection was done using smoke pods or by reference to clearly identifiable topographical “highpoints”. There was no evidence of provocations by fighters or mistakes in selecting targets. The document went on to state that the identification of targets had occurred on the basis of information received prior to departure, from the forward air controllers during the flight, and from the observed activity. Since their use by illegal insurgents could not be verified, attacks on vehicles were ruled out unless very precise and distinguishable directions had been received from the ground. The aircraft attacked from a height of about two kilometres and from a distance of about two kilometres; from that distance details such as clothing and the presence of firearms could not be distinguished. For that reason, contact with the air controllers was necessary before and after hitting the selected target. 44. In the cited extract, the experts concluded that “such engagement of artillery and aviation munitions practically ruled out the likelihood of casualties to civilians, except those who were with the fighters in houses occupied by the latter”. 45. They further concluded that the “employment of a minimal amount of artillery, the choice of the most accurate target direction possible, and the use of the minimum amount of shells necessary ... guaranteed safety from injuries by splinters both for the civilians and security forces. ... Having examined the criminal investigation file, the experts concluded that the OC of the Western Zone Alignment and the head of the special operation in Katyr-Yurt had taken all possible measures in order to prevent losses among civilians while planning and carrying out the operation”. 46. Turning to the situation of the civilians, the experts judged that they had been able to leave the village along “humanitarian corridors” through two roadblocks. The information about the corridors had been communicated by means of a helicopter and an armoured personnel carrier (APC). The head of the administration had been properly informed of the beginning of the special operation and, at his request, its start had been postponed for a day. The civilians had been informed of the need to evacuate and two roadblocks had ensured safe and unhindered passage. The civilians had been accorded the time necessary for the evacuation and the transport carrying the civilians was able to travel back and forth through the roadblocks. 47. While the report, as cited in the extract, conceded that an unspecified number of civilians had been killed during the operation through the use of weapons under the control of the operation’s commanders, such measures had been in compliance with the appropriate order of decision-taking in the choice of targets and means employed during the special operation. 48. On the basis of this report, the investigator concluded that the measures resulting in civilian casualties had been absolutely necessary within the meaning of Article 39, part 1 of the Criminal Code (as in the previous decisions of 13 March 2002 and 14 June 2007 – see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 159). 49. The extract ended by listing the names of the 47 individuals who had been killed, but Mr Z. M. Isayev (a son of the applicant in the Isayeva case, cited above) was listed twice. It did not contain the names of the applicant’s five family members, nor of her cousin Khava Abakarova (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). Nor did it contain the names of five relatives of applicants 2 and 24 in the Abuyeva and Others case (see Abuyeva and Others, cited above, § 156). The non-exhaustive list of the wounded included the applicant; however no separate list of victims has been drawn up; nor does it appear that a copy of that decision was sent to them. 50. On 26 September 2013 a lawyer representing Mrs Marusa Abuyeva, another victim in criminal investigation no. 14/90/0092-11, appealed to the Grozny Garrison Military Court against the decision of 9 March 2013 to close the criminal investigation and to terminate Mrs Abuyeva’s victim status in the proceedings. The statement of appeal was based on the following grounds: the decision had not been based on the established facts, no proper collection and examination of evidence had taken place and legal classification of the events had been incorrect. 51. Firstly, it was argued that the investigation had failed to establish the following pertinent facts: the number of illegal fighters in Katyr-Yurt; the timing and conditions of the transmission of information about the operation and evacuation of civilians; the purpose of the roadblocks at the two extremities of the village; and the details of the aircraft bombings. As to the number of fighters, the statement of appeal referred to various figures cited in the extract and emphasised the fact that the source of this information had not been identified. Likewise, there was a lack of clarity as to the number of fighters killed, nor were there any indications as to any names, identification procedures etc. The appeal statement also pointed out that the number of the security force personnel involved had not been given; it was therefore difficult to evaluate the numerical superiority of the fighters and the need to employ massive weapons. Furthermore, the victim challenged the statement that the administration and population of Katyr-Yurt had been informed about the operation in advance, pointing to the absence of any clear evidence in the case-file to that effect. Turning to the roadblocks set up by the security forces, the appeal statement pointed out that there were no grounds for concluding that this measure had facilitated the exit of civilians from Katyr-Yurt and reiterated the findings made in this respect by the Court in the judgments in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others cases (both cited above, §§ 194 and 199, accordingly). As to the details of aircraft bombing, it was argued that the investigators had accepted two mutually incompatible versions and no steps had been taken in order to clarify whether the pilots, or the aviation controllers who had coordinated the fire, had been able to observe and distinguish legitimate targets (members of illegal armed groups) from civilians. It was also pointed out that the employment of unguided missiles and free-falling general purpose bombs in any event ruled out the possibility of limiting the impact to the selected targets. 52. As regards the incompleteness of the investigation, it was stressed that the investigators had failed to collect the information necessary to evaluate the threat to the civilian population and the appropriateness of the use of selected weapons and ammunition, and to compile an exhaustive list of victims and damage caused. On the last point, it was emphasised that no list of those who had been killed, both civilians and fighters, had ever been compiled and that the information in this regard remained incomplete. 53. Finally, it was argued that the legal classification of the commanders’ actions had been incorrect and that the application of Article 39 part 2 of the Criminal Code had been unjustified without the prior 54. On 6 December 2013 the Grozny Military Garrison Court examined and dismissed the appeal. The court referred to the conclusions of the expert report of 24 September 2012, according to which the actions of the operational commanders had been in accordance with the relevant field manuals and other instructions and were justified in view of the numerical superiority of the fighters. The court also found that the evidence collected by the investigation justified the conclusions reached as regards each of the points raised by the appeal. As to execution of the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, the court stressed that in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, and in line with the Resolution of the Plenary of the Supreme Court No. 21 of 27 June 2013, the investigation had been reopened in 2012 and a number of relevant steps had been taken. In particular, a new expert report had been commissioned and carried out. The Court’s position on the ineffectiveness of the previous investigation had therefore been taken into account and the failings had been rectified. 55. The victim appealed. In her appeal of 23 December 2013 it was stressed that the breach of procedural obligations under Article 2 in this case had taken on a lasting character. Pointing to the relevant passages in the Isayeva and Abuyeva and Others judgments, both cited above, the appeal argued that the following fundamental defects of the investigation, as identified by the Court, had not been corrected in the new round of proceedings: there had been no independent evaluation of the proportionality and necessity of the lethal force used; no individual liability had been established for the aspects of the operation which had led to civilian losses, and these aspects had not been studied and evaluated by an independent body, preferably a judicial one. It was reiterated that the expert report of September 2012, as cited in the decision of 9 March 2013, had simply repeated the findings of two previous expert reports which had already been examined by the Court. Like the previous two, it had not been based on the pertinent facts of the case. Finally, the important question of the total number of victims had still not been resolved, as demonstrated by the failure to include some of the victims’ deceased relatives in the total. 56. On 6 March 2014 the Rostov Circuit Military Court examined the appeal. During the hearing, the victim’s representative submitted a number of additional points. He concentrated on the relevant precepts of international humanitarian law and the practice of international criminal tribunals which, he argued, should have guided the investigator in his examination of the case. In his view, the decision of 9 March 2013 had failed to take into account the relevant interpretation of these provisions in so far as it concerned the definition of victims as civilians, and the widespread, systematic, indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on them. 57. The Circuit Military Court dismissed the appeals. It found that the Garrison Court had examined all the relevant evidence and had applied a comprehensive and consistent interpretation thereto. At this stage, the judge was unable to analyse the substance of the question of guilt or innocence, or to evaluate the correctness or sufficiency of the evidence collected. The Circuit Court stressed that the victim’s arguments regarding both the incompleteness of the investigation and the failure to take into account the European Court’s binding judgments had been thoroughly examined and dismissed. 58. As is apparent from subsequent documents, the victim’s Supreme Court cassation appeal was unsuccessful. On 25 September 2014 a judge of the Supreme Court refused to accept the request for review, in view of the detailed and well-reasoned decisions of the military courts. The victim’s argument that the legal position of the Court in the new round of proceedings had not been taken into account was judged to be unfounded.","['13', '2']",['2-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Fălticeni. 6. On 31 July 2008, the applicant was driving to Galați accompanied by C.P. in a car registered in the United States of America. At about 7 p.m. they visited a mutual friend, O.C. Shortly thereafter, all three of them returned to his car, which was parked near O.C.’s home. They found it surrounded by three police cars, approximately ten police officers and dozens of curious civilians. 7. The applicant overheard one of the police officers informing his colleagues that they had found out the car registered in America had been involved in that accident in which some pedestrians had been injured. He informed the police officers that he was the owner of the car and denied that he had been involved in an accident. 8. The police officers immediately proceeded to detain the applicant aggressively, without checking his identity papers. Police officer G.S. twisted the applicant’s arm behind his back and hit him in the legs. The blow was so powerful that the applicant had to grab one of the police car’s wing mirrors and window in order to avoid falling down. At the same time he was hit on the head and his mouth was covered because he was shouting for, amongst other things, his identity documents, which were in his car. Police officer I.V.V. also punched the applicant repeatedly. 9. Once he was in the police car, the applicant was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and two police officers, who remained unidentified, continued to hit him. He lost his dentures and eventually fainted. Police officer R.P. travelled in a separate car and police officer M.G. drove the police car in which the applicant was detained. Consequently, the applicant concluded that those two officers could not have hit him. 10. At the police station police officer C.M. removed the handcuffs from the applicant. 11. On 31 July 2008, the applicant was caught speeding and refused to stop his car at a police officer’s request. When the police eventually found his car parked in an area surrounded by blocks of flats, the applicant and his friends became very agitated and the applicant refused to show his identity papers to the police officers. He claimed that he was immune to prosecution because he was an American citizen. 12. The police officers lawfully took the applicant to the police station in order to establish his identity and to fine him for speeding. According to eyewitness statements, the police officers handcuffed the applicant in a stern, but not abusive manner. They confirmed that the applicant and his friends had been verbally abusive towards the police officers. 13. On 1 August 2008, following a request by the applicant, the Galați Forensic Medical Service produced an expert report concluding that the applicant had suffered traumatic lesions which could have been sustained on 31 July 2008. It also concluded that he had suffered an injury to the lower lip and damage to the dental prosthesis next to his upper-right canine as a result of his being struck with a solid object, possibly on the chin. In addition, the skin on the bridge of his nose and the left side of his neck had been scratched by a hard and sharp nail-like object. The bruises located on his left shoulder and below his left clavicle had resulted from being struck with a solid object. The bruise on the inside of his right arm had resulted from finger compression. Also his left forearm and the back of his left hand had been scratched with or by solid sharp objects. The report concluded that the contusion of his thorax together with the bruise below his left clavicle would require, in the absence of any complications, four to five days of medical care in order to heal. The rest of the lesions would require one to two days of medical care to heal and he might have to have the prosthesis next to his upper-right canine repaired. 14. The forensic report stated that on 31 July 2008 the emergency unit of the Galați County Hospital had diagnosed the applicant with cranio-cerebral and thorax trauma, as well as a severe thorax contusion. The thorax X-ray that had been produced on the same date did not show any broken ribs or post-traumatic lung damage. Also the dental emergency unit attached to the same hospital had diagnosed the applicant with a contusion in the chin area as a result of a blow which had damaged the dental work on his upper-right canine. It stated that the repairs to his upper-right canine could require the destruction of his fixed maxillary prosthesis. 15. On 14 August 2008 the applicant underwent an encephalography at the Baia Mare County Hospital. He was advised to rest for ten days on account of anxiety. 16. At the applicant’s request, on 18 August 2008 the Suceava Forensic Medical Service produced a forensic expert report. The report stated that according to a dental specialist, the dental-alveolar lesions suffered by the applicant as a result of the assault of 31 July 2008 would require twentyeight to thirty days of medical care to heal and repair. 17. The forensic report further stated that according to the medical documents presented by the applicant, he had been prescribed treatment with pain killers for five days for his dental-alveolar lesions. In addition, his fixed maxillary prosthesis needed to be repaired as a result of the damage caused to his upper-right canine; the report estimated that the repairs would take thirty days. 18. On 4 August 2008 the applicant brought criminal proceedings against the police officers who had been involved in the incident of 31 July 2008 for violent behaviour. In addition, he requested that those responsible for the impugned events be brought to justice. He claimed that on 31 July 2008 he had been ill-treated by police officers and had suffered physical injuries, including damage to his dental prosthesis. 19. On 11 August 2008 O.C. and A.C., friends of the applicant and C.P., submitted two statements before the Galați Police Department. O.C. stated that when the applicant had returned to his car, police officers had already been waiting for him, claiming that the car had been involved in an accident, even though there had been no visible damage to the car. Although the applicant had attempted to present his identity papers to the police, they had abusively and violently grabbed him and handcuffed him. Subsequently, the applicant had been thrown into a police car and hit until he fainted. When O.C. had attempted to find out what police station the applicant was being taken to, one of the officers had elbowed him in the chest. 20. A.C. stated that on arrival at the police station she had noticed a smell of alcohol on the breath of one of the prosecution witnesses. The witness had been collected by the police officers from the terrace of a restaurant located near the scene of the incident. He had been insulting the applicant on account of his American citizenship. He had admitted that he had been drinking and when he had started becoming aggressive, one of the officers had asked him to leave the room. 21. On 14 August 2008 the investigating authorities heard D.Z. as a witness. He stated that he had seen the applicant park his car at the scene of the incident and run together with C.P. through the blocks of flats. The police had arrived shortly afterwards and waited for the applicant to return. When the applicant had returned the officers had asked him politely to identify himself. The applicant had refused vehemently to identify himself and claimed that the police officers could not touch him because he was an American citizen. As the police officers had been unable to reason with him, they had been forced to immobilise him in order to place him in the police car, which the applicant had almost wrecked. At the same time the applicant had continued to verbally offend the officers and him. He had seen the applicant being placed in the police car; the applicant had not been beaten by the police officers. Moreover, the applicant had not been abused, either physically or verbally, by the police officers at the police station. 22. On 20 August 2008 the investigating authorities heard M.M. and I.P. as witnesses. They both stated that they had seen police officers speak to the applicant and attempt politely to identify him. The applicant had refused to give his identity by shouting that he was an American citizen. The police officers had made several more attempts to politely reason with the applicant and once that had failed they had proceeded to immobilise him and to place him in a police car. Once inside the police car, the applicant had started shouting again, at which point several other bystanders, including M.M., had started to remonstrate with him. Consequently, C.P. had started insulting them. The witnesses further stated that they had not seen the police officers hit the applicant. 23. On an unspecified date C.P. stated before the investigating authorities that on 31 July 2008 when the applicant had been driving to Galați, she had noticed a police car on the road and had seen a police officer make a signal. However, it had not been the correct signal for a motorist to stop. The applicant had not stopped the car but had continued to drive. When they had arrived in Galați she had seen another police car, but the police had not signaled the applicant to stop. 24. On 3 February 2009 the prosecutor’s office attached to the Galați District Court discontinued the criminal proceedings brought by the applicant against the police officers, on the grounds that the police officers had not committed the offences of which they had been accused or that the alleged offences were not provided for by criminal law. It held, on the basis of the police officers’ statements corroborated by the statements of M.M., I.P. and D.Z. that the applicant had repeatedly refused to show the police officers his identity papers, despite warnings that he would be taken to a police station if he failed to provide proof of his identity. The police officers had attempted to take the applicant to the police station, but he had resisted. Consequently, the officers had immobilised him. When they had attempted to place him in the police car, he had continued to resist, physically struggling and being verbally aggressive towards them. The prosecutor’s office further held that the time required for medical care could not be confused with the time required for full recovery. In this connection, it noted that in the applicant’s case the reconstruction work that was needed on his upper teeth would take thirty days. Consequently, the thirty days referred to by the forensic expert report of 18 August 2008 could not be understood to mean days of medical care within the meaning of the law. Lastly, the use of force by the police officers had not been disproportionate and had been aimed solely at immobilising him. 25. The applicant challenged the decision before the superior prosecutor attached to the Galați District Court. He argued that the witnesses who had been heard had committed perjury, probably because they had been influenced by the police. 26. By a final decision of 19 March 2009 the superior prosecutor dismissed the applicant’s challenge. He held, amongst other things, based on the eyewitness statements, that the police officers’ actions had been in response to the applicant’s aggressive and offensive behaviour. Consequently, the police officers had not overstepped their bounds. Also, the number of days of medical care required by the applicant, according to the forensic expert report produced on 18 August 2008, concerned the period required for the reconstruction of his upper dental prosthesis and not the time it would take for the dental-alveolar lesions to heal. 27. The applicant appealed against the decision before the domestic courts. He argued that the authorities had failed to investigate how the injuries attested by the forensic expert reports had been caused. 28. By a judgment of 16 October 2009 the Galați District Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of 3 February 2009. It noted, amongst other things, that according to the forensic expert report of 1 October 2008, the applicant had suffered injuries which required, depending on their severity, one to five days of medical care. In addition, according to the criminal investigation carried out in respect of the case, the police officers who had been involved in the events of 31 July 2008 were R.P., I.V.V., M.G., G.S., C.M. and T.R. as well as two Police Academy students, I.M. and A.I. According to the statements of C.M. and T.R., the applicant had been caught speeding. He had ignored T.R.’s signals to stop and had continued to drive. Consequently, C.M. and T.R. had asked their colleagues to locate and stop the applicant’s car. I.M. had made a second attempt to stop the applicant, but he had ignored the police sirens and the signals to stop. The police officers had searched for the applicant’s car and had eventually found it parked near O.C.’s home. According to the statements of R.P., M.G., I.V.V. and G.S., when the applicant returned to his car he refused the police officers’ request to show his identity papers on the grounds that he was an American citizen and was not subject to Romanian law. Even though he was informed that he had broken the law, he continued to refuse to show his identity papers to the police or to accompany them to the police station. 29. The court also noted that M.G. and R.P. stated that G.S. and I.V.V. had had to handcuff the applicant and force him into the police car, because he had refused to climb into the car and had resisted by grabbing the car door and wing mirror. G.S. and I.V.V. stated that after the applicant had been immobilised and forced into the police vehicle, during the drive to the police station he had continued to bang his head against the windows of the police car. At the police station C.M. had fined the applicant for the offence and prepared a police report, which had eventually been signed by the applicant. C.M. stated that from the time the applicant had arrived at the police station, he had had no further contact with the other police officers and had shown no signs of violence. 30. The court further noted that according to C.P.’s statement, she had seen the applicant being handcuffed and how several police officers had tried to place him in the police car, even though he had wanted to prove to them that he was an American citizen. She had not been allowed to travel with the applicant to the police station and when she had arrived there his clothes had been dirty and he had blood stains on his face. According to O.C., the applicant had been handcuffed prior to being placed in the police car and had not been asked to identify himself or told why was he being taken to a police station. O.C. had seen the applicant resisting getting into the police car, but the police officers had used force. He also contradicted the applicant’s statement that after leaving the police station they had gone to the Galați County Hospital. 31. The court also noted that D.Z. had seen the whole incident and had stated that the applicant had refused to identify himself because he was an American citizen and together with C.P. he had insulted the police officers and the other witnesses. Also the applicant had been forcefully placed in the police car because he had been behaving aggressively and had been grabbing the car door and wing mirror. D.Z.’s statement concerning the applicant’s behaviour had also been confirmed by witnesses I.P. and M.M. 32. The court held that according to the available evidence, in particular the witness statements of D.Z., G.S. and I.V.V., the applicant had had to be handcuffed because he had been behaving aggressively both prior to and after being placed in the police car as well as during the drive to the police station. The court noted that the applicant had claimed that the injuries he had suffered at the hands of the police had amounted to ill-treatment in breach of the guarantees set out in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. However, the European Court of Human Rights had been reluctant to sanction the behaviour of State agents if they had used force in order to counteract the aggressive behaviour of an arrested person. The applicant’s refusal to show the police officers his identity papers and his aggressive conduct on account of his foreign nationality had not been justified given that he had been informed that he had committed an offence and had a duty to observe the laws of the State. Consequently, the force used by the State agents did not appear excessive. 33. The applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment. He argued that the prosecutor’s office attached to the Galați District Court had not been competent ratione materiae to carry out the criminal investigation in his case. The investigation had been superficial because not all the police officers involved in the events had been identified and because the police officers who had informed their colleagues that the applicant’s car had been involved in a car accident had not been heard. The authorities had refused to allow him to identify the individuals against whom the criminal proceedings had been brought, and witnesses C.M. and A.I. had committed perjury. At the time of the incident he had been denied the right to contact the American Embassy or a lawyer. The statements of witnesses C.P. and O.C. had been incomplete, and the first-instance court had ignored the fact that the authorities had failed to investigate how the injuries attested by the forensic expert reports had been caused. 34. By a final judgment of 18 February 2010 the Galați District Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. It held that the prosecutor’s office attached to the Galați District Court had been competent ratione materiae to carry out the criminal investigation in the case. Also the investigation had not been superficial and the authorities had identified and heard the four police officers who had handcuffed the applicant and had driven him to the police station. Other police officers had been heard, including the two Police Academy students as well as relevant eyewitnesses who were not police officers. 35. The court also held that the investigation had focused on all the applicant’s allegations and the authorities had heard the defence witnesses requested by him, namely C.P. and O.C. The fact that the authorities had not adduced all the data considered relevant by the applicant was not unlawful, considering that a preliminary investigation could be limited in respect of both quality and quantity by its lawful purpose. Moreover, the applicant’s allegation that some of the witnesses had committed perjury had been refuted by the corroboration of their statements by other evidence. The prosecutor’s office solution remained valid given that most of the witnesses had confirmed that the applicant had refused to go to the police station and had behaved aggressively, both verbally and physically, and that none of the witnesses had confirmed that he had been hit before being placed in the police car. Consequently, the measures taken against him had not been excessive or unjustified and had met the requirements of section 31 of Law no. 218/2002 on the organisation and operation of the Romanian police force. 36. The court further held that the fact that the statements of the applicant’s friends had contradicted those of the remaining witnesses was a consequence of their friendly relations with the applicant. 37. The court considered that the authorities had correctly interpreted the available medical documents. The scratches on the left side of the applicant’s neck, on his left forearm and the back of his left hand, as well as the bruises on his left shoulder, below his left clavicle and on the inside of his right arm had been inflicted by the police officers when they had handcuffed him and placed him in the police car. Their actions had been proportionate given his strong opposition. It was clear that handcuffing and the operation of placing a person in a police vehicle, if that person physically resisted the measure, would cause injuries. The superficial nature of the injuries and the areas of the body where the bruises and scratches had been sustained merely confirmed the proportional nature of the police officers’ actions. It was clear that the applicant had exaggerated the nature of his injuries in his complaint against the officers, given that there was no evidence in the file suggesting that he had been repeatedly kicked. It appeared that the internal lip injury and the dental damage suffered by the applicant had been caused by an impact to the chin, possibly when he had been resisting his handcuffing and placement in the car. The police officers could not be considered guilty as long as the applicant had continued to behave violently in the police vehicle. He had not suffered any external lesions in the chin area which could have been caused by an impact with a solid object. 38. On 31 July 2008 the applicant was fined for speeding and for failure to stop when signaled to do so by a police officer. 39.

ROMANIA,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for private life),Alvina Gyulumyan;Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Bucharest. At the time of the facts of the case, the applicant was in private legal practice and was a senator. 6. On 10 December 2009 the Anti-Corruption Department of the Prosecutor’s Office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice (referred to herein as “the prosecutor” and “the DNA”) started criminal proceedings against the applicant (urmărirea penală) on suspicion of trading in influence (traffic de influenţă). In particular, the prosecutor alleged that: (i) the applicant had accepted 200,000 euros (EUR) from a businessman, C.C., in return for using his connection to Judge F.C. of the High Court of Cassation and Justice in order to influence the outcome of a case pending before that court which concerned a dispute between C.C.’s company and a state agency; and (ii) that he had accepted money from M.L., under the pretext of providing legal services through his law firm, in order to facilitate M.L.’s access to the head of the police with the aim of discussing criminal investigations that were being conducted against M.L. 7. On 11 December 2009 the applicant was returning home during the day in a car belonging to the Senate. Close to his home, his route was blocked by another car. Several armed individuals jumped out, dragged the applicant from his car and, in front of his neighbours and a crowd of passers-by, handcuffed him and put him in their car. He was then taken to the DNA’s headquarters, where he was informed of the criminal proceedings against him. The applicant gave a statement to the prosecutor. 8. At the DNA’s headquarters, the applicant found out that he had been under investigation for a crime against national security. However, the prosecutor had decided on 27 November 2009 not to prosecute that offence. The evidence gathered in that investigation, in particular through intercepting the applicant’s telephone, had led the investigators to suspect the commission by the applicant of the crimes of corruption for which he was currently under investigation by the DNA. 9. On the same date, the prosecutor issued an order prohibiting the applicant from leaving town for thirty days. 10. Upon the applicant’s request, on 12 January 2010 the prosecutor sent him a copy of the decision of 27 November 2009. 11. On 9 March 2010 the prosecutor sought, through the Minister of Justice, Parliament’s approval to arrest the applicant. On the same date, the DNA issued a press release informing the public that it had sought authorisation for the arrest. 12. From the moment the DNA informed the public about the proceedings against the applicant, the media took great interest in the case. Numerous panel discussions were broadcast and journalists and politicians commented publicly on the events. 13. Excerpts from conversations between the defendants which had been obtained through telephone tapping during a criminal surveillance operation conducted prior to the criminal prosecution made it into the newspapers before the applicant and his co-accused had been committed for trial. Those excerpts gave the impression that the applicant and Judge F.C. had tried to manipulate some of the judges from the panel ruling in a commercial case involving C.C., and had reported back to the latter on the progress of those alleged manoeuvres. In the conversations among them, the applicant and the codefendants expressed in strong terms their disappointment that the outcome had not been favourable to C.C., and made assumptions as to whether the remaining judges on the panel had been influenced by someone else. 14. The transcripts of telephone conversations intercepted during the surveillance operation first appeared in the press between 18 and 22 March 2010. 15. Other pieces of evidence from the prosecution file were likewise published and commented on in the press. 16. On 24 March 2010 the Senate met to discuss the prosecutor’s request. The applicant was unable to take part in the session, as he was in the hospital at the time. The Senate allowed the prosecutor’s request. 17. Upon obtaining the Senate’s approval, the prosecutor submitted a detention order to the High Court of Cassation and Justice, which examined it in private on 30 March 2010 and endorsed it. The applicant was arrested on the same day. 18. The High Court then took a statement from the applicant and proceeded to examine the prosecutor’s application for the applicant’s pretrial detention. It heard arguments from the parties, reviewed the evidence presented by the prosecutor and concluded that there were serious indications and evidence in the file that the applicant had committed the crimes of which he was accused and that he had abused his important official position, thereby damaging the reputation of the legislature and the judiciary, as well as undermining the public’s trust in the judicial system. It therefore considered that the specific danger that the applicant posed to the public order was serious enough to justify his detention. 19. Upon the applicant’s appeal, by a final decision of 2 April 2010 the High Court, sitting as a ninejudge bench, upheld the previous decision. At the applicant’s request, this hearing was held in secret and journalists and the public were removed from the courtroom. The High Court found that the evidence lawfully included in the file justified a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the crimes under investigation. It also dismissed the applicant’s argument as to procedural flaws, in so far as it found that the prosecutor had heard the applicant on 11 December 2009 and considered that his right to mount a defence had not been disregarded because of the mere fact that a certain lapse of time had passed between the date of his statement and that of the arrest order. 20. The applicant sought his conditional release. On 12 April 2010 the High Court dismissed his application, on the grounds that the evidence in the file indicated that he had tried to influence one of the witnesses and to create false evidence in his defence. It also considered that the reasons underlying the court decision to place him in pre-trial detention were still valid, given that, in particular, such a short time had passed since that decision. This decision became final on 16 April 2010, when the High Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 21. The High Court examined the applicant’s pre-trial detention on ten more occasions and the applicant repeatedly applied for release pending trial conditioned on the obligation not to leave town (decisions of 23 April, 25 May, 16 June, 14 July, 10 September, 6 October, 16 November 2010, 12 January, 9 February and 4 March 2011). The High Court considered that the evidence in the file offered a reasonable indication that the applicant had committed the crimes he was accused of and that his continued detention was needed given the difficulty involved in investigating such crimes. It also referred to his attempt to influence witnesses, to his personal situation (first time on trial, family situation), his personality, his office during the alleged commission of the offences, and the nature and severity of the crimes under investigation. The High Court also took into account the fact that the proceedings on the merits had only recently started, on 20 May 2010. It referred to the European Court’s case-law and the relevant Council of Europe texts, and considered that the grounds for the applicant’s detention were still valid and the time spent in pre-trial detention was not excessive within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention. For these reasons, it did not consider it opportune to substitute the preventive measure that had been applied with a less strict measure. 22. The appeals lodged by the applicant against each of these court orders were dismissed by a different panel of the High Court on 26 April, 31 May, 21 June, 22 July, 30 September, 13 October and 29 November 2010, 20 January, 28 February and 14 March 2011 respectively. 23. On 4 April 2011 the High Court examined a new application for release on probation lodged by the applicant and decided that he could be released. It held that the vast majority of the evidence for the prosecution had already been heard in court, thus the risk of the applicant trying to influence witnesses was no longer acute. The court ordered him not to leave town and not to contact his co-accused. 24. However, on 11 April 2011 the decision was quashed and a fivejudge panel of the High Court dismissed the applicant’s application for release. The High Court examined the suitability of releasing’s case-law on the subject. It considered that the severity of the crimes allegedly committed and the particular circumstances in which they had occurred, coupled with the applicant’s attempts to influence a witness, were sufficient factors to justify extending the applicant’s detention pending trial, which remained the only adequate preventive measure. It also considered that the overall length of the measure remained reasonable in the applicant’s particular situation. 25. On four more occasions (27 April, 11 May, 8 June and 12 July 2011) the High Court was called to examine the necessity of keeping the applicant in detention and each time it decided to release him pending trial for the same reasons as those advanced on 4 April 2011. The High Court replaced the measure with the obligation not to leave town. However, each order, save for the last one, was quashed by a five-judge panel of the High Court and the applicant’s detention was extended (on 29 April, 24 May and 17 June 2011 respectively). 26. On 18 July 2011 the High Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the prosecutor against the court order of 12 July 2011. As a consequence, the applicant was released from detention on the same day. 27. The applicant was arrested on 30 March 2010 and remained in pretrial detention until 12 July 2011. He described the overall conditions of his detention as follows: it was very cold in the cell, hot water was only available for one hour a week and basic hygiene was lacking. He had to share a 9 sq. m cell with ten other inmates and the lack of space triggered violent clashes within the cell. 28. The Prison Administration submitted a full record of the applicant’s stay in prison, giving details of the cells the applicant was kept in, their occupancy and the facilities offered. According to this information, the applicant was held in Bucharest Remand Centre No. 1 (“Bucharest Remand Centre”) on 30 March 2010 and again from 16 April 2010 to 13 July 2010. He was held in two separate cells, one of 9 sq. m with four beds and another of 14.57 sq. m with six beds. The cells were at full occupancy at that time. Each cell was equipped with beds, a table, chairs, a squat toilet, a sink with cold and hot water and a shower separated from the living space by a curtain. The inmates cleaned the cell themselves with products provided by the administration or purchased by them. 29. The applicant described these cells as badly lit and ventilated, humid and foul smelling. He further explained that because the toilet was not partitioned off from the beds, the inmates lacked privacy when using it. The tap for washing dishes and clothes and for showering was placed above the toilet and the water ran straight into the toilet. There was frequently no running water at all, which rendered it impossible to flush the toilet. The hot water was never sufficient for all of the inmates to take showers. 30. The records show that from 30 March to 16 April 2010 the applicant was held in Jilava Prison Hospital in a hospital room measuring 30 sq. m which was equipped with five beds and had access to hot water twice a week. 31. The applicant spent the remainder of his pre-trial detention in Bucharest-Rahova Prison, where he was held, at his request and because of his position as a senator, in a cell for vulnerable individuals. The cell measured 24.59 sq. m, had eight bunk beds and was at full occupancy at that time. The cell had a window which allowed in natural light and ventilation. The detainees had at their disposal a table, benches, shelves and a TV set. Adjacent to the cell there was a bathroom equipped with a toilet, sinks and a shower. Cold water was continually available and hot water was available twice a week. The cell was heated to 18oC during the winter. The applicant explained that it was very hot in the summer and very cold in the winter; the heating system was old and broke down frequently, leaving the cells brutally cold. Hot water was scarce and there was never enough for all of the inmates to take showers. 32. On 28 February 2011 the applicant was transported from BucharestRahova Prison to the prosecutor’s office in Piteşti and back, a trip of around two hours each way. According to the applicant, they left in the morning from Bucharest-Rahova Prison. He was transported in the back of a prison van. Although the outside temperature was no more than 2-3oC, there was no heating in the van; in addition cold air from outside was able to enter the van through two hatches in the roof which could not be closed completely. There was insufficient light in the van because there were no windows in the detainee’s compartment, the only source of light being a small window separating the detainee’s compartment from the driver’s cabin. The applicant, who was alone in the back of the van, had nothing to sit on or lean against, thus having to stand up during the entire journey with nothing to hold on to. When the van arrived in Piteşti and returned to Bucharest, he was allowed to stretch, warm up and do some physical exercise. 33. The Prison Administration informed the Government that the applicant had been transported in a van designed for transporting sixteen people, as follows: two people in the forward cabin, ten detainees on chairs in a separate compartment, and four guards in another separate compartment in the back of the van. The van had natural and artificial ventilation, a heating system, and artificial light, which was kept on throughout each journey in order to allow the guards to keep watch over the detainees. The applicant had been transported alone, thus having ten chairs at his disposal. The journey had started at 8.45 am and ended at 1.35 pm. 34. In his observations in reply to the official information supplied by the Prison Administration, the applicant explained that the back of the van where he had been held had been completely opaque without any natural light and that the artificial lighting and the heating system had not been working. He reiterated that the two hatches on the roof had remained open during the journey, resulting in freezing temperatures inside the van. The guards had had blankets to cover themselves during the journey, but he had not been given one. In addition, the seats in the detainees’ compartment had not been fitted with safety belts, which had made it difficult to keep his balance.","['3', '8']",['8-1'],[],['3'],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Zagreb. 6. The applicant was a co-owner of a block of flats on the island of Vir. 7. On 2 and 23 March 2006 building inspectors of the Inspectorate of the Ministry of the Environment, Spatial Development and Construction (Ministarstvo zaštite okoliša, prostornog uređenja i graditeljstva, Uprava za inspekcijske poslove) carried out an on-site inspection of the block of flats in question. 8. On 31 March 2006 one of the building inspectors ordered that the block of flats be demolished within three days from the date of service of the decision. 9. The applicant lodged an appeal against the demolition order, submitting that the time-limit for compliance was too short and that the block of flats was not within the protected coastal area. 10. On 15 May 2006 the appeal section of the Legal Department at the Inspectorate (Odsjek za postupak u drugom stupnju – “the second-instance body”) dismissed the appeal, finding that the block of flats had been built without a building permit. 11. Meanwhile, on 4 May 2006 the building inspector issued an administrative enforcement order (zaključak o dozvoli izvršenja), stating that the demolition order of 31 March 2006 had become enforceable on 6 April 2006 and that the co-owners had not complied with it within the given time-limit. He therefore ordered that the demolition be carried out by a third party after 11 May 2006, at the expense of the co-owners. 12. The applicant lodged an appeal against the administrative enforcement order, submitting that it was not sufficiently reasoned and that the construction of the block of flats could be retrospectively approved. 13. On 23 May 2006 the second-instance body dismissed the appeal as ill-founded. 14. On 27 June 2006 the co-owners had the block of flats demolished. 15. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2006 the applicant lodged an administrative complaint with the Administrative Court, repeating the arguments made in her appeal and seeking damages for the demolition. Since it was not clear whether the applicant was complaining about the second-instance decision concerning the demolition order or the administrative enforcement, on 11 July 2006 the Administrative Court requested her to specify which she wished to contest. 16. On 30 August 2006 the applicant replied that she was seeking annulment of the second-instance decision of 15 May 2006 concerning the demolition order. 17. On 22 April 2010 the Administrative Court dismissed her complaint as ill-founded, but addressed it as if it had been about the second-instance decision of 23 May 2006 concerning the administrative enforcement. 18. On 13 July 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, alleging, inter alia, a violation of her right of access to court, on the ground that the Administrative Court had erroneously decided a matter which had not been the subject of her administrative complaint. 19. On 13 December 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, on the grounds that the contested decision had not concerned the merits of the case and as such was not amenable to constitutional review. This decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 7 January 2011.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1961 and is currently detained in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel near Sofia. 5. In a final judgment of 23 February 2009, the applicant was convicted of murder and sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. On 6 April 2009 he entered Sofia Prison to serve his sentence. He did not say anything about the conditions of his detention there. 6. On 21 August 2009 he was transferred to Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel, a closed-type prison hostel. 7. On 26 August 2009 the serving of his sentence of imprisonment was interrupted in order for him to take care of his elderly mother, who had undergone hip-replacement surgery in July 2009. The interruption came to an end on 26 October 2009, and the applicant was again placed in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel. 8. From 26 October 2009 until 28 October 2010 the applicant was placed in group no. 72. According to him, the group was housed in several cabins with cement floors. The cells were heated with wooden and coal stoves. They were damp and had many of their windows broken and doors shattered. Each cell had between thirty and thirty-five square metres of floor space and housed between sixteen and twenty-two inmates – that is, provided less than two square metres per inmate –, and had one sink and one toilet with a shower. According to the Government, the cell measured between thirty-five and forty square metres and housed around twelve inmates. 9. The applicant further said that cold water was only available between 6 and 8 a.m. and 6 and 8 p.m., and hot water was only available between 8 and 9 a.m. and 7 and 8 p.m. Hygienic and sanitary materials were not regularly provided. There was no canteen or dedicated eating space, and no cutlery. As a result of those conditions – mainly the cold and the humidity –he had developed arthritis of both knees. 10. On 28 October 2010 the applicant was transferred to group no. 6. He was placed in a cell which he shared with three to four other inmates. He also started working in the hostel’s canteen and had his meals there. According to the Government, the applicant had to share a cell with two to three inmates. The cell was heated with electricity and there were no water supply restrictions. The door and the windows were in good condition. 11. After the applicant’s prison regime was changed to a more lenient one, on 19 November 2014 he was placed in a cell outside the guarded area of the hostel. The Government submitted that his cell had its own sanitary facilities and that no water supply restrictions existed. 12. According to the applicant, material conditions in the cells in which he was placed after 28 October 2010 were significantly better in terms of heating, lighting and hygiene, and were satisfactory. Food was also of good quality. Taking a shower, however, was only possible after 10 p.m. due to low water pressure. 13. Lastly, the applicant alleged that health care in custody was inadequate, with no qualified doctors but only a dentist working on site, and no provision of medicines at reduced prices, as available to people out of prison.",['3'],[],[],['3'],[],[],1

Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"5. The applicant, Ms Ljiljana Milisavljević, is a Serbian national who was born in 1966 and lives in Belgrade. 6. The applicant was a journalist employed at Politika, a major Serbian daily newspaper. In September 2003 she was requested by the editorial board to write an article about Ms Nataša Kandić. 7. Ms Nataša Kandić is a Serbian human rights activist primarily known for her activities in investigating crimes committed during the armed conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, including those crimes committed by Serbian regular and irregular forces. She was also recognised as one of the most vocal advocates for full cooperation of the Yugoslav and later Serbian authorities with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (hereinafter “the ICTY”). 8. At the time relevant to this case, between 40% and 64% of the Serbian population considered the ICTY to be a major security threat to the Republic of Serbia. Some 54% of the population was against cooperation with the ICTY, which would include arrests and transfers of Serbian suspects to this institution. In 2003, the ICTY’s assessment of Serbia’s cooperation with that court was that it was “neither full nor proactive”. The level of cooperation was further negatively influenced by the assassination of the Serbian Prime Minister Dr Zoran Đinđić in March 2003, a major political figure open to full cooperation with the ICTY. Ms Kandić herself came under attack by a significant portion of the Serbian political elite and general population. As a consequence, she was involved in several incidents. 9. The applicant’s article on Ms Kandić appeared in Politika on 7 September 2003. The integral translation of the impugned article, titled “The Hague Investigator”, reads as follows: “‘Even my son blames me for protecting everybody but the Serbs’, says the director of the Fund for Humanitarian Law. Ms Nataša Kandić, founder and Executive Director of the Humanitarian Law Centre for Serbia, Montenegro, and Kosovo and Metohija, a non-governmental organisation aimed at promoting human rights for minorities, last week, again, defended herself ‘from the Serbian patriotism surge’. On the occasion of the International Day of the Disappeared commemoration, at the gathering of the Association of Families of Missing and Kidnapped Persons in Kosovo and Metohija organised in the centre of Belgrade, following a short argument she slapped one of the participants. After this incident the Belgrade police submitted a request for the initiation of prosecution proceedings against her, and the Association of Families of the Missing lodged a lawsuit, demanding that she pay 30,000,000 Serbian dinars (RSD) for the insult to the families of those kidnapped and killed. Recently our media have also reported that this ‘prominent advocate of human rights and democratic reform in Serbia’ was awarded the annual Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative Award (CEELI) from the American Bar Association on 9 August during the ABA Annual Meeting luncheon in San Francisco. Former winners of this award were Petar Stoyanov from Bulgaria, Emil Constantinescu from Romania, Vaclav Havel from the Czech Republic, Stjepan Mesić from Croatia ... It was also reported that at the beginning of May the American magazine Time published a list of thirty-six individuals dubbed the European heroes, among which was Nataša Kandić, too. The Serbian campaigner for the truth on war crimes, a lonely voice of reason in Serbia or the Soros mercenary, the one who was named by all the banished FRY spies, has won many awards, including the Human Rights Watch Award, but none of them were awarded to her in Serbia. Nataša Kandić provokes stormy reactions wherever she appears. While the West lauds and praises her, in Serbia she is spoken about with contempt and accused of anti-Serbian politics. Most of all they blame her for never pursuing the crimes against Serbs but exclusively dealing with those committed by Serbs against other ethnicities. Although she has been called a witch and a prostitute and is permanently under threat (this year she has also had to cancel her appearance at a local TV station owing to a bomb threat), she says: ‘This is simply the part of this job. I don’t think that they hate me, only my message’. Nevertheless, she once made a public complaint: ‘Even my son has accused me of protecting everybody except the Serbs.’ Although later, she adds, she heard him defending her concern for the weak. Nataša Kandić was born in 1946 in Topola, to her father Radoslav and mother Vera. In 1966 she went to study in Great Britain and upon her return she enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade. She participated in the 1968 student demonstrations. In the 1970s she started working in the Belgrade municipality of Palilula. Afterwards she worked in the city trade union. During the mid-1990s she went to the Centre for Antiwar Action to work as a technical secretary, but before long she left it after a conflict with Ms Vesna Pešić. With a group of like-minded people she founded the Humanitarian Law Centre at the beginning of 1993. A year later, on the invitation of Ms Jeri Laber, the Helsinki Watch Executive Director, she left for New York. Upon discussion with top people at the Hague Tribunal, the Humanitarian Law Centre took charge of its work in respect of the socalled Serbian crimes against Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as violations and abuses of Muslim and Croatian minority rights in the FRY. That is how this organisation became the [ICTY] ‘investigator’. Starting from the second half of the 1990s the Centre became involved in the Kosovo and Metohija issues. During the NATO campaign she frequently travelled the Belgrade-Kosovo and Metohija-Montenegro routes. Her email messages sent via the Internet to foreign friends and collaborators are the evidence of her time and work in Kosovo and Metohija. With Lazar Stojanović, the Plastični Isus (‘Plastic Jesus’) director, she has a son Stefan, who lives in New York and is involved in graphic animation.” 10. On 10 November 2003 Ms Kandić started a private prosecution against the applicant. She claimed that the entire piece had been written with the intent of belittling her in the eyes of the public, to present her as a traitor to Serbian interests and as a “paid servant of foreign interests and a prostitute who sells herself for money”. She further claimed that the points introduced in the article were maliciously misrepresented, and that the article contained untruths and blatant insults. She explicitly refused to lodge any civil compensation claim within these proceedings. 11. The applicant, in her defence, stated that she was not expressing her own opinion of Ms Kandić, whom she did not intend to insult, and that she had written the entire article on the basis of the documentation of other magazines. She put the citations within quotation marks, but she omitted them when she was not literally citing but paraphrasing (“ono što nije stavila pod navodnike predstavljaju navode koji nisu citati, već ih je prepričavala iz drugih listova”). She provided details as to what phrases were taken from which articles and magazines, including from which article and magazine she had taken the phrase that Ms Kandić had been called a witch and a prostitute. 12. On 1 September 2005, after a remittal, the First Municipal Court (Prvi opštinski sud) in Belgrade found that the applicant had committed a criminal offence of insult when having stated for Ms Kandić “although she has been called a witch and a prostitute” and gave her a judicial warning. The court established that the impugned phrase had been indeed previously published in another article by another author in a different magazine. However, the applicant did not put it in quotation marks which meant that she agreed with it, thus expressing her opinion. The court concluded that there was therefore an intention to insult Ms Kandić. In view of no aggravating circumstances and a number of mitigating ones (the applicant had a clean record, was employed and of mature age (u zrelom dobu)), she was given a mere judicial warning (sudska opomena), on the grounds of Articles 41 and 59 of the General Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below). No prison sentence or fines were imposed. 13. On an unspecified date thereafter the applicant appealed. She reiterated that the impugned words were not her own opinion, but an opinion of another author. The fact that she wrote also on the negative attitudes towards the private prosecutor and her work could not and must not make her, the applicant, criminally liable. She also submitted that such an attitude towards the freedom of press could have long-reaching consequences. 14. On 5 July 2006 the Belgrade District Court (Okružni sud) upheld the first-instance decision endorsing the reasons given therein. 15. In separate proceedings, on 2 October 2006 the Belgrade First Municipal Court ordered the applicant to pay Ms Kandić RSD 33,125 (around 386 euros (EUR)) in respect of costs and expenses. The applicant did not appeal against that decision. 16.

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 6+6-3-c - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Article 6-3-c - Defence through legal assistance),Alena Poláčková;Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helena Jäderblom;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"5. The applicant was born in 1979 and before his conviction lived in Izhevsk. 6. According to the applicant, on 18 February 2005 the police carried out a search of the applicant’s flat in connection with the murder of a lawenforcement officer, which took place during the night of 7-8 February 2005. 7. On 3 March and 10 March 2005 the police interviewed the applicant, in the presence of the applicant’s lawyer, about the circumstances of the murder case under investigation. No suspicions were raised against the applicant. 8. At 6 p.m. on 22 March 2005 the applicant was apprehended on the street in Izhevsk and taken to the Ustinovskiy district police station of Izhevsk (Устиновский РОВД г. Ижевска – “Izhevsk police station”). He was allegedly beaten and coerced into confessing to having committed the murder and to signing a record of his surrender and confession (явка с повинной). 9. According to that record, at 9.50 p.m. on 22 March 2005 in office no. 312 at Izhevsk police station, a police officer, M., obtained from the applicant a confession to the crime, in accordance with Article 142 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation. In particular, the record stated that at the beginning of February 2005 the applicant had been drinking alcoholic beverages in the company of a certain S. after work. At an unspecified time after midnight he left S.’s flat. On his way home he entered a nearby house to urinate. There he saw a man who made a rude remark about the applicant’s behaviour. The man was also drunk. They began to fight, in the course of which the applicant hit the man several times on the head with a knife handle, and also punched and kicked him. The latter fell down the stairs. When the applicant left the man was still lying on the ground floor. The record further stated that the confession had been handwritten by the applicant himself without any coercion on the part of police officers, and that the applicant had been informed of Article 51 of the Constitution (the right not to give self-incriminating statements), which he had understood. 10. The applicant furthermore wrote a similarly worded confession addressed to the Prosecutor of the Republic of Udmurtiya. 11. At 00.05 a.m. on 23 March 2005 a record of the applicant’s arrest was drawn up. He was formally assigned the status of a criminal suspect and was informed of all his rights, including the right to remain silent, the right to a lawyer and the right not to incriminate himself. The record contained the applicant’s handwritten note to the effect that he accepted his arrest, as he had committed a murder on 8 February 2005. The record further contains the applicant’s request for access to his lawyer. 12. Later on the same day, 23 March 2005, the applicant was provided with a legal-aid lawyer and questioned as a suspect. During the questioning the applicant retracted his confession, asserting that it had been given as a result of coercion and in the absence of a lawyer. He consistently repudiated his confession throughout the ensuing proceedings. 13. On 23 March 2005 the applicant was made to undergo a forensic medical examination, which revealed no injuries on his body aside from a scar on the edge of his hairline dating back two to three months (forensic medical examination report no. 2672). 14. On 27 March 2005 the applicant was remanded in custody and transferred to the Izhevsk SIZO-1 remand prison. 15. On 29 March 2005 charges of murder were brought against the applicant. 16. On 22 April 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Ustinovskiy district prosecutor’s office of Izhevsk, alleging that he had been ill-treated. 17. On 27 May 2005 an investigator from the Ustinovskiy district prosecutor’s office issued a decision not to initiate criminal proceedings against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant. 18. On 25 July 2005 the criminal case against the applicant was submitted to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya for trial. 19. On 22 August 2005 the trial against the applicant commenced. 20. Before the court the applicant denied committing the murder and reaffirmed that his confession had been given under pressure from police officers and in the absence of his lawyer. 21. On 19 December 2005 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya convicted the applicant of murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. The court based the conviction on the following evidence: - statements by a police officer, M., who had been involved in the investigation and who had submitted that (i) in the course of the investigation it had been determined that the murder had been committed by the applicant; and (ii) the latter had been apprehended and brought to Izhevsk police station, where he had voluntarily confessed to having committed the murder of G. and had written a statement of surrender and confession (явка с повинной), describing the details of the committed crime; no violence had been exerted on the applicant; - statements by a police officer, N., involved in the investigation of the murder, who submitted that (i) in the course of the investigation it had been determined that the crime had been committed by the applicant; (ii) in March 2005 the latter had been brought to the police station, where he had confessed to the murder; and (iii) a statement of surrender and confession had been drawn up in which the applicant had described in detail the circumstances under which he had committed the murder; - statements by a police officer, O., who submitted that (i) on 8 February 2005 he had participated in the inspection of the scene of the murder of G.; (ii) it had been established that the applicant had been involved in the crime; (iii) in March 2005 the applicant had been brought to Izhevsk police station, where he had confessed to the murder (his confession had been recorded in the statement of surrender and confession); and (iv) no violence had been applied to the applicant. - a statement by a police officer, S., who had participated in the inspection of the crime scene on 8 February 2005 – he submitted that (i) during the check it had been established that a man nicknamed “Gunya” [the applicant] could have committed the crime; (ii) the applicant had been apprehended by the police; (iii) the applicant had been interrogated at about 9 p.m. on 22 March 2005 by M., O., P. and himself; (iv) in the course of the interrogation the applicant had confessed to having committed the murder; and (v) no violence had been applied to him; - statements by a police officer, Nam., who submitted that he had learned from police officer M. that the applicant had confessed to having committed the murder of G.; The above statements were found to be confirmed by the applicant’s statement of surrender and confession of 22 March 2005 and by statements by independent witnesses in the case, specifically: - statements by an anonymous witness, “Akulov”, to whom the applicant had supposedly confided about the murder on 8 February 2005; during the trial “Akulov” had been placed in a separate room, and questions from the parties had been asked through a court bailiff; the parties had heard the witness’s answers by means of a radio communication device with acoustic shielding; - statements by a witness, M., who had been detained together with the applicant at Izhevsk police station during the night of 22-23 March 2005, and whom the applicant had supposedly told about his having committed the murder of a police officer; - statements by a witness, S., who submitted that (i) he had worked with the applicant as a painter and decorator since 2003; (ii) they had been drinking alcoholic beverages after work on 7 February 2005 until 10 p.m., after which they had each gone home; (iii) the following morning at 8 a.m. he had picked the applicant up and gone to work with him; (iv) he had found out about the murder of G. on the evening of 8 February 2005 from a certain M. and later from the police; (v) the applicant had had his right arm in plaster since January 2005, which had not prevented him from working; (vi) that the applicant had had a folding knife, which he had lost in January 2005; and (vii) that the applicant had been nicknamed “Gunya”; - statements by a witness, Ts., the applicant’s colleague and neighbour, who submitted that (i) he had been drinking alcoholic beverages with the applicant and S. until 10 p.m. on 7 February 2005, following which he had left while the applicant and S. had stayed on; (ii) he had found about the murder on 8 February 2005 from the police; (iii) he had known that the applicant was suspected of that murder; - statements by other witnesses with no interest in the outcome of the case; - the applicant’s handwritten statement of 22 March 2005 addressed to the Ustinovskiy district prosecutor’s office describing the circumstances of the murder; - the record of the applicant’s arrest, in which the applicant noted that he accepted his arrest, as he had committed a murder; - records of forensic biological examinations, which did not exclude the possibility that the traces of blood on the applicant’s coat could have been the victim’s; the conclusions of those forensic biological examinations were confirmed by the record of the crime-scene examination and the record of the forensic medical examination of the victim’s corpse; - records of forensic chemical examinations of the fibres discovered at the crime scene, the origin of which could not be excluded as being from the clothes worn by the applicant at the time of the murder; - the record of the forensic medical examination, which concluded that the applicant’s having a plastered right arm did not exclude the possibility of him administering active purposeful actions with that arm; - the record of the applicant’s forensic psychiatric examination. 22. The court dismissed the applicant’s allegation that his confession had been obtained through ill-treatment, referring to the statements made by the police officers and to expert report no. 2672, which had not recorded any injuries on the applicant’s body. 23. The applicant appealed against the conviction. In his statement of appeal he submitted, in particular, that his confession was inadmissible evidence, as it had been obtained under duress and in the absence of a lawyer. 24. On 14 June 2006 the Supreme Court of Russia dismissed the appeal. It endorsed in full the trial court’s decision concerning the admissibility of the statement of the applicant’s surrender and confession. The Supreme Court held, in particular, that the law did not require the presence of a lawyer at the moment of giving a confession. 25. On 4 July 2006 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony IK-8 of the Republic of Udmurtiya to serve his sentence. 26. On 19 August 2006 the applicant was transferred to the IZ-16/2 remand centre of Kazan with ankle-joint oedema, skin erosion and fever. 27. On 30 August 2006 the applicant was transferred to the surgical unit of that facility for medical treatment. 28. On 25 October 2006 the applicant was transferred to penal institution LIU-19 of the Republic of Mordoviya (a medical penal establishment designed for the treatment and detention of drug addicts, alcoholics, and HIV- and tuberculosis-infected prisoners), where he underwent compulsory treatment for drug addiction until 21 November 2008. 29. According to the applicant, there had been a high percentage of HIVpositive detainees in the facility, some of whom had worked with the applicant at the facility’s sewing workshop. The applicant believed, therefore, that he had faced a serious risk of contamination via the working utensils (for example, scissors and sewing needles).",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1983 and lives in Cheboksary. 5. On 19 July 2005 the Chertanovskiy District Court in Moscow found the applicant guilty of kicking a police officer while intoxicated, an offence under Article 318(1) of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to one year’s imprisonment. The District Court explained the decision to impose a custodial sentence in the following manner: “When sentencing the defendant, Mr Aleksandrov, the court takes into account the nature and degree of the social danger of the offence, all the , and the information regarding the defendant’s personality: [he] has never incurred any criminal or administrative liability, he is not registered [as a drug addict or as a person suffering from psychotic disorders], he was given positive references by his neighbours and employers, [and] his military registration has been annulled because of a kidney disease. The court accepts the above-mentioned circumstances as mitigating the defendant’s guilt; however, it does not find any grounds for sentencing [him] to probation or imposing a fine on him, given the particular circumstances in which the offence was committed and the fact that [he] does not have a permanent place of residence in Moscow or in the Moscow Region”. 6. The applicant appealed, claiming in particular that he had been discriminated against by the trial court’s refusal to impose a non-custodial sentence on the grounds that he did not have a permanent residence in Moscow or in the Moscow Region, even though there had existed circumstances calling for the mitigation of his sentence. 7. On 29 August 2005 the Moscow City Court dismissed the appeal. It held, in a summary fashion, that the trial court had complied with every legal requirement and had issued a reasoned judgment, having sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment.","['14', '5']",['5-1'],['5-1-a'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Donetsk. 6. On 29 May 1997 the Donetsk Kirovskyy District Court (“the Kirovskyy Court”) found the applicant guilty of robbery and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. 7. On 18 July 1997 the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal (“the Regional Court”) granted amnesty to the applicant. 8. On 26 September 1997 the same court, following an objection (протест) by its president, quashed the decision of 18 July 1997 and upheld the judgment of 29 May 1997 by a final decision. The applicant became aware of the Regional Court’s decision of 26 September 1997 only after his arrest in February 2003 (see paragraph 10 below). 9. In October 1997 the Kirovskyy Court sent its judgment to the local police with a view to ensuring its enforcement. As submitted by the applicant and eventually established by the domestic courts (see paragraph 12 below), he continued living at his permanent address. Although he was placed on a wanted list for a brief period in December 1997, neither during that period nor thereafter did the police try to contact him. 10. On 12 February 2003 the Kirovskyy police arrested the applicant at his home and brought him to Dzerzhynsk prison no. 2 to serve his sentence. 11. Following numerous unsuccessful complaints to the prosecution authorities, in March 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Kirovskyy Court, stating that his arrest and detention had been unlawful and requesting to be released. 12. After several rounds of proceedings, on 23 March 2006 the Kirovskyy Court allowed the applicant’s claim and found the impugned actions of the police officers unlawful. The court found no evidence in the case file that the applicant had been informed of the court hearing and the final decision of 26 September 1997. He had been arrested more than five years later. By that time his sentence had become time-barred, a fact which the police had been obliged, but had failed, to check. As regards the applicant’s request for release, the Kirovskyy Court stated that the issue was no longer of relevance (see paragraph 14 below). 13. On 23 June 2006 the Regional Court upheld the above decision. 14. In the meantime, on 27 April 2005, the Dzerzhynskyy Local Court ordered the applicant’s release on parole. The applicant was released on 4 May 2005 once all the formalities had been completed. 15. In 2006 the applicant lodged a claim for damages against the Ministry of the Interior on account of his unlawful arrest and detention. He relied on the Compensation Act, under which a person could claim such compensation if the unlawfulness of his or her arrest and detention had been established by a judicial decision (see paragraph 26 below). The applicant referred in that connection to the court’s decision of 23 March 2006, in which his deprivation of liberty had been found to be unlawful (see paragraph 12 above). 16. On 3 April 2007 the Kirovskyy Court rejected his claim as unfounded. It noted the existence of the judicial decision referred to by the applicant without, however, commenting on it. The court observed that the applicant had appealed against neither the judgment of 29 May 1997 nor the ruling of 26 September 1997 (see paragraphs 6 and 8 above). It also observed that he had been released without any conclusion about his guilt. Having relied on the above considerations, the Kirovskyy Court concluded that the applicant had failed to prove that he had been deprived of his liberty unlawfully. 17. On 26 June 2007 the Regional Court upheld that decision. 18. On 22 August 2007 the applicant’s representative, G., appealed on points of law. 19. On 6 September 2007 the Supreme Court gave the applicant a deadline of 16 October 2007 to submit the power of attorney. Its ruling referred to the applicant’s case number as registered by the Supreme Court. 20. As confirmed by a postal acknowledgement of receipt, on 17 October 2007 the Supreme Court received a registered letter from the applicant’s representative, which had been dispatched on 12 October 2007 and which concerned the case under the number indicated in the ruling of 6 September 2007. According to the applicant, his representative had sent the requested authority form by the above-mentioned registered letter. According to the Government, the content of that letter and the documents enclosed, if any, could not be established in the absence of their detailed description on the acknowledgment of receipt. 21. On 30 October 2007 the Supreme Court returned the applicant’s appeal on points of law without examination. It held that, contrary to its instructions of 6 September 2007, he had failed to submit the power of attorney “within the set time-limit and before the delivery of the present ruling”. 22. On 9 November 2007 the Supreme Court sent its ruling to the applicant’s representative. According to the applicant, his representative received it on 24 November 2007. 23. On 3 December 2007 G. requested that the Supreme Court give reasons for the dismissal of the applicant’s appeal on points of law, since the ruling of 6 September 2007 had been complied with. There was no reply to that request.",['5'],"['5-1', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,3,Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression),Alena Poláčková;Dmitry Dedov;Georgios A. Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"5. At the material time the applicant company was the publisher of Kvartirnyy Ryad, a newspaper specialising in coverage of the housing market in the Moscow area (“the newspaper”). 6. On 20 May 2004 the newspaper published an article by G. entitled “So sorry for the bird. The blue one” («А птичку жалко. Синюю» – “the article”). The article described a conflict situation concerning a large commonhold association, Bluebird (Синяя птица), which included eight blocks of flats in the south-west of Moscow. G. suggested in the article that a number of residents of the Bluebird flats had been affected by the alleged misuse of common areas, in particular attics in the blocks of flats and that T., the head of the commonhold association, had been behind the misuse. G. emphasised that T. was also the deputy head of a district council in Moscow and that he had declined to comment on the article’s contents prior to publication. The article asked T. and the local government questions pertaining to the misuse of the common areas. 7. The relevant parts of the article read as follows: “Residents of eight blocks of flats in Severnoe Butovo keep sending letters to the courts, the prosecutor’s office, the city administration and even President Putin to complain about the head of the “Bluebird” commonhold association, T., [w]ho has developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the association’s Charter and a number of regional and federal laws. ... ... But T. has expressed his distrust in the commission elected by the general meeting and has appointed his own commission...as a result T. has managed to retain his position ... ... the commission was not elected, but appointed, which guaranteed the appointment of T. for a third term ... ... In sum, even though T. did not have the majority of the votes, he nonetheless managed to conclude the contract ... ... let’s ask one final question, which again pertains to T.: does a State official have the right to combine his official functions with a commercial business activity?” 8. On 28 May 2004 T. lodged a defamation claim against the applicant company and G. with the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”). The plaintiff alleged that the statements contained in the article damaged his honour, dignity and business reputation. The court received the statement of claim on 15 June 2004. 9. On 8 December 2004 the District Court examined and partially allowed the claim, referring to Article 152 of the Civil Code and Resolution no. 11 of the Plenary Supreme Court. It reasoned: “... the impugned statement: “... who [has] developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the commonhold association’s Charter and a number of regional and federal laws” should be retracted [by the defendants] ... as during the judicial examination of the case the defendants failed to prove that T.’s actions were unlawful. The defendants, a third party and witnesses explained that an attic ... had been unlawfully rented out. The lease agreement had been unlawfully concluded by T. ... However, no evidence has been provided [by the defendants] to the court to prove that the plaintiff’s actions were unlawful or illegal or in violation of federal and regional law or the commonhold association’s Charter. Moreover, the issue of the lease of the attic ... was examined by the Zyuzinskiy District Court of Moscow. By the decision of the Zyuzinskiy District Court of Moscow of 19 May 2004 actions of the Bluebird commonhold association headed by T. were found to be in compliance with the law in force. As to the statements: “... the commission was not elected, but appointed, which guaranteed the appointment of T. for a third term ... In sum, even though T. did not have the majority of the votes, he nonetheless managed to conclude the contract ...” ... They are not to be retracted as they are not damaging to the honour and dignity of the plaintiff. ... as to the statement: “let’s ask one final question, which again pertains to T.: does a State official have the right to combine his official functions with a commercial business activity?” It should not be retracted either as ... the author of the article [G.] is asking a rhetorical question ...” 10. The District Court ordered the applicant company “to refute the statement [published] in the newspaper Kvartirnyy Ryad on 20 May 2004 ... that T. developed activities as the head of the “Bluebird” commonhold association, violating the association’s Charter as well as a whole range of laws of the capital area and federal law”. It also awarded T. non-pecuniary damages: 10,000 Russian roubles (RUB – approximately 270 euros) to be paid by the applicant company and RUB 8,000 to be paid by G. 11. The applicant company and G. appealed against the judgment to the Moscow City Court (“the City Court”). 12. On 4 May 2005 it upheld the judgment of 8 December 2004 in full, referring to Article 152 of the Civil Code and to Resolution no. 11 of the Plenary Supreme Court. It provided the following succinct reasoning: “The plaintiff has proven the fact that the contested statements were disseminated: he provided the court with an original issue of the newspaper of 20 May 2004 ... ... the court [of first instance] rightly held that the defendants had failed to prove the veracity of the disseminated statement ... that [the plaintiff] had developed an indecently hasty business activity spitting in the face of the association’s Charter and the law. At the same time, the court [justifiably] referred to the judgment of the Zyuzinskiy District Court of Moscow ... which found the actions of the commonhold association ... headed by T. to be in compliance with the law in force.” 13. On 25 July 2005 the City Court rejected a request by the applicant company for supervisory review. 14. On 13 October 2005 the enforcement proceedings were terminated by a bailiff as the judgment of 8 December 2004 had been enforced in full.",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Berehove. 6. In the early hours of 22 August 2004 M. was robbed and killed in Berehove, where the applicant was also living. On the same date the applicant and two other people, K.A. and St., were arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing M. 7. According to the applicant, he was apprehended by the police task force at about 10 a.m. on 22 August 2004 in the apartment of his girlfriend and taken to the police station, where he was beaten up and threatened in an attempt to force him to confess to the robbery and murder of M. 8. The case file contains two arrest warrants – one issued by a police officer and another one by the prosecutor investigating the murder (hereinafter “the investigator”), both indicating that the applicant had been arrested by the above-mentioned officials on 22 August 2004 at 6.30 p.m. at their offices. The arrest warrant issued by the investigator indicates that the applicant acknowledged his guilt, had no observations regarding his arrest and that he wished to be legally represented. It bears the applicant’s signature, with no comments. The lower part of the last page of the record contains a printed statement (“довідка”) that was added later (it was dated 2007); this additional statement is signed by the investigator only and asserts that the applicant’s relatives were informed of his arrest. The applicant alleged that his family had been informed of his arrest on the evening of the following day (that is to say 23 August 2004). 9. After his arrest, the applicant signed a record, bearing no time, explaining his rights as a suspect, including the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer before he was first questioned. The relevant entry in the record indicates that the applicant expressed his wish to be represented by S., a lawyer who lived in Uzhhorod, some 70 kilometres from Berehove, and noted the address of the latter. 10. At about 4 p.m. on 22 August 2004, according to the applicant, and from 9 until 10 a.m. on that day, according to the official record, the applicant was questioned as a suspect by the investigator in the presence of B., a lawyer. The record of the questioning noted that the applicant had been informed of his rights as a suspect from 6.30 until 6.45 p.m. on that day and that a separate procedural document existed in this respect evidencing that he had wished to be legally represented. The handwritten entry in the record furthermore stated that the applicant wanted to have B. as his lawyer and that he acknowledged in full his guilt in respect of the robbery and murder. During the questioning, the applicant provided details regarding the robbery and admitted that he had hit M. in the head with a bat during the robbery but that he had done so instinctively, in self-defence. The applicant did not state what had become of the bat – namely where or in what circumstances he had hidden the bat after the murder. The applicant and B. signed the verbatim record, making no objections as to its contents. B. then left. 11. Later that day, from 8 until 8.30 p.m., the applicant took part in a videotaped reconstruction of the crime in the presence of a forensic expert, an investigator from the local police, two attesting witnesses and the investigator in the case. According to the Government, B. was apparently busy and was not able to participate in the reconstruction. No other lawyer was instructed to assist the applicant during this investigative step. According to the applicant, he repeated his request for S. to be called, but this was not done and he was forced by means of threats to testify. 12. During the reconstruction, which commenced near the place where the bat used for the murder had been hidden, the applicant pointed to the exact place where the bat was; the bat was then uncovered and retained as evidence. A copy of the verbatim record of the reconstruction provided to the Court by the applicant indicates that he was informed of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself. The verbatim record bears a handwritten “not” next to the following printed “agreed to testify”. The relevant part of the text is not visible on the copy of the record provided by the Government. The record furthermore contains the applicant’s statement that he had not been forced to testify by means of any psychological or physical violence. The applicant signed the record without indicating any objections as to its contents next to his signature. 13. At an unspecified time on the same date St. and K.A were questioned as suspects. St., being represented by B. (the same lawyer who represented the applicant), acknowledged his guilt in respect of the robbery. He stated, inter alia, that he had seen the applicant carrying a bat when they had been entering the victim’s house. K.A., having waived his right to legal assistance, admitted that he had taken part in the robbery. He furthermore participated, still unrepresented, in a videotaped reconstruction of the crime during which he stated, inter alia, that he had seen the applicant with a bat in his hands but had not seen who had murdered M. 14. On 23 August 2004 the investigator appointed B. to represent the applicant, and St., and admitted him to the proceedings. 15. On the same day the applicant, in the presence of B., participated in another videotaped reconstruction of the crime in the victim’s house. The applicant admitted his guilt and gave further details about the robbery and murder. He reiterated that he had hit M. on the head with the bat and stated that another suspect in the case had helped him to hide the bat afterwards. 16. On 26 August 2004 the applicant’s mother signed a contract with the lawyer S. concerning her son’s legal representation. On the same date S. contacted the prosecutor, who allowed S. to represent the applicant instead of B. The applicant furthermore made a written statement declaring that he was refusing the services of B. and wanted S. to act as his lawyer. 17. On 8 October 2004 medical experts examined the applicant following his complaint that he had been ill-treated by the police. No injuries were discovered on the applicant’s body. 18. On 14 October 2004 the video recording of the reconstruction of the crime of 23 August 2004 was played to the applicant in the presence of S. The applicant retracted his earlier confession and explained that he had only given it because he had been threatened and beaten up by the police on 22 August 2004. 19. On 2 September 2004, and 20 and 28 January and 17 February 2005 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his defence lawyer but refused to give any evidence. 20. On 19 January 2005 the prosecutors refused to institute a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegation that he had been beaten up by the police, having found the police officers’ actions to be lawful. 21. On 18 February 2005 the pre-trial investigation was completed and the applicant – together with St. and K.A. – was charged with robbery and murder. It was established that another person, I.K., had also participated in the robbery, but as he had absconded, he would have to be tried separately. 22. During the trial the applicant denied having participated in the robbery and the murder and refused to give any evidence. He stated that his earlier confessions to the crimes should not be admitted as evidence as they had been made under duress and in breach of his defence rights, including his right to be represented by a lawyer of his own choosing. He also argued that the bat which had been retained as evidence and examined by experts during the investigation had not been the same bat as that which he had pointed out during the reconstruction. He supported his allegation by referring to the fact that in the verbatim record, the prosecutor had described the bat as blue, while the experts who had subsequently examined it had described it as grey. 23. In April 2005 the police detained I.K. In the course of the trial St., A.K. and I.K all pleaded guilty to robbery but denied killing M. 24. On 29 August 2006 the Zakarpattya Regional Court of Appeal, acting as the first-instance court, convicted the applicant of murder and robbery and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. St., A.K. and I.K. were also found guilty of robbery but acquitted of murder. The hearing was held in the presence of the applicant’s new lawyer, D., who had replaced the lawyer S. on an unspecified date. 25. The court based the applicant’s conviction, among other evidence, on the confessions he had made during his questioning by the investigator on 22 August 2004, the reconstructions of the crime on 22 and 23 August 2004, the statements of his co-defendants that they had seen him with a bat in M.’s house, and physical evidence, including an expert’s report suggesting that the traces of blood found on the bat (the location of which had been pointed out by the applicant during the reconstruction of the crime on 22 August 2004) could have belonged to M. 26. By the same judgment, the court rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s submissions that he had made his self-incriminating statements under duress, referring to the results of the medical examination of 8 October 2004 (see paragraph 17 above) and the prosecutors’ decision of 19 January 2005 (see paragraph 20 above). 27. The court also found no violation of the applicant’s defence rights. It noted, inter alia, that on 22 August 2004 the prosecutor’s decision to appoint B. as the applicant’s lawyer had been lawful, because at the material time the applicant had not had a contract with S. for legal representation. It also observed that on 22 August 2004 the applicant had raised no objections to the questioning record. The court also suggested, without giving details, that there had been some technical errors in the procedural documents, in particular as regards the time of the applicant’s arrest and questioning, but that they did not affect the fairness of the respective investigative actions. 28. The court refuted the applicant’s allegation that the bat retained as evidence had been switched with another (see paragraph 22 above), noting that the disparity in the bat’s description by the experts and the prosecutor could have been explained by the fact that the latter was colour blind. 29. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court on points of law, reiterating his complaints. He stated, in particular, that he had not been represented by the lawyer of his choice, S., on 22 and 23 August 2004, but by B., who had been appointed by the investigator against the applicant’s will. He further stated that he had not been assisted by any lawyer when he had been forced to confess during the crime reconstruction of 22 August 2004. He also complained about the fact that B. had represented him and his co-accused St. at the same time (see paragraph 13 above) – a conflict of interest (as there had been important discrepancies in their respective statements) that should have prevented him from being allowed to do so. 30. On 12 April 2007 the Supreme Court, acting as the second-instance court, upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence in his presence. The applicant was not represented by a lawyer during the hearing, but he did not provide any further details in this regard. 31. The Supreme Court found that the applicant’s guilt was proved, inter alia, by the statements he had made during his questioning of 22 August 2004 and during the reconstructions of the crime. It noted in this respect that those statements had been corroborated by other evidence, including the testimony of his co-accused, and concluded that the lower court had correctly admitted the applicant’s self-incriminating statements as evidence. The court also noted that the details of the crime which the applicant had revealed in his statements could not have been known to him unless he had been the direct perpetrator. 32. Without mentioning the applicant’s arguments regarding the alleged breach of his defence rights, the Supreme Court found no procedural violations during the proceedings serious enough to necessitate it quashing the judgment. 33. On an unspecified date the applicant was released from prison.",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

AUSTRIA,3,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for family life);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction),Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska,"6. The applicant was born in 1968 and lives in Vittorio Veneto. 7. The applicant entered into a relationship with D.P., an Austrian national, and lived together with her in Vittorio Veneto. Their daughter, who is an Italian and Austrian national, was born in December 2006. Under Italian law the applicant and D.P. had joint custody of her. 8. The relationship between the applicant and D.P. deteriorated and the latter left the family home on 31 January 2008, taking their daughter with her. 9. The applicant applied to the Venice Youth Court (tribunale per i minorenni di Venezia) for an award of sole custody of the child and asked the court to issue a travel ban prohibiting her from leaving Italy without his consent. 10. On 8 February 2008 the Venice Youth Court issued a travel ban in respect of the applicant’s daughter. On the same day the applicant learned that D.P. had left Italy with the child and had travelled to Austria, where she intended to take up residence. 11. On 23 May 2008 the Venice Youth Court lifted the travel ban in respect of the applicant’s daughter, granted preliminary joint custody of the child to both parents, and authorised her to reside with her mother in Austria, having regard to her young age and close relationship with her mother. It also appointed an expert who was entrusted with the task of collecting the necessary information for a final decision on custody. In addition, the court granted the applicant access rights twice a month in a neutral location, noting that the meetings should alternate between Italy and Austria and that the dates and arrangements should be agreed with the expert. 12. According to the applicant, D.P. brought their daughter to Italy only once. Visits took place in Austria, although D.P. did not facilitate their organisation. At a later date visits ceased, allegedly due to D.P.’s obstructive behaviour. In a report of 15 May 2009 the expert noted that she was not in a position to evaluate the applicant’s ability to take care of his daughter. 13. According to the Government the applicant met his daughter fifteen times in Austria, where supervised visits took place between October 2008 and June 2009. Subsequently, he refused to travel to Austria without giving any reasons. 14. The applicant applied for assistance to secure his daughter’s return under the Hague Convention. His application was forwarded via the respective central authorities in Italy and Austria to the Leoben District Court (Bezirksgericht), where proceedings began on 19 June 2008. Subsequently, the court appointed an expert. 15. On 3 July 2008, the Leoben District Court dismissed the applicant’s application for the return of the child under the Hague Convention. Referring to the expert’s opinion and having regard to the very young age of the child, the court found that her return would constitute a grave risk for her within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention. 16. On 1 September 2008, the Leoben Regional Court (Landesgericht) set aside that decision because the applicant had not been duly heard in the proceedings. 17. On 21 November 2008 the Leoben District Court, having heard the applicant, again dismissed his application for his daughter’s return, referring to the Venice Youth Court’s decision of 23 May 2008. 18. On 7 January 2009 the Leoben Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, finding that returning the child to him and her separation from her mother would entail a grave risk of psychological harm within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention. 19. Meanwhile, in March 2009 D.P. brought proceedings before the Judenburg District Court, seeking an award of sole custody of the child. 20. On 26 May 2009 the Judenburg District Court held that it had jurisdiction with regard to custody, access and maintenance issues in respect of the child by virtue of Article 15(5) of EU Regulation 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (“the Brussels IIa Regulation”). 21. On 25 August 2009 the same court made a preliminary award of sole custody to D.P., referring to the child’s close links with Austria and the risk of danger to her well-being upon a possible return to Italy. 22. On 8 March 2010 the Judenburg District Court awarded D.P. sole custody of the child. 23. In the meantime, on 9 April 2009 the applicant made an application to the Venice Youth Court for his daughter’s return under Article 11(8) of the Brussels IIa Regulation. 24. In a judgment of 10 July 2009 the Venice Youth Court, having held a hearing, ordered the child’s return to Italy. The child would live with her mother, should the latter decide to return to Italy with her. In that event the Vittorio Veneto social services department was required to provide them with accommodation. In addition, a programme for the exercise of the applicant’s access rights would have to be established. If the child’s mother did not wish to return to Italy, the child was to reside with the applicant. 25. The Venice Youth Court found that it remained competent to deal with the case, as the Judenburg District Court had wrongly determined its jurisdiction under Article 15(5) of the Brussels IIa Regulation. It noted that its previous decision of 23 May 2008 had been designed as a temporary measure in order to re-establish contact between the applicant and his daughter through access rights and to obtain a basis for an expert opinion for the decision on custody of the child. However, the child’s mother had failed to co-operate with the appointed expert and had refused a programme of access rights for the applicant prepared by the expert. The latter had stated in her preliminary opinion that she was not in a position to answer all questions relating to the child’s best interests in a satisfactory manner. 26. On 21 July 2009 the Venice Youth Court issued a certificate of enforceability under Article 42 of the Brussels IIa Regulation. 27. On 22 September 2009 the applicant sought the enforcement of the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 10 July 2009. He was represented by counsel in these and all subsequent proceedings. 28. On 12 November 2009 the Leoben District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for enforcement of the Venice Youth Court’s order to return the child. It noted that the child’s mother was not willing to return to Italy with her. However, the child’s return without her mother would constitute a grave risk for her within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention. 29. On 20 January 2010 the Leoben Regional Court quashed that decision and granted the applicant’s request for enforcement. 30. The Leoben Regional Court noted that under Article 11(8) of the Brussels IIa Regulation a judgment refusing return under Article 13 of the Hague Convention was irrelevant where the court which was competent pursuant to the Brussels IIa Regulation had ordered the child’s return in a subsequent judgment. It confirmed that the Venice Youth Court had been competent to issue the judgment of 10 July 2009, as D.P. had unlawfully removed the child from Italy and the applicant had immediately requested her return. Moreover, the applicant had submitted a certificate of enforceability under Article 42 of the Brussels IIa Regulation in respect of the judgment at issue. The Austrian courts therefore had to recognise the judgment and to enforce it. They were not to establish anew whether the child’s return would be contrary to her best interests. In any event, there was no indication that the circumstances had changed since the Venice Youth Court had given its judgment. It was for the court of first instance to order appropriate measures of enforcement. 31. D.P. lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof) on 16 February 2010. 32. On 20 April 2010 the Supreme Court requested a preliminary ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), submitting a number of questions concerning the application of the Brussels IIa Regulation. 33. On 1 July 2010, the CJEU issued a preliminary ruling (C-211/10 PPU) confirming the jurisdiction of the Italian courts in the case and the enforceability of the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 10 July 2009. It found, in particular, that: (1) a provisional measure [such as the one issued by the Venice Youth Court in 2008] did not constitute a ‘judgment on custody that does not entail the return of the child’ within the meaning of Article 10(b) subparagraph (iv) of the Brussels IIa Regulation and could not be the basis of a transfer of jurisdiction to the courts of the Member State to which the child had been unlawfully removed; (2) Article 11(8) of the Regulation applied to a judgment of the court with jurisdiction ordering the return of the child, even if it was not preceded by a final judgment of that court relating to custody of the child; (3) Article 47(2) subparagraph (2) of the Regulation had to be interpreted as meaning that a judgment delivered subsequently by a court of the Member State of enforcement which made a provisional award of custody could not preclude enforcement of a certified judgment previously delivered by the court which had jurisdiction in the Member State of origin and had ordered the return of the child; and (4) enforcement of a certified judgment [ordering the child’s return] could not be refused by the Member State of enforcement because, as a result of a subsequent change of circumstances, it might be seriously detrimental to the best interests of the child. Such a change had to be pleaded before the court which had jurisdiction in the Member State of origin, which also had to hear any application to suspend the enforcement of its judgment. 34. On 13 July 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed D.P.’s appeal on points of law. It noted that according to the CJEU’s ruling the Austrian courts’ only task was to take the necessary steps for the enforcement of the return order, without proceeding to conduct any review of the merits of the decision. If D.P. asserted that the circumstances had changed since the Venice Youth Court had given its judgment, she had to apply to that court, which would also be competent to grant such an application suspensive effect. 35. The Supreme Court noted that it was now for the first-instance court to enforce the Venice Youth Court’s judgment. In doing so, it had to take into account the fact that the Venice Youth Court had in the first place envisaged that the child should reside with her mother upon her return to Italy and had ordered the Vittorio Veneto social services department to make accommodation available for them. The first-instance court would therefore have to ask the applicant to submit appropriate evidence, in particular confirmation from the Venice Youth Court or Vittorio Veneto municipal council, that accommodation was indeed available. The first-instance court would then have to order the mother to return with the child within two weeks. Should she fail to comply within that time-limit, the first-instance court would, upon the applicant’s request, have to order coercive measures for the child’s return, while still giving the mother the opportunity to avoid such drastic measures by voluntarily returning to Italy with the child. 36. On 31 August 2010 the Venice Youth Court refused to grant an application by D.P. for the enforcement of its judgment of 10 July 2009 to be stayed. Referring to that decision, the applicant asked the Leoben District Court to order his daughter’s return to Italy. 37. The applicant claimed that he had offered to make accommodation (apparently a flat belonging to him) available to D.P. and his daughter, but that the Leoben District Court had found that this did not fulfil the conditions set by the Venice Youth Court in its judgment of 10 July 2009. 38. On 17 February 2011 the Leoben District Court asked the applicant to submit evidence that appropriate accommodation would be made available to his daughter and her mother by the Vittorio Veneto social services department, as required by the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 10 July 2009. 39. By letter of 22 March 2011 the Austrian Federal Ministry of Justice, as Central Authority, informed its Italian counterpart accordingly and also noted that to date the condition had not been complied with. A similar letter was sent to the Italian Central Authority on 27 May 2011. Three further letters with similar content were sent to the Italian Central Authority prior to November 2011. 40. By a judgment of 23 November 2011 the Venice Youth Court withdrew D.P.’s custody rights and awarded the applicant sole custody of the child. It further ordered the child’s return to Italy to reside with the applicant in Vittorio Veneto. The court ordered the Vittorio Veneto social services department – if need be in co-operation with the neuropsychiatry department of the local health authority – to ensure that contact between the child and her mother was maintained and to give the child linguistic and educational support in order to assist her integration into her new family and social environment. 41. The Venice Youth Court referred to its decision of 23 May 2008, which had been aimed at preserving the child’s relationship with her mother while re-establishing contact with the applicant, noting that such attempts had failed owing to a lack of co-operation from the mother. It had therefore ordered the child’s return to Italy in its judgment of 10 July 2009. It further considered that D.P. had unlawfully removed the child to Austria and had subsequently deprived her of contact with the applicant without good reason. She had thus acted contrary to the child’s best interests. It therefore found that sole custody was to be awarded to the applicant. Given that to date any attempts to establish contact step by step had failed, his daughter was to reside with him immediately. The court noted that this would entail a difficult transition for her, but considered that the damage caused by growing up without her father would weigh even heavier. The court considered that the social services department would have to give the child educational and linguistic support to help her settle in her new family and social environment and to maintain contact with her mother. Finally, the court considered that the child’s return would not entail any grave risk of psychological or physical harm within the meaning of Article 11 of the Brussels IIa Regulation, which in turn referred to Article 13 of the Hague Convention. 42. D.P. did not appeal against this judgment. 43. On 19 March 2012 the applicant notified the Leoben District Court of the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 23 November 2011. He also submitted a certificate of enforceability under Article 42 of the Brussels IIa Regulation. 44. On 3 May 2012 the Leoben District Court dismissed the applicant’s request for enforcement of the Venice Youth Court’s order for the child’s return. Referring to the Supreme Court’s decision of 13 July 2010, it considered that he had failed to submit proof that appropriate accommodation would be made available for the child and her mother upon their return. 45. The applicant appealed. He submitted, in particular, that the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 23 November 2011 had granted him sole custody of the child and had ordered her return to Italy, where she was to reside with him. 46. On 15 June 2012 the Leoben Regional Court granted the applicant’s appeal and ordered D.P. to hand the child over to the applicant within fourteen days, noting that enforcement measures would be taken in case of failure to comply. 47. The Regional Court found that the condition that appropriate accommodation be made available to the child and the mother was no longer valid: in its judgment of 23 November 2011 the Venice Youth Court had awarded sole custody of the child to the applicant and had ordered that she return to reside with him. The applicant had submitted that judgment together with a certificate of enforceability under Article 42 of the Brussels IIa Regulation. The mother’s obligation to return the child to the applicant thus resulted directly from the Venice Youth Court’s judgment of 23 November 2011. Finally, the Leoben Regional Court noted that the award of custody made by the Judenburg District Court on 8 March 2010 could not prevent the enforcement of the Venice Youth Court’s judgment. The latter had retained its competence to rule on custody matters, as D.P. had unlawfully removed the child to Austria and the applicant had made a timely request for her return under Article 10 of the Brussels IIa Regulation. 48. D.P. did not comply with the return order. She lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court. 49. On 13 September 2012 the Supreme Court rejected D.P.’s extraordinary appeal on points of law, as the case did not raise an important legal issue. It noted that the return order had become final and was enforceable. The first-instance court now had no other task than to define the steps to be taken to enforce the return order. The CJEU had clarified that where there was a certificate of enforceability under Article 42(1) of the Brussels IIa Regulation, the requested court had to proceed with the enforcement of the main judgment. Any questions relating to the merits of the return decision, in particular the question whether the requirements for ordering a return had been met, had to be raised before the courts of the requesting State in accordance with the laws of that State. Consequently, any change in circumstances affecting the issue of whether a return would endanger the child’s well-being had to be raised before the competent court of the requesting State. D.P.’s argument that the child’s return would lead to serious harm for her and entail a violation of Article 8 of the Convention was therefore not relevant in the proceedings before the Austrian courts, but rather had to be raised before the competent Italian courts. 50. On 1 October 2012 the Leoben District Court held that it was not competent to conduct the enforcement proceedings and transferred the case to the Wiener Neustadt District Court, apparently on account of a change of residence by D.P. and the child. 51. On 4 October 2012 the Wiener Neustadt District Court issued a decision on the next steps to be taken in the enforcement proceedings. The judge noted, in particular, that a continuation of the path chosen by both parents, namely the use of the child in the conflict between them, would lead to the child being traumatised, especially if the parents’ unbending position eventually led to an enforcement of the return order by coercive measures as a last resort. He noted that the best interests of the child required the parents to reach a workable compromise. The judge therefore proposed that a hearing in the presence of both parents be held in order to seek a constructive solution. Accordingly, he asked both parents to indicate within two weeks whether they were ready to take part in the proposed hearing. The judge further noted that if the parents were not willing to take part in the hearing, the enforced return of the child would be arranged. In this connection, the judge stated that any trauma suffered by the child because of such enforcement would then have to be laid at the door of the parents. Moreover, the applicant would be required to find a way to deal with the trauma caused to the child. 52. On 16 October 2012 the applicant informed the Wiener Neustadt District Court that he was not ready to take part in a hearing with the child’s mother, but wanted to arrange the return of the child with the least traumatic impact possible. He therefore suggested that he come to Austria with his parents to pick up the child or, alternatively, that D.P. travel to Italy with the child to hand her over. He therefore asked D.P. to either set a pick-up date in Austria or to inform him of a date when she would bring the child to Italy. 53. On 23 October 2012 D.P. informed the District Court that she was ready to take part in the proposed hearing. She also informed the court that she had appealed against the decision which had transferred the case from the Leoben District Court to the Wiener Neustadt District Court. Consequently, the decision establishing the latter court’s competence had not become final. She therefore asked the court to await the decision on her appeal before taking any further steps. 54. In the related case brought before the European Court of Human Rights by the mother of the child (Povse v. Austria (dec.), no. 3890/11, 18 June 2013), the Court granted a request for interim measures on 4 December 2012. It asked the Government to stay the child’s return to Italy. Having obtained information from the Austrian and Italian Governments and from the applicants, the Court lifted the interim measure on 18 February 2013. 55. On 4 April 2013 the applicant’s counsel requested that the enforcement proceedings be continued. 56. On 25 April 2013 the Wiener Neustadt District Court decided to continue the enforcement proceedings and, on 30 April 2013, requested that the parties submit their views within two weeks in order to reach a comprehensive solution for the benefit of the child. According to the Government, the applicant refused to contribute to that process. 57. In a decision of 20 May 2013 the Wiener Neustadt District Court ordered D.P. to hand over the child to the applicant by 7 July 2013 and stated that in case of failure to comply coercive measures would be applied. The District Court noted that it was for D.P. to choose whether she would accompany her daughter to Italy or whether she would set a date within that timeframe for the applicant to pick up the child in Austria. Furthermore, the District Court, referring to the Supreme Court’s judgment of 13 September 2012, repeated that it was for the Italian courts to examine any issues relating to the child’s well-being. It noted finally that the deadline for handing over the child had been set in such a way as to allow her to finish the school year in Austria. 58. As D.P. did not comply with the order to hand over the child, an attempt to enforce it by means of coercive measures was made in the early hours of 24 July 2013 without prior notice. The attempt, in which the judge, trained bailiffs and police officers participated, was unsuccessful, as D.P. and the child were not present at their place of residence. The applicant had been informed of the planned enforcement and was present. 59. On 9 August 2013 D.P. asked the Venice Youth Court to stay the enforcement of its judgment of 23 November 2011. Furthermore, she sought an award of sole custody in her favour. She alleged that she had not been adequately heard in the initial proceedings. Furthermore, she asserted that there had been a change of circumstances, in that her daughter was fully integrated into her living environment in Austria and had formed bonds with D.P.’s family, consisting of her mother, the latter’s partner and her younger half-brother. There had been no contact between father and child for a lengthy period and the child had no knowledge of Italian. D.P. submitted an expert opinion, according to which the child’s return to her father through the use of coercive measures would cause serious harm to the child. 60. On 14 August 2013 the Wiener Neustadt District Court dismissed D.P.’s application for a stay of enforcement, but decided to provisionally refrain from returning the child until the Venice Youth Court gave a decision on D.P.’s action before it. 61. In his observations of 18 October 2013 the applicant claimed that he had not yet been duly notified of the fresh proceedings before the Venice Youth Court. The Government, in their submissions of 18 November 2013, stated that the proceedings were pending before the Italian courts and that the parties had been notified of the dates of hearings. Moreover, the Government submitted that the applicant had not taken advantage of numerous opportunities to re-establish communication between himself and his daughter. 62. According to information provided by the applicant in a letter of 17 November 2014, the Venice Youth Court held hearings in January and April 2014 in the presence of both parents and fixed a series of meetings between the applicant and his daughter. A number of meetings took place between February and May at intervals of three weeks in Austria and then in June in Italy. The mother of the child was present at the meetings and on some occasions also her partner. The applicant alleges that on two occasions the mother’s partner threatened him and disrupted the meetings. According to the applicant meetings which had been scheduled for July and August 2014 did not take place as the mother refused to bring the child to Italy. The Venice Youth Court held a further hearing on 29 September 2014 and scheduled further meetings in Italy between the applicant and his daughter for December 2014 and January 2015. The proceedings before the Italian courts are still pending.",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Budapest. 6. At the material time the applicant was a managing director of a tour operator limited liability company, HTC Kft. 7. On an unspecified date criminal investigations were opened against HTC Kft and another limited liability company on suspicion of bankruptcy fraud. On 8 September 2000 the Budapest VI/VII Police Department ordered the search of the applicant’s flat and vehicle, since there were grounds to believe that as the managing director of HTC Kft, he kept certain company documents at home. 8. On 14 February 2007 the applicant was heard as suspect on charges of bankruptcy fraud. 9.

The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Vilnius. 6. By a decision of 18 June 2002 the Vilnius Region Administration restored the applicant’s property rights to 0.23 hectares of land in the context of restitution of property rights which had been violated by the unlawful nationalisation during the Soviet regime. Subsequently, the plot of land was registered in the land registry in her name. 7. On 15 July 2002 the applicant sold the plot of land for 76,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL; approximately 22,000 euros (EUR)) to two private buyers, E.T. and D.Z., who became the owners of the plot. 8. In August 2003 the Vilnius Region Administration found that a mistake had been made in granting the plot of land to the applicant and notified her and, later, the public prosecutor. 9. In June 2004 the public prosecutor initiated civil proceedings to have the decision of 18 June 2002 and sale contract annulled on the ground that in 1993 part of the same plot of land had already been sold by the State to a private buyer, R.G. Moreover, the plot was situated in a community garden (sodininkų bendrija) and therefore the former owner’s rights to it could not be restored under the Law on the Restoration of Citizens’ Rights of Ownership to Existing Real Property (Piliečių nuosavybės teisių į išlikusį nekilnojamąjį turtą atkūrimo įstatymas – hereinafter “Law on Restitution”). 10. At the same time criminal proceedings had been instituted into possible forgery of the documents. However, suspicions with regard to the applicant were not confirmed, and the proceedings were discontinued in July 2006. 11. The Vilnius Region Administration acknowledged that the plot of land had been assigned to the applicant unlawfully. 12. On 20 August 2004 assets belonging to the applicant amounting in value to LTL 76,000, including bank deposits and her pension, were seized to ensure satisfaction of the prosecutor’s civil claim. 13. On 5 May 2005 the Vilnius 1st City District Court granted the prosecutor’s claim. The transfer of title involving the plot of land was annulled. Ownership was awarded to R.G. and the applicant was ordered to pay LTL 76,000 to E.T. and D.Z. The applicant did, however, reserve the right to have her ownership rights to a plot of land restored. 14. On 15 September 2005 the Vilnius Regional Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant. 15. By a final decision of 22 March 2006 the Supreme Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts. 16. On 30 May 2006 the order requiring the applicant to pay LTL 76,000 was enforced by a bailiff. 17. According to information submitted by the applicant, she had to borrow money to comply with the order to pay LTL 76,000 and to cover other legal expenses. She also alleged that the unlawful actions of the authorities and the related court proceedings had caused her health to deteriorate significantly, as she had suffered stress and later become disabled. 18. In November 2005, after receiving a refusal from the Vilnius Region Administration to compensate her for her loss, the applicant brought a claim against the State before the administrative courts for LTL 90,479 (about EUR 26,200) in pecuniary damage and LTL 300,000 (about EUR 87,000) in non-pecuniary damage. 19. By a final decision of 15 November 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision of the first instance court and granted the applicant’s claim in part awarding her LTL 838 (approximately EUR 240) for pecuniary (part of her legal costs and expenses) and LTL 2,000 (approximately EUR 580) for non-pecuniary damage. The court also concluded that the unlawful actions of the national authorities had violated the applicant’s legitimate expectations and had had an impact on her health, given her old age. However, the court dismissed most of the applicant’s claims to have reimbursed the pecuniary loss she had allegedly sustained as a result of the annulment of the transfer of title to the plot and the court proceedings she had had to undergo. In that connection, the courts noted that the applicant had no legal grounds to claim compensation for pecuniary damage, given that she had unlawfully had her ownership rights to the disputed plot restored. 20. Later, by a decision of 9 April 2009 the Vilnius Region Administration restored the applicant’s property rights by granting her a new plot of land of 0.23 hectare.",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

Allegations by the applicant regarding a real risk of ill-treatment were dismissed, and he was detained pending expulsion. The District Court assessing the risks stated that “[t]he claims of the representative ... are of a speculative nature and not confirmed by the case materials” 19. The above judgment was upheld on appeal by the City Court on 24 October 2014. Claims by the applicant under Article 3 of the Convention were dismissed with reference to the District Court’s assessment of the case, which took into consideration “...the nature of the administrative offence, the character of the accused [who was criminally convicted in Russia]... 20. According to the latest submissions of his representative in 2015, the applicant was still in detention. 21. On 18 December 2013 the applicant lodged a request for refugee status, referring to persecution in Tajikistan and a real risk of ill-treatment. 22. On 15 September 2014 his request was refused by a final administrative decision of the migration authorities. The applicant challenged that decision in the courts, referring, inter alia, to the risk of illtreatment. 23. On 12 November 2015 his appeals were dismissed by a final decision of the City Court.","['3', '5']",['5-4'],[],['5'],['5-1'],[],1

The applicant is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. 6. At the time of the events the applicant company was the creditor of company C. which, in its turn, was the creditor of company P. On 1 October 2005 the applicant company and company C. concluded an agreement by which the debt owed by company P. to company C. was assigned to the applicant company in lieu of the debt owed by company C. to the applicant company. 7. Later company P. became bankrupt and the insolvency procedure was commenced in its respect. On 10 May 2006 the applicant company requested that the Chişinău Economic Court allow it to replace company C. in the list of creditors of company P. In so doing, the applicant company relied on an agreement that it had concluded on 1 October 2005 with company C. 8. On 5 June 2006 the Chişinău Economic Court held a public hearing in the case and accepted the applicant company’s request. As a result the applicant company replaced company C. in the list of creditors of company P. with a debt of some 14,015,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of some 901,000 euros (EUR)). 9. On 16 October 2006 company C. lodged an appeal against the above decision on the ground, inter alia, that the agreement of 1 October 2005 was faulty and that the persons who had signed it from both sides had acted ultra vires. 10. On 9 November 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice examined the appeal lodged by company C. in a hearing to which the applicant company had not been summoned to appear. The other parties participated in the hearing. The Supreme Court upheld the appeal and reversed the judgment of the lower court. In particular, the Supreme Court held that the person who had signed the agreement of 1 October 2005 on behalf of company C. had acted ultra vires, because at the relevant time she had been on maternity leave. The decision of the Supreme Court of Justice was final and the applicant company was excluded from the list of creditors of company P.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Elazığ. 5. On 19 October 1999 the applicant sat an examination in order to become a public servant. She was successful in the examination and on an unspecified date she was informed by the State Personnel Department attached to the Prime Minister’s office that she had been appointed to the post of security officer in the Batman branch of TEDAŞ, the state-run Electricity Company, the first of the five choices that the applicant had made in the course of the examination procedure. 6. On 5 July 2000 the human resources department of the Batman branch of TEDAŞ informed the applicant that she would not be appointed as she did not fulfil the requirements of “being a man” and “having completed military service”. 7. In a letter dated 9 August 2000 and addressed to the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the human resources department of TEDAŞ requested the Ministry to provide a list of new persons to be appointed instead of a number of persons, including the applicant, who could not be recruited for various reasons. As regards the applicant and three other persons, B.U., R.B. and A.O.C., the human resources department of TEDAŞ informed the Ministry that they were women and therefore could not work as security officers. In the letter, it was stated that security officers had the task of protecting depots, switchyards and transformer stations in rural areas far from city centres, against attacks and in case of fire and sabotage. They were obliged to work day and night and to use weapons, including those with long barrels, and physical force in case of an attack. It was therefore considered that women were not suitable for the post of security officer. 8. On 18 September 2000 the applicant lodged an action against the general directorate of TEDAŞ with the Ankara Administrative Court requesting the annulment of the decision of the Batman branch of TEDAŞ with all its financial consequences. In her deposition, the applicant noted that being a man was not a requirement for appointment to the post in question and that she fulfilled all the requirements for that post. The applicant also noted that she had been deprived of the opportunity to be appointed to one of the other four posts that she had indicated following the refusal in question and that she could not sit the examination again in 2000 as she had succeeded in 1999. 9. On an unspecified date the general directorate of TEDAŞ submitted to the administrative court that one of the requirements for the post in question had been declared by the State Personnel Department as “having completed military service” and that therefore only men could be appointed to the post. The applicant, being a woman, could therefore not be recruited as a security officer. 10. On 27 February 2001 the Ankara Administrative Court annulled the decision of the Batman branch of TEDAŞ. The court held that the requirement of “having completed military service” should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that there had been no restriction on women working as security officers in TEDAŞ. The court also noted that another woman, Y.P., who had also brought a case against TEDAŞ for the same reasons as the applicant, had been appointed to the post of security officer after she had lodged the case. 11. Subsequent to the judgment of 27 February 2001, the applicant was offered a contract by the Batman branch of TEDAŞ. On 11 July 2001 she took up her duties. On 1 March 2002 she was transferred to the Elazığ branch of TEDAŞ as her husband lived and worked in that city. 12. On 8 May 2001 TEDAŞ lodged an appeal against the judgment of 27 February 2001, requesting the Supreme Administrative Court to order a stay of execution of the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court and to subsequently quash it. The representative of TEDAŞ submitted, inter alia, that the announcement of the post of security officers in the Batman branch contained the requirement of “having completed military service” and not “in respect of male candidates, having completed military service”, unlike the post in the Gaziantep branch of TEDAŞ, which first rejected Y.P. According to the lawyer, this expression demonstrated that the post was reserved for male candidates only and that therefore the status of the applicant was different from that of Y.P. 13. On 27 June 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the request for a stay of execution. 14. On 31 March 2003 the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Ankara Administrative Court, holding that the requirement regarding military service demonstrated that the post in question was reserved for male candidates and that this requirement was lawful having regard to the nature of the post and the public interest. The high court therefore found that the administration’s decision had been in accordance with the law. 15. On 1 August 2003 the applicant requested rectification of the decision of 31 March 2003. In her petition, she submitted that the post of security officer was not reserved for male candidates and that therefore the high court’s decision was in breach of the principle of equality. 16. On 17 March 2004 the applicant was dismissed from her post at the Elazığ branch of TEDAŞ. According to the letter sent by the deputy head of the human resources department of TEDAŞ to the Elazığ branch, the applicant’s contract was to be terminated on account of the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court dated 31 March 2003. 17. On 22 March 2004 the applicant lodged a petition with the Supreme Administrative Court. She maintained that she had lost her post and requested the high court to order a stay of execution of the decision of 31 March 2003. She noted, in her petition, that the post in question should not be reserved only for men, since certain acts, such as a body search on women, should be carried out by female officers. 18. On 16 April 2004 her request was dismissed by the Twelfth Division. 19. On 11 October 2005 the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court further dismissed the applicant’s request for rectification. 20. On 21 February 2006 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case, taking into consideration the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court. 21. On 24 April 2006 the applicant appealed. In her deposition she noted that there were three other similar cases brought against TEDAŞ by female candidates for the same reasons as hers and that one of these cases, brought by R.B., who had also not been appointed to a post of security officer in the Batman branch of TEDAŞ on the same grounds as those applied to the applicant, was pending before the Supreme Administrative Court’s General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions. She further noted that she would have lost the opportunity to apply for another public post, had the high court decided in favour of TEDAŞ. 22. On 6 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court’s General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions (Danıştay İdari Dava Daireleri Genel Kurulu) issued a decision in favour of R.B. The General Assembly held that the requirement of “having completed military service” should be considered to apply only to male candidates and that the refusal to appoint R.B. to the Batman branch of TEDAŞ had therefore been unlawful. 23. On 12 February 2008 the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of 21 February 2006, holding that the latter was in accordance with the law. In its decision, the court noted the content of the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court’s General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions but did not comment on it. 24. On 17 March 2008 the applicant requested rectification of the decision of 12 February 2008, maintaining that the decision in question constituted a breach of the principle of equality and the right to a fair hearing since the Supreme Administrative Court’s General Assembly of Administrative Proceedings Divisions had ruled in favour of R.B. She further claimed that there had been discrimination, since pursuant to the Constitution no distinction could be made in public employment. 25. On 17 September 2008 the Twelfth Division of the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request.","['14', '6', '8']","['6-1', '8-1']",[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Piatra-Neamț. 6. The applicant (also referred to herein as prosecutor L.), in her capacity as a prosecutor at the prosecutor’s office attached to the Neamț County Court, initiated criminal proceedings against A.B. on two occasions. She filed an indictment proposing A.B.’s conviction in both sets of proceedings. 7. The first indictment, filed by the applicant on 17 January 2000, sought the conviction of A.B. for the offences of making false declarations and destruction. On 20 September 2001 the Ploiești District Court found A.B. guilty as charged and sentenced her to six months’ imprisonment in respect of each offence. The judgment was upheld by the Prahova County Court, which dismissed an appeal lodged by A.B. on 7 January 2002. On 22 March 2002 the Ploiești Court of Appeal allowed an appeal on points of law lodged by A.B. in part, noting that the limitation period had expired in respect of the offence of destruction. 8. The second indictment of 25 July 2001 was not approved by the chief prosecutor, who ordered the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against A.B. 9. On 7 February 2002 disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the applicant following a complaint being lodged by A.B. On 6 March 2002 the prosecutor’s office attached to the Supreme Court of Justice found that the applicant had not committed any disciplinary offence and closed the investigation. 10. A.S., a journalist at the national newspaper Romania Liberă, wrote two articles concerning the applicant’s professional activity in connection with the criminal proceedings against A.B. 11. The first article published on 13 February 2002 was entitled “Judicial corruption. Prosecutor L. falsified two indictments! An innocent person was sentenced to prison” and had six sections. The first section, entitled “Professional dross, confirmed by her superiors” (“Rebut professional, confirmat de șefi”), referred to an allegedly “falsified” indictment filed by the applicant on 25 July 2001. It concerned A.B., who according to the journalist had been innocent and a victim of the applicant’s corrupt actions. In the journalist’s opinion the fact that this indictment had been invalidated by the chief prosecutor proved that it had been the result of falsification and could be considered professional dross (“rebut professional”). 12. In the second section, entitled “Exclusion from the magistracy” (“Excludere din magistratură”), the journalist referred to “the cheating prosecutor L.” (“procurorul măsluitor”) who “did not manage to send A.B. before a court on the basis of her falsified indictment on this occasion. However she had already managed to send A.B. before a court of justice on the basis of another indictment, the product of scandalous falsification”. It was stated that an examination of the applicant’s conduct in connection with the first indictment “could result, besides criminal charges against her for abuse of position, in her rapid exclusion from the magistracy by the disciplinary board of the public prosecutor’s office. By misleading her superiors, cheating prosecutor L. managed to send the defendant A.B. before a court on 17 January 2000 for criminal damage and making false declarations. The lies and the wilfully erroneous interpretation contained in the ten pages of the second falsified indictment could fill a whole chapter in ‘a real handbook of judicial corruption’”. 13. The third and the fourth sections of the article concerned civil proceedings brought by A.B., without making any reference to the applicant. The fifth section concerned a complaint of criminal damage lodged by “the mafia of crooked businessmen” against A.B. and allocated to “cheating prosecutor L.” In the last section, the journalist accused the applicant, “the cheating prosecutor”, of causing A.B. to be sentenced to prison by lying to the courts with her “falsified indictment”. 14. The second article, published on 22 February 2002, was entitled “E.L., the prosecutor who falsifies indictments”. It referred to the conviction of A.B. on the basis of an indictment drafted by the applicant. The journalist claimed to have exposed the alleged influence exercised over the applicant by S.E., directly interested in the affair, which had led to A.B.’s conviction. According to the journalist, S.E. had repeatedly “brought a variety of food products to [the applicant’s] home in bags or in boot of her car (...). Once she brought a pig cut in half to [the applicant’s] home, leaving bloodstains in the building’s corridors”. 15. On 15 April 2002 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint for defamation against A.S. The applicant complained that A.S. had damaged her reputation and dignity by publishing the two above-mentioned articles in February 2002. She sought one million Romanian lei (ROL) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. 16. By a judgment of 3 November 2003, the Călărași District Court found the journalist guilty of defamation and sentenced him to a criminal fine of 10,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL), the equivalent of EUR 270. The journalist and the newspaper were jointly ordered to pay the applicant damages of ROL 300,000,000, the equivalent of EUR 8,000. The court found that the expressions “falsifier and cheater” did not correspond to reality, as a disciplinary investigation had concluded that the applicant had conducted herself professionally and appropriately in connection with the charges she had brought against A.B. in her capacity as a prosecutor. The court noted that in February 2002, when the articles had been published, the journalist had been aware that the prosecutor’s indictment in the first set of proceedings had been upheld by the first two levels of the domestic courts and the appeal on points of law was still pending. The court also noted that the journalist had been aware that the disciplinary investigation against the applicant was pending when he had written the articles. It therefore held that this should have caused the journalist to exercise a certain amount of caution in his approach and use of language, given that he could have exposed the applicant to disciplinary and even criminal sanctions. 17. The district court examined the indictment of 17 January 2000, mentioned by A.S. in his first article, and noted that it had been upheld by final decisions of the domestic courts. As regards the second indictment, the court noted that it had not been approved by the chief prosecutor on 18 January 2002. The court also noted that at the time the articles were published the chief prosecutor’s decision was not yet final, as a complaint had been lodged against it. The court considered that the refusal of the chief prosecutor to approve the applicant’s indictment should not have led the journalist to the conclusion that the applicant had falsified the indictment. 18. The court concluded that in the two articles the journalist had overstepped the limits of acceptable speech provided by Article 10 of the Convention. 19. Journalist A.S. and the newspaper appealed against this judgment. On 28 December 2004 the Hunedoara County Court allowed the appeal, quashed the first-instance judgment and proceeded to rehear the case. It acquitted the journalist of the defamation charge and dismissed the applicant’s request for damages. The county court held that the journalist had merely provided details of A.B.’s situation as it emerged from the court records. It also held that the article published on 22 February 2002 had simply been a reproduction of the administrative complaints lodged by A.B. with the Ministry of Justice and the Public Prosecutor’s Office. The county court classified the relevant statements of the journalists as value judgments and found that the expressions used were to be examined in connection with the function of the press in a democratic society to impart information and ideas on all matters of public interest, as was the case in respect of the matter before it, which concerned the administration of justice. It referred to the judgment Dalban v. Romania ([GC], no. 28114/95, § 49, ECHR 1999VI), noting that the journalist had had recourse to a certain degree of exaggeration and provocation. 20. The relevant domestic provisions of the Civil and Criminal Codes concerning slander and defamation and liability for paying damages in force at the material time, as well as the subsequent developments in the legislation, are described in Timciuc v. Romania (no. 28999/03, §§ 95-97, 12 October 2010).",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Khachmaz. 6. The applicant’s son, Zakir Babayev (Z.B.), was born in 1991; on 3 July 2009 he was drafted into the army to perform his compulsory military service. From October 2009 he served as a sniper in Gadabay region in military unit no. 171. 7. On the morning of 14 November 2009 Z.B. was on guard duty with one other soldier (Q.S.) at a military post called “A” in Gadabay region. At around 11 a.m. he left his post and went into the nearby forest, where two peasants were cutting wood. Z.B. called the applicant using the telephone of one of the peasants and asked his father to provide him with some belongings. He also asked the applicant to send him a mobile telephone topup card worth ten Azerbaijani manats (AZN). During the telephone conversation he was in a good mood and did not complain about any problems. Z.B. also asked the applicant to tell his mother to leave her mobile telephone turned on as he would call her later. Following that conversation, the applicant bought mobile telephone top-up cards and sent their passwords to his son by a telephone message. 8. According to the material in the case file, following the telephone conversation with the applicant, Z.B. returned to his guard duty post. At around noon Q.S. left the post in order to change the guard and Z.B. remained alone. A few minutes later the soldiers heard a gunshot and went to the post, where they discovered Z.B.’s body. 9. On 14 November 2009 criminal proceedings were instituted under Article 125 (incitement to suicide) of the Criminal Code by the Gazakh Military Prosecutor. 10. On the same day a record of an inspection of the scene of the crime was drawn up and signed by the commander of military unit no. 171, Major A.F. It was also signed by two attesting witnesses, E.Q. and N.D., who were soldiers in the same military unit. The record states that the inspection began at 4.30 p.m. and ended at 6 p.m. According to the record, Z.B. had been wearing a shoe and four socks on his left foot; however, the shoe and the sock of his right foot had been taken off. His right shoe had been found next to his body. According to the record, one cartridge, a pen and a note written on a cigarette pack were found at the crime scene. Various photographs of Z.B.’s body, the cartridge, the pen and the note were taken. The note read as follows: “I, Z.B., commit suicide and nobody is responsible for that. I commit suicide because I don’t want to be a burden to anyone. Mum and Dad, forgive me. Goodbye to everyone; goodbye to life. Signature. Z.B.” 11. On the same day a record of the examination was drawn up by the investigator in charge of the case, who examined Z.B.’s body at the headquarters of military unit no. 171 in Gadabay region. According to the record, the examination began at 9 p.m. and ended at 10 p.m. Various photographs of Z.B.’s body were taken. 12. On 15 November 2009 a record of the examination of the body was drawn up in the presence of a forensic expert in the city of Ganja. 13. On the same date a post-mortem examination of Z.B.’s body was carried out. Report no. 02 dated 15 November 2009 showed that death had resulted from one gunshot wound to the left part of the rib cage. The expert found that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform had become unstitched. The expert did not find any other injury on Z.B.’s body or uniform. 14. On 17 November 2009 the investigator questioned nine soldiers of the military unit in which Z.B. had served. The soldiers stated that Z.B. had never been ill-treated during his military service. One of the soldiers, Q.S., further stated that when they had been on guard duty on 14 November 2009, Z.B. had been in a bad mood and had told him about his family problems. In particular, according to Q.S., the applicant’s son told him that he had talked to his mother-in-law, who had said that his parents had gone to Russia and would not be visiting him. However, another soldier (N.D.) stated that on 14 November 2009 Z.B. had been in a good mood and had told him that he had talked to his mother-in-law by telephone. 15. On 17 November 2009 the investigator also took signature and writing samples from the soldiers of the military unit in order to identify the author of the written note found at the crime scene. 16. On 19 November 2009 the investigator requested the Khachmaz District Department of Education to provide the investigation with the signature and samples of the applicant’s son’s writing. 17. On 24 November 2009 the investigator also sent an operational request (əməliyyat tapşırığı) to the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171, asking him to investigate whether Z.B. had been subjected to unlawful actions during his military service. In a letter dated 30 November 2009 and marked “secret”, the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171, a lieutenant-colonel (Y.S.), replied to the investigator’s request of 24 November 2009. He noted that according to the information obtained after having taken operational measures (əməliyyat tədbirləri), on 14 November 2009, before going to the guard post, Z.B. had had a dispute with a sergeant (S.H.) and a soldier (Q.S.), who had beaten him. Around five minutes after this incident, a gunshot had been heard and Q.S., S.H. and another soldier (K.M.) had gone to the post, where they had discovered Z.B.’s body. It was also indicated in the letter that the soldiers had removed Z.B.’s body after the incident in order to help him, but upon realising that he was dead they had laid the body back in its original place. 18. On 24 November 2009 the investigator sent another operational request to the head of the Khachmaz District Police Office, asking him to investigate whether Z.B. had had any family problems, whether Z.B. had been engaged to anyone, or whether any of his close relatives had been suffering from any psychological illnesses. By a letter of 7 December 2009, the head of the Khachmaz District Police Office informed the investigator that Z.B. had had no family problems, that he had not been engaged to anyone and that his relatives had not been suffering from any psychological illnesses. 19. By a decision of 25 November 2009, the investigator recognised the applicant as a legal heir of the victim (zərərçəkmiş şəxsin hüquqi varisi). On the same day the applicant was questioned by the investigator. He stated that at around 11 a.m. on 14 November 2009 he had talked to his son by telephone. Z.B. had been in a good mood and had not complained about anything. Z.B. had asked the applicant to tell his mother to leave her mobile telephone turned on as he would call her later. The applicant further stated that at the request of his son he had bought mobile top-up cards and sent their passwords to him by a telephone message. The applicant also stated that his son had not had a fiancée or a mother-in-law and that he had not had any family problems. 20. On 4 December 2009 the investigator ordered forensic medical, ballistic, chemical and trace examinations. Report no. 16771/72/73 dated 29 December 2009 showed that Z.B. had used his service weapon – an SVD-type D6197 sniper rifle – to commit suicide. The report further found that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform had become unstitched and that this could have resulted either from contact with a blunt object or the use of physical force. 21. On 7 December 2009 the investigator ordered a handwriting examination of the written note found at the crime scene. Report no. 16713 dated 28 December 2009 concluded that a comparison of the samples submitted to the examination showed that the note had similarities with Z.B.’s writing and signature. Report no. 709 dated 27 January 2010 concluded that the coloured elements used in the writing of the note in question and of the pen found at the scene of the crime had the same chemical characteristics. 22. According to a document entitled “Instruction” (Göstəriş) dated 14 December 2009 the Deputy Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan gave various instructions to the prosecuting authorities in connection with the criminal proceedings relating to Z.B.’s death. In particular, he asked the prosecuting authorities to inspect the scene of the crime. The relevant part of the document reads as follows: “It appears from the case material that the Gazakh Military Prosecutor’s Office received the information that Z.B. died ... and the agents of the prosecuting authorities went to the scene of the crime, but it was not possible for them to inspect the scene of the crime, given the foggy weather conditions in the mountainous area. The military commander who carried out the preliminary inspection of the scene of the crime presented the collected material evidence to the Gazakh Military Prosecutor’s Office. In order to reconstruct the conditions in which the incident took place, the scene of the crime should again be inspected ...” 23. On 11 January 2010 the investigator visited the “A” military post and inspected the scene of the crime. According to the record of the inspection (dated 11 January 2010), it began at 2.30 p.m. and ended at 3.40 p.m. The investigator took various photographs of the area where the military post was situated. 24. On the same day the investigator questioned four soldiers, including S.H. and Q.S. They denied having beaten Z.B. on 14 November 2009 and submitted that Z.B. had never been subjected to ill-treatment. As regards the investigator’s question regarding the fact that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform had been unstitched, they stated that they had not noticed it. 25. On 12 January 2010 the investigator questioned the two peasants who had seen Z.B. on 14 November 2009. They stated that on 14 November 2009, as they had been cutting wood in the forest, Z.B. and Q.S. had approached them. Z.B. had used their mobile telephone to call his father; Z.B. and Q.S. had then left the area. They also stated that Z.B. had been in a good mood before and after the telephone conversation. 26. On 18 January 2010 the investigator carried out a reconstruction of the events in order to establish whether Z.B. had been technically able to commit suicide with his service weapon. The investigator concluded that it would have been possible if he had pressed the trigger of the weapon with the toe of his right foot when standing up or lying down. 27. On 21 January 2010 the applicant was again questioned by the investigator. 28. On the same day the investigator ordered a post-mortem psychiatric and psychological examination (məhkəmə-psixiatrik və psixoloji ekspertizası) of Z.B. Report no. 19 of that examination, dated 1 February 2010, concluded on the basis of the statements available in the case file that Z.B. had not been suffering from any mental disorder, but that he had probably been in a state of depression before his death. However, it was not possible to determine the reason for that depression. 29. On 3 February 2010 the investigator questioned five soldiers of the military unit in which Z.B. had served. 30. On 9 February 2010 the investigator decided to terminate the criminal proceedings, finding that there had been no criminal element in Z.B.’s death. The investigator concluded that Z.B. had committed suicide because he had probably been in a state of depression. The investigator further held that it had not been established that Z.B. had been ill-treated by other soldiers. The investigator also decided to destroy the material evidence found at the crime scene, including the written note found next to Z.B.’s body. 31. On 27 February 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Gazakh Military Court against the investigator’s decision of 9 February 2010, complaining of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation. He disputed the investigator’s conclusions relating to the suicide of his son, pointing out that Z.B. had not suffered from any mental disorder. He submitted in that connection that the statements of the soldiers had been contradictory and had been fabricated, as his son had never had a fiancée or a mother-in-law. The applicant alleged that his son had been either killed or had been driven to suicide by S.H. and Q.S. In that connection, he relied on the content of the letter of 30 November 2009 from the military counterintelligence department of the military unit. He also submitted that the fact that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform had become unstitched proved that his son had been beaten before his death. The applicant further pointed out that the note found at the crime scene had been written using certain words that his son had never used. In particular, he noted that even though Z.B. had never called his parents “ana” (mum) and “ata” (dad), but rather “mama” and “papa”, he had addressed them as “ana” and “ata” in that note. The applicant also complained that his son had been harassed by S.H., who had regularly forced Z.B. to ask the applicant to send mobile telephone top-up cards for S.H. In that connection, he asked for an examination of the list of calls made to and from his mobile telephone during the entire period during which his son had been undertaking military service. 32. On 18 March 2010 the Gazakh Military Court overruled the investigator’s decision and remitted the case to the prosecuting authorities for fresh examination. The court ordered the investigating authority to examine the applicant’s particular complaints. It further found that the investigator had not had the right to decide to destroy the material evidence found at the scene of the crime. 33. As can be seen from the documents submitted by the Government, following the Gazakh Military Court’s decision of 18 March 2010, on 19 March 2010 the investigator decided to continue the investigation. 34. On 23 March 2010 the investigator questioned the expert who had conducted forensic medical, ballistic, chemical and trace examinations (see paragraph 20 above). The expert stated that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform could have come unstitched because it had come into contact with his service weapon after his suicide. 35. On 25 March 2010 the investigator also questioned two soldiers, who stated that they did not remember whether Z.B. had called his parents “ana” (mum) and “ata” (dad) or “mama” and “papa”. 36. On 29 March 2010 the same investigator again decided to terminate the criminal proceedings. That decision was identical in its wording to the investigator’s previous decision of 9 February 2010, except for the part concerning the preservation of the written note found at the scene of the crime and two newly added paragraphs. In those paragraphs, the investigator noted that the two soldiers questioned during the investigation had not remembered whether Z.B. had called his parents “ana” (mum) and “ata” (dad) or “mama” and “papa”. Moreover, relying on the questioning of the expert on 23 March 2010, the investigator concluded that the seam of the left pocket of Z.B.’s uniform had been unstitched because it had come into contact with his service weapon after his suicide and not as a result of any ill-treatment. 37. On 10 April 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan against that decision. He complained of the ineffectiveness of the criminal investigation, pointing out that, taking into consideration that there had been a national holiday in the country from 20 to 28 March 2010, it had been impossible to carry out a new investigation between 19 and 29 March 2010. The applicant also argued that the investigator should have questioned Z.B.’s parents and relatives – not the two soldiers in question – in order to establish whether Z.B. had called his parents “ana” (mum) and “ata” (dad) or “mama” and “papa”. He further disputed the investigator’s interpretation of the expert’s conclusion (see paragraphs 20 and 34 above), alleging that the investigator had substituted his own opinion for the expert’s conclusion. Lastly, he complained that his lawyer had not had access to the case file. 38. As can be seen from the documents in the case file, on 21 April 2010 the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan overruled the investigator’s decision of 29 March 2010 and remitted the case for fresh examination. Despite the Court’s explicit request to the Government that they submit copies of all the documents relating to the criminal proceedings concerning Z.B.’s death, the Government failed to provide the Court with a copy of the decision of 21 April 2010 of the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 39. The criminal case was allocated to another investigator at the Gazakh Military Prosecutor’s Office. 40. In May and June 2010 the new investigator questioned Z.B.’s parents, two schoolmates, and five soldiers (including Q.S.) who had served in the same military unit. During the questioning, despite stating that Z.B. had never complained before his death about being ill-treated, the applicant reiterated his previous complaints. It further appears that, even though on 5 June 2010 the investigator questioned the five soldiers separately, the wording of their statements was identical. They each stated that Z.B. had never been ill-treated during his military service. 41. On 18 June 2010 the investigator in charge of the case decided to terminate the criminal proceedings. The investigator found that the allegation of Z.B.’s ill-treatment by Q.S. and S.H. had not been proved during the investigation and that Z.B. had committed suicide because he had probably been in a state of depression. 42. On 13 July 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision, reiterating his previous arguments. He also noted that the investigator’s decision of 18 June 2010 was almost identical in its wording to the previous decisions of the prosecuting authorities. He further complained that the new investigator had failed to question S.H. again or to address the contradictions in the statements of the soldiers. In that connection, he pointed out that, although Z.B. had had no fiancée or mother-in-law – which had been confirmed in a letter dated 7 December 2009 from the Khachmaz District Police Office – the soldiers had referred in their statements to an alleged telephone conversation with a mother-in-law. The applicant lastly complained about the investigator’s failure to attach any importance to the letter dated 30 November 2009 from the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171. 43. On 23 July 2010 the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan again quashed the investigator’s decision and remitted the case to the prosecuting authorities for fresh examination. The Government failed to provide the Court with a copy of the decision of 23 July 2010 of the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan. 44. On 27 July 2010 the investigator again questioned Z.B.’s parents, who reiterated their previous complaints. They also stated that Q.S. and S.H. had regularly harassed their son into obtaining mobile telephone top-up cards. 45. In August 2010 the investigator also questioned various soldiers, who denied any ill-treatment or harassment of Z.B. during his military service. 46. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 27 August 2010 the investigator again sent an operational request to the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171. The investigator noted that, although in the letter dated 30 November 2009 it was stated that Z.B. had been beaten by S.H. and Q.S. on the day of the incident, that allegation had not been proved during the investigation. The investigator further asked the head of the military counterintelligence department to investigate whether S.H. and Q.S. had tried to extort money from Z.B. during his military service. 47. By a letter dated 10 September 2010, the head of the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171, Y.S., replied to the investigator’s request of 27 August 2010. Y.S. noted that, although he had previously indicated in his letter of 30 November 2009 that Z.B. had been beaten by S.H. and Q.S., that information had not been subsequently confirmed. He further informed the investigator that the military counterintelligence department had not received any information relating to the extortion of money. 48. On 20 September 2010 the investigator at the Gazakh Military Prosecutor’s Office again decided to terminate the criminal proceedings, finding that there had been no criminal element in Z.B.’s death. In that connection, the investigator found that Z.B. had committed suicide because he had probably been in a state of depression. Relying on the letter dated 10 September 2010 from the intelligence department of military unit no. 171, he also concluded that the allegation that Z.B. had been ill-treated by S.H. and Q.S. had not been confirmed during the investigation. 49. On 9 October 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan. He reiterated his previous complaints, pointing out that the investigator had tried to cover those who had ill-treated his son and driven him to suicide. 50. On 15 October 2010 the Deputy Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan dismissed the applicant’s complaint, finding that the criminal investigation had been effective. 51. On 1 November 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the Baku Military Court, arguing that the investigator had failed to carry out an effective investigation. In particular, he alleged that the appearance of a new letter from the military counterintelligence department of military unit no. 171 (see paragraph 47 above), which clearly contradicted the previous letter from the same organ, had shown that the domestic authorities had tried to cover S.H. and Q.S., who had beaten his son. He also complained of the investigator’s failure to address the contradictions in the statements of the soldiers relating to the alleged existence of a fiancée and a mother-in-law and the alleged family problems of Z.B. 52. On 13 November 2010 the Baku Military Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court found, without providing any explanation, that the applicant’s complaints were groundless. 53. On 1 December 2010 the applicant appealed against that decision, reiterating his previous complaints. 54. On 29 December 2010 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the Baku Military Court’s decision of 13 November 2010.",['2'],['2-1'],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Kavadarci. 6. In April 2000, while criminal proceedings were pending against a certain Mr I.A., the latter sold a lorry (“the lorry”) to a company, M. 7. On 13 June 2000 the Skopje Court of First Instance (“the Trial Court”) convicted Mr I.A. of smuggling nearly 9 tonnes of sugar, which he had transported in the lorry in November 1997. According to the Government, the court dismissed the prosecutor’s application to have the lorry confiscated, given that Mr I.A. had stated that he had already sold it. The court considered that the conditions for confiscation of the lorry under Article 68 (2) of the Criminal Code 1996 (see paragraph 21 below) had not been fulfilled: specifically it had not been established that the lorry could be used again to commit an offence; that the confiscation had been necessary for the protection of safety or for reasons of ethics; and that the lorry had been specially adjusted for the commission of specific type of offences. On 20 November 2001, following separate appeals by Mr I.A. and the public prosecutor, the Skopje Court of Appeal found the public prosecutor’s application immaterial (беспредметна) and quashed all aspects of this judgment. 8. On 17 September 2003 the Trial Court convicted Mr I.A. in absentia. It fined him and ordered, under Article 278 (3) of the Criminal Code 1996, the confiscation of the lorry and the sugar (“the confiscation order”). In the absence of an appeal, the judgment became final on 29 October 2003. 9. On 6 September 2004 the company M. sold the lorry to the applicant, who later registered the lorry in his name. 10. On 12 June 2006 the Kavadarci Court of First Instance (“the first-instance court”) enforced the confiscation order of 17 September 2003 against the applicant and issued a record of enforcement (записник за извршување). 11. On 15 November 2006 the applicant objected to the enforcement of the confiscation order, arguing that Mr I.A. had died on 21 March 2005 and that the confiscation order accordingly could not be enforced. There had been no injunction restricting the sale of the lorry. He had been the lawful owner and he had been making his living using the lorry. Lastly, he stated that he had sought, in separate civil proceedings, return of the lorry (see paragraph 14 below). 12. On 20 November 2006 the execution-of-sanctions judge of the Trial Court rejected the objection as inadmissible, finding that the applicant had no procedural standing. It found that the confiscation order had been enforced in accordance with section 355 of the Enforcement of Sanctions Act (see paragraph 26 below). It further found that the applicant, as the third person from whom the lorry had been confiscated, could assume his rights under section 129(5) of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraph 25 below). 13. The applicant appealed. On 6 December 2006 a three-judge panel of the Trial Court dismissed his appeal reiterating that he had no right to object to the enforcement of the confiscation order. However, he had been entitled to claim, in civil proceedings, return of the lorry. Civil courts had jurisdiction, under section 129(5) of the Criminal Proceedings Act, to reverse a final confiscation order issued in criminal proceedings and order the return of the confiscated item. 14. On 19 June 2006 the applicant submitted a civil claim seeking that the first-instance court declare him to be the owner of the lorry and to order the State to restore it to his possession. In the case of failure of his first claim, he sought that the State would reimburse him for the upgrades made to the lorry. In this latter context, he identified the upgrades that he had installed in the lorry. He further maintained that he was the bona fide and lawful owner of the lorry. He argued that the authorities had failed to seize the lorry immediately after the offence had been committed (на лице место) and to note a ban on the sale of the lorry on its registration certificate. As he was making his living off the lorry, he requested an injunction restricting the State from selling or otherwise disposing of the lorry until the final resolution of the dispute. 15. By decisions of 29 June and 16 November 2006 respectively, the first-instance court and the Skopje Court of Appeal (“the second-instance court”) dismissed the applicant’s application for an injunction finding no evidence that in the absence of such a measure his claim would be considerably affected or that he would sustain irreparable damage. 16. On 2 March 2007 the applicant informed the first-instance court that Mr I.A. had died in Austria in 2005. 17. On 10 May 2007 the first-instance court dismissed the applicant’s claim. It established that Mr I.A., who knew that the lorry could have been confiscated, had sold it to the company M. At the relevant time, neither the manager of M. nor the applicant had known that the lorry had been used in the commission of the offence and that it had been subject to a confiscation order. Relying on Articles 68 and 278 (3) of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 21 and 22 below), the court stated that: “Confiscation is a safety measure, the typical aim of which is to remove conditions which are convenient for the commission of offences, and it is a condition for ordering such a measure that the offender has been sentenced, as in the present case. The court considers that it is mandatory to confiscate the [lorry] under the afore-mentioned provisions, because this safety measure has a wider influence [in the sense of] general deterrence of all future offenders of this type of offences, and otherwise the offenders would be encouraged, after the offence has been committed, to dispose of the means with which they committed the offence and, thus, to even acquire pecuniary benefit; furthermore that would have a negative influence on the ethics of the wider public, [that is to say] on general deterrence ... ... Given that from the evidence and the above-mentioned statutory provisions it has been established that the [lorry] in question was confiscated in favour of [the respondent State] in lawful proceedings, the court finds that the [respondent State] has therein obtained ownership of the [lorry] in question on the basis of a final and enforceable judgment ... in accordance with sections 112(2) and 154 of the [Property Act.] For these reasons, the court dismisses the [applicant’s] main claim and also the alternative claim, because it concerns upgrades made to the [lorry]. On the other hand, the court considers that the [applicant], as the bona fide owner, can be indemnified for the value of the entire [lorry], including the upgrades, but solely from the offender, [Mr I.A.], in accordance with Article 68 (3) of the [Criminal Code], and not from the [respondent State] ... The court dismisses as groundless the argument that at the moment of confiscation of the [lorry] in question it was not owned by [Mr I.A.] but by the [applicant] as the bona fide possessor (совесен владетел), given that from the evidence it was established that when the offence was committed the [lorry] was owned by [Mr I.A.] and the safety measure confiscation of the [lorry] was issued on those grounds. The court also considers groundless the [applicant’s] representative’s arguments that under section 129(5) of the Criminal Proceedings Act the final decision for confiscation of the [lorry] could be amended with a decision in civil proceedings if there were a dispute concerning the ownership of the confiscated items, given that this provision would have been applied if the [lorry] had been sold to the [applicant] before the offence was committed and had, under any legal basis, remained in the factual possession of the convicted [Mr I.A.] and he, after having sold it, committed the crime; but in the present case it is vice versa; firstly the offence was committed and then the [lorry] was sold.” 18. The court also established that the applicant had upgraded the lorry to the value of 69,150 Macedonian denars (MKD). Furthermore, on the basis of the applicant’s and two witnesses’ statements, the court established that the applicant had bought the lorry for 4,300 euros (EUR). 19. The applicant appealed. He stated that he had previously requested that the first-instance court obtain evidence from the Ministry of the Interior which would confirm that Mr I.A. had died in Austria in 2005. He argued that the domestic authorities had failed to ban Mr I.A. from disposing of the lorry or to seize the lorry at the time the offence had been discovered. He also argued that he was the bona fide owner and that he had obtained title to the lorry by adverse possession (одршка). The first-instance court had incorrectly applied section 129(5) of the Criminal Proceedings Act. The lorry had been confiscated nine years after the offence had been committed. The State had been unlawfully enriched by the value of the upgrades installed by the applicant. 20. On 19 October 2007 Skopje Court of Appeal (“the second-instance court”) dismissed the applicant’s appeal finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and reasons given by the lower court. On 13 November 2007 this judgment was served on the applicant.",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

The first applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Rinschnach. The second applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Linz. 5. In 1997 the Wels Regional Court (Landesgericht Wels, “the Regional Court”) instituted preliminary investigations (Vorerhebungen) against the two applicants and several other persons on account of the suspicion of aggravated fraud (schwerer gewerbsmässiger Betrug) by having set up and managed an internationally operated gambling system which was based on a pyramid scheme. 6. On 19 January 1999 the Regional Court decided that the proceedings against the applicants were to be separated from those of the co-suspects to avoid delays. 7. On 9 December 1997 the Regional Court issued an international arrest warrant (Steckbrief) in respect of the first applicant. He was in detention on remand from 26 to 27 May 1998. 8. On 18 February 2008 the first applicant filed a request for the acceleration of the proceedings under Section 91 of the Courts Act (Fristsetzungsantrag). The Linz Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht, “the Court of Appeal”) dismissed the request on 11 September 2008, stating that it could only be directed against delays caused by the courts, not the Public Prosecutor. 9. On 2 May 2013 the Regional Court acquitted the first applicant of all charges. The decision was served on his counsel on 15 October 2013. 10. On 18 April 1997 the Regional Court issued an international arrest warrant in respect of the second applicant. He was in detention on remand from 22 May 1997 until 6 August 1999. 11. On 12 April 2002 the preliminary investigations against the second applicant were closed and the file was transferred to the Wels Public Prosecutor (Staatsanwaltschaft, “the Public Prosecutor”) for further processing. However, no indictment was brought against him. 12. On 4 December 2007 the second applicant filed a request for the acceleration of the proceedings under Section 91 of the Courts Act. The Court of Appeal dismissed the request on 11 September 2008, stating that it could only be directed against delays caused by the courts, not the Public Prosecutor. 13. On 2 April 2010 the Public Prosecutor brought an indictment against the second applicant. The second applicant lodged an appeal against the indictment and a motion requesting the discontinuation of the proceedings. On 28 February 2011 the Court of Appeal rejected the indictment, but did not discontinue the proceedings. 14. On 13 October 2011 the Public Prosecutor discontinued the proceedings against the second applicant.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

TURKEY,3,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Positive obligations;Article 8-1 - Respect for private life);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed (Article 41 - Pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction);Non-pecuniary damage - award (Article 41 - Non-pecuniary damage;Just satisfaction),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Robert Spano;Georges Ravarani,"5. The applicants were born in 1974, 1975 and 2003 respectively and live in Ankara. 6. In 2004 Duru Kurt’s parents took her to the Ankara SSK hospital because they thought that she was displaying symptoms of heart problems. The child was examined and then transferred to the Sami Ulus paediatric hospital, where she was treated for two years, after which the doctors decided that she should undergo heart surgery. 7. Before the operation, which took place on 19 July 2006, the patient’s father signed a form setting out the potential risks facing his daughter in undergoing the surgical operation, consenting to the operation (“the consent form”). 8. During the post-operative check-ups a leak was detected on the periphery of the membrane covering the incision. 9. On 8 February 2007, by decision of the hospital medical board, the patient underwent a second operation carried out by a different medical team. Prior to the operation, the patient’s father signed a consent form identical to the first one. That form did not mention any risk of a serious neurological problem, but specified that the list of possible sequelae was not exhaustive. 10. After that second operation, the patient suffered an oedema, a brain haemorrhage, liver failure and muscle spasticity while in intensive care. 11. On 6 July 2007 the applicants lodged a complaint against the doctors who had carried out the operations. 12. On 11 July 2007 the medical board of the Dışkapı paediatric hospital in Ankara diagnosed the child with a severe irremediable psychomotor disability (caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy), estimating her disability rate at 92%. 13. On 16 July 2007, pursuant to standard procedure, the prosecutor’s office applied to the Governor of Ankara for authorisation to prosecute. 14. The report drawn up following the internal investigation commissioned by the Governor’s Office stated that the patient was suffering from a very serious congenital heart disease, that treating that disease would entail a high-risk surgical operation and that in 52% of cases a leak was noted around the membrane, necessitating a second operation. It concluded that the medical team had not been guilty of negligence during the first operation. 15. According to the aforementioned report, the second operation, which had been carried out to rectify the leak, had also been very risky. The report pointed out that the patient’s neurological complications had been a common occurrence during open-heart surgery and that they occurred when artificial pumps were installed to maintain blood circulation or where the patient was placed in hypothermia. It added that the patient continued to suffer from sequelae despite the treatment administered after the second operation. In conclusion, the investigator recommended not authorising a criminal prosecution. This preliminary investigation report explained that the relevant persons had been questioned by the instigator. It is not known in what capacity the author of the report, who is a doctor, was involved or to which hospital he is attached. 16. On 6 September 2007, as recommended by the preliminary investigation report, the Governor’s Office refused to authorise prosecution. 17. The applicants’ challenge to that administrative decision was dismissed by the Regional Administrative Court on 18 December 2007 on the grounds that the preliminary investigation report and the appendices thereto were not such as to enable the prosecutor’s office to instigate a judicial investigation. 18. Consequently, on 28 September 2008 the prosecutor’s office issued a discontinuance decision. 19. Concurrently with the criminal proceedings, the applicants lodged a complaint with the Ankara Medical Association. 20. The expert appointed by the latter submitted his report on 14 July 2008. This one-page document stated that the patient had displayed a congenital anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), that open-heart surgery had been carried out in order to irrigate the left coronary artery from the aorta, that six months later a leak had been detected on the membrane which had been applied to the incision during that first operation, that a second operation had been carried out which had resolved that problem, but that the patient had suffered a stroke. The expert pointed out that the patient’s anomaly had been extremely serious, that it was liable to be fatal, and that the probability of complications occurring during or after such an operation had been high. The expert took the view that the second operation, geared to treating a foreseeable complication stemming from the first operation, had in fact been even riskier. He considered that open-heart surgery presented risks not only to the organ being operated on but also to other organs. The expert concluded his report as follows: “The stroke [suffered by] the patient Duru Kurt was one of the possible complications occurring during open-heart surgery. No negligence or fault has been noted on the part of the medical teams which carried out the first and second operations. The teams showed great efficiency and a high degree of medical expertise. The complication [which occurred in the present case] was an eventuality which can be observed in cases of anomalies [such as that suffered by the patient] and as a result of open-heart surgery.” 21. On 23 May 2008 the applicants brought an action for damages against the doctors before the Ankara Civil Court of General Jurisdiction (“CCGJ”) alleging that they had not practised their profession properly and had caused the very severe sequelae with which their daughter Duru Kurt was afflicted. In support of their claim they submitted a private expert report dated 13 May 2008 on the amount of the damages. 22. On 26 March 2009 the CCGJ appointed a board of experts comprising two professors and a lecturer in cardiovascular surgery from Ankara University. 23. The board of experts submitted its report on 31 July 2009. 24. According to that report the patient had originally been diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy (an illness which significantly diminishes the “pumping” capacity of the heart) at Ankara University Hospital, and following more detailed examinations at the Sami Ulus Hospital, ALCAPA, also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome, had been diagnosed. 25. The experts explained that the patient had undergone a Takeuchi operation to create an intrapulmonary tunnel and that a leak had been noted on the periphery of the membrane during the check-ups conducted six months later. They stated that that leak had led to a second surgical operation, that the patient had been placed on respiratory support owing to the emergence of a tonic-clonic contraction after the operation and that the neurological sequelae had appeared during that period of intensive care. 26. After those initial findings, the experts stated in their report that the heart disease from which the patient suffered and for which she had undergone surgery was rare, accounting for 0.5% of all congenital heart diseases. Without treatment the mortality rate was between 80% and 90%, and those affected seldom reached adulthood. The board of experts considered that the only treatment for that disease was surgery, and that the most appropriate type of surgery was the Takeuchi operation. The board added that the latter had a mortality rate of up to 23%, that in 50% of all cases a leak could occur around the membrane following such heart surgery and that, taking all types of complications together, the rate of re-operation was up to 30%. 27. The experts added that in 10% to 29% of cases congenital cardiovascular diseases were accompanied by neurological disorders, and that a multi-country study had shown that the rate of neurological damage in the immediate post-operative period stood at 20%. 28. In their conclusions, the experts pointed out that ALCAPA was a very serious heart disorder and that the patient’s parents had signed a consent form before their child’s operation. They considered that the fact of the patient’s dilated cardiomyopathy had further exacerbated the already serious risks posed by the operation. According to the report, the leak which had been observed around the membrane after the first operation had been a complication which occurred in 50 % of cases, and the operation carried out to resolve that issue had been even riskier than the first one. The experts also pointed out that the neurological damage suffered by the patient had been a complication which was often encountered in cases of patients suffering from a congenital heart defect who underwent post-operative intensive care. 29. The report, which quoted twenty or so bibliographical sources, ended with the following words: “In short, this patient’s situation could be seen as one large complication. There can be no question of the doctors having committed a medical or surgical error.” 30. The applicants contested the report, deeming it inadequate. They considered that the document, which cited scientific studies, was more like a magazine article than an expert report. It contained no concrete and objective facts about the case in hand and would not help in determining the dispute. The applicants did not deny that there had been a risk, but considered that neither that risk nor the signing of a consent form released the doctors from their duty to practise their profession properly. They submitted, however, that the report, which lacked any explanations or reasoning on that point, had not mentioned any checks carried out with regard to the risk factors. Consequently, they asked the court to commission a second expert assessment, either from a different medical board or from a specialist section of the Istanbul Institute of Forensic Sciences. 31. By judgment of 3 November 2009 the CCGJ rejected the applicants request for a second expert assessment. With regard to the expert report of 31 July 2009 and the facts set out in the prosecution investigation file, the court held that the doctors had not been responsible for the sequelae affecting the child after her high-risk operations, to which her parents had given their consent. 32. The parents lodged an appeal on points of law against that judgment, reiterating their previous criticism of the expert report, which they considered inadequate. They also emphasised that the report had been based on the medical file and that their daughter had not been examined by the experts. Furthermore, under established case-law, the experts should have begun by explaining the acts and procedures required by medical lege artis and comparing them with the acts which the doctors in question had actually carried out in order to determine whether and how far the said rules had been observed. Furthermore, they submitted that it was not the courts’ usual practice in this type of case to confine themselves to a single expert report. In that connection, the rejection of their request for a second expert report had amounted to a blatant injustice. They alleged, moreover, that one of the doctors who should have been present during the operation had stayed away from the theatre after having been alerted by telephone that the patient’s heart had stopped during the operation, pointing out that the expert report had neither analysed nor even mentioned that fact. 33. Their appeal was dismissed by judgment of 20 April 2010. 34. On 7 October 2010 the Court of Cassation also dismissed the applicants’ application for rectification.",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

RUSSIA,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Expulsion) (Conditional),Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in the Ivanovo Region. 6. According to the applicant, in 1991, at the age of fifteen, he moved to Russia from Georgia with his parents. In 1998 he settled in Shuya, Ivanovo Region, whereas his parents moved back to Georgia. 7. On 18 November 1999 the Shuya Town Court of the Ivanovo Region found the applicant guilty of extortion and theft of a passport, and sentenced him to three years and one month’s imprisonment. According to the applicant, in order to spare his mother’s feelings, he told the prosecuting authorities that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. On 4 June 2001 the applicant was released on parole. Upon release he was issued with an ID card in the name of Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. 8. On 26 April 2005 the Town Court found the applicant guilty of theft and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment. Again he claimed that his name was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili and presented the relevant ID card. On 1 June 2007 the applicant was released on parole. 9. The applicant was in a relationship with Ms K. On 29 February 2008 Ms K. gave birth to a girl. On 21 September 2009 the applicant was recognised as the girl’s father. On 22 September 2009 the applicant and K. got married. On 20 December 2011 Ms K. gave birth to the couple’s second daughter. According to the Government, Ms K. and her two daughters are Russian nationals. 10. According to the Government, on 19 June 2007 the applicant was found administratively liable for failing to have his residency in Russia duly authorised. 11. On 26 June 2007 the applicant was registered as a migrant under the name of Mazmishvili. The registration remained valid until 26 October 2007. 12. It appears that on an unspecified date the applicant asked the Russian migration authorities to issue him with a Russian passport indicating that his name was Shota Petrovich Adeishvili. Following their refusal, the applicant lodged a claim with the Digora District Court of the Northern Osetiya and Alaniya Republic, asking the court to confirm that he had been residing permanently in Russia since 1991. 13. On 30 October 2007 the District Court granted the applicant’s request. The court based its findings on the applicant’s birth certificate in the name of Shota Petrovich Adeishvili submitted by him, a certificate issued by the Digora municipal authorities and the testimony of Ms G., stating that the applicant had been renting a flat from her since 1991. 14. On 8 July 2008 the applicant received a Russian passport in the name of Shota Petrovich Adeishvili. 15. On 10 February 2010 the regional migration service asked the District Court to quash the judgment of 30 October 2007 and remit the matter for new consideration. 16. On 17 March 2010 the District Court quashed the judgment of 30 October 2007, noting that the certificate confirming the applicant’s residence in Digora had not in fact been issued by the town administration. The matter was remitted for fresh consideration. 17. On 31 March 2010 the District Court noted that the applicant, who had been duly notified of the date and time of the court hearing, had failed to appear in court on two occasions. The Court left the matter without consideration on the merits and discontinued the proceedings. The applicant did not appeal. 18. On 18 April 2010 the migration service terminated the applicant’s Russian citizenship and invalidated his passport. According to the applicant, the migration services transmitted the case file to the prosecuting authorities for further inquiry. He did not inform the Court of the inquiry’s outcome. 19. On 8 July 2010 the applicant was arrested and taken to a police station where he spent the whole day. His passport was confiscated. On the same day an expert from the regional department of the interior confirmed that the applicant’s fingerprints corresponded to those belonging to Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. 20. In the evening of 8 July 2010 the applicant was taken to the Shuya Town Court, which started the hearing at 11 p.m. The applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer. The Town Court considered that the applicant was Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili. It found that, as a person without citizenship, he had failed to have his residency in Russia duly authorised. It therefore imposed a fine on him and ordered his expulsion from Russia to Georgia. The court also held that the applicant should be remanded in custody pending expulsion until 8 September 2010. In particular, the court noted as follows: “When deciding whether to expel Sh. G. Mazmishvili and taking into account that the defendant has a family and a minor child, the court sees no reason not to expel [him] in view of the offences he has committed in Russia, his unlawful acquisition of a Russian passport and his lack of employment.” 21. The applicant appealed against the judgment of 8 July 2010 alleging, inter alia, that the State-appointed lawyer had not carried out his defence effectively, and that the court had failed to provide him with a copy of the decision of 17 March 2010 or a record of his own questioning of 14 September 1999. 22. On 26 July 2010 the Ivanovo Regional Court upheld the judgment of 8 July 2010 on appeal. The applicant was represented by counsel of his own choosing. 23. On 18 August 2010 the police sent the documents concerning the applicant’s expulsion to the Georgian authorities. 24. On 30 August 2010 the President of the Regional Court upheld the judgments of 8 and 26 July 2010. 25. It appears that the regional migration service could not prepare the documents necessary to expel the applicant to Georgia and asked the Town Court to extend the applicant’s detention pending expulsion. 26. On 6 September 2010 the Town Court extended the applicant’s detention until 7 October 2010. The court noted that the Georgian authorities had not yet prepared the documents necessary for the applicant’s expulsion to Georgia. The court considered that the applicant, if released, might abscond or fail to comply with the expulsion order. The applicant’s detention was repeatedly extended by the Town Court. 27. On 3 January 2011 the Georgian authorities informed the regional migration service that a real Shermandin Goderziyevich Mazmishvili was residing in Georgia and it was not possible to issue the requested documents in that name for the applicant’s expulsion to Georgia. 28. On 7 February 2011 the Town Court ordered the applicant’s release. Referring to the information supplied by the Georgian authorities, the court considered that it was not possible to expel the applicant under the name of Mazmishvili. 29. According to the Government, the applicant has not been expelled. He has no document confirming his ID, and the Russian authorities have not established his identity. 30. According to the applicant, the Town Court, when deciding to detain him pending expulsion, took into account a certificate prepared by police captain P. on which it was noted that the applicant “had been involved in car thefts, belonged to the Shuya organised criminal group ... [and] was a drug dealer.” 31. Despite a complaint lodged by the applicant that P. had knowingly disseminated false information about him, on 18 August 2010 the prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against P. 32. From 9 July 2010 to 7 February 2011 the applicant was held in a special detention centre in Ivanovo. 33. According to the Government, all the inmates detained with a view to expulsion were held in cells nos. 2, 3 and 4. During the period of the applicant’s detention, the cell population varied from three to sixteen persons in all three cells. On average, the number of persons detained in a cell was four to five. 34. Each detainee was provided with a mattress, a pillow, sheets and a blanket. The sheets were changed on the days the applicant was allowed to take a shower. According to the relevant ledger, the applicant took showers on 9, 21 and 29 July, 4, 14, 24 and 30 August, 7, 13, 27 and 30 September, 1, 12, 15, 22 and 29 November, 6, 13, 20 and 27 December 2010, and on 13, 19 and 25 January and 1 February 2011. 35. Each cell had a window opening onto a hallway. The window was covered with a metal grill. The light coming from the hallway was sufficient for reading. The window was periodically kept open to ensure proper ventilation of the cell. There was a table and a bench with seating for four persons in each cell. Both the table and the bench were fixed onto the floor. 36. The cells where the applicant was detained from 9 July to 30 September 2010 were not equipped with a toilet. The detainees were taken out of the cell at least twice a day to use the toilet in the building. During the nighttime the inmates had to use buckets placed in the cells. The buckets were emptied and disinfected daily. In September 2010 toilets and wash sinks were installed in all cells of the special detention centre. They became operational in October 2010. 37. Food was provided three times a day. Breakfast consisted of hot tea, sugar and a pastry; lunch comprised of soup, meat or fish with a side dish, and tea with sugar or a fruit drink. The applicant also received food parcels from his family and friends. 38. According to the applicant’s file, he declared a hunger strike twice. Each time he was examined by a paramedic. On a number of occasions ambulance doctors attended to the applicant. 39. The special detention centre had an exercise area measuring 4.66 m by 3.7 m covered with a metal grill. The detainees had one hour’s outdoor exercise daily. 40. The applicant was allowed to telephone his family on several occasions. The internal regulations did not provide for the right to a family visit. 41. The applicant provided the following information as regards his detention in the special detention centre: 42. Prior to the refurbishment of the special detention centre, there had been no toilets or wash sinks in the cell. The inmates had had to use a bucket placed in the cell. It had been emptied twice a day. The inmates had been allowed to use toilets outside the cell twice a day. The toilets had offered no privacy. Six to eight inmates had been taken simultaneously to the lavatory and had had to use the toilet in front of the others waiting for their turn. 43. The toilets installed in the cells offered no privacy either. Only cell no. 8 had a one-metre high partition separating the toilet from the living area of the cell. 44. The applicant did not contest the Government’s submissions as regards the frequency of the showers he had been allowed to take. According to him, the hot water had run out after the first ten minutes. Each time the inmates had had from fifteen to twenty-five minutes to take a shower and to do their laundry. They could use only cold water for the laundry. The sheets, which were old and ragged, had been changed every two weeks. 45. The windows in the cell were covered by two sets of metal bars on both sides. Access to daylight was insufficient. The table and the bench allowed for two persons to eat. The rest of the inmates had to eat sitting on their beds. In cell no. 3 the applicant was given a mattress that was infested with lice. 46. Cell no. 9, which was unofficially called “a disciplinary cell”, had no windows. During the four days the applicant spent in that cell, he was not taken out for outdoor exercise. 47. The daily outdoor exercise lasted thirty minutes and took place in a yard measuring 12 square metres. 48. The applicant had nothing to do while detained at the special detention centre. There was no library, television or radio. He was not allowed to subscribe to a newspaper or a magazine. 49. Breakfast was served at 7 a.m., lunch was served at 3 p.m. and dinner, if any, was served at 5 p.m. Breakfast consisted of a piece of white bread, a mug of hot water and a piece of sugar. No spoon was provided. For lunch inmates received soup with an unpleasant odour and taste, a minced meat cutlet and a piece of rye bread. For dinner they were given a burger and cabbage. The meals were the same every day. Because of the applicant’s condition, he could not eat any of the food served. Drinking water was not provided at all. The foodstuff sent by the applicant’s family quickly perished as no fridge was provided and the applicant had to store the food under his bed.",['3'],[],[],['8'],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in L. 6. For several years the applicant had been under the supervision of, and had been receiving various types of financial assistance amounting to some 600 Croatian kunas (HRK) per month from, a local social care centre. 7. In June 2008, the applicant’s family doctor submitted to the social care centre a report on her medical treatment, stating as follows: “With regard to your question concerning Ms M.S.’s state of health and treatment and my observations on her health problems ... I confirm that she has been my patient since March 2008. She is a person with polymorphic health issues, and, in terms of the somatic aspect of her state of health, abdominal sensations related to the gynaecological area (a gynaecologist has prescribed surgery, which the patient constantly refuses) and thereby related anaemia – of course, treated by an alternative therapy. Because of a number of other health issues (frequent headaches, lumbar pain) she has been sent for specialist examinations, which attested to a sufficiency of outpatient treatment, in the form of both medication and physiotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient has her own peculiar interpretation of her health issues, on which she insists, and therefore I consider that the best help for her would be psychological/psychiatric treatment. Of course, this requires her consent, which so far could not be obtained. The continuity of the treatment is additionally hampered by the patient’s change of her place of residence. Her visits to the doctor are random, and so are her wishes as to the scope and area of treatment. The particular difficulty in the medical treatment of Ms [M.]S. is related to her mental [state].” 8. On 26 June 2008 the social care centre instituted proceedings in the competent court for divesting the applicant of legal capacity, which was one of the issues giving rise to a case before the Court in M.S. v. Croatia (no. 36337/10, §§ 40-46, 25 April 2013). 9. Following an expert report of 19 August 2013 indicating that the applicant had been effectively engaged in psychiatric treatment, which had been progressing well, on 9 September 2013 the social care centre withdrew the request to divest her of legal capacity. 10. On 29 October 2012 the applicant went to see her family doctor complaining of severe lower-back pain. Her doctor, after having examined her, called the emergency health service and sent the applicant for some further medical checks. 11. The doctor who received the applicant in the emergency service found that her general condition was good, that she was conscious and well oriented, but that she had difficulty moving. The doctor made a working diagnosis of lumbago and sent the applicant for further medical checks by a neurologist. 12. The neurologist in the emergency service examined the applicant on the same day and found that the information she was giving was incoherent and disproportionate to her pain, and that she had not been taking her medication. He made a diagnosis of back pain and anxiety disorder, and sent the applicant for a further examination by a psychiatrist. 13. The applicant was then examined by a psychiatrist in the emergency service who after interviewing her found that she was making fanciful and confusing allegations of persecution by various doctors. The psychiatrist made a diagnosis of acute psychotic disorder, systemic delusional disorder and delusional dysmorphic disorder, and prescribed hospitalisation. 14. The applicant was immediately admitted to the psychiatric clinic of the R. Clinical Hospital Centre (Klinički bolnički centar R., Klinika za psihijatriju; hereinafter: “the hospital”), a public health-care institution. The relevant parts of the admission record, in so far as legible, indicate as follows: “Date of admission: 29.10.2012 Date and time of hospitalisation: 29.10.2012 ... Admission diagnosis: ... anxiety disorder ... Patient’s attitude towards the examination: refused examination by a psychiatrist; requested a somatic examination ... Psychological condition: conscious and well oriented, suspicious ... tense in the psychomotor sense ... distanced, cold, with ideas of ... persecution, control ... Neurological condition: syndrome of back pain ... Patient’s attitude towards the hospitalisation: refuses Consent: NO ... Physical intervention: physical restraint, tying to a bed ...” 15. In the evening of the same day, another doctor examined the applicant. The relevant part of the examination record reads: “The patient was hospitalised after an examination by Dr [T.]L., and after having been treated in the [emergency ward] for persistant severe back pain (documentation in attachment). She was brought on a stretcher, tied down, maintaining conscience and orientation, negative, arguing, yelling, agitated, affectively dissolute, with a mind-flow disorder, substantively paranoid ideas. ... Diagnosis: Acute psychotic disorder F 23.2 Delusional disorder ... Fixation. Th. according to the list.” 16. According to the applicant, following her admission to hospital she was tied to a bed with four belts tightened around her ankles and wrists, and forcefully injected with a strong drug. She was kept in that position throughout the night and felt severe pain in her back. Her left leg was restrained in such a position that the belts caused her additional pain. The room was small and had no windows. The following morning the belts were removed and she was taken to another room in the psychiatric hospital. 17. According to the Government, following the applicant’s admission to hospital she was given the usual treatment for patients in a state of psychotic agitation and was then placed in an isolation room. The room had a direct connection with the adjacent staff room and was under constant video surveillance. The room measured 2.50 by 2.12 metres and the height of the ceiling was 3.15 metres. It was equipped only with one bed. It had a heating and air-conditioning system, as well as access to sanitary facilities. The belts used to restrain the applicant to the bed were specially adapted so as to avoid any injuries. 18. The Government further explained that the applicant had been tied to the bed in the isolation room from the time of her admission to hospital at 8.50 p.m. on 29 October 2012 until the next morning. She was then taken to a regular hospital room where she was again restrained until 12 noon. During that time her condition and all her needs were regularly monitored. After the initial period following the applicant’s admission to hospital until her release, she was not restrained again. 19. The available medical records concerning the physical restraint used on the applicant in the hospital show that this method was used in the period between 8.50 p.m. on 29 October 2012 until around 12 noon on 30 October 2012. The relevant medical record monitoring the applicant’s physical restraining, in so far as legible, reads as follows: “29/30.10 brought by [the emergency service] on a stretcher ... upon admission screaming, restive, kicking came [to the emergency service] because of back pain taken to the isolation box (hands and legs fixed), screaming, threatening, restive ... psychotic, paranoid [ideas] drunk water complains of lower back pain did not sleep well during the night, called [for assistance], drunk water (approximately one litre) ... manipulative did not sign the consent to hospitalisation, ... 30.10.2012 morning hygiene performed in the box ... around 12 p.m. taken to the intensive care ward ... complains of back pain, unaware of her condition, paranoid ...” 20. On 30 October 2012 the hospital informed the R. County Court (Županijski sud u R.) that the applicant had been involuntarily admitted for treatment on 29 October 2012, that she had refused further hospitalisation and that her mental condition prevented her from making a sound decision in that respect. 21. On the same day the R. County Court instituted proceedings for the applicant’s involuntary retention and appointed a legal-aid lawyer, P.R., to represent her. 22. On 31 October 2012 the judge conducting the proceedings visited the applicant in the hospital. The record of the visit in its entirety reads: “[Number of the case file]","['3', '5']",['5-1'],['5-1-e'],[],[],[],1

GEORGIA,4,Violation of Article 9 - Freedom of thought conscience and religion (Article 9-1 - Freedom of religion);Violation of Article 14+9-1 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 9 - Freedom of thought conscience and religion;Article 9-1 - Freedom of religion),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Iulia Motoc;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicants, Mr Ramaz Tsartsidze, Mr Samvel Bozoyani, Mr Mamuka Gelashvili (applicants nos. 1-3, case no. 1); Mr Alexander Mikirtumov, Mr Binali Aliev (applicants nos. 4-5, case no. 2); Mr Gia Dzamukov, Mr Vladimer Gabunia (applicants nos. 6-7, case no. 3); Mr Boris Gogoladze, Ms Anastasia Tvaradze, Ms Madona Kapanadze (applicants nos. 8-10, case no. 4); and Mr Jimsher Gogelashvili, Mr George Kurua and Mr Omar Chubinidze (applicants nos. 11-13, case no. 5) are all Jehovah’s Witnesses. Their application to the Court relates to five cases of religiously motivated aggression to which they were allegedly subjected in Georgia at various times. The events described in cases nos. 1 and 4 were the subject of the Court’s examination in the case of Begheluri and Others v. Georgia (no. 28490/02, 7 October 2014). 6. The following account of the facts is based on the applicants’ submissions. 7. This part of the application concerns the applicants Mr R. Tsartsidze, Mr S. Bozoyani and Mr M. Gelashvili (applicants nos. 1-3). 8. On 16 September 2000 nineteen coaches and several cars with Jehovah’s Witnesses headed to Marneuli to attend the convention at Mr Tsartsidze’s premises. The police set up checkpoints along the route and blocked the roads, preventing the Jehovah’s Witnesses from reaching their destination. At the same time, the police authorised a coach containing extremist members of the Orthodox Church, led by Mr V. Mkalavishvili, also known as Father Basil (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 71156/01, § 11, 3 May 2007), to continue their journey to Marneuli in order to attack and damage the site within Mr Tsartsidze’s property where the Jehovah’s Witnesses were to gather. The attackers destroyed objects for religious use and seized items belonging to others. The police officers who were in attendance refused to intervene. Property belonging to the Jehovah’s Witnesses, including 1.5 tonnes of religious literature was confiscated. The religious literature was burnt in the street. Other items (tents, 400 benches, and other items) were distributed to local residents by Father Basil’s supporters (see Begheluri and Others, cited above, §§ 16-21). 9. According to estimates made on 25 January 2001 and 28 February 2002, the stolen and destroyed equipment and material was worth about 9,000 euros (EUR) and the 1.5 tonnes of stolen and burnt religious literature was worth about EUR 700. 10. On 16 October 2000 applicants nos. 1-3, other Jehovah’s Witnesses, the representation of the Pennsylvania Watchtower in Georgia and the Union of Jehovah’s Witnesses, lodged an administrative complaint with the Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi District Court in Tbilisi against the Ministry of the Interior, the governor of Marneuli, the Marneuli chief of police and his deputy and twelve other police officers involved in the case. The applicants sought compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage caused by the State’s agents. 11. On 8 May 2001 the Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi District Court decided to consider the Ministry of the Interior as a third-party intervener and referred the case to the Marneuli District Court for examination. 12. On 13 May 2002 the Marneuli District Court dismissed the applicants’ complaint as ill-founded. The court considered it to have been shown that individuals acting under the orders of Father Basil had attacked Mr Tsartsidze’s property and the Jehovah’s Witnesses. As to the Marneuli police, the court held that they had not been informed that a convention was due to be held on 16 September 2000 at Mr Tsartsidze’s home and had been taking part on that date in an anti-drugs operation in the area bordering Azerbaijan. The court found that the defendants who were police officers had gone to the scene only after the attack in question and had only been able to observe the damage that had already been done. They could not therefore have contributed by being passive or taking part in the acts of religious aggression against the applicants. 13. On 18 June 2002 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Tbilisi Regional Court complaining that the court of first instance had ignored the fact that the police had turned back the Jehovah’s Witnesses but had allowed Father Basil and his supporters to go through the same checkpoints. The applicants argued that their witness statements had been disregarded by the first-instance court in favour of unsubstantiated statements by the police officers. The applicants also challenged the status of third-party intervener granted to the Ministry of the Interior in spite of the fact that it had been cited as a defendant. 14. On 30 December 2003 the regional court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the same grounds as the first-instance court. 15. On 29 September 2004 an appeal on points of law by the applicants was dismissed by the Supreme Court, which considered that the applicants had not demonstrated an “intentional” or “negligent” breach of professional obligations by the police officers. 16. This part of the application concerns Mr Alexander Mikirtumov and Mr Binali Aliev, applicants nos. 4 and 5. 17. On 26 October 2000, when about thirty members of the Azerbaijani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses were preparing to hold a meeting in Marneuli at Mr Aliev’s home, five plainclothes police officers entered the property. They included S.Kh. and G.N., who, a few days earlier, had allegedly taken part in the attack on the Jehovah’s Witnesses at Mr Tsartsidze’s property (see case no. 1), and N.N. The police officers stated that the meeting could not go ahead. Using insulting language towards the participants, they ordered them to leave the premises. They confiscated religious books and Bibles belonging to the Jehovah’s Witnesses. 18. Mr Aliev and Mr Mikirtumov, a pastor, were taken to the police station. There, they were insulted by Officer G.N., who ordered Mr Mikirtumov to leave Marneuli and never to return, otherwise he would face serious problems. S.Kh. ordered Mr Aliev not to hold any more religious gatherings at his home if he wished to avoid problems with the police. Mr Mikirtumov was then forced into a car and driven away from Marneuli. 19. On 27 November 2000 the two applicants, together with the representation of the Pennsylvania Watchtower in Georgia and the Union of Jehovah’s Witnesses, lodged an administrative complaint with the Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi District Court against the Ministry of the Interior and the police officers involved. As well as identifying the three police officers, the applicants also gave the number plates of the two vehicles in which the police officers had arrived. They asked that the Ministry of the Interior make a public apology, in accordance with the Police Act, and bring disciplinary proceedings against its staff. The applicants also asked that they be paid compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage and that a directive be sent to all police stations in the country, saying that the rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses were to be respected. 20. On 6 June 2001 the case was sent to the Marneuli District Court, which sent it in turn to the Bolnisi District Court on 14 May 2002. 21. Questioned by that court, the applicants and other people who had attended the meeting confirmed the above-mentioned facts. Officers S.Kh. and G.N. denied the accusations. While G.N. claimed that he had never entered Mr Aliev’s property on the date in question and was seeing the applicants for the first time, S.Kh. stated that he had that day seen G.N. and other police officers, who were his subordinates, in front of Mr Aliev’s house. He had gone to see what was happening. G.N. had explained that a group of people had informed the police that a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses was due to be held and had asked the police to intervene before they did so themselves. The police officers had therefore been obliged to go to the premises. According to S.Kh., G.N. had entered Mr Aliev’s property in order to ask him not to hold the meeting, so as to avoid a clash with the group of individuals in question. S.Kh. stated that he had then continued his journey and denied having taken the two applicants to the police station. He acknowledged, however, that G.N., Mr Aliev and Mr Mikirtumov had been taken together “somewhere”. According to S.Kh., if the applicants had been taken to the police station on the day concerned they would have been questioned, and their visit to the police station duly registered. He criticised the applicants for failing to lodge a complaint with the police chief if they had indeed been taken unlawfully to the police station. 22. The two applicants, on the contrary, submitted that they had been taken to S.Kh.’s office and that he had ordered that they be required to give written undertakings, respectively, to leave Marneuli and for Mr Aliev not to allow religious meetings at his home. S.Kh. denied those allegations also. 23. On 17 June 2003 the proceedings brought by the applicants were dismissed as ill-founded. In the court’s opinion, it had not been established that the police officers in question had prevented the religious meeting from being held at Mr Aliev’s home, confiscated the religious books and taken the two applicants to the police station in order to forbid them from performing religious rites in accordance with their faith. With regard to the statements made by four eyewitnesses, the court held that they were not reliable because they had been made by people taking part in the meeting, who had an interest in supporting the applicants’ complaint. Moreover, the statements made by the complainants had been completely rejected by the police officers. Consequently, the court found that there was nothing to prove that the police officers had failed in their professional obligations, within the meaning of Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code. 24. On 21 October 2004 the Tbilisi Regional Court upheld the judgment of 17 June 2003, on the same grounds as those used by the lower court. 25. On 23 February 2005 the Supreme Court, ruling in written proceedings, dismissed an appeal by the applicants on points of law. It concluded that the applicants had failed to prove either an intentional or a negligent breach of duties by the respondent police officers. 26. This part of the application concerns Mr Gia Dzamukov and Vladimer Gabunia (applicants nos. 6 and 7 respectively). 27. On 2 September 2000, while in possession of religious tracts, Mr Dzamukov was stopped in the street in Kutaisi by two uniformed police officers, E.K. and E.Ch. His bag with religious literature was confiscated and he was taken to the police station. The applicant was struck by several police officers, including E.Ch., before being released. Before leaving the police station, the applicant asked that his belongings be returned to him. In reply, E.Ch. came up to him and attempted to strangle him with his tie, ordering the applicant to get out of his sight. Outside the station, police officers blocked his path and threatened to beat him with their truncheons. Seeing that the applicant refused to leave and insisted that the confiscated religious literature be returned, a police officer came up and threw his Bible in his face. 28. On returning home, the applicant and his wife noticed that his chest was red. He also found it painful. His wife immediately went to the police station, protesting about the way her husband had been treated, and asking for the return of the confiscated belongings. She was, in turn, insulted and chased out of the premises. 29. On the following day, Mr Gabunia, applicant no. 7, was walking in the street in Kutaisi with religious tracts. He gave one to E.K., who was accompanied by another police officer. In response, E.K. reprimanded him, stating that his conduct was not worthy of a Christian. B.M., the second police officer, punched him in the stomach and, after he had fallen to the ground, pulled his bag away from him. The police officers emptied the bag and tore up the religious literature inside. They kept two Bibles for themselves. When the applicant insisted that they return his Bible, B.M. threatened to put him in his car and dump him in the Rioni River. 30. On 2 October 2000 the applicants lodged an administrative complaint with the Kutaisi Court against the Ministry of the Interior, the chief and deputy chief of Kutaisi police and police officers B.M. and E.K. Claiming that their rights guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution and Articles 9 and 14 of the Convention had been breached, they asked that the Ministry of the Interior issue a public apology and bring disciplinary proceedings against two of its staff who, in their opinion, had failed to comply with their professional duties, as provided for in the Police Act. The applicants also asked to be compensated in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage, in application of Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code. 31. Questioned by the court, the applicants confirmed the abovementioned events. Mr Gabunia described in detail the place where he had met the two police officers, and stated that they had been in uniform and wore badges. He also provided information about the make, colour and registration number of their car. Mr Dzamukov provided the registration number of the car in which he had been taken to the police station. His wife gave the registration number of the vehicle in which E.Ch. had followed her., while Ms L.K., a witness to the incident at the police station, confirmed that she had seen Mr Dzamukov there. E.Ch. denied the allegations, stating that he had been on leave on the day in question and had not been in Kutaisi. B.M. and E.K. also denied the allegations, claiming that they were seeing the applicants for the first time. 32. On 7 June 2002 the applicants’ complaint was dismissed as illfounded. The court pointed to the rights guaranteed by Article 19 of the Constitution and noted that, historically, no religion had ever been persecuted in Georgia. It further noted the following: “It is also well known that many of Jehovah’s Witnesses blatantly violate the requirements of Article 19 § 3 of the Constitution and frequently impose their opinion and belief on others, thus violating their rights.” Then the court set aside the three witness statements in favour of the applicants on the ground that those people had not been eyewitnesses. In addition, it noted the following: “The first two witnesses are Jehovah’s Witnesses and the applicants’ friends, and they have an interest in having the case decided in the applicants’ favour.” As the applicants had not submitted any other valid evidence (medical reports, torn-up religious literature, or other items), their allegations were held to be ill-founded. Lastly, the court noted that Mr Dzamukov had waited one year before adding E.Ch.’s name to his complaint. 33. The applicants lodged an appeal, stating that submitting the destroyed religious literature to the court would have had no valid evidential value, since it would not have sufficed to prove that the police officers concerned had torn up the literature on the date in question. The applicants also explained that it had not been necessary to obtain a medical report, given that they had not received serious wounds or injuries. That did not, however, alter the fact that they had been struck by the police officers. Furthermore, in their opinion, the insults directed against them on account of their faith had been sufficient to establish that the police officers had been negligent in carrying out their professional duties. 34. On 18 December 2002 the Kutaisi District Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal on the same grounds as the first-instance court. In particular, it took account of the fact that the police officers had denied the allegations and that the applicants had suffered no physical injuries. It concluded that, in the absence of sufficient evidence to the contrary, there had been no damage to the applicants’ dignity or any infringement of their right to freedom of religion, which ruled out the application of Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code and the granting of compensation. 35. According to the applicants, the appeal court took into consideration an oral statement by E.K., who had claimed that he did not recognise a white car with the registration number DAQ 492, which Mr Dzamukov had nonetheless identified as being that in which the two police officers had been patrolling at the time of the incident in question. After the hearing, however, E.K. had left in that same vehicle, which had been parked in front of the regional court. The applicants took a photograph, and attached it to their appeal on points of law. They complained, in particular, that E.K.’s denial had been accepted by the first-instance court and on appeal without any supporting evidence. 36. After postponing the hearing several times on account of the absence of the defending parties, the Supreme Court examined the applicants’ appeal on points of law in written proceedings, and dismissed it on 17 October 2003. It criticised the applicants for failing to bring criminal proceedings against the police officers. The Supreme Court stated that acknowledging that the police officers had failed in their professional obligations in the impugned manner (attacking and assaulting the applicants) would be equivalent to recognising, in the context of administrative proceedings, their criminal guilt, which would be contrary to the law. At the same time, if the accusation against the police officers had indeed been confirmed in criminal proceedings, the applicants would have been entitled to compensation, and also to a public apology. 37. The Supreme Court’s judgment was served on the applicants on 27 November 2003. 38. This part of the application concerns Mr Boris Gogoladze, Mrs Anastasia Tvaradze and Mrs Madona Kapanadze (applicants nos. 8-10 respectively). 39. On 1 April 2001 a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses was returning from a religious meeting in the village of Dviri, Borjomi region. At a bus stop they met Mr S.Kh., the deputy governor of the town of Borjomi, Mr J.B., the governor of Dviri, and about fifteen local residents. One of the latter, assaulted Mr Gogoladze, wounding him on the cheek, and tore a bag containing religious literature and other personal effects from his hands. Then he struck the two applicants on the head with a shoulder strap ripped from Mr Gogoladze’s bag. The two governors, who watched the attack, directed insults at the victims. In the end they asked the assailant to desist and left with him (see Begheluri and Others, cited above, § 56). 40. On 30 April 2001 the applicants filed an administrative complaint with the Borjomi Court against the Borjomi regional administration, the local police chief and the two governors concerned. The applicants asked that the officials apologise publicly and that the regional administration take disciplinary proceedings against them. They also claimed compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage (Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code). 41. On 17 September 2001 the court dismissed the applicants’ complaint on the grounds that the governors had not been under a legal obligation to ensure the maintenance of public order. It concluded that it had not been shown that they themselves had organised the attack in question or had personally attacked or assaulted the applicants. The decision was upheld on appeal by the Tbilisi Regional Court on 25 July 2003. The regional court held that ensuring the maintenance of public order did not amount to a “pressing obligation” on the governors. 42. On 13 February 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicants, using the same grounds as the regional court. 43. This part of the application concerns Mr Jimcher Gogelashvili, George Kurua and Omar Chubinidze (applicants nos. 11-13). 44. On 27 March 2001 a group of Orthodox religious extremists led by Mr P. Bluashvili, a leader of the Jvari movement, burst into Mr Gogelashvili’s flat, where a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses was holding a meeting. The assailants ordered the Jehovah’s Witnesses, whom they described as Christ-insulters and Satanists, to hand over their religious literature and to leave the premises. The Jehovah’s Witnesses protested, referring to provisions of the Constitution, but were nonetheless obliged to comply. Mr Kurua was insulted by Mr Bluashvili, who then pulled on his tie to strangle him. 45. After confiscating religious literature from the people present in the flat, the attackers opened the cupboards and took out similar literature, first throwing it on the floor, and then out of the window. The benches used by the Jehovah’s Witnesses during the meeting were also thrown out of the window. 46. The attack was recorded on video. Moreover, an individual wearing civilian clothes, who, according to the applicants, was a police officer named L. Gogolauri, appears on the screen. He stands in the courtyard, observes the Jehovah’s Witnesses being chased from the flat and allows a child to leave, carrying a bench that has been thrown from a window. 47. The applicants assessed the pecuniary damage caused by the attack in question at about EUR 760 (audio-visual equipment, religious literature, benches, and other items). They submitted an audit report, dated 23 May 2001, in support of their claim. 48. On the day after the above incident the same group of attackers publicly burned the religious literature taken from Mr Gogelashvili’s home at the main market in Rustavi. That scene was also captured in the abovementioned recording. According to the applicants, the police officers patrolling the market did not react. 49. On 30 April 2001 the Jehovah’s Witnesses who had been victims of the attack, including the three applicants named above, as well as the representation of the Pennsylvania Watch Tower in Georgia and the Union of Jehovah’s Witnesses, filed an administrative complaint with the Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi Court against the Ministry of the Interior, Mr Th.A., the chief of Rustavi police, Mr L.G., the head of the police station involved in the case, and Mr K.Z., a police officer. They alleged that the officials had failed in their professional obligations and had breached Articles 8-11, 13 and 14 of the Convention. 50. In particular, the applicants asked that the Ministry of the Interior issue a public apology, in accordance with section 8(37) of the Police Act, and bring disciplinary proceedings against the above-named police officers. The applicants also claimed compensation in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, in application of Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code, and asked that a directive be sent to all police stations in the country, stating that the rights of Jehovah’s Witnesses were to be respected. Drawing the court’s attention to the spread of violence against Jehovah’s Witnesses throughout the country, they asked that it rule on their case in accordance with the law, as, in their opinion, a proper judicial decision could help to halt such violence. 51. The court heard the three applicants and other Jehovah’s Witnesses who had been victims of the attack. They all complained about the passivity of the police officers present at the scene. Mr Gogelashvili stated that when the attack had begun, he had gone to a police station located about a hundred metres from his building. After some delay, two police officers had accompanied him back to the scene. He had seen that books and furniture were being thrown out of the window. The police officers had taken no action. He had then run up the stairs to his flat to retrieve some money that he kept in a cupboard. He had found that the cupboard door had been broken and that EUR 130 had been stolen. Mr Gogelashvili complained that the police officers had not intervened to prevent the violation of his private property or to protect the victims. 52. Mr Kurua stated that immediately after leaving the flat on the attackers’ orders, he had gone to the police station, where he had learned that the alarm had already been raised. He had asked that police officers return with him, in order to “intimidate” the attackers. The officers had refused to accompany him. 53. Mr Chubinidze stated that during the attack he had telephoned the police from the flat, but that the person on the other end of the telephone had hung up immediately. He had then been obliged to comply with the orders to leave the flat. He had managed to grab his bag back from an attacker who had taken it. 54. On 10 May 2002 the court decided to strike the case out of its list of cases, on the basis of a letter, allegedly signed by the applicants, withdrawing their complaint. On 5 June 2002 they lodged an appeal, stating that the signatures on the letter in question had been forged and that they had never withdrawn their complaint. On 16 December 2002 the appeal court overturned the decision of 10 May 2002 and proceedings resumed. 55. Questioned by the Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi District Court, a representative of the Ministry of the Interior argued that it had not been established that the police had been present at the scene and asked that the applicants’ complaint be dismissed. The police officers themselves did not attend the hearings on two consecutive dates. Obliged to rule in their absence, on 16 July 2003 the court dismissed the complaint as ill-founded. It considered it established that the applicants had been attacked by a group of individuals led by Mr Bluashvili on 27 March 2001. It considered, however, that the applicants had not demonstrated that the police had been present at the scene or that they had watched passively as acts had been committed against property and the applicants’ rights to freedom of religion. Accordingly, it had not been established that the police officers had failed to perform their professional duties within the meaning of Article 1005 § 1 of the Civil Code. Nonetheless, in the same decision, the court acknowledged that, after having been informed of the attack, the police officers had gone to the scene, which had resulted in a decision to place the attackers under investigation. According to the court, in the context of the latter criminal proceedings, it would be lawful for the applicants to submit a claim for compensation against the individuals who had infringed their rights. The decision made no reference to the burning of literature at Rustavi market. 56. On 25 June 2004 the Tbilisi Regional Court upheld the first-instance judgment, repeating the grounds used in it. Neither the representative of the Ministry of the Interior nor the police officers appeared. 57. On 2 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicants. The court concluded that the fact of a breach of duty by the police, either intentionally or by negligence, had not been proven.","['14', '9']",['9-1'],[],[],[],[],1
44,001-176816,ENG,BGR,COMMITTEE,2017,CASE OF KARZHEV v. BULGARIA,4,Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{general} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression),Erik Møse;Yonko Grozev;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1945 and lives in Sofia. 6. The applicant is a former prosecutor. For several years, until 2005 or 2006, he served as district prosecutor for Sofia, heading what has been described as the largest prosecution office in Bulgaria. While in that post, he got into a conflict with several of his subordinates, including B.K. and G.C. 7. After the applicant left his post, a commission was appointed with the task of looking into the prosecution office’s work under his management. B.K. and G.C. were among the commission’s members. The revision carried out by the commission led subsequently to the opening of criminal proceedings against the applicant, as it was alleged that he had exerted pressure on one of his subordinates in relation to the outcome of a case. 8. On 12 October 2006 the national daily Trud published an interview with the applicant, where he stated: “All my life I have fought against crime. What is more, I have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services. I admit that I have failed. And now I am bearing the consequences of that. The commission which carried out the inquiry [at the district prosecutor’s office] includes exactly those prosecutors, [B.K., G.C. and a third person], who staged a revolt at the time against the working methods I introduced. The aim of those methods was to eliminate any grounds for corrupt arrangements related to the cases. That did not suit those three prosecutors and the notorious [prosecutor N.N.].” 9. Warned by the journalist interviewing him that his words were strong, the applicant nevertheless continued: “I am saying things which will not surprise my colleagues. It is a public secret that one of the prosecutors I mentioned is known among barristers and “clients” of the prosecution not so much with his own name, but with another one.” The applicant then explained that the prosecutor at issue was known as “Prosecutor Rushvetchiyski” (прокурора Рушветчийски), meaning someone who takes bribes, derived from the colloquial word for bribe, rushvet (рушвет). 10. Asked by the journalist whether the Chief Public Prosecutor knew that, the applicant continued: “If he does not know, he may ask me. I am knowledgeable about corruption patterns. And because I respect his efforts to defeat these patterns, I will give him a well-meant advice: he should check the properties owned by the people accusing me of having committed an offence while doing my work.” 11. Questioned about a finding by the commission that a “bad psychological atmosphere” existed at the Sofia district public prosecutor’s office while it was headed by him, the applicant stated further: “The inspection might be right, if by ‘bad psychological atmosphere’ they mean my intolerance towards those prosecutors ..., who performed their duties in a sloppy manner, or attended meetings with the lawyers of criminals to decide on the outcome of cases. There were such prosecutors at the [Sofia district prosecutor’s office]. They became an organised group when the prosecutor [N.N.] came to work with us. ... The animosity between me and [N.N.’s] circle, comprising the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service, is well known. As are known from media publications [N.N.’s] palaces, the companies owned by his wife in association with criminals. ... It is ironic that exactly those prosecutors which we at the [district prosecutor’s office] called “[N.N.’s] guardsmen” are in the group which is to check my work. Me being checked by Prosecutor Rushvetchiyski! Shame! And have the case files of the checkers also been checked?” 12. Asked then about the working methods he had introduced, the applicant stated: “Instead of commenting on whether the working methods introduced by me have been effective, I will give you simple statistics. I took over [the district prosecutor’s office] in 1996. During the previous year the prosecutors in it had drawn up 782 acts of indictment. 39% of those were remitted by the courts, and the acquittals were 12%. This means that the failures were 51%. The persons convicted were 768. Now pay attention to the statistics for 2004, after I introduced my working methods. Acts of indictment drawn up: 4,164. Only 8% of the cases remitted by the courts. Acquittals: 6%. Persons convicted: 3,594. I am not being smug about the obvious progress of the prosecution. On the contrary, I thought we could have improved even further. ...” Concerning the working methods at issue, the applicants said further: “The aim was to make the police officer and the prosecutor work side by side, exactly as European experts are recommending. And to reduce the possibilities for corruption deals made in private ... But I do not want to talk any further. My frustration is enormous. You understand why.” 13. In response to a question by the journalist as to why he had not discussed the matter with the Chief Prosecutor, the applicant said: “I don’t know if there is any point. In fact, what [he] is doing now in [his office] is what I tried to do at the time at the [Sofia district prosecutor’s office] – to sweep all the trash out of the house. I managed, to a certain extent, but at the end of the day many pieces of trash came to the surface. They are crushing me now. I hope sincerely that the same fate will not befall [the Chief Prosecutor].” 14. On 16 October 2006 Trud published B.K. and G.C.’s response to the applicant’s allegations. That article has not been submitted by the parties. 15. On an unspecified date in 2007, B.K. and G.C. initiated a private prosecution of the applicant, alleging that he had insulted them and had committed the offence under Articles 146 and 148 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 24 below). They found the following statements particularly offensive: “I have tried to defeat the mafia present in the prosecution services”; “the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service”; “many pieces of trash came to the surface ...crushing me now”; as well as his allegedly calling one of them “Prosecutor Rushvetchiyski”. They claimed that the offence was aggravated because the insult had been made through the media and concerned them in their capacity as “public officials”. 16. In the context of the criminal proceedings, B.K. and G.C. also brought civil claims for damages against the applicant, each of them seeking 10,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) in compensation. 17. The first-instance court, the Plovdiv District Court, heard a number of witnesses, who described the conflict between the applicant and B.K. and G.C. It also heard the applicant, who stated that when making the above statements he had not referred to either of the two complainants and pointed out that in the interview he had mentioned the names of two other prosecutors, in particular N.N. 18. In a judgment of 5 December 2007, the Plovdiv District Court acquitted the applicant and dismissed the civil claims against him. It considered that it had not been established that the expressions complained of had indeed referred to B.K. and G.C. It found further that the complainants had seen the statements as being aimed at them, and had felt their reputation and dignity as being harmed, “owing to their strained relations” with the applicant. 19. B.K. and G.C. lodged an appeal. In a final judgment of 22 May 2008 the Plovdiv Regional Court reversed the lower court’s ruling and convicted the applicant, finding that he was guilty of insult in an aggravated form. It set aside his criminal liability but imposed an administrative penalty on him – a fine of BGN 1,000 (the equivalent of 510 euros (EUR)). Furthermore, it ordered him to pay each of the complainants BGN 5,000 (the equivalent of EUR 2,551) in damages, plus interest, and BGN 412 (the equivalent of EUR 210) for the costs and expenses incurred by the complainants. 20. The Regional Court reasoned as follows: “It is a fact that the accused uttered the expressions indicated in the private criminal prosecution – “mafia in the prosecution services”, “Rushvetchiyski”, “the unhealthiest elements in the prosecution service” and “many pieces of trash came to the surface ...crushing me now”. It is also a fact that the expressions were uttered in an interview, which was published and disseminated through the mass media – the Trud newspaper ..., in its issue of 12 October 2006. It is a fact that the complainants ... were named in their capacity as public officials – being prosecutors at the Sofia district public prosecutor’s office – and in relation to their official duties.” ... “It has been established that the complainants were aware of those statements, on the basis of the testimony [of the witnesses], as well as on the basis of the article in Trud published on 16 October 2006, and presented in the case, which contained ... their response to the interview of 12 October 2006 ....” “It can be seen from the testimony [of the witnesses] that after reading the interview given by the accused ...the complainants felt that their honour and dignity had been harmed, which caused a feeling of humiliation ...” “The accused’s explanations show that he was aware that the incriminatory expressions were offensive and humiliating to those to whom they were addressed [and] the manner in which he disseminated them [shows] that he aimed to make them public and that they reach the complainants ...” “The accused’s claim in his defence, endorsed by the district court, that the incriminatory expressions were not directed specifically at the complainants ..., cannot be accepted by the appeal court. The fact that [the statements] may have been directed against two other [prosecutors whose names were mentioned in the interview], and that those people may have decided not to prosecute the accused for harming their honour and dignity, does not alter the fact that the accused’s criminal liability in respect of the two complainants must be engaged.” 21. The applicant paid in the amounts indicated in paragraph 19 above on 7 August 2008. The total amount paid, including interest and the fees charged by the enforcement official, was BGN 14,826 (the equivalent of about EUR 7,565). 22. On 5 January 2009 Trud published an interview with B.K. and G.C., where they discussed the applicant’s conviction.",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

He has been disabled since childhood and has lacked legal capacity since 1999. The application was brought on his behalf by his mother. 6. At about 5 p.m. on 28 August 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of robbery and taken to Industrialniy district police station, Barnaul (Индустриальный РОВД г. Барнаула, “the Industrialniy ROVD”) by Officers K., S. and Ch., who allegedly beat him when they arrived at the police station. 7. A report on the applicant’s arrest was drawn up at 9 p.m., following which the applicant’s mother was informed about his arrest. She arrived at the police station shortly afterwards. The applicant complained, in the presence of his mother and a lawyer, that he felt unwell and that he had been beaten by the police officers who had arrested him. 8. An ambulance was called to the police station at 10.29 p.m. on 28 August. The applicant was diagnosed as having facial and chest contusions. He told the ambulance medics that he had been physically assaulted by the police. 9. Another ambulance was called for the applicant at 12.24 a.m. on 29 August 2007, to the temporary detention facility. He was diagnosed as having a contusion on the soft tissues of the face and an X-ray examination was recommended. The applicant told the medics that he had injured himself while drunk two days previously after falling down and hitting his head on the ground. 10. The applicant was taken to hospital the same day for the X-ray examination and was diagnosed as having a closed fracture of his nose bones with displacement of bone fragments and a chest contusion. He gave the same explanation for the injuries as he had given previously that day to the ambulance medics at the temporary detention facility. 11. Upon admission to the temporary detention facility, staff seized, among other items, a pledge ticket for a silver chain and cross which were in pawn until 5 September 2007 (worth 4,840 Russian roubles (RUB) and RUB 990 respectively). 12. On 30 August 2007 the Industrialniy District Court of Barnaul (“the District Court”) ordered the applicant to be kept under arrest for an additional forty-eight hours, until 2.30 p.m. on 1 September 2007. 13. On 1 September 2007 the applicant was released. 14. On the same day the District Court granted an application from the investigator to place the applicant in a psychiatric hospital for a psychiatric forensic examination. 15. On 4 September 2007 the applicant was admitted to a psychiatric hospital, where he stayed until 4 October 2007. 16. On 4 October 2007 the report on the forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant was concluded. It established that at the time of the events in question the applicant could understand and take responsibility for his actions. 17. On 11 October 2007 the pawn shop ticket was returned to the applicant. 18. On 9 November 2007 the applicant underwent planned surgery for a fracture of the nose (rhinoplasty). 19. On 17 March 2008 the criminal proceedings against the applicant were discontinued owing to a lack of evidence of his involvement in the crime in question. 20. On 29 August 2007 the applicant’s mother complained to the prosecutor’s office that the applicant had been beaten by the police. 21. On 19 September 2007 a forensic medical expert held that the closed fracture of the applicant’s nose had been caused by a blow from a hard, blunt object with a limited area of impact and that it had resulted in moderately severe health damage. The report went on to say that the injury had occurred shortly before the applicant had sought medical assistance and that it could have been caused on 28 August 2007. The possibility of the injury being caused by a fall or that the applicant had inflicted it on himself was excluded. The diagnosis of a chest contusion was found to be unsubstantiated by the information in the medical documents. 22. On 4 October, 25 November and 24 December 2007, and 1 February and 15 March 2008 the prosecutor’s office refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant for lack of the constituent elements of a crime in their actions. The applicant’s statements were found to be contradictory and not consistent with the injuries sustained. The applicant’s mother had not witnessed the alleged beatings and, because the applicant was mentally disabled and had been inebriated when arrested, his statements were assessed in critical fashion. There was also evidence that the applicant had possibly had injuries prior to his arrest. The initial refusal to institute criminal proceedings referred to the following evidence: - the statements of the applicant’s mother, who submitted that the applicant had had no injuries when he had left home on 28 August 2007 and that she had found him at the police station later that day with a swollen face, bruises on his back and with his clothes covered in blood; - a statement by the applicant’s mother that on 26 August 2007 she had witnessed a quarrel between her son and a certain Kar., that she had called the police and that the police had helped her take the applicant home; - statements by a witness, B., who had seen the applicant on 28 August 2007, shortly before his arrest, drunk, but without any visible injuries; B. later saw police officers escorting the applicant to a police car, with the applicant showing no resistance. B. did not see the police officers using physical force against the applicant; - the applicant’s statements on the circumstances of his arrest. He submitted, in particular, that the beatings had taken place at the back entrance to the police station and in an out-of-the-way office inside the police station; the police officers had hit him with truncheons on his back, bottom and legs (at least four to five blows), and had then punched him on the head and nose (no less than seven to ten blows). The applicant had started bleeding and the officers had threatened him, warning him not to tell anyone about the beatings; - information on the applicant’s health and his disability, as well as his previous criminal and administrative offence records; - documents on the applicant’s arrest; - documents on the ambulance doctors’ examination of the applicant on 28 August 2007 in connection with complaints of a bleeding nose and chest pain; - the forensic medical report of 19 September 2007 (see paragraph 21 above); - statements by Officers S. and K. on the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest. In particular, they submitted that when the applicant had seen them he had started to run in the opposite direction. He had stumbled and fallen forward onto the pavement. When they had lifted him up they had noticed that he had old abrasions on the left side of his face and a bleeding nose, probably from falling on the pavement. His breath had also smelt of alcohol. The applicant had then been escorted to the police car and taken to the police station. He had not resisted arrest and no physical force had been applied to him; - statements by Officer Ch., who had been waiting for S. and K. in the police car. He submitted that he had seen S. and K. escorting the applicant to the car and that the applicant had been visibly drunk. He had had abrasions and dried blood on his face and his clothes had been dirty. No physical force had been used against him; - statements by police officers on duty at the police station on 28 August 2007 about the absence of any conflict situations there on that day or any complaints of ill-treatment from the applicant; - statements by Ts., A., D., detained at the police station at the same time as the applicant. They submitted that they had not witnessed any clashes between the applicant and the police and had not seen the police use physical force against him; - statements by the investigator, N., who had questioned the applicant on 28 August 2007 and to whom he had explained that his injuries (a scratch on the face and a swollen nose) had been sustained while he was drunk, either by falling down or in some other way, the applicant had not remembered exactly. The investigator had later called the applicant’s mother. After she had arrived, the applicant had started complaining that he felt unwell and that he had been beaten by the police, after which an ambulance had been called for him; - statements by the investigator D., who said that she had questioned the applicant on 31 August 2007 at the temporary detention facility. He had stated that he had been drinking in the courtyard of his house on 26 August 2007 and had picked a fight with a certain Kar., with whom he had drunk before; - information from the temporary detention facility on the applicant’s injuries at the time of his admission (a closed fracture of the nasal bones and an abrasion on the left cheek) and a handwritten note from the applicant to the effect that he had received the injuries after falling down while in an inebriated state and that he had no complaints about the law-enforcement bodies; - statements by a certain R., who submitted that on 26 August 2007 the applicant and her husband Kar. had been drinking together and had had a quarrel. The subsequent decisions also took into account the following evidence: - statements by Kar., who submitted that he had been drinking alcohol with the applicant on 25 August 2007, that they had been so drunk they could not walk in a straight line and had had to hold to one another, and that on their way home they had fallen down several times. On 26 August 2007 Kar. and the applicant had again spent all day drinking together, but had had no arguments. He could not remember whether the applicant had had any injuries on 25 and 26 August 2007; - an additional forensic medical report of 18 December 2007 which showed that the injury could have been caused on 26 August 2007 but that it could not have been caused by the applicant’s falling down; - statements by the doctors who examined the applicant on 28 and 29 August 2007 and performed the X-ray examination and by the expert who conducted the initial forensic medical examination. 23. The supervising authority set aside all those decisions, except for the most recent one, as unfounded and ordered additional pre-investigation inquiries. 24. In the meantime, on 13 December 2007 the chief of inquiries at the investigations department of the Industrialniy ROVD instituted criminal proceedings against unidentified persons under Article 112 § 1 of the Criminal Code for the intentional infliction of moderately severe damage to the applicant’s health at an unidentified place and time, but no later than midnight of 19 September 2007. 25. On 14 February 2008, 11 March 2009, 20 October 2010 and 5 May 2012 forensic medical examinations of the applicant’s medical file were conducted. The conclusions of the examinations showed that the closed fracture of the nose and swelling of the soft tissues in the nasal area could have been caused between 26 August and 28 August 2007. It was not possible to completely exclude the possibility that the above injury had originated as the result of the impact of a slightly protruding object. The injured area was also accessible to the applicant himself. The report of 20 October 2010 excluded the possibility that the applicant had been injured by falling on the pavement while running away from Officers S. and K. given the absence of other injuries on prominent parts of his face (nose, cheekbones or forehead) or on other parts of his body (the stomach or his extremities). 26. On 12 January 2008 the chief of inquiries at the investigations department of the Industrialniy ROVD decided to suspend the investigation. 27. However, on 29 January 2008 the acting prosecutor of the Industrialniy District of Barnaul set that decision aside. He noted that the case file contained information that police officers at the Industrialniy ROVD had allegedly inflicted the applicant’s injuries and transferred the criminal case from the investigations department of the Industrialniy ROVD to the Barnaul investigations department of the investigation committee of the Altay Regional Prosecutor’s Office. 28. On 11 February 2008 the chief of inquiries at the investigations department of the investigation committee of the Altay Regional Prosecutor’s Office resumed the case. 29. On 13 February 2008 a witness, I., (the victim in the proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of robbery) submitted that when the alleged robbery had taken place, at about 3 p.m. on 28 August 2007, she had noticed that the applicant had an old abrasion on his face. She did not exclude the possibility that she could have scratched the applicant in the course of the struggle, but she had not hit him and had not seen any injuries on his face later that day when she had seen him at the police station. 30. On 16 February 2008 Officer Ch. was questioned as a witness. 31. On 11 April 2008 the proceedings were suspended for the second time. The decision mentioned that the operational-search activities conducted to identify the perpetrator of the assault had not led to any positive results. It provided no further details on the exact measures taken by the investigator. 32. On 16 April 2008 the deputy head of the investigations department set that decision aside and held that it was necessary to give the applicant victim status in the proceedings and question him. He also wanted to give the applicant’s mother the status of the applicant’s legal representative and question her, to carry out a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric examination of the applicant, to question a number of witnesses on the circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment (among them Officer S.), and to join references from work on Officers K., S. and Ch. to the case file. 33. On 17 April 2008 the applicant was given the status of a victim in the proceedings and was questioned as such. The applicant’s mother joined the proceedings as his legal representative and was questioned. 34. On 19 May 2008 the proceedings were suspended for the third time, with reference to the fact that the operational-search activities to identify the perpetrator had not led to any positive result. However, on 21 May 2008 the deputy head of the investigations department set that decision aside and held that it was necessary to question the witnesses to establish all the relevant circumstances of the alleged ill-treatment. 35. Between May and August 2008 the head of the Industrialniy ROVD and the officers present there at the time of the applicant’s arrest were questioned as witnesses. 36. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2008 a fourth decision on suspending the proceedings was taken. However, on 2 July 2008 the deputy head of the investigations department set the decision aside and listed in detail the investigative measures that were needed. They included questioning the police officers S., K. and Ch. about the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest, a forensic psychiatric examination of the applicant and, depending on the results of that examination, deciding on the possibility of carrying out identification parades involving the applicant and S., K. and Ch. 37. On 7 August 2008 Officer K. was questioned as a witness. 38. The proceedings were suspended for the fifth time on 14 September 2008, but were again resumed on 29 September 2008. The acting head of the investigations department considered it necessary, inter alia, to put further questions to certain witnesses. He also wanted to carry out a comprehensive psychological and psychiatric forensic examination of the applicant and, depending on the results of that examination, to decide on the possibility of carrying out identification parades involving the applicant and S., K. and Ch. In addition, he wanted to request documents on the applicant’s hospital treatment after 4 September 2007 and join them to the case file and to carry out an additional forensic medical examination. 39. On 23 October 2008 another witness, D., (an acquaintance of the applicant’s mother) stated that he had seen the applicant’s arrest on 28 August 2007. The applicant had been escorted by two people – one wearing a police uniform and the other in plain clothes. The applicant had not shown any resistance, had had no visible injuries and had not been subjected to physical force. 40. On 28 October 2008 the applicant had an additional forensic psychiatric examination, which established that at the time of the alleged beatings he could not correctly perceive the factual aspect of events or understand the meaning and nature of actions taken in his respect. 41. On 30 October and 8 November 2008 two witnesses, Z. and M., stated respectively that they had seen the applicant on 28 August 2007, shortly before his arrest, that he had been dressed tidily and had had no injuries on his body or blood stains on his clothes. They had later seen him being escorted by two police officers to a police car, the applicant had acted calmly, his clothes had been tidy and no physical force had been applied to him. A similar statement was made by the witness B. 42. On 14 November 2008 the investigator decided to suspend the proceedings for the sixth time. He relied on the results of the applicant’s forensic psychiatric examination of 28 October 2008 and therefore the impossibility for the investigation to rely on his statements, as well as the absence of eyewitnesses of the circumstances in which the applicant had received his injuries. However, on 30 December 2008 the District Court found that decision unlawful and unsubstantiated. 43. On 12 February 2009 the proceedings were resumed, only to be suspended for the seventh time on 12 March 2009 for the same reasons as given in the decision of 14 November 2008. However, on 7 April 2009 the District Court found the decision of 12 March 2009 unlawful and unsubstantiated, and on 14 May 2009 the proceedings were again resumed. 44. On 15 June 2009 the proceedings were yet again suspended. The decision said that the applicant’s statement about his alleged ill-treatment by the police officers S., K. and Ch. could not be admitted as evidence in view of the results of the forensic psychiatric examination of 28 October 2008. The applicant’s mother’s statements had derived from those of the applicant himself. There was no direct evidence proving that the applicant had sustained his injuries at the hands of S., K. and Ch. The fact that those officers had arrested the applicant and taken him to the Industrialniy ROVD had not proved that they had been involved in the alleged ill-treatment. Exhaustive measures had been taken to establish the time the applicant had sustained his injuries. The witnesses B., D. and Z., who had seen the applicant’s arrest, had stated that they had not seen the police officers use any physical force against him. 45. On 12 January 2010 the proceedings were resumed and subsequently suspended for the ninth time on 15 February 2010. The investigation established that on 28 August 2007 the applicant had been taken to the Industrialniy ROVD by Officers S., K. and Ch. The applicant had complained that those officers had beaten him after his arrest. According to the forensic medical examination of 14 February 2008, the applicant had had a closed fracture of bones in the nose and swelling of the soft tissues in the nasal area, which had been caused by the impact of a hard, blunt object and could have occurred between 26 August and 28 August 2007. The investigation had not confirmed any fact of ill-treatment of the applicant by S., K. and Ch. That was in accordance with the statements by the police officers, who had denied inflicting any injuries on the applicant, the witnesses who had seen the applicant’s arrest, the records of identification parades and other evidence. There had been no other evidence attesting directly to the fact that a crime had been committed by the police officers. In addition, the decision reiterated that the applicant’s statements could not be relied on in view of the results of the forensic psychiatric examination of 28 October 2008 and could not be a basis for bringing charges against the police officers. The mother’s statements had derived from those of the applicant and therefore could not be relied on either. 46. On 27 April 2010 the District Court found the decision of 15 February 2010 unlawful and unsubstantiated and on 1 June 2010 the proceedings were again resumed. 47. On 8 June 2010 P., an expert in psychiatry – a doctor of medical sciences and a professor – was questioned as a witness. He submitted that the conclusions of the psychiatric expert examination of 28 October 2008 on the applicant’s mental state at the time of the events in question were more consistent and reliable than those of the applicant’s previous psychiatric expert examination on 4 October 2007. 48. On 11 June 2010 the proceedings were suspended for the tenth time. The decision referred to the applicant’s arrest on 28 August 2007, his statement as to the alleged ill-treatment by the police officers S., K. and Ch., the results of the forensic medical examination of 14 February 2008 with a description of his injuries and the time they were inflicted, and the police officers’ denial of the alleged ill-treatment. 49. Proceedings were resumed on 12 July 2010. Formal confrontations were carried out between the witnesses B. and Z., Officer K. and Z., Officer Ch. and Z., the applicant and the investigator N., the applicant’s mother and N., the applicant and the police officer who had taken him from the Industrialniy ROVD to the temporary detention facility and had allegedly threatened him on their way there by warning him not to tell anyone about the beatings, and the applicant and Officer K. 50. On 19 July 2010 the proceedings were suspended for the eleventh time. The decision noted that it had been impossible to reconcile the statements of the police officers and the witnesses as to whether the applicant had had any injuries on his face at the time of his arrest. However, on 31 August 2010 the District Court found that decision unlawful and unjustified and the proceedings resumed again on 19 October 2010. 51. On 21 August 2010 another police officer, S., was questioned as a witness (the case file contains no earlier record, if any, of the questioning of S. as a witness). 52. The proceedings were again suspended on 26 October 2010, 14 January, 10 February and 17 February 2011, and resumed respectively on 12 January, 8 February, 15 February and 7 April 2012. In addition to the previously collected evidence, the decisions on suspension relied on: - statements by the investigator N.; - statements by Ts., D. and Yer., detained at the police station at the same time as the applicant; - a radiology laboratory assistant K. and the radiologist R.; - an expert, Kl., on the nature of the applicant’s injuries; - statements by Kar.; - a statement by the witness, S., who submitted that she had seen a fight between the applicant and the witness I., but that she had not seen any injuries on the applicant’s body at that time; - Kr., who submitted that she had seen no injuries on the applicant on 26 August 2007 and that when she had seen him on 1 September 2007 he had had a swollen nose. He had had no other visible injuries; - a statement by the officer on duty at the temporary detention facility, P., who called an ambulance for the applicant on 29 August 2007; - the ambulance medics who examined the applicant on 28 August and 29 August 2007, but who could not remember any circumstances of value to the investigation given the length of time since the events in question; - the neurosurgeon R., who examined the applicant on 29 August 2007 at the hospital and submitted that he could have received his injuries several days prior to the examination; - the lawyer M., present at the applicant’s questioning at the police station on 28 August 2007. Owing to the passage of time, he could not remember whether the applicant had any visible injuries or if he had told him anything about the circumstances of the alleged beatings. 53. On 10 May 2012 the proceedings were suspended for the sixteenth and last time. Taking into account the evidence that had been collected, the investigating authority came to the conclusion that the applicant had received his injuries no later than 10.37 p.m. on 28 August 2007 (the time of his examination by ambulance medics at the Industrialniy ROVD). However, it was impossible to make an objective and reliable conclusion as to the exact time and circumstances of the injuries. The results of the applicant’s psychiatric expert examination precluded the investigating authority from relying on the applicant’s submissions as evidence and there was no other evidence proving beyond doubt that his injuries had been inflicted in the circumstances he had described. In addition, the experts had arrived at the conclusion that the injury could have been caused anytime between 26 August and 28 August 2007. 54. According to the applicant, while the investigator was questioning him as a suspect on 28 August 2007, a trainee police officer, I., had taken the keys to his flat and had gone there and searched his room. A gold bracelet had allegedly gone missing after the search. 55. According to the applicant, Officers A. and B. had allegedly threatened him on the same day, warning him not to reveal that he had been beaten at the police station and to say instead that he had injured himself several days before in a fight. 56. From 2008 the applicant’s mother sought to have criminal proceedings instituted against I. and Officers A. and B. for abuse of position. 57. The investigator refused several times to institute criminal proceedings. 58. The most recent refusal to institute criminal proceedings against I. is dated 15 October 2009. On 10 December 2009 the Altay Regional Court found at final instance that the aforementioned decision was lawful and justified. It had been established that the applicant’s mother had let I. into the flat, answered his questions, and had then let him into the applicant’s room and helped him search it. It had also been established that the disappearance of a gold bracelet had been alleged long after the events complained of. For those reasons, there could not reasonably have been an expectation that the incident would be investigated. 59. The most recent refusal to institute criminal proceedings against A. and B. is dated 31 May 2010. The inquiry found no evidence to support the applicant’s allegations. There is no information in the case file as to whether the applicant challenged the lawfulness of that decision in court. 60. The applicant’s mother brought civil proceedings against the Ministry of Finance on behalf of herself and the applicant, seeking compensation for non-pecuniary damage caused by the unlawful prosecution of the applicant and the resulting medical treatment. She also sought compensation for pecuniary damage, representing the cost of the silver chain and cross which could not be recovered from the pawnshop and other costs and expenses. 61. On 10 March 2010 the District Court granted the claim in part and ordered the Ministry of Finance to pay the applicant RUB 15,000 for the non-pecuniary damage caused by his unlawful prosecution. It refused the claim for recovery of the cost of the silver chain and cross, holding that the mother, as the applicant’s legal representative, could have recovered them from the pawnshop herself. 62. On 21 April 2010 the Altay Regional Court upheld the above judgment on appeal, increasing the amount awarded in respect of nonpecuniary damage to RUB 40,000. The court further held that the applicant’s mother had failed to submit any evidence that she had asked the investigator to return the pawnshop pledge ticket and that such a request had been refused.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1962 and is detained in Daugavpils Prison. 11. On 25 April 1998 the applicant and another individual, A. Vovruško, were arrested by the police on suspicion of having committed, inter alia, aggravated assault against P.M. 12. Criminal proceedings were initiated in that connection, throughout which the applicant and his co-defendant pleaded their innocence. 13. On 27 September 2000 the applicant and his co-defendant were found guilty of the charges and were sentenced to nine and twelve years’ imprisonment respectively by the Riga Regional Court. 14. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law and unsuccessfully sought leave to attend the hearing on his appeal before the Supreme Court. 15. Following his questioning at the police station after his arrest, the applicant complained to the public prosecutor’s office that he had been ill-treated by police officers who had tried to obtain a confession from him (for details concerning similar allegations of ill-treatment made by the applicant’s co-defendant, see Vovruško v. Latvia, no. 11065/02, 11 December 2012). 16. As a result, criminal proceedings (case no. 50207598) were initiated against the police officers for abuse of official power. On 19 March 2001 those criminal proceedings were discontinued by the Riga police station investigator (Rīgas rajona policijas pārvalde) on grounds of insufficient evidence. The investigator found, inter alia, that the applicant’s allegations were incoherent, and concluded that the “light” injuries he had sustained could have been caused during his arrest. 17. On 8 October 2001 the applicant lodged an application (no. 547/02) with the Court. He alleged a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, complaining of having been subjected to ill-treatment during the pre-trial investigation and of the lack of an effective investigation into those allegations. He also alleged breaches of Article 3 (conditions of detention following his conviction), Article 5 § 3 (duration of pre-trial detention), Article 5 § 5 (lack of compensation), Article 6 § 1 (refusal to grant him leave to attend the Supreme Court hearing and overall duration of the criminal proceedings), and Article 6 § 1 taken in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14 of the Convention (lack of legal assistance). He lodged a further complaint under Article 6 § 1 alleging that the criminal proceedings which had resulted in his conviction had been unfair as his confession had been obtained from him as a result of ill-treatment in breach of Article 3. 18. On 22 February 2007 the Government were given notice of the applicant’s complaints concerning, inter alia, his ill-treatment and the lack of an effective investigation into his allegations in that regard. 19. On 30 April 2008 the Government submitted the following unilateral declaration: “The Government of the Republic of Latvia (hereinafter – the Government) represented by [their] Agent Inga Reine admit that the physical treatment of Viktors Jeronovičs (hereinafter – the applicant) by the police officers, as well as the effectiveness of the investigation of the respective applicant’s complaints, the access to legal aid and effective remedies to apply for the compensation of damages, the length of criminal proceedings [against the applicant], as well as the lack of effective remedy did not meet the standards enshrined in Article 3, Article [5 § 5], Article [6 § 1], Article 13 and Article 14 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter – the Convention). Being aware of that, the Government undertake to adopt all necessary measures in order to avoid similar infringements in future, as well as to provide an effective remedy. Taking into account that the parties have failed to reach a friendly settlement in this case, the Government declare that they offer to pay ex gratia to the applicant compensation in the amount of 4,500 EUR ([approximately] 3,163 LVL]), this amount being the global sum and covering any pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage together with any costs and expenses incurred, free of any taxes that may be applicable, with a view to terminat[ing] the proceedings pending before the European Court of Human Rights (hereinafter – the Court) in the case [of] Jeronovičs v. Latvia (application no. 547/02). ... This payment will constitute the final resolution of the case.” 20. On 10 February 2009 the Chamber of the Court’s Third Section to which the case had been allocated adopted a decision in which, inter alia, it took note of the terms of the Government’s declaration and, by virtue of Article 37 § 1 of the Convention, struck out the complaints mentioned in the unilateral declaration. The relevant paragraphs of the decision read as follows: “48. The Court observes at the outset that the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a friendly settlement of the case. It reiterates however that a distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, declarations made in the context of strictly confidential friendly-settlement negotiations and, on the other, unilateral declarations – such as the one at issue – made by a respondent Government in public and adversarial proceedings before the Court. In accordance with Article 38 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 62 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the Court will proceed on the basis of the Government’s unilateral declaration and the parties’ observations submitted outside the framework of the friendly-settlement negotiations, and will disregard the parties’ statements made in the context of exploring the possibilities for a friendly settlement of the case and the reasons why the parties were unable to agree on the terms of a friendly settlement (see Tahsin Acar v. Turkey (preliminary objection) [GC], no. 26307/95, § 74, ECHR 2003VI). 49. The Court further refers to Article 37 § 1 of the Convention, the relevant parts of which provide: ‘1. The Court may at any stage of the proceedings decide to strike an application out of its list of cases where the circumstances lead to the conclusion that ... (c) for any other reason established by the Court, it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the application. However, the Court shall continue the examination of the application if respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto so requires.’ Tahsin Acar, cited above, § 75; see also, for example, Van Houten v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 25149/03, § 33, ECHR 2005IX; Swedish Transport Workers’ Union v. Sweden (striking out), no. 53507/99, § 24, 18 July 2006; Kalanyos and Others v. Romania, no. 57884/00, § 25, 26 April 2007; Kladivík and Kašiar v. Slovakia (dec.) (striking out), no. 41484/04, 28 August 2007; Sulwińska v. Poland (dec.) (striking out), no. 28953/03, 18 September 2007; Stark and Others v. Finland (striking out), no. 39559/02, § 23, 9 October 2007; Feldhaus v. Germany (dec.) (striking out), no. 10583/02, 13 May 2008; and Kapitonovs v. Latvia (dec.) (striking out), no. 16999/02, 24 June 2008). ... 52. As to the ill-treatment to which the applicant was allegedly subjected in police custody and the effectiveness of the investigations carried out, although the Court has not to date found a violation of Article 3 by the Latvian police in that specific context, it nevertheless points to its clear and very extensive case-law in this regard (see, among many other authorities, Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, §§ 95-106, ECHR 1999V; Dikme v. Turkey, no. 20869/92, §§ 73-104, ECHR 2000VIII; and Karaduman and Others v. Turkey, no. 8810/03, §§ 64-82, 17 June 2008). The same is true as regards the principles governing the granting of legal aid as a component of the right of access to a court (see, for example, Aerts v. Belgium, 30 July 1998, §§ 59-60, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998V; P., C. and S. v. the United Kingdom, no. 56547/00, §§ 88-91, ECHR 2002VI; Bertuzzi v. France, no. 36378/97, §§ 23-32, ECHR 2003III; and Staroszczyk v. Poland, no. 59519/00, §§ 127-129, 22 March 2007). 53. In their declaration in the present case the Government have recognised that the treatment to which the applicant was subjected by the police officers while in police custody, the manner in which the investigations were carried out in that regard, the handling of the applicant’s claims for compensation and in particular the refusal of his applications for legal aid in order to gain access to the compensation procedure, as well as the length of the criminal proceedings against him, infringed Articles 3, 5 § 5, 6 § 1, 13 and 14 of the Convention. They have offered to pay the applicant EUR 4,500 in compensation and undertake to take all necessary measures to prevent similar violations in the future. 54. In view of the nature of the undertakings contained in the Government’s declaration, the Court considers that it is no longer justified to continue the examination of the complaints in question. That decision is without prejudice to the possibility for the applicant to exercise any other available remedies in order to obtain redress. The same applies to the complaint under Article 2 of Protocol No. 7, which is identical in substance to the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention concerning the length of the criminal proceedings in question (paragraph 38 in fine). The Court is further satisfied that respect for human rights as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto does not require it to continue its examination of this part of the application (Article 37 § 1 in fine). 55. Accordingly, the case should be struck out of the list in so far as it concerns the complaints referred to in paragraphs 28, 37 and 38 of this decision.” 21. In the same decision, the Court declared admissible the complaints concerning the applicant’s conditions of detention (Article 3) and the refusal to grant him leave to attend the Supreme Court hearing (Article 6), and dismissed all the other complaints, including the complaint that the criminal proceedings had been unfair owing to the admission of evidence obtained under duress (Article 6). On the latter point the Court found as follows: “39. Relying on Articles 6 §§ 1 and 2, 7 and 14 of the Convention, the applicant complained of the overall unfairness of his conviction for the armed robbery allegedly committed in April 1998. He maintained in that connection that a confession had been obtained from him under duress and that the courts had refused several requests made by him for a confrontation. Lastly, the applicant contended that he had been convicted solely on account of his ethnic and social origin and his previous convictions. ... 84. The Court, having regard to all the evidence in its possession and in so far as it has jurisdiction to examine the allegations made, finds no appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the provisions on which the applicant relies. In particular, it reiterates that it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention, which is not the case here (see, among many other authorities, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, § 34, ECHR 2000V). 85. It follows that these complaints are manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.” 22. On 1 December 2009 the Court adopted a judgment – Jeronovičs v. Latvia (no. 547/02) – finding a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (conditions of detention) and Article 6 § 1 (refusal to grant leave to attend the Supreme Court hearing) and awarding 5,000 euros [EUR] in compensation for the non-pecuniary damage suffered on account of the Article 3 violation. 23. On 11 October 2010 the applicant requested the public prosecutor’s office to reopen the criminal proceedings in which he had been convicted (see paragraph 13 above) as well as the proceedings concerning his alleged ill-treatment by police officers (see paragraph 16 above). He relied on the terms of the Government’s unilateral declaration of 30 April 2008 and on sections 655(3), 656(3) and 657 of the Criminal Procedure Law (see paragraphs 28 to 31 below). 24. On 17 November 2010 a prosecutor attached to the Riga Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s request, finding that none of the grounds for the reopening of criminal proceedings set out in section 655(2) of the Criminal Procedure Law applied. The prosecutor also found as follows: “...The case of Jeronovičs v. Latvia (no. 547/02) contains the Government’s unilateral declaration, the conclusions of which are applicable only to the circumstances and the events examined within the scope of that case. It cannot be concluded from the judgment of 1 December 2009 adopted by the European Court of Human Rights that the Court examined and assessed any activities carried out by the law-enforcement officers during the pre-trial investigation in the criminal proceedings ... Accordingly, the conclusions reached in [the Court’s] judgment of 1 December 2009 and the Government’s unilateral declaration of 30 April 2008 cannot be applied or connected to the criminal proceedings...” 25. In an appeal lodged on 9 December 2010 the applicant reiterated that there was a legal basis for reopening the criminal proceedings concerning his ill-treatment, on account of the fact that the Government’s unilateral declaration had expressly recognised the violation of Article 3 of the Convention, a circumstance which had led the Court to strike out that complaint. He further argued that at the time his criminal case was examined by the domestic courts, the judicial authorities had been unaware that the investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment was in breach of Article 3. 26. In a final decision of 20 December 2010 a higher-ranking prosecutor upheld the decision of 17 November 2010. The prosecutor noted that, under section 655(2) of the Criminal Procedure Law, only criminal proceedings that had ended with a valid court judgment or decision could be reopened, and only provided that the ground for requesting such reopening was among those listed in that provision. The prosecutor further found as follows: “Having examined the foregoing, I find that the conclusion of the prosecutor in her decision of 17 November 2010 is valid and well-founded, to the effect that your application dated 11 October 2010 requesting the reopening of the criminal proceedings in cases nos. 06725198 and 50207598 on the basis of new circumstances does not comply with any of the conditions prescribed by section 655(2) of the Criminal Procedure Law which could serve as grounds for reopening the above-mentioned criminal proceedings. The prosecutor did not establish the existence of any such conditions during the examination of your application, which is why I regard as reasonable her decision to refuse the reopening of the criminal proceedings in cases nos. 06725198 and 50207598 on the basis of newly disclosed circumstances. As already mentioned, the Criminal Procedure Law prescribes in detail all the circumstances which shall be recognised as newly disclosed and on the basis of which criminal proceedings ending in a valid court judgment or decision may be reopened. The Criminal Procedure Law does not make any provision for these circumstances to be expanded. In examining your complaint I did not find established any of the newly disclosed circumstances prescribed by section 655(2) of the Criminal Procedure Law. Likewise, I did not find any opinion by an international judicial authority relating to the decision of the Latvian court in case no. 50207598 and finding that the judgment of the Criminal Division of the Riga Regional Court which came into force on 27 September 2000 did not comply with international law and regulations binding on Latvia. The European Court of Human Rights did not express such an opinion in its judgment of 1 December 2009 or in the decision of 10 February 2009 in which that international court examined your application. I would also like to point out that, contrary to your allegations, the European Court of Human Rights in its decision of 10 February 2009 stated that in the adoption of its decision concerning inhuman treatment by police officers during the criminal investigation it did not find any violation of international laws or regulations. In your application you emphasised that the criminal proceedings in cases nos. 06725198 and 50207598 should be reopened in connection with the unilateral declaration of the Government of the Republic of Latvia mentioned by the Latvian Republic Government Agent on 30 April 2008, in which the Government of the Republic of Latvia recognised that the physical treatment of Viktors Jeronovičs by police officers, the effectiveness of the investigation into the applicant’s complaints, his access to legal aid and to effective remedies by which to apply for compensation for damage, the length of the criminal proceedings, and the lack of an effective remedy, did not meet the standards enshrined in Articles 3, 5 § 5, 6 § 1, 13 and 14 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. I would like to make clear that, according to section 655(2) of the Criminal Procedure Law, the above-mentioned unilateral declaration by the Government of the Republic of Latvia is not recognised as a newly disclosed circumstance and cannot therefore be regarded as a basis for reopening the criminal proceedings in cases nos. 06725198 and 50207598. In view of the above-mentioned considerations, there is no reason to quash the decision [...] dated 17 November 2010 concerning the refusal to reopen the criminal proceedings in the light of newly disclosed circumstances...”",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The first applicant currently lives in Turkey and the second to fifth applicants live in Stavanger, Norway. 6. The first applicant, a mechanics and a professional driver, is of Kurdish ethnic origin coming from south-east Turkey. He was not a member of any political party but like many other members of his family sympathised with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party). During the violent conflicts between Turkish authorities and Kurdish people in 1992 and 1993 he lived in the City of Sirnak. The first applicant stated that he had assisted the PKK and that because of several occurrences he felt persecuted by Turkish authorities. Fearing for his life he found it necessary to flee in March 1993. 7. The second applicant, Mrs Naime Kaplan, married the first applicant in the early 1990s. She and the third applicant, their son Azat (born in 1993), continued to live with the first applicant’s parents in Sirnak. After the latter’s house was set on fire, she and the son spent a period as refugees in Iraq. 8. Over a period of more than a year and a half, the first applicant sojourned at several locations in Turkey. He had some contact with his wife and son and applied for visa to visit Denmark, where his older brother had obtained asylum (in 1988). Only the first applicant obtained a visa. In February 1995 he arrived in Denmark and applied for asylum. His wife and son went back to Sirnak, where she gave birth to the couple’s second son, Cemsit, in August 1995 (the fourth applicant). 9. The first applicant’s asylum application in Denmark was refused. He then stayed in several European countries and returned to Denmark where his second asylum application was refused in September 1998. 10. On 23 October 1998 he applied for asylum in Norway. The Directorate of Immigration rejected the application on 30 September 1999. His appeal to the Ministry of Justice was rejected by a decision of 21 January 2000, according to which he was under a duty to leave the country and measures were to be taken to implement this decision. 11. On 7 December 1999 the Sunnhordaland District Court (tingrett) convicted the first applicant on charges of aggravated assault and sentenced him to 90 days’ imprisonment, of which 60 days were suspended. He was found guilty of having inflicted with a kitchen knife a cut in the shoulder of another man which had been mended with three stiches. Even though the extent of the injury was not considerable, the offence was deemed very serious and could easily have had great consequences for the victim. In mitigation, the District Court had regard to its finding that, whilst it was uncertain who had started the row, the victim had gone further than the applicant and had provoked him by hitting his face with his palm and by uttering serious insults against his family. The victim had also withdrawn his criminal complaint against the applicant. The judgment was transmitted to the Directorate of Immigration for consideration of whether there was a ground for ordering his expulsion. 12. On 5 May 2000 the Ministry of Justice refused to revise its earlier rejection (of 21 January 2000) of the first applicant’s asylum application and asked the Stavanger Police to implement the decision. It contained no mention of the judgment of 7 December 1999, but on 5 May 2000 the Ministry also forwarded a copy to the Directorate of Immigration requesting it to assess whether there was a basis for expulsion. The applicant did not leave the country, and the authorities took no specific measures to deport him until he received a warning to this effect issued on 31 October 2006. 13. In 2003 the applicant was fined for driving too fast, and in 2005 and 2006 for driving without a license. 14. The second applicant arrived in Norway with the couple’s two sons and applied for asylum on 24 May 2003, which the Directorate of Immigration rejected on 30 December 2003. The Immigration Appeals Board upheld the rejection on 25 February 2005, stating that unless they left the country voluntarily, the expulsion was to be forcibly implemented, if possible in coordination with that of the first applicant. 15. On 4 August 2005 a daughter of the couple, Rojin, was born (the fifth applicant). 16. Pending amendments to the Immigration Regulations, the Directorate of Immigration decided on 19 September 2006 to stay the implementation of the decision of 25 February 2005 regarding the wife and the sons but in a separate decision, referring inter alia to his conviction of 1999, rejected the first applicant’s request to stay the implementation of the refusal of 5 may 2000 to grant him asylum. 17. Following the warning of 31 October 2006, the first applicant was on 1 November 2006 arrested and detained for two weeks with a view to deportation. On 2 November 2006 the Directorate of Immigration decided, under section 29 of the Immigration Act 1988, to order his expulsion and to prohibit his re-entry in Norway for an indefinite duration. This was because of his criminal conviction and of his long illegal stay and work in Norway. On appeal, the decision was upheld by the Immigration Appeals Board on 2 March 2007. 18. In the meantime, on 1 November 2006, the first applicant requested the Oslo City Court (tingrett) to issue an order that he be granted a residence- and work permit and an interlocutory injunction to stay his deportation pending the outcome of the judicial proceedings. 19. Following a request by the first applicant to the Immigration Appeals Board, the latter granted him on 8 November 2006 a stay of implementation of his expulsion until the City Court had decided on his request for an interim measure to stay his deportation. 20. On 5 July 2007 the Immigration Appeals Board rejected a request to revise its earlier rejection (of 25 February 2005) as there were not sufficient reasons to grant the wife and the children a residence permit on humanitarian grounds. 21. In an appeal of 18 December 2007 the applicants’ lawyer challenged the lawfulness of the decision of 5 July 2007 on the ground that Rojin had been diagnosed as suffering from child autism and had special needs. 22. In the light of this information the parties agreed before the City Court that the immigration authorities should consider the matter anew for all the family members. 23. After having decided on 3 January 2008 not to implement the expulsion with respect to the wife and the children, the Immigration Appeals Board on 28 February 2008 decided (with two votes to one) to alter its decision of 5 July 2007 and granted the second applicant, with the children, a residence- and work-permit under section 8(2) of the Immigration Act 1988 (according to which such a permit could be granted if warranted by weighty humanitarian considerations or particular links to the country, see paragraph 49 below). The majority attached decisive weight to the new information concerning the daughter’s health together with the length of the children’s residence in Norway (four years and nine months in the case of the sons). It also had regard to more recent practice of the Board. The permit was granted for a period of one year and could on certain conditions be renewed, constitute a ground for settlement permit and for family reunification. A prerequisite for the permit was that the wife continued to live in Norway. 24. On 7 April 2008 the Immigration Appeals Board carried out a new assessment of the first applicant’s immigration status. It did not alter its decision of 2 March 2007 upholding the Directorate’s decision of 2 November 2006 to order his expulsion, stating inter alia the following reasons. 25. In the Board’s view, the Directorate could in principle have responded more rapidly with regard to the question of expulsion in connection with the applicant’s conviction. The Directorate had had an occasion to bring this matter up as early as in May 2000, when the Ministry of Justice by a letter of 5 May 2000 forwarded a copy of the judgment with a request for assessment of the question of expulsion (see paragraph 12 above). By the fact that counsel for the applicant was sent a copy of the Ministry’s letter, the applicant had been made aware that the offence could constitute a ground for expulsion. The specific procedural rules concerning expulsion of convicted foreign nationals indicated in principle that a decision to expel should be made as soon as possible after conviction with no further right of appeal or after the serving of a sentence had been commenced (section 126 of the Immigration Regulations of 1990). 26. There was nevertheless nothing to prevent that the offence be taken into account at a later date together with any other factors militating in favour of expulsion in a global assessment. In the Board’s view, it could not be decisive for the applicant’s expulsion from the country pursuant to section 29 (c) of the Immigration Act that his 1999 conviction had not been raised until 2006. In this connection, it referred to the fact that at the date of the Directorate’s expulsion decision the applicant had resided unlawfully in Norway for over six years and had in addition worked without a work permit for large parts of this period. In addition, since his conviction in 1999, he had on three occasions been fined for violation of the Road Traffic Act (on the latter two occasions for driving without a driving license, see paragraph 13 above). Whilst these offences were regarded individually and on principle as being relatively minor, they ought to be viewed in connection with the applicant’s previous conviction for bodily harm, in addition to his failure to respond to the order to leave the country as well as his prolonged unlawful residence and employment throughout several years. These offences, when considered as a whole, indicated a lack of respect for Norwegian law and for Norwegian authorities’ decisions. The Board further observed that intentional or negligent violations of the Immigration Act of 1988 of the nature involved in the instant case in principle constituted a criminal offence (section 47(1)(a) of the Immigration Act of 1988). It reiterated that the legislative bill to Parliament (Ot.prp.nr. 75 (2006-2007)) stated inter alia the following with regard to expulsion on the grounds of violations of the Immigration Act (page 289): “Although such violations [i.e. gross violations of the Immigration Act] normally also may lead to criminal liability, in terms of prosecution costs, it would be advantageous if an expulsion order could be made without requiring a legally enforceable criminal judgment.” 27. On the other hand, the Board altered its decision of 2 March 2007 prohibiting the first applicant to return to Norway indefinitely and limited the prohibition to five years. A decisive consideration for this change was that his spouse and children had been granted a residence permit. The Board observed that as a starting point the first applicant’s expulsion would mean that the family would be split. However, the right of the other family members to reside in Norway did not imply any corresponding duty to do so. The whole family originated from Turkey, where the older children had been born and lived during their childhood. Their family life could in principle be secured either by the whole family moving to Turkey or through the visits of the wife and children of the husband in Turkey. His expulsion was of limited duration and at the expiry of the period it would be possible to apply for a residence permit on family reunification ground. Whether such a permit would be granted would depend on future circumstances. However, an expulsion for five years did not imply a permanent splitting of the family. 28. The Board had particular regard to the daughter’s situation, which was followed up and was to be the subject of measures in Norway, and to the scarcity and low quality of public assistance in Turkey to children suffering from handicaps and other types of illnesses affecting their functional capacities, where assistance to children suffering from autism and their parents was provided primarily by private institutions. Bearing in mind especially the daughter’s interests, the Board had understanding for the fact that the family as a whole did not prefer to return to Turkey. 29. In the light of the above, the City Court discontinued, by decisions of 23 April and 20 November 2008, the proceedings in so far as the spouse and the children were concerned. As regards the first applicant, the City Court found for the Immigration Appeals Board and rejected his request for an interlocutory injunction to stay his deportation, by a judgment and a decision of 23 April 2009. 30. On 10 July 2009 the Borgarting High Court (lagmannsrett) rejected the first applicant’s appeal against the City Court’s decision not to grant an interlocutory injunction, as did the Supreme Court on 1 September 2009. 31. On the other hand, the High Court, by a judgment of 1 March 2010, quashed the Immigration Appeals Board’s decision of 7 April 2008 as being unlawful. 32. The High Court had no doubt, nor was it disputed, that the objective conditions set out in section 29(1)(a) and (c) of the 1988 Immigration Act for ordering the first applicant’s deportation had been fulfilled; the only question was whether the measure would be proportionate as required by section 29(2). In this regard, the High Court observed that his conviction in 1999 for having caused physical injury to a third party with a knife was serious, even though there had been mitigating circumstances and the sentence (90 days of which 60 were suspended) had been relatively short. General considerations of crime prevention suggested that one ought to react to violence of this character. 33. However, the expulsion of a convicted person ought to be effected as soon as possible after the criminal judgment had become enforceable. The fact that more than six years had elapsed before concrete measures had been taken to expel him, which could hardly be due to anything else than a lack of coordination on the part of the immigration authorities, weakened the significance of the judgment. 34. On the other hand, the fact that the first applicant for a number of years had stayed and worked unlawfully in Norway was very serious and was not altered by the authorities’ passiveness. The Board had not incorrectly assessed his attachment to Norway and lack of legitimate expectations of being able to stay there. The fact that his spouse and children had been granted a residence permit would not hinder his expulsion, as this would not in the circumstances be a disproportionate measure vis-à-vis him. Another question was whether his four and half year daughter Rojin with her special care needs ought to be viewed as such extraordinary circumstances as could warrant his being able to stay in Norway. 35. On the evidence the High Court found that Rojin’s chronic and very serious degree of child autism and need for follow-up would affect the other family members strongly in the years to come and entail a burden on them far beyond the normal level. Her functional incapacity meant that she would always be dependent on her parents’ resources. Her mother was exhausted and had a marginal level of functioning. It was the father who had activated Rojin on a daily basis and she was particularly attached to him. Should he be deported it was likely that the disturbance to her development would be aggravated and would cause a further burden to the mother, to the brothers and to others who assumed responsibilities for her. 36. The High Court concluded that the first applicant’s expulsion would expose Rojin to an extraordinary burden that would not be justified by general considerations of crime prevention or immigration policy and would constitute a disproportionate measure. In this context the High Court had regard to the importance of the fact that the residence permit to the mother and the children had so far been limited to one year at a time. 37. The High Court upheld the City Court’s findings that the first applicant had not made it sufficiently probable that he upon return to Turkey would risk such persecution as could justify granting him a refugee status or would otherwise face a real danger of loss of life or exposure to inhuman treatment. 38. Finally, the High Court dismissed the claim for a residence- and work permit from the courts. 39. The State appealed to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett) challenging the High Court’s proportionality assessment under section 29(2) of the 1988 Immigration Act. 40. In its judgment of 26 November 2010 (Norsk Retstidende) (Norwegian Supreme Court Law Reports – “Rt.” p. 1430) the Supreme Court observed inter alia that considerable time had elapsed from the rejection of his asylum application in 2000 until the expulsion decision of 2006 and further to the present review of the case by the Supreme Court. Throughout this time, the first applicant had resided in Norway unlawfully, of which he had also been aware. The time factor could thus not be given particular weight in the assessment. Whilst his residence had naturally resulted in strengthening his attachment to Norway, it had equally aggravated his violations of the Immigration Act. This point of view was particularly valid in a case such as the present one, where the applicant had been aware throughout that he was required to leave the country. 41. Nor had the first applicant had any legitimate expectation of being allowed to remain in the country. Also, his criminal conviction meant that an instruction of 31 August 2006 issued by the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion to put certain cases in abeyance, notably cases concerning applications for asylum or residence, involving or relating to children, made by persons who had resided in Norway for more than three years, did not apply to the first applicant. 42. The Supreme Court found it established that the first applicant had committed serious violations of the Immigration Act 1988 which of their own clearly constituted a sufficient ground for expulsion. An additional ground were the offences he had committed under Article 229, cf. Article 232, of the Penal Code and, albeit of lesser importance, under the Road Traffic Act. The Immigration Appeals Board had in its decision of 7 April 2008 pointed out that immigration policy considerations then ought to militate strongly in favour of upholding the expulsion order. Also the background – his unlawful stays in other European countries with unsuccessful asylum applications, including once under a false name – was a factor that to some extent went in the same direction. 43. The Supreme Court further observed that the first applicant lacked a legal basis for residing in Norway and therefore ought to leave the country in any event. What the likely outcome could be of an application for residence permit in the current situation could not enter into the consideration of the case. The disputed decision entailed the consequence for him that he would be expelled from the country for a period of five years and he could not apply for a residence- or work permit during this period. Norway’s participation in the Schengen cooperation meant as a rule that an expulsion from Norway also implied a prohibition to enter the entire Schengen Area. In the case of a foreigner, whose unlawful residence had been so extensive and so long and who had been convicted of violence, it could not be said that an expulsion in such circumstances would constitute an extraordinary burden. 44. The interests pertaining to his wife and his two eldest children could hardly speak in favour of making a different assessment than that which applied to the first applicant. They had for many years lived on their own in Turkey. That the first applicant in the event of an expulsion could not come for visit for a period of five years was a normal consequence of expulsion and did not constitute an extraordinary burden. The family life could be maintained by his wife and children travelling to Turkey for shorter or longer periods. 45. The Supreme Court also noted that, whilst the High Court had relied on the consideration that Rojin was suffering from a chronic and serious degree of child autism, the first applicant had submitted a medical statement of 27 October 2010 from which it appeared that her current diagnosis was “unspecified far-reaching developmental disturbance”. The expulsion applied for a period of five years during which the first applicant would not have the opportunity to help his daughter upon visits in the country. As already mentioned, the family contact would instead be maintained through visits in Turkey. Nor in this respect could there be a question of any extraordinary burden. 46. The Supreme Court, having regard the Court’s case-law, notably Darren Omoregie and Others v. Norway (no. 265/07, §§ 57 and 66, 31 July 2008) and the criteria of “exceptional circumstances” and “insurmountable obstacles” relied on there, concluded that the first applicant’s expulsion would not give rise to a violation of Article 8. His expulsion would not constitute a disproportionate measure vis-à-vis the other family members. 47. On 16 July 2011 the first applicant was expelled to Turkey. 48. The second to fifth applicants were granted Norwegian citizenship on 24 January 2012.",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

A two-roomed flat at 29-1-26 Ozernaya Ulitsa, Moscow, was owned by the city. G. and her son resided there as tenants under the social housing agreement with the city. 7. On 16 November 2002 G. died. On 17 September 2003 the municipal authorities de-registered her tenancy. 8. On 3 October 2003 G.’s son died. On an unspecified date the municipal authorities de-registered his tenancy. 9. On an unspecified date A. submitted a forged copy of a court judgment to the Department of the Municipal Housing and Housing Policy (the “Housing Department”) recognising her right to reside in the flat and on 9 February 2005 the Housing Department entered into a social housing lease agreement with A. and her family. 10. On 25 February 2005 the Housing Department transferred the title to the flat to A., her husband and her daughter under the privatisation scheme. 11. On 15 December 2005 A. and her husband sold the flat to the applicant. On 29 December 2005 the city registration body issued a certificate confirming the first applicant’s title to the flat. The applicants moved into the flat and resided there. 12. On an unspecified date the Housing Department obtained information that the court judgment submitted by A. might have been forged and on 15 December 2005 the housing authorities asked the prosecutor’s office to conduct a relevant inquiry. 13. On 20 March 2008 the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow invalidated the social housing lease agreement of 9 February 2005 and the privatisation agreement of 25 February 2005. 14. On an unspecified date the Housing Department brought an action against the applicants seeking the transfer of the flat to the city and the applicants’ eviction. 15. On 9 October 2009 the District Court granted the Housing Department’s claims in full. The court ruled that the case fell under one of the two exceptions to the protection of a bona fide purchaser’s title, which required that precedence be given to the previous owner who had been deprived of the property against his or her will. The first applicant’s title to the flat was annulled and the title was transferred to the City of Moscow. The court also ordered the applicants’ eviction. The applicants appealed. 16. On 25 February 2010 the City Court upheld the judgment of 9 October 2009 on appeal. 17. On an unspecified date the bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings. 18. On 12 March 2012 the District Court granted the applicant’s additional time to comply with the judgment of 9 October 2009. The applicants were required to vacate the flat by 1 August 2012. On 14 May 2012 the City Court upheld the said decision on appeal. 19. The applicants continued to reside in the flat. On 14 August 2013 the Housing Department entered into a housing agreement with them in respect of the flat for a term of five years.",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

The first applicant was born in 1948, the second applicant was born in 1976, the third applicant was born in 1980 and they all live in Slatina. The fourth applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Osijek, and the fifth applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Josipovac. 6. The first applicant is the husband, the second and third applicants are children, and the fourth and fifth applicants are sisters of the late M.B.B., a lawyer who was based in Slatina. 7. M.B.B. represented M.N. in divorce proceedings instituted in December 2001 in the Slatina Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Slatini) against her husband, A.N. 8. A first hearing in those proceedings was held on 12 February 2002, attended by the parties and the lawyer M.B.B. The court heard the parties’ arguments and decided to request a report from the local social services. It then adjourned the hearing until 9 April 2002. 9. According to A.N.’s police records, he had a history of alcohol abuse, violent behaviour and unlawful possession of firearms. In May 1993 the Slatina Police (Policijska Postaja Slatina – hereinafter “the police”) instituted minor offences proceedings against him for beating up his daughter and wife under the influence of alcohol and making serious threats using firearms. On that occasion, the police seized from A.N. a rifle with a dozen bullets and a hand grenade. There is, however, no further information on the outcome of these proceedings. Furthermore, between 2000 and 2002 A.N. was reported three times for family violence and twice for a breach of the peace and public order, and in May 2001 the police lodged a criminal complaint against him with the State Attorney’s Office for making serious death threats to his wife. 10. On 16 October 2000 the Slatina Minor Offences Court (Prekršajni sud u Slatini) found A.N. guilty of the minor offence of family violence and fined him 500 Croatian kunas (HRK). During the proceedings, M.N. explained that the divorce proceedings were pending before the courts and that A.N. had contested them. She also explained that she had ended up in hospital after having been severely beaten by A.N. 11. On 25 July 2001 the Slatina Municipal Court found A.N. guilty of the criminal offence of making serious death threats to his wife and sentenced him to two months’ imprisonment, suspended for one year. 12. According to a police report drawn up on 25 March 2002, M.N., accompanied by A.N., attended the police station on 21 March 2002, alleging that her husband had been harassing her. She made no other complaints of possible threats or violence. She further explained that A.N. had previously beaten her up and had been convicted in the minor offences and criminal courts. She also pointed out that their divorce proceedings were pending and that a hearing was scheduled for 9 April 2002. On the same occasion, A.N. argued that he did not want his wife to see other men. The police officer who interviewed the couple, Ž.J., warned A.N. to stop harassing his wife and instructed them to settle all their disputes in the divorce proceedings. The report also contains a note suggesting that during the interview, A.N. and M.N. showed no signs of aggression, alcohol abuse or agitation. 13. Afterwards, police officer Ž.J. informed his superior officer, M.Kr., of the interview. He was told to make a short note of the event in the logbook and that it was not necessary to draft a report or take any further action. 14. According to further police reports, at around 7 a.m. the following day, A.N. went to a bank in Slatina with the intention of withdrawing all his money. He told a bank employee, D.K., whom he had met before, that they would not see each other again. While speaking to the bank employee, A.N. was in tears. When she asked him what was troubling him, he said that “it will be talked about”. He also shook hands with several other people who then told the bank manager, F.S., to contact the police. F.S. followed A.N. out of the bank and asked him what was troubling him. A.N. responded that he was sick of everything; his wife, who was having affairs with other men, and his son, who was a drug addict, and that he was going to do something and nobody could stop him. 15. At 7.15 a.m. F.S. informed the police of the event, saying that he was afraid that A.N. could do something to himself or others. 16. At 7.17 a.m. an on-duty commanding officer, T.S., sent a patrol of two police officers, M.L. and I.B., to the bank. At the same time he checked A.N.’s police records and saw that he had a violent background. He therefore informed the police chief, M.Ko., who ordered a police patrol to be sent to A.N.’s home address. At 7.38 a.m. M.L. and I.B. were sent to look for him there. 17. The report submitted by police officers M.L. and I.B. indicates that they found A.N. at home. He approached them at the front of his house and said that he was sick of everything, and that he had withdrawn the money for his funeral because he was going to kill himself either that day or the next by jumping under a train, and that there was nothing they could do about it. He also said that he had already written a suicide note, and complained that the day before he had been at the police station because his wife had been seeing another man. The police officers noted in their report that A.N. had appeared sober and had not shown any signs of aggressiveness, and had not mentioned his wife or anybody else or that he might hurt anybody. They therefore advised him that everything was going to be fine and left. 18. Upon their arrival at the police station at 8.06 a.m. the police officers reported on the interview to the on-duty commanding officer M.T., who had taken over from T.S. (see paragraph 16 above) in the meantime. 19. According to a report drawn up by M.T. on 22 March 2002, M.L. and I.B, the police officers who had visited A.N. at his home (see paragraph 17 above), had reported to him that A.N. was contemplating suicide because of his family problems, and that he had mentioned his divorce and said that nobody could stop him. At 8.12 a.m. M.T. informed the deputy police chief for the criminal police, M.B., of the event who instructed him to immediately inform the Slatina Health Centre (Dom zdravlja Slatina – hereinafter “the hospital”) and Slatina Social Care Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb Slatina). He informed the hospital doctor, I.F., at 8.15 a.m. and the Social Care Centre at 8.18 a.m. The doctor had said that he would see with a nearby psychiatric hospital whether they could admit A.N. for treatment, while an official from the Social Care Centre had said that she had known A.N.’s situation very well and told the police to contact the hospital. 20. Later during the investigation the police found that officer M.T. had falsified his report, as he had actually informed doctor I.F. at 9.40 a.m., not 8.15 a.m. as indicated, and had informed the Social Care Centre at 9.37 a.m., not 8.18 a.m. as indicated (see paragraph 19 above and paragraphs 35 and 46 below). 21. Meanwhile, sometime after 8.00 a.m., A.N. returned to the bank, shouting at F.S. for having called the police. He then went to a nearby bar for a drink and at around 9.00 a.m. went to the police station. He met the on-duty commanding officer M.T. there, and demanded to know why the police had been to see him. M.T. explained that the police had had information that he had been having some problems. A.N. replied that he was going to solve his problems himself and that he was going to do what he intended. He then left the police station. 22. A.N. then went in search of his wife, who started work in a bakery shop at 10 a.m. He waited for her in a nearby street he knew she had to pass when going to work. When A.N. saw her, he approached her and kicked her in the head, knocking her to the ground. He then fired one shot at her and went to leave, but then returned to shoot her a further three times. She survived, despite receiving serious injuries to her head, stomach and arm. 23. After shooting his wife, A.N. went to M.B.B.’s office, which was only some three hundred metres away. M.B.B. was in the office at the time with her secretary and a client, A.R. Immediately upon entering the office A.N. fired a shot in M.B.B.’s direction, but hit her desk. The client attempted to talk him round, but when A.N. threatened to kill him, he ran away. A.N. then attempted to shoot the secretary, who was calling the police, but his pistol jammed and she managed to escape. A.N. then approached M.B.B. and shot her dead by firing three bullets at her, of which two were fatal. 24. In the meantime, some onlookers had informed the police of the incidents and several police units were sent to search for the gunman. 25. At around 10.35 a.m. the police arrived at A.N.’s house and ordered him to surrender and go with them to the station in connection with the investigation into the shootings. He refused, before throwing two hand grenades at the police officers and starting to shoot at them. 26. When special police units stormed into A.N.’s house at around 3.26 p.m., they found him with a self-inflicted head wound, the type of weapon that had been used for the shootings, and a suicide note. He was immediately taken to hospital, but died the next day. 27. On the same day as the incidents occurred, an investigating judge of the Bjelovar County Court (Županijski sud u Bjelovaru) and a Deputy County State Attorney conducted crime scene investigations with the assistance of police forensic scientists. In A.N.’s house the police found another suicide note, a number of different bullets and an empty hand grenade cartridge. They also discovered that the weapon used by A.N. had been reported missing and that its owner had died in 1997. 28. The investigating judge ordered a forensic examination of the bodies which confirmed that M.B.B. had suffered a violent death as a result of the gunshots. 29. During the investigation the police interviewed a number of people who provided information concerning A.N. and the course of the events in which he had killed M.B.B. and attempted to kill his wife. The police drew up reports of the interviews but they were not signed or otherwise attested by the witnesses. 30. According to the police reports, A.N. and M.N.’s children, E.N. and M.B., provided information about the problems in their family and the frequent violent incidents mainly caused as a result of A.N.’s alcohol abuse. The incidents were confirmed by M.N. in her interview with the police. She also stated that he had been angry at her lawyer M.B.B., but had not threatened to kill her. 31. M.B.B.’s secretary described the course of events in which A.N. had attempted to shoot her and killed the lawyer M.B.B., which was also confirmed by the client A.R. who had been in the office at the time (see paragraph 23 above). Another witness, N.M., a waiter in a nearby bar, described how he had heard gunshots and later found M.B.B. dead in her office. 32. The police also interviewed the bank employees D.K. and F.S., who provided information about A.N.’s behaviour in the bank (see paragraph 14 above), and two other witnesses, I.T. and A.K., who had also been in the bank when A.N. was there. The two bank customers stated that A.N. had seemed disturbed and looked as though he had needed some help, but had not said he was going to kill anybody. 33. An acquaintance of A.N., Ž.M., told police that for the past year A.N. had been saying that he was going to kill his wife. After the incidents at issue, A.N. called him and said that he killed his wife and shot her lawyer. Information to that effect was also provided by another acquaintance of A.N., I.Š., who said that when he got drunk A.N. would say that he was going to kill somebody but without specifying whom. On the morning in question he had seen A.N., who had shown him a handful of bullets. 34. A.N.’s brother-in-law, L.Z., stated that A.N. had complained that during a hearing in the divorce proceedings M.B.B. had prevented him from raising all his arguments before the court, and that he should do something about it but without specifying what. He had never mentioned that he was going to kill anybody. His other brother-in-law, F.Z., stated that a couple of days before the incidents his wife Ž.Z. had told him that she had seen A.N., who had told her that he was going to kill his wife and her lawyer, but she had not thought that he had really meant it. This was confirmed by Ž.Z. herself in her statement to the police. 35. During the investigation the police interviewed doctor I.F. who had taken the police’s call to the hospital on the morning of the incidents (see paragraph 19 above). He stated that he had received the call at around 9.40 a.m., not 8.20 a.m. as reported in the media. He also provided evidence to that effect because his telephone had the ability to record times and dates of calls. Based on the information he had received, he had attempted to contact a nearby psychiatric hospital to arrange for A.N.’s possible hospitalisation. However, he had not managed to speak to any of the doctors, as he had been told by a nurse that they had all been in a meeting which she had not been allowed to interrupt. 36. The results of the investigation were submitted to the Slatina Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državni odvjetništvo u Slatini) to assess whether the police could be held liable for their actions in connection with the incidents at issue, particularly with regard to the application of section 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act. That provision stated that an individual could be admitted to a psychiatric institution where there was a reasonable suspicion that the individual posed an immediate threat to his life or health, or the life or health of others (see paragraph 81 below). 37. On 16 August 2002 the Slatina Municipal State Attorney’s Office issued the following statement: “A.N. was a violent person against whom a criminal complaint had been made for making serious death threats to his wife and on several occasions was reported for the minor offences of family violence, abusive behaviour and inappropriately addressing police officers. On the day in question A.N., without any further elaboration, told police officers that he was going to kill himself because of his family problems. The police officer on duty, M.T., omitted to inform the hospital and Social Care Centre of the whole situation. Had there been coordination between the doctor and social worker, who had known the situation in A.N.’s family better, measures for the prevention of suicide could perhaps have been taken. In the circumstances, at the relevant time the police officers had no reason to treat A.N. as a mentally disturbed person within the meaning of section 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act. ...” 38. On 22 March 2005 the applicants, through their lawyer, lodged a criminal complaint against police officer M.T. with the Slatina Municipal State Attorney’s Office, alleging that he had falsified the police records indicating the exact time he had contacted the hospital and Social Care Centre (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). They also lodged a criminal complaint against police chief M.Ko. for abuse of power and authority, because he had failed to institute criminal proceedings against police officer M.T. 39. On 30 May 2005 the Slatina Municipal State Attorney’s Office rejected the criminal complaints against the police officers on the grounds that their actions did not constitute criminal offences. 40. On 10 June 2005 all five applicants and K.B., the mother of M.B.B., took over the prosecution as subsidiary prosecutors and lodged an indictment against the police officers in the Slatina Municipal Court. 41. During the proceedings police officer M.T. stated that after officers M.L. and I.B. had returned from their interview with A.N. (see paragraph 19 above), they had told him that A.N. had been agitated and had mentioned problems in his family, but had not made any threats. Sometime at around 8 a.m. he had therefore attempted to contact police chief M.Ko. to seek further instructions. After having failed twice to reach M.Ko., who had been out of his office, he had called the deputy police chief for the criminal police, M.B., who had instructed him to contact the hospital and Social Care Centre. He had then telephoned the hospital, but the number he had dialled had not been valid, so he had only managed to get the right number later when he had spoken to doctor I.F. When he had called the hospital for the first time he had written down the exact time on a piece of paper and then later had just taken that time for his report. 42. Doctor I.F. also gave his oral evidence during the proceedings. He testified that after he had received the information from the police about their interview with A.N., he had told the police that he would need to examine A.N. and then decide whether compulsory psychiatric treatment would be necessary. However, the police had not known where A.N. was at the time, so he had told them to find him. Approximately fifteen minutes later the hospital had received information about the shootings. 43. On 3 May 2006 the Slatina Municipal Court acquitted police officer M.T. on the grounds that there had been no evidence that he had deliberately falsified his report. The court also dismissed the charges against police chief M.Ko. on the grounds that the prosecution had become time-barred. 44. The judgment was confirmed on appeal by the Virovitica County Court (Županijski sud u Virovitici) on 21 September 2006. 45. On 18 April 2002 the Ministry of the Interior opened disciplinary proceedings against police officer M.Kr. for failing to report on the interview with A.N. and his wife on 21 March 2002 even though A.N.’s background and the information concerning their relationship warranted that such action be documented (see paragraphs 12 and 13 above). 46. On 27 May 2002 disciplinary proceedings were also opened against police officer M.T. for failing to immediately report the situation concerning A.N. on the morning of 22 March 2002 to the hospital as he had been instructed to do by his superior, and for falsifying his report about the times he had contacted the hospital and Social Care Centre (see paragraphs 19 and 20 above). 47. The first-instance Osijek Disciplinary Panel of the Ministry of the Interior (Prvostupanjski disciplinski sud u Osijeku) found police officer M.Kr. guilty on 10 October 2002 and sentenced him to a 15% reduction of salary, to be applied for one month. 48. On 5 November 2002 the disciplinary panel found police officer M.T. guilty and sentenced him to a 10% reduction of salary, to be applied for two months. 49. On 22 March 2005 the five applicants and K.B. lodged a civil action against the State in the Slatina Municipal Court, seeking damages for the authorities’ failure to protect their relative’s right to life. They relied on section 13 of the State Administration Act, which provides that the State is liable to compensate damage caused to a citizen, legal entity or other party for the unlawful or wrongful conduct of a State authority (see paragraph 83 below). 50. A first hearing was held on 6 July 2005, at which the trial court heard evidence from bank employees F.S. and M.S. 51. F.S. testified that after he had seen A.N. crying, he had asked him what had happened and A.N. replied that it would be talked about. He had then called the police, who arrived soon after. When he had told them what had happened, the police had just replied that they had known A.N. very well. A.N. had appeared totally unstable that morning, which had been noticeable to F.S. because he worked with people. Everybody in the bank had noticed that A.N. had been totally crazy, and F.S. had therefore called the police because he had thought that A.N. was a danger, primarily to himself, and should get medical treatment. When A.N. had entered the bank for the second time he had not calmed down and had been yelling at F.S. for calling the police about him. This version of events was confirmed by M.S. 52. At a hearing on 14 September 2005 the trial court heard evidence from doctor I.F. He testified that on the morning of 22 March 2002 at around 9.45 a.m. he had been informed by the police that A.N. had been behaving strangely and that he might do something bad. The police officer had not however known where A.N. was at the time. Doctor I.F. explained that the usual practice in such cases was to examine the person and then decide whether admission to hospital was necessary. He also specified that the police officer who had called him had said that A.N. could kill somebody or do something bad. This had prompted him to believe that his and the police’s intervention had been necessary, and that A.N. should be taken to the psychiatric hospital. Had the police managed to trace A.N., he would have examined him, because that had been the practice in similar cases and also in cases where somebody had threatened suicide. 53. At the same hearing the trial court questioned police chief M.Ko., who explained that A.N. was known to him because he had once been held at the station for violent behaviour. On the day in question he had given orders to the on-duty commanding officer to send a police patrol to A.N.’s home address and had then left the police station to attend to some other business. He had returned to the police station at around 9.55 a.m. and had been told of the shootings. 54. The next hearing was held on 23 November 2005, where the trial court heard evidence from M.N. She stated that A.N. had previously had a rifle, a handgun and a bomb which had been, at some point, confiscated from him by the police. He would also say that he was saving money to buy a handgun to kill her and two other people, but she had never known exactly whom. A.N. had had a problem with alcohol and when he would get drunk he would be violent. She had called the police on more than a hundred occasions, but sometimes they would come and sometimes they would not. A.N. had contested the divorce and the day before the incidents had threatened to kill her. She had reported that on the same day to the police, but they had done nothing about it. At the same hearing the trial court questioned bank employee D.F., who explained the course of the events in the bank (see paragraph 14 above). 55. A further hearing was held on 18 January 2006, at which the police officers M.L., M.T. and I.B. gave evidence. 56. M.L. testified that on the morning of the incident, he and police officer I.B. had been ordered to go to the bank because A.N. had been there and had been behaving strangely. In the bank, they had met someone who had called the police, who explained that A.N. had gone to the bank, had withdrawn all his money and while in tears had said “it will be talked about”. When M.L. and I.B. had reported on their findings to the on-duty commanding officer, they had been instructed to find A.N. at his home address. They had found him there and interviewed him. A.N. had not been drunk or aggressive. He had said that he was going to kill himself because of problems with his wife and son and that he would do it either that day or the next, and that nobody could stop him. He had appeared normal and calm. They had not searched him because there had been no grounds to take such action, nor had there been any reason to take him to hospital in accordance with the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act. M.L. also explained A.N. was known to him and that before seeing him, he had been informed by the on-duty commanding officer that he had already threatened to kill his wife. 57. In his statement I.B. confirmed M.L.’s version of events, explaining that the police could take an individual to hospital or a police station and have a doctor examine him, but they had not considered A.N. to be a danger so had not taken any such action. 58. Police officer M.T. stated that when officers M.L. and I.B. had returned from the bank they had said that A.N. had not been drunk or aggressive but merely agitated, and that he had threatened suicide. M.T. had then attempted to contact his superiors and had managed to get in touch with the deputy chief for the criminal police M.B., who had instructed him to inform the hospital and Social Care Centre. He had attempted to contact the hospital several times and at some point had managed to reach doctor I.F, who had said that he would try to find a place for A.N. in a psychiatric hospital. He had also asked where A.N. was, but at the time M.T. had not known. M.T. further explained that he had been familiar with the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act, which enabled the police to take a mentally disturbed individual to a psychiatric hospital, but he had considered the police to have done everything they could, although with hindsight, it would have been possible to do more, but the police could not have predicted what would happen. He had known that A.N. had a violent background but stressed that he had not been registered as insane. 59. At a hearing on 15 March 2006 the deputy chief for the criminal police M.B. gave his oral evidence. He explained that he had been informed that A.N. had gone to the bank where he had been behaving strangely. Later, he had been informed that the police had interviewed him and that he had appeared calm and normal but had threatened suicide. At around 8.05 to 8.10 a.m. M.B. had instructed the on-duty commanding officer, M.T., to inform the hospital and Social Care Centre. He considered the police to have done everything they could, but there had been no grounds to take any further measures given the findings of the police patrol that had interviewed A.N. at his home. He also explained that the usual practice in similar cases was to inform the hospital, who could call the police if they needed assistance. 60. A further hearing was held on 10 May 2006 at which police officers Ž.J. and T.S. and a customer from the bank, I.T., gave evidence. 61. Ž.J. stated that the day before the incidents M.N. had arrived at the police station followed by her husband A.N. Police officer Ž.J. had interviewed them but had found no grounds for the police to take further action, so he had told them to resolve their marital problems in their court proceedings. M.N. had also mentioned that after A.N. had been handed a suspended sentence, he had stopped making threats and beating her up. Ž.J. had not reported on the interview because his superior officer M.Kr. had not requested it. 62. Police officer T.S. had no specific knowledge about the incident. He had been off-duty at the time although he had, early in the morning, just before leaving the police station, sent a police patrol to the bank to check what had happened there and why A.N. had been behaving strangely. 63. The bank customer I.T. testified that he had seen A.N. in the bank on the morning in question, who had told him that he had been having some problems and that it would be talked about. He had been behaving strangely, as he had been walking around the bank in circles. He had looked nervous, and I.T. had thought that he had been ill and in need of medical attention. 64. On 15 September 2006 the trial court obtained a psychiatric report certifying that the first, second and third applicant and M.B.B.’s mother had all experienced mental suffering after the events. The report was confirmed by the expert at a hearing held on 21 February 2007. 65. On 5 March 2007 the Slatina Municipal Court allowed the civil action and ordered the State to pay damages for failing to protect the life of the applicants’ relative. The trial court held that the State’s responsibility under section 13 of the State Administration Act was objective, and that it was only necessary to establish whether the death had been a result of the unlawful or wrongful conduct of the State authorities. The relevant part of the judgment reads: “... It is not disputed between the parties that F.S. called the police a little after 7 a.m. F.S. informed the police of what had happened in the bank and about A.N.’s appearance. This court fully accepts the statements of F.S., M.S., D.F. and I.T. as credible when they testified about A.N.’s state of mind [in the bank]. They stated that A.N. had appeared totally unstable. The conclusion of the police officers M.L. and I.B. that A.N. had been normal and calm and had not been a danger cannot be accepted as logical. They reached such a conclusion after being informed by A.N. that he had withdrawn the money for [his] funeral, and that he was going to kill himself and nobody could stop him. Taking this into account, [this court considers that] the average person could have reached the conclusion about A.N.’s state of mind referred to by witnesses [F.]S., M.S., D.F. and I.T. The police officers who needed to act with particular diligence should have also reached [this] conclusion about A.N.’s state of mind, which they failed to do. They thus failed to act in accordance with sections 22 (1), 23§(1) and 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act ... The defendant considers that there is no connection between the failures of the police and [M.B.B.’s death] and that there is therefore no liability on the Republic of Croatia. This court considers differently. Had police officer M.T. complied with the order of the deputy chief for the criminal police M.B., and informed the hospital and Social Care Centre at 8.15 a.m., as noted in the report, it is highly probable that the outcome would have been avoided, particularly taking into account the statement of witness I.F ... As the liability of the State is objective; it was for it to prove that the damage occurred as a result of a cause which could not have been avoided (vis major), or that the damage resulted exclusively from the actions of the aggrieved party or a third party which could not have been predicted and where the outcome could not have been avoided (section 177(1) and (2) of the Civil Obligations Act). Nothing of [the sort] has been proven by the defendant. ...” 66. The Slatina Municipal State Attorney’s Office, representing the State in the proceedings, lodged an appeal with the Virovitica County Court on 26 April 2007. 67. On 19 November 2007 the Virovitica County Court quashed the first-instance judgment and ordered a retrial on the grounds that the first-instance court had erred in its findings that the liability of the State was objective as it was based on the existence of a fault, namely unlawfulness. That court further found that, irrespective of the fact that A.N. had threatened suicide, there had been nothing requiring police officers M.L. and I.B. to treat the case as particularly urgent and to take A.N. to a psychiatric hospital. It also accepted the police officers’ statements that A.N. had appeared calm during the interview. The Virovitica County Court instructed the first-instance court to question witnesses I.F. and M.T. again to establish what actions doctor I.F. had intended to take, since it was not clear whether he had intended to examine A.N. or just to see whether he could be placed in a psychiatric hospital, as could be inferred from the statement of police officer M.T. 68. In the resumed proceedings, at a hearing held on 27 February 2008, the Slatina Municipal Court heard doctor I.F. and police officer M.T. 69. Doctor I.F. testified that the usual practice in similar cases was to immediately respond at the scene and to examine the person if he or she was available. The medical response team consisted of a doctor, a driver and medical technician and a nurse. They first had to examine the person and then the doctor could decide whether hospitalisation in a psychiatric hospital was necessary. Police intervention was only sought if the person could not be apprehended for the examination. As regards the case at issue, doctor I.F. explained that he had been called by a police officer who had told him that A.N. had been behaving strangely and that he could do something bad. The police officer had not known where A.N. was. Had he known, he would have immediately responded at the scene and examined him. Doctor I.F. also explained that he had to first examine the person and only then he could make a prescription for that person’s admission to hospital. There had been no reason for him to check whether there had been a place in the hospital because it was for the hospital to decide what they wanted to do with his prescription and the person in question. In the present case, the information he had received from the police suggested that it had been necessary to examine A.N. at the scene. 70. Police officer M.T. stated that on the day in question he had informed doctor I.F. that the police had had a person who was seriously disturbed and who should be given an injection in order to calm down. As to his further conversations with the doctor, M.T. stated: “I cannot remember any more what doctor [I.]F. told me when I contacted him. I don’t remember exactly, but I think he told me that he would see whether [A.N] could be placed in the psychiatric hospital and then would ask for police intervention if he needed it. ... I would like to change my statement in the part where I said that doctor [I.]F. was going to first find a place in [the psychiatric hospital] and that he would then consult the police chief. Doctor F. actually told me that he would first examine [A.]N. and that he would call the police if necessary. ... In reply to the question from the defendant’s representative, I cannot explain why I changed my statement as regards what doctor [I.]F. had told me.” 71. On 7 March 2008 the Slatina Municipal Court obtained a police report describing the course of events later on the day of the shooting, and on 9 April 2008 concluded the trial. 72. On 22 April 2008 the Slatina Municipal Court dismissed the civil action as ill-founded, and ordered the applicants to pay HRK 80,700 in costs and expenses. The relevant part of the judgment reads: “... The liability of the defendant is based on the principle of fault (section 154(1) of the Civil Obligations Act). Unlawful conduct is conduct which is contrary to the law or an omission in the application of the law, which is committed deliberately or by accepting that it might cause damage to a third party. ... The purpose of section 13 of the State Administration Act is to provide for the liability of the State where there is a wilful act contrary to the law with the intent of causing damage ... Acceptance [of that outcome] is conduct or an omission of a State official in the performance of his or her official duties where he or she was able to, according to his or her individual capability, take into account the objective requirements with due diligence, and which he or she failed to do. In the particular circumstances, there is no causal link between the damage and the omissions of police officer M.Kr., in his capacity as on-duty commanding officer, to report the day before [the shootings] about M.N.’s complaint that she had been followed by A.N. This court finds nothing to suggest that the police officers who intervened at the bank, and who had had no knowledge of this, would have acted differently even if they had had such information. The plaintiffs also refer to the omissions of police officers M.L. and I.B ... Under section 24 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act the police may, in particularly urgent cases, take a mentally disturbed individual to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination, provided there is a reasonable suspicion that the individual poses an immediate threat to his life or health, or the life or health of others ... The events [in the bank] suggest that the police had an obligation to act under section 23 of the Protection of Individuals with Mental Disorders Act and to secure A.N.’s medical examination, after which the doctor could decide whether to take to a psychiatric hospital. But in the particular circumstances police officers M.L. and I.B. could not have been expected to recognise that there was any particular urgency or that A.N. should be taken to a psychiatric hospital without prior medical examination ... The omission of police officer [M.T.] to inform the hospital about A.N.’s behaviour is an irregularity in the performance of his official duties. However, the dispute between the parties is whether there is a causal link between this irregularity and the event ... Even if M.T. had informed the hospital at 8.15 a.m., it is doubtful whether the doctor would have carried out an examination because at that time he had not known where A.N. was. It follows that at the time A.N. was no longer available to the police and according to the evidence [submitted by] F.S. was in the bank sometime between 8.30 and 9 a.m. There is therefore no causal link between the incidents and the omissions of police officer M.T ... “ 73. The first, second and third applicants and K.B. lodged an appeal against the above judgment with the Virovitica County Court, arguing that the State authorities had failed to prevent the killing of their relative, and that in accordance with the relevant domestic law they should have been awarded damages. 74. On 7 May 2009 the Virovitica County Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. It held, however, that the first-instance court had erred in concluding that at 8.30 a.m. the police had not known A.N.’s whereabouts, because around that time the police had interviewed him at his home. In any event, the police could have informed the hospital immediately after 7.15 a.m. when they had received the call from the bank. Nevertheless, the court held that the police had done everything they could and that it could not be concluded that only intervention by the doctor in the first few hours after the information had been received from the bank would have prevented the incidents. The court also found that, irrespective of A.N.’s violent background and the indications that he was mentally disturbed, he had not acted violently on the day of the incidents or the day before. It was true that police officers M.L. and I.B. had omitted to examine A.N. under section 49 of the Police Act, but he had not been behaving violently, so that omission could not be characterised as an irregularity in their work. Moreover, it was not certain whether A.N. had a gun at the time and therefore it was in doubt whether such a police search could have prevented the incidents. 75. On 29 June 2009 the first, second and third applicants and K.B. lodged an appeal on points of law against the above judgment before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). 76. On 11 May 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law as ill-founded and upheld the Virovitica County Court’s judgment. It found that the lower courts had misinterpreted the relevant domestic law by holding that the liability of the State was based on the principle of fault because it was in fact based on the objective principle. It was thus sufficient to establish that there was unlawful or irregular conduct on the part of the State administration and the causal link to the damage thereby caused. In the case at issue, the Supreme Court held that there had been no causal link between the irregular work of the police officers and the killing of the applicants’ relative. 77. On 5 January 2012 the applicants (including the fourth and fifth applicants, who had taken over the proceedings from K.B. following her death on 14 June 2010) lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) challenging the decisions of the lower courts. 78. On 15 March 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants’ constitutional complaint, endorsing the reasoning of the Supreme Court. The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicants’ representative on 27 April 2012.",['2'],['2-1'],[],['13'],[],[],1

De Gaetano,"5. The first applicant, Ms Floare Cacuci, was born on 2 March 1939 and lives in Oradea. She is an accounting expert and the owner and general manager of the second applicant, S.C. Virra & Cont Pad SRL, a singlemember company based in Oradea. Both applicants were members of the Romanian Institute of Accounting Experts and Certified Accountants (Corpul experților contabili și contabililor autorizați din România). 6. On 30 July 2001 the criminal department of the Bihor County Police ordered a forensic accounting report in a criminal case it was dealing with. The first applicant was appointed to produce this report, which concerned pecuniary damage to the State budget in the sum of 22,143,258,699 Romanian lei (ROL), allegedly caused by S.C. T.P. SRL, a private company. The first applicant’s fees in relation to that expert report amounted to ROL 497,250,000. Claiming that she had not been fully paid for the report, on 25 January 2004 the first applicant submitted to the county police only approximately ninety-five pages of the report, which actually consisted of more than five hundred pages. She only submitted the conclusions of the report. The annexes justifying the conclusions were thus not appended on that occasion, but at a later date (see paragraph 22 below). The first applicant alleged that, when asked by the Police to hand in the remaining pages of the report, she had replied that the report was on her computer, and that, since she had not received any payment for it, she was not able to print it, as it was extremely long. 7. On 25 March 2005 the first applicant, together with two other accounting experts, was appointed by the Oradea District Court to produce a forensic accounting report in a criminal case concerning tax fraud, forgery and the use of forged documents – offences allegedly committed by two third parties, M.G.S. and C.V.C, in their capacity as managers of two private companies. A fourth expert, who was assisting M.G.S. and C.V.C., was also appointed to participate in producing the report. The conclusions of the report, which was submitted on 15 September 2005 by the three experts and with which the assisting expert agreed, noted that no damage had been caused to the State budget by the managerial activities of M.G.S. M.G.S. and C.V.C were acquitted on 7 December 2005 by the Oradea District Court. That judgment was later upheld by the Bihor County Court on 28 May 2007 on appeal, and by the Oradea Court of Appeal on 22 May 2008 in an appeal on points of law. 8. On 18 October 2005 the prosecutor’s office attached to the Oradea District Court proposed to initiate ex officio criminal investigations against the first applicant in relation to an offence of intellectual forgery (fals intelectual, defined by Article 289 of the Criminal Code) in connection with the second forensic accounting report. The prosecutor noted that the report was based solely on documents provided by M.G.S., in spite of the fact that it stated that the district court’s case file had been consulted. In the case file, there was no request from any of the experts to either consult the file or obtain copies of it. The conclusions of the report were therefore not based on all the documents on file, in spite of what the report stated. 9. The prosecutor’s proposal also concerned the two other accounting experts, who were investigated for the same offence as the first applicant. 10. The proposal to initiate criminal investigations in respect of the first applicant was confirmed by the prosecutor’s office on 19 October 2005. 11. On 20 October 2005 the prosecutor’s office attached to the Oradea District Court filed an application with the court, asking it to issue a search warrant in respect of the first applicant’s home. The prosecutor argued that there was a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed intellectual forgery while producing the second forensic accounting report, in order to help one of the defendants, M.G.S, avoid investigation. The grounds for this suspicion were: the report’s conclusions contradicted the conclusions of a previous report which had been produced by another accounting expert during the criminal investigation; the report objectives proposed by M.G.S. had most likely been copied and pasted into the report itself, the two documents having the same page settings, wording, spelling and grammar mistakes; and there was no proof that the first applicant had ever studied the case file in the court’s archives or requested copies of the documents in order to produce the expert report, therefore the report was probably based solely on information provided by M.G.S. The prosecutor also stated that, in accordance with the decision of 19 October 2005, a criminal investigation had already been initiated in respect of the first applicant in relation to intellectual forgery. The prosecutor further submitted that important evidence relating to the production of the second expert report – such as a computer, a printer, files and documents (whether on paper or on disc) – could be obtained from the first applicant’s home. 12. On the same day the Oradea District Court – sitting as a single judge, Judge F.P. – allowed the prosecutor’s application and issued a warrant to search the first applicant’s home, with the aim of discovering evidence concerning the alleged offence of intellectual forgery. In accordance with the relevant domestic law, the decision was taken in camera, in the presence of the prosecutor and without summoning the parties. The warrant was to last three days, the court stating that the search was to be carried out in compliance with Articles 101, 103-108 and 111 of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure (hereafter “the RCCP” – see paragraph 46 below). It was formulated as follows: “Based on Article 100 of the RCCP, in view of the prosecutor’s application issued on 20 October 2005 and the investigative work which has been presented, namely: the minutes attesting to the decision of the prosecutor to initiate criminal investigations ex officio, confirmation of the proposal to initiate criminal investigations against Cacuci Floare in relation to the offence of intellectual forgery as set out in Article 289 of the Criminal Code, and the forensic reports included in the file, [the court] authorises that a home search (percheziție domiciliară) be performed at the suspect’s place of residence, [the suspect being] Cacuci Floare, daughter of ..., born on ..., in Oradea, ..., in the Bihor District. The search shall be performed in compliance with Articles 101, 103-108 and 111 of the RCCP. This warrant is to last three days from the day of issue. Given in camera on 20 October 2005 at 3 p.m.” 13. According to the first applicant, on 21 October 2005, while she was in the street, having just left her house, she was stopped by a police officer, who told her that he had a search warrant for her home. The first applicant asked to be assisted by her lawyer. The police officer then searched her bag, from which he seized some personal documents, including an orange notebook containing various phone numbers. Subsequently, a prosecutor entered the first applicant’s home in order to perform the home search, accompanied by three police officers, one of whom was an information technology (IT) specialist. 14. According to the Government’s version of events – supported by the documents in the file, as issued by the criminal investigating authorities (see paragraph 42 below) – the search of the bag was carried out inside the first applicant’s home. 15. The first applicant’s lawyer arrived at the beginning of the search, namely around ten minutes after the first applicant had been stopped in the street (see paragraph 13 above); two assistant witnesses, who were neighbours of the first applicant, were also present during the search. 16. The prosecutor’s notes in the search report produced on that occasion at the place of residence of the first applicant state that the first applicant was asked to surrender the items used to commit the alleged offence of intellectual forgery, namely the computer, the printer, and the documents on which the second expert report was based (Articles 96-99 of the RCCP, see paragraph 45 below). The first applicant confirmed the existence of such items at her place of residence. According to the search report, the first floor of the building was occupied by the first applicant’s office, where she claimed to keep the objects which had been requested and other objects essential to her professional duties. Several items and documents were found, the first applicant claiming that everything belonged to the second applicant. She showed the prosecutor a lease contract concluded between herself and the second applicant in respect of the use of one half of the immovable property. According to the report, the following objects were seized: the computer’s central processing unit, one printer, four files and documents concerning various forensic accounting reports, one CD, forty-two floppy discs, an orange notebook containing several notes written by the first applicant and telephone numbers – one of which belonged to M.G.S., see paragraph 7 above – and an empty printer cartridge box. 17. The applicants argued that, while the copy of the search report handed to them at that moment had made no mention of the manner in which the seized items had been sealed, the copy in the criminal file contained supplementary information on page 4, mentioning that the objects had been put in a sealed cardboard box labelled MAI (the Ministry of Internal Affairs) 15980. 18. At the end of the search the first applicant declared, in the presence of her lawyer, that she would submit written objections at a later stage. The witnesses had no objections concerning the manner in which the search had been carried out. 19. According to the report, the search started at 8.45 a.m. and was finished by 12.30 p.m. 20. On 18 November 2005, at the request of the prosecutor, the Oradea District Court issued a warrant for a search of the computer system and IT data seized from the applicants on 21 October 2005, namely one CD and forty-two floppy discs. The court gave reasons for its decision, accepting that there was sufficient indication that the IT data would prove that the impugned expert report had been partly copied from a document given to the first applicant by M.G.S (see paragraph 11 above). The warrant was to last three days, starting on 21 November 2005. 21. According to the applicant, on 18 November 2005 she was summoned to the Cluj District police headquarters to participate in the unsealing of the computer on 21 November 2005. She went there with her lawyer, where they noted that the sealed box was different to the box which had been used at her house during the search (see paragraphs 16-17 above). She therefore asked that the two witnesses who had been present at the search be summoned to attest that the box was different, but the request was refused. Consequently, together with her lawyer, she decided to leave the police headquarters without attending the unsealing and search procedure. 22. On 5 December 2005 the first applicant submitted the missing 497 pages from the first expert report (see paragraph 6 above) to the Oradea District Court, following payment of 60% of her fee. 23. On 8 November 2005, pursuant to Articles 275-2781 of the RCCP (see paragraph 47 below), the first applicant filed a complaint against the search carried out on 21 October 2004 (see paragraphs 13-19 above). She contested both the search itself and the manner in which it had been carried out. The first applicant submitted that the warrant had been issued only in respect of her home, and not in respect of the registered office of the second applicant. In spite of that, a search of the whole house had been carried out, including the space used by the second applicant. The seized items and documents belonged to the second applicant. The first applicant also submitted that the search had not been necessary, and could have been avoided if she had been asked to submit the relevant items and documents, as set out in Article 98 of the RCCP (see paragraph 45 below). Furthermore, no reasons had been given to justify the search measure. She argued that the limits of the search warrant had been exceeded by the search carried out in respect of her purse, which constituted a body search (percheziţie corporală), and by the fact that she had been prevented from using her mobile phone during the search. She complained of the manner in which the electronic devices seized had been sealed on that occasion. She further referred to the seizure of various items from her home, namely “personal documents and personal notebooks which had no connection to the criminal charge against her”, concluding that all the above circumstances constituted evidence of a breach of her right to a private life, personal inviolability, professional secrecy, and right of property. 24. On 24 November 2005 the head prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the District Court of Oradea dismissed the first applicant’s claims, finding that the complaint against the search measure itself was inadmissible, given the lack of specific legal provisions allowing for such an appeal, while the complaint concerning the carrying out of the search was ill-founded. 25. Concerning the appeal against the search measure itself, the prosecutor gave reasons for his inadmissibility decision, stating that it was inconceivable that any search warrant application would be debated in adversarial proceedings, as such a procedure would impede the very purpose of the search, namely the discovery and collection of specific evidence from a specific place without prior notice. The prosecutor stated that the search at the applicant’s home had been conducted in accordance with the law. The warrant had been issued in respect of her residence as stated on her identification documents. The prosecutor submitted that the investigating authorities had had no obligation to check whether that residence was also the registered office of various private companies. In the impugned forensic expert report, the first applicant had given her identification details, including her place of residence, without mentioning that the report had been issued by or on behalf of the second applicant. Moreover, during the search, the first applicant had submitted a lease contract concluded between herself and the second applicant concerning one half of the immovable property, without specifying or determining which half belonged to which party. The prosecutor also stated that the investigating authorities had been obliged to seize all pieces of physical evidence found at the search location, irrespective of who owned them, and that the pieces not belonging to the suspect had been returned to their owner at the end of the criminal trial. 26. Concerning the body search, namely the search of the first applicant’s bag, the prosecutor submitted that the relevant forensic rules set out clearly and authoritatively that such a search had to be performed before the start of a home search, “so as to preclude any potential act of aggression against the authorities or self-aggression, but also so as to locate and collect any potential corpora delicti thus hidden by the searched person (in [this] case, documents)”. The rules also provided that the investigating authorities were obliged to prevent any people inside the building in question from communicating with people outside, whether by phone or otherwise, which justified the fact that the first applicant had been temporarily prevented from using her mobile phone. 27. In respect of the manner in which the seized electronic devices had been sealed, the prosecutor stated that the report produced on that occasion had been signed by both the first applicant and her lawyer, and no objections had been raised. As mentioned in the report, the central processing unit of the computer had been sealed in a cardboard box with the MAI seal. In any event, the manner in which the seized objects had been sealed could not affect the legality of the search, but possibly their use as evidence in the criminal proceedings. 28. The first applicant contested that decision before both the prosecutor’s office attached to the County Court of Bihor and the Oradea District Court. 29. It is unclear whether any response to that complaint was given by the prosecutor’s office. In any event, the same complaint was assessed by the domestic courts in two separate sets of proceedings, as detailed below. 30. In the first set of proceedings, started by the first applicant on 23 December 2005, the Oradea District Court gave its judgment on 29 June 2006, dismissing the first applicant’s complaint as inadmissible in respect of the search measure itself, and ill-founded in respect of the manner in which the search had been carried out. The court stated that, in the event that she was indicted, the first applicant would be entitled to lodge with the criminal courts complaints regarding the search and the acts of the prosecutor. 31. The first applicant appealed. On 28 November 2006 the Bihor County Court dismissed her appeal, upholding the first instance court’s decision. It considered that the search had been lawful and in compliance with the warrant issued by the Oradea District Court. Furthermore, at the material time, the first applicant, assisted by her lawyer, had not objected to either the search or the manner in which it had been carried out. The court considered that it would be “abusive” to have an adversarial procedure for debating the necessity of a search, either before or after it was carried out. 32. In the second set of proceedings, a complaint lodged by the first applicant on 4 January 2006 reiterated the same main arguments as those presented in the proceedings described above. In particular, it referred to the fact that the limits of the search warrant had been exceeded as follows: the warrant had only been issued in respect of her home, and not in respect of the registered office of the second applicant; no warrant had existed in respect of her purse or mobile phone; certain items, like her personal notebooks, had been seized even though they had no connection with the criminal charge. The computer had been seized without being appropriately sealed, therefore the first applicant had refused to take it back in the absence of verification and confirmation by an expert that the IT data had not been altered. The first applicant argued that the real aim of the prosecutor and the police had been to seize her computer in order to copy the 497 pages of annexes to the first accounting expert report (see paragraph 6 above). In any event, the search had not been necessary, as she would have surrendered all required items and documents if she had been asked to. 33. The complaint was allocated to a single judge for determination, Judge F.P., who on 21 February 2006 asked to recuse herself from the case, as it had been she who had examined and approved the application for a search warrant on 20 October 2005 (see paragraph 12 above). That request was dismissed by the President of the Oradea District Court on the same day. It was noted that the first applicant had expressly confirmed that she was not challenging the search measure itself, but the manner in which it had been carried out. In such circumstances, there was no reason for Judge F.P. to withdraw from the case. 34. In the context of the second set of proceedings, on 28 June 2006 the first applicant lodged an application calling into question the constitutionality of the provisions of Article 100 § 4 of the RCCP (see paragraph 46 below). She claimed that the impugned provisions breached a claimant’s defence rights, right to a fair trial and right to an effective remedy, as he or she was denied the right to participate in proceedings and contest a search measure. 35. The application was dealt with by the Romanian Constitutional Court (“the Constitutional Court”), which gave its judgment on 30 November 2006, dismissing the objection as ill-founded. The Constitutional Court firstly found that the constitutionality of the impugned provisions had already been examined and found to be in accordance with the Constitution (the court referred to its decision of 21 October 2004, detailed in paragraph 52 below). The court reiterated that only the legislature could dictate the jurisdiction of the domestic courts and trial procedure. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court held that the issuing of a search warrant was a procedural measure and not a trial in itself, and that therefore the summoning of parties was not obligatory, especially as a search was conducted in the presence of the interested parties and/or their representative. Moreover, interested parties had at their disposal several opportunities and means to contest any measure taken during a criminal investigation or criminal trial. 36. The case was sent back to the Oradea District Court, which gave its judgment on 31 January 2007, dismissing the first applicant’s complaint. The court noted that a similar claim lodged by the first applicant in another set of proceedings had already been dismissed by a final judgment (see paragraph 31 above). The court further stated that the search had been carried out in compliance with the domestic legal provisions and in the presence of the prosecutor, the applicant and her lawyer, and no objections had been raised at the material time. It appears that the decision was not appealed against by the first applicant. 37. In January 2006 the second applicant was struck off the list of the Romanian Institute of Accounting Experts and Certified Accountants; the first applicant was removed from the list from January 2006 until 7 April 2010, allegedly as a result of the criminal investigations against her. 38. The first applicant was indicted on 27 September 2009, charged with perjury as a witness in a criminal trial, aiding and abetting a perpetrator (with specific reference to the criminal trial concerning M.G.S. and C.V.C.), and spoliation (the material alteration, thereby invalidation) of evidence. The indictment referred to the items seized during the search of 21 October 2005, namely documents relating to the forensic accounting reports issued by the first applicant and relevant to several criminal proceedings against various suspects (C.V.C., A.D., F.K., G.P.); the prosecutor considered that such documents had been withheld by the first applicant for the purpose of obstructing justice. The indictment stated that the criminal proceedings against the two other accounting experts (see paragraph 9 above) were to be terminated (scoatere de sub urmărire penală). 39. By a judgment of 30 November 2010 the Oradea District Court acquitted the first applicant of all charges. In relation to the charge of perjury, the court held that such a charge was relevant where an expert had been called before a court to give oral evidence, which had not been the case with regard to the first applicant. In relation to the written evidence given by the first applicant in the form of the forensic accounting report, the court held that the report was a collective piece of work produced by the three experts appointed in the case. Even if evidence had been adduced proving that only one of the experts had personally studied the file in the court’s archives, it could not be inferred that the work had been done by the first applicant exclusively and in the absence of consideration of all the relevant documents and consultation with the other experts. The court further stated that there was insufficient proof that the first applicant had favoured M.G.S. The accounting expert report had been produced with the other experts appointed in the case. The first applicant had been selected as an expert in the impugned criminal proceedings from a list of six experts, and it had therefore been impossible for her to plan to help M.G.S in any way. With reference to the documents found at the first applicant’s residence during the search carried out on 21 October 2005, the court stated that they had not been in her possession unlawfully, as all of them had been given to her by the police for the purpose of allowing her to produce the relevant forensic accounting reports. It could therefore not be inferred that the applicant had withheld the documents with the intention of obstructing justice. The court ordered that all IT equipment seized from the first applicant should be returned to her once the judgment became final. 40. By a judgment of 21 April 2011 the Oradea Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal lodged by the prosecutor and upheld the first-instance court’s judgment, stating essentially that the presumption of innocence in respect of the first applicant had not been rebutted. The only dissenting opinion of the Oradea Court of Appeal considered that the case should have been remitted to the first-instance court for a re-trial, as the first-instance judgment had lacked appropriate reasoning. 41. The first applicant filed several criminal complaints against the relevant prosecutors and police officers who had requested and carried out the search of 21 October 2005 with various domestic authorities (the Romanian Senate, the High Council of the Judiciary and the Ministry of Internal Affairs), accusing them of abuse of office for carrying out the search in breach of Articles 100-111 of the RCCP (see paragraph 46 below). She reiterated her arguments: a special warrant and a separate report had been needed for the body search (Article 106), and another warrant had been necessary for the search of the company’s registered office (Article 111). 42. Those complaints were joined and assessed in a unique case file, being dismissed as ill-founded by the Oradea Court of Appeal on 20 September 2006. The court upheld the prosecutor’s decision. In respect of the complaint concerning the body search, it found that the search of the applicant’s bag had been carried out inside her house, as a preliminary step of the actual search measure. Furthermore, the home search warrant had been issued in respect of an address, not in respect of a person or company. The court concluded that all the complaints were ill-founded. That decision was upheld by the High Court of Cassation and Justice on 10 November 2006. 43. The first applicant also submitted to the Court a copy of another undated criminal complaint, which was addressed to the prosecutor’s office attached to the High Court of Cassation and Justice. In the complaint, the first applicant claimed that the search report had been forged with regard to the manner in which the computer had been sealed (see paragraphs 16-17 above). She also stated that, at some point after the search, she had noticed that the data on her computer relating to various forensic accounting reports which she had produced had been altered while at the police headquarters, so as to provide evidence to incriminate her. In the absence of any registration number or reference to a domestic file number, it is unclear if and when that complaint was lodged with the domestic authorities; assuming that it was, it is equally unclear whether the first applicant received any response.",['8'],['8-1'],[],"['13', '8']",['8-1'],[],1

De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Hadžići. 6. On 22 November 2011 the applicant was arrested and detained on suspicion of having committed war crimes against the civilian population and against prisoners of war during the 1992-95 war. 7. On 23 November 2011 the State Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the State Court”) reviewed and extended his detention based on the risk of his obstructing the course of justice by exerting pressure on witnesses and co-accused or by destroying evidence. On 1 December 2011 that decision was upheld by the Appeals Chamber of the State Court. 8. On 21 December 2011 the State Court further extended the applicant’s detention on the same grounds as before. On 5 January 2012 that decision was upheld by the Appeals Chamber of the State Court. 9. On 29 December 2011 the State Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicant and seven other co-suspects, which was confirmed by the State Court on 10 January 2012. 10. Thereafter, the applicant’s detention was regularly examined and extended every two months by the State Court. In addition to those automatic reviews, the applicant repeatedly challenged his detention before the Appeals Chamber of the State Court. 11. On 23 February 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional appeal, relying on Article II § 3.(d) of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) and Article 5 of the Convention. He alleged, in particular, that his detention had been arbitrary and excessive, and that it had not been based on relevant and sufficient reasons. 12. On 13 July 2012 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”), in a formation of eight judges, rejected the applicant’s appeal since it could not reach a majority on any of the proposals. The court’s reasoning included all the views expressed at the session on the issues raised in the case. Pursuant to Article VI § 4 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) that decision was final. 13. On 1 November 2012 the State Court held that the grounds for the applicant’s continued detention had ceased to apply and released the applicant. By the same decision, the court imposed preventive measures on the applicant which included the following: a prohibition on leaving his place of residence without the prior approval of the State Court save for the purpose of appearing before that court; the duty to report once a week to the Hadžići police; a prohibition on associating with other co-accused and on associating or having contact with the witnesses. Furthermore, the applicant’s passport was seized. 14. The preventive measures were reviewed and extended every two months. On 16 December 2015 they were revoked. 15. At the date of the latest information available to the Court (22 July 2016), the criminal proceedings against the applicant were still ongoing.",['5'],['5-4'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Chişinău. 6. In 2001 the Comrat Prosecutor’s Office initiated a criminal investigation against the applicant on charges of murder and an arrest warrant was issued by the Comrat District Court. Since the applicant had left the country, an international search order was issued. 7. On 21 January 2011, upon his return to Moldova, the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. On 4 February 2011, when the applicant was about to be transferred from Comrat to Chisinau, he cut open his abdomen as a sign of protest. He was taken to a hospital where his wound was taken care of. The applicant lodged a habeas corpus request, however it was rejected on the ground, inter alia, that he had been in hiding for more than ten years and that, consequently, he could abscond again. Later the detention warrant was renewed several times on similar grounds and the applicant’s appeals were rejected. The last judgment in the proceedings complained of by the applicant is dated 18 October 2011 and was issued by the Comrat Court of Appeal. 8. During all this time the applicant was detained in Prison no. 13 in Chisinau (between 4 March and 17 April 2011 and between 9 October 2012 and 12 June 2013) and in Prison no. 5 in Cahul (between 18 April 2011 and 8 October 2012). The applicant gave a detailed description of the conditions of detention in Prison no. 13 where, according to him, the cells were overcrowded and dirty. Each inmate only had between 1.5 and 3 square metres of available space in the cells in which the applicant was detained. The toilets were separated from the rest of the cells by a wall which was not very high and were located at a distance of some 1.5 metres from the table where the inmates served their meals. There was no ventilation system and the air was impregnated with a sewage smell and with cigarette smoke; there was no sufficient natural light because the windows were very small; the daily walks lasted for only one hour and the food served was of a very bad quality. The applicant submitted that according to information available on the web page of the Ministry of Justice, each inmate was allocated only 10 Moldovan Lei per day, i.e. the equivalent of 0.8 Euros (EUR) at the time. Moreover, the applicant alleged that after his arrest, he needed urgent medical care for the wound on his abdomen and for an ear infection and that no medical care was provided for him for one month. He provided medical documents to support his claims concerning his health problems. The Government provided documents according to which the applicant was seen by doctors and medication was prescribed for him. 9. In so far as Prison no. 5 is concerned, the applicant submitted that he was detained in two cells in which each inmate had between 2.4 and 3 square metres. The Government contested that information and presented a document according to which in the applicant’s cells each inmate had between 4.4 and 6.6 square metres. 10. The applicant was released from detention on 12 June 2013. The Court was not informed about subsequent developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

Serghides;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"5. The applicant was born in 1990 and lived in Moscow until his arrest. 6. The background facts relating to the planning, conduct and dispersal of the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square are set out in more detail in Frumkin v. Russia (no. 74568/12, §§ 7-65, 5 January 2016), and Yaroslav Belousov v. Russia (nos. 2653/13 and 60980/14, §§ 7-33, 4 October 2016). The parties’ submissions on the circumstances directly relevant to the present case are set out below. 7. On 6 May 2012 a public demonstration entitled the “March of Millions” was held in central Moscow to protest against the allegedly rigged presidential elections. The event had been approved by the city authorities in the form of a march followed by a meeting at Bolotnaya Square, which was supposed to end at 7.30 p.m. The march was peaceful and held without any disruptions, but when the marchers arrived at Bolotnaya Square it became apparent that barriers installed by the police had narrowed the entrance to the meeting venue, allegedly restricting the space allocated for the meeting. To control the crowd the police cordon forced the protestors to remain within the barriers; there were numerous clashes between the two sides. At 5.30 p.m. the police ordered the meeting to finish early and began to disperse the participants. It took them about two hours to clear the square. 8. On the same day the Moscow city department of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation opened criminal proceedings to investigate suspected acts of mass disorder and violence against the police (Articles 212 § 2 and 318 § 1 of the Criminal Code). On 18 May 2012 the file was transferred to the headquarters of the Investigative Committee for further investigation. On 28 May 2012 an investigation was also launched into the criminal offence of organising acts of mass disorder (Article 212 § 1 of the Criminal Code). The two criminal cases were joined on the same day. 9. At the time of his arrest the applicant was a second-year student at the Moscow University of Social Studies and worked part-time as a courier for an insurance company. According to him, on 6 May 2012 he arrived at Kaluzhskaya Square to take part in the march and walked with other participants to Bolotnaya Square. Upon arrival there he discovered that the police cordon had blocked access to the square. When passage to the stage of the rally taking place along the embankment was opened, the applicant went in that direction. The police started to disperse the protesters, using excessive force and beating them with truncheons. In response, the protesters dragged metal barriers in place to protect themselves from the police. At one point the applicant observed a protester in a green T-shirt, who five or six police officers were holding and beating with truncheons. He grabbed the protester and pulled him back, trying to protect him from the blows. The applicant was later arrested by the police and taken to a police station before being released shortly after. After the events in question he continued to live at his usual address and pursue his studies. 10. On 26 July 2012 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having participated in acts of mass disorder on 6 May 2012. 11. On 27 July 2012 the Basmannyy District Court ordered that the applicant be placed in pre-trial detention until 26 September 2012. It referred to the gravity of the charges and information about the applicant’s character, including a report by Moscow Police’s chief of department at the Centre for Counter-Extremism. According to that report, the applicant was an active member of organisations of a destructive character. If he were to stay at liberty, he planned to threaten witnesses, abscond and obstruct the investigation. The court concluded that those circumstances gave sufficient grounds to believe that the applicant was likely to flee to avoid the investigation and trial, destroy evidence or otherwise obstruct the investigation of the criminal case, which was still at an initial stage. 12. On 1 August 2012 charges were brought against the applicant under Article 212 § 2 (participation in acts of mass disorder accompanied by violence). He was accused, in particular, of resisting police officers by pushing them away when they were arresting other protestors and by trying to liberate the latter. 13. On 27 August 2012 the Moscow City Court upheld the detention order of 27 July 2012. 14. On 24 September 2012 the Basmannyy District Court examined an application from the investigator for an extension of the applicant’s pre-trial detention. The applicant asked for the preventive measure to be changed to house arrest, a written undertaking not to leave a specified place, bail or personal guarantees. On the same day the District Court granted the investigator’s application and extended the applicant’s detention until 6 November 2012. It considered that the circumstances justifying the detention order had not changed. 15. On 1 October 2012 Police Officer T. identified the applicant during an identification parade as a participant in mass disorder who had used violence against him. In particular, when T. and other officers had been arresting a protester, the applicant had grabbed his hand and pulled it off the protestor, thereby causing the police officer pain. Another police officer, L., also identified the applicant as a participant in acts of mass disorder who had tried to prevent the police arresting another protestor. 16. On 22 October 2012 the Moscow City Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the extension order of 24 September 2012. 17. On 29 October 2012 the Basmannyy District Court granted an extension of the applicant’s detention until 6 March 2013, essentially on the same grounds as earlier, noting that the circumstances justifying the detention order had not changed. In particular, it dismissed an objection from the applicant to the use of the operational-search reports concerning his character and rejected his contesting of the alleged membership of any organisations of a destructive nature. 18. On 15 November and 21 December 2012 the charges against the applicant were reformulated. It was stated that the applicant, who had been wearing a surgical mask to conceal his face, had used violence against the police while trying to liberate protestors who had been arrested and that he had pushed police officers away. In particular, he had grabbed Officer T.’s hand and pulled it off a protester, thereby preventing his arrest. He had also built a line of metal barriers to block the police and had tried to repel the police with them. The applicant’s alleged offences were classified additionally under Article 318 § 1 of the Criminal Code (use of violence against a public official). 19. On 5 March 2013 the Basmannyy District Court granted a new extension of the applicant’s detention, until 6 July 2013, essentially on the same grounds as before. On 17 April 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld the extension order. 20. On 24 May 2013 the applicant’s criminal case was transferred to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow for the determination of criminal charges. 21. On 6 June 2013 that court granted another extension of the applicant’s detention, until 24 November 2013. The decision concerned eleven defendants. Along with the gravity of the charges, the court based its decision on the findings that “the reasons which initially warranted the detention have not changed” and that “no other measures of restraint would secure the aims and goals of the judicial proceedings”. The applicant’s request for an alternative preventive measure was dismissed on the grounds that no other measure could secure the proper course of justice in the case. The Moscow City Court upheld the extension order on 2 July 2013. 22. On 19 November 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court granted another extension of detention in respect of nine defendants, including the applicant. It ordered their detention until 24 February 2014 on the grounds of the gravity of the charges and the nature of the offences imputable to them. On 17 December 2013 the Moscow City Court upheld that extension order. 23. The applicant was held in IZ-77/2 for the whole period of his pre-trial detention from 4 September 2012. According to him, the conditions of his detention had been poor. The applicant referred to cases against Russia in which the Court had previously found a breach of Article 3 because of overcrowding in IZ-77/2 in 2004-2005 (see Lind v. Russia, no. 25664/05, §§ 42 and 58-63, 6 December 2007; Zentsov and Others v. Russia, no. 35297/05, §§ 25-29 and 40-44, 23 October 2012; and Vyatkin v. Russia, no. 18813/06, §§ 2627 and 38-43, 11 April 2013). The applicant submitted that his conditions of detention had been similar. 24. The applicant’s description of the conditions of detention during his transfer from the remand prison to court and back and the Government’s submissions in that regard were identical to those in the case of Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, §§ 69-73). 25. As regards the conditions of detention in the convoy room of the Moscow City Court, the applicant submitted that it was poorly lit and that access to the toilet was limited to once an hour. In addition, he had been required to strip naked and to perform sit-ups during the body search conducted in the convoy room. 26. On 6 June 2013 court proceedings began in hearing room no. 338 at the Moscow City Court, moving at the end of July 2013 to hearing room no. 635. The defendants, including the applicant, were held in glass cabins in both hearing rooms. From mid-September 2013 to the end of 2013 the hearings continued at the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow in hearing room no. 303, while in January and February 2014 they took place at the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court in hearing room no. 410. Those hearing rooms were equipped with metal cages in which nine defendants (seven from 19 December 2013), including the applicant, sat during the hearings. 27. For a detailed description of the conditions in those hearing rooms see Yaroslav Belousov (cited above, §§ 74-77). 28. On 6 June 2013 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow began a preliminary hearing in a criminal case against ten participants in the demonstration at Bolotnaya Square, who were charged with participation in acts of mass disorder and committing acts of violence against police officers. On 18 June 2013 the same court began the trial on the merits. 29. On 5 September 2013 Police Officer T., the alleged victim of the applicant’s assault, was examined as a witness. He testified that the applicant had impeded him and two other police officers from arresting a protester by grabbing T.’s hand and pushing the officers away. The applicant had caused him pain but had not inflicted any injuries. During the hearing the applicant and his lawyers applied to deprive T. of victim status because no harm had been caused to him, but the court refused that request as unsubstantiated. 30. On 21 February 2014 the Zamoskvoretsky District Court of Moscow found the applicant guilty as charged. It held, in particular, as follows: “Between 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. on 6 May 2012 ... at Bolotnaya Square ... unidentified persons ... called those present [at the venue] to move outside the agreed meeting venue, to defy the lawful orders of the police ..., to use violence ... which led to mass disorder accompanied by the use of violence against public officials in connection with the performance of their duties [and] the destruction of property. On the same day at 5 p.m. at the latest [the defendants] acquired the criminal intent to participate in mass disorder and to use violence against ... police officers ... Moreover ... the participants of the acts of mass disorder threw chunks of tarmac, stones, sticks and other objects at the police ... which hit them on various parts of their body, and [the defendants] ... [who] participated in the acts of mass disorder ... implemented their criminal intent to use violence against public officials ... applied physical force which was not a danger to the life or health of those [officials] ... [The applicant] ... who was wearing a surgical mask to hide his face, together with unidentified persons ... tried to liberate those arrested by the police for a breach of public order and pushed the police officers away ... ... [the applicant] used violence against Police Officer [T.] which did not endanger his life or health ... [The applicant] ... from 5 p.m. to 9.40 p.m. ... when unidentified participants of acts of mass disorder tried to break the police cordon, acting intentionally and using force, grabbed [T.’s] hand and then pulled it off the person whom [T.] was arresting, thus impeding his apprehension, which caused [T.] pain. In addition, [the applicant] together with unidentified persons ... built a line of metal barriers blocking the police’s movements, and ... tried to repel the line of police officers ... with the help of those barriers. [The applicant] pleaded not guilty and testified that ... he had decided to attend the public gathering on 6 May 2012 ... for the purposes of personal security he wore a surgical mask ... [The applicant] was at the bridge when a blockage occurred. He did not see what was happening, but at one point ... he had been able to proceed with the flow of people towards the stage. There [the applicant] saw the mass beating of people by police officers and participants of the rally starting to bring forward metal barriers ... and to put them close to the police officers, trying to protect themselves from the latter. [The applicant] was standing close to the barriers, taking his hands off when the police officers used their truncheons to hit over the barriers. Then ... [the applicant] saw a group of five or six police officers who were trying to seize a young man in a green T-shirt. They hit the man with their truncheons, and [the applicant], considering that the man was in danger because the police actions were unlawful, tried to snatch him from the officers’ hands. He grasped the young man’s waistband, pulled it and turned his back to protect him from the truncheon blows. [The applicant] finds it conceivable that in this turmoil he might unintentionally have pushed someone and asks for attention to be paid to [T.’s] statements that the latter did not feel any pain. Then [the applicant] was arrested and taken to a police vehicle. ... the court considers the [defendants’] arguments that they were protecting somebody from police officers or happened to be victims of the police’s use of force as farfetched and aimed at the mitigation of their responsibility ...” 31. The applicant was sentenced to three years and six months’ imprisonment, calculated on the basis of a three-year prison term under Article 212 § 2 of the Criminal Code, partly concurrent with a term of one year and three months under Article 318 § 1. The applicant’s pre-trial detention counted towards the prison sentence. 32. The applicant appealed. He complained that the same acts imputed to him had been classified under both Article 212 and Article 318 of the Criminal Code. He insisted that he had not used violence against T. because the latter had not suffered any pain or injuries. 33. On 20 June 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the first-instance judgment.","['11', '3', '5']","['11-1', '5-3']",[],['3'],[],[],1

Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom,"4. This application was lodged on 20 October 2008 by Svetlana Ivanovna Tsvetkova, who was born in 1972 and lives in Irkutsk. 5. At 10 p.m. on 1 January 2008 Officer S. escorted the applicant to the police station, in accordance with Article 27.2 of the Federal Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) (see paragraph 67 below), on suspicion of shoplifting. 6. Officer B. compiled an arrest record under Article 27.3 of the CAO (see paragraph 69 below). The administrative arrest record reads as follows: “I, Officer B., ... compiled the present administrative arrest record in respect of: [the applicant’s name, date of birth, address] ... who has been escorted to ... on 1 January 2008 at 10 p.m., on account of an administrative offence under Article [blank] of the CAO. Reasons for the arrest (Article 27.3 of the CAO): [blank] ...” 7. According to the applicant, after she had been taken away by the police, her minor son (who had apparently been with her in the shop) had been left unattended in the cold. The applicant was then subjected to a humiliating body-search procedure and was asked to take off her clothes, remaining in her underwear. She was then kept with drunk people in a small cell with no seats and no toilet. 8. In her application to the Court, the applicant specified that she had been released at 3 a.m. on 2 January 2008. In her observations before the Court, she specified that she had been released “after 4 a.m.”. According to the Government, the applicant was released at 0.35 a.m. 9. The applicant was not subsequently prosecuted for an administrative offence or a criminal offence. 10. Considering that the police actions in respect of her and the degrading treatment to which she had been subjected were sufficiently serious so as to amount to a criminal offence, on 27 May 2008 the applicant sought the institution of criminal proceedings against officer S., referring, inter alia, to the unlawful deprivation of liberty. 11. On 16 June 2008 an investigator refused to open a criminal case, finding that the officer had not committed any abuse of power, which was a criminal offence punishable under Article 286 of the Criminal Code. The investigator referred to a statement from B. affirming that the applicant had been taken to the police station on suspicion of theft. 12. On 20 June 2008 a superior officer overruled the refusal to open a case. A new refusal was issued on 30 June 2008 by the same investigator. That was also then overruled. 13. A further refusal was issued on 11 December 2008 and the applicant sought a judicial review. On 19 January 2009 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Irkutsk confirmed the refusal. On 26 February 2009 the Irkutsk Regional Court set aside the judgment, considering that the applicant’s allegations concerning the unlawfulness of her arrest had not been examined. 14. The District Court then declined jurisdiction in favour of another court, but that was declared unlawful on appeal. 15. On 8 May 2009 the District Court discontinued the case because on 7 May 2009 the impugned refusal to prosecute had been overruled by a superior officer. However, a new refusal was issued on 12 November 2009 as regards offences under Articles 285, 286 and 293 of the Criminal Code. This refusal was then upheld by a final judgment of the Regional Court on 9 September 2010. 16. This application was lodged on 28 January 2011 by Aleksandr Vitalyevich Bgantsev, who was born in 1958 and lives in Volgograd. The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms Y. Lepilina, a lawyer practising in the Volgograd Region. 17. On 30 August 2010 the applicant’s superior, Mr I., called the police to report that the applicant had used (unspecified) foul language at his work place. Officer O. ordered the applicant to accompany him to the police station. The applicant refused and said that nothing prevented the officer from compiling an administrative-offence record on the spot. The officer insisted, stating that it would be more convenient for him to do it at the police station. The applicant obeyed and was escorted to the police station at around 1 p.m. (in accordance with Article 27.2 of the CAO). At 3.40 p.m. he was subjected to the arrest procedure (Article 27.3 of the CAO). The arrest record reads as follows: “[The applicant] was escorted to the police station at: 3.40 p.m. On account of: an administrative offence under: Article 20.1 of the CAO For the purpose(s) of Article 27.3 of the CAO: for taking a decision.” 18. Officer O. compiled the administrative-offence record, which reads as follows: “[The applicant] used foul language in the presence of Mr I. and continued his unruly behaviour, despite being asked to stop. Thus, [the applicant] committed an offence under Article 20.1 of the CAO. Witnesses to the offence: Mr K.; Mr M.” 19. The applicant spent the night at the police station. 20. On 31 August 2010 the applicant was taken before a justice of the peace, who held a hearing at which he examined the applicant, as well as I., K. and M. On the same day, the justice of the peace convicted the applicant of minor hooliganism (Article 20.1 of the CAO) and sentenced him to five days of detention. 21. The applicant started to serve the sentence on the same day, in the police station. Between 30 August and 4 September 2010 he was locked in cells measuring six square metres and accommodating, on average, four detainees. Each cell was equipped with two benches some 35 cm in width. There was no window and no ventilation system. The other detainees smoked cigarettes, which caused discomfort to the applicant, who was not a smoker. There was no bed or bedding. The applicant was not provided with food or allowed outdoors. Access to a toilet (which was apparently outside the cell) was available every four hours (or sometimes every eight hours). The applicant submitted written statements from three co-detainees in support of his allegations. 22. The applicant was released at 3.40 p.m. on 4 September 2010. 23. On 4 October 2010 the Krasnoarmeyskiy District Court of Volgograd held an appeal hearing and examined the applicant, I., K., M. and Officer O. The appellate court upheld the judgment of 31 August 2010. On 3 November 2010 the Volgograd Regional Court upheld the judgments following a review. 24. This application was lodged on 1 February 2013 by Pavel Vladimirovich Andreyev, who was born in 1989 and lives in Syktyvkar. The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms I. Buryukova, a lawyer practising in the Moscow Region. 25. On 9 December 2011 the applicant distributed leaflets in various police stations, urging the police not to use force to disperse public gatherings which were to be held on 10 December 2011, after the contested elections to the State Duma earlier that month. 26. At 11 p.m. the traffic police took the applicant to the police station on suspicion of evading military service. At 11.50 p.m. the applicant was charged with an administrative offence under Article 20.25 of the CAO on account of an unpaid fine of 300 roubles (RUB) (equivalent to 7 euros (EUR)) for a traffic offence. The charge concerning evasion of military service was not pursued. 27. The arrest record reads as follows: “[The applicant] was escorted to the police station: at 11.30 p.m. On account of an administrative offence: under Article 20.25 of the CAO. For the purposes of Article 27.3 of the CAO: for compiling an administrative record.” 28. The applicant was not released after the administrative-offence record had been drawn up, but was instead placed in a detention centre at 2 a.m., for reasons which were not specified. 29. At 3 p.m. on 11 December 2011 the applicant was taken before a justice of the peace, who then sentenced him to two days of detention for the offence under Article 20.25 of the CAO. The applicant was then taken back to the detention centre and was released at around 11.30 p.m. 30. The applicant appealed. On 31 January 2012 the Syktyvkar Town Court upheld the conviction. 31. The applicant brought proceedings, under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the CCP”), to challenge the deprivation of his liberty from 2 a.m. on 10 December 2011 to 3 p.m. the next day. By a decision of 12 May 2012, the Town Court discontinued the proceedings. On 2 August 2012 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld the decision. On 4 March 2013 the cassation instance of the same court confirmed it. The courts considered that while neither the CCP nor the CAO set out a separate procedure for challenging the measures of being escorted to the police station or of administrative arrest, arguments concerning those measures could be raised during an examination of the related CAO charges against the applicant, as well as in an appeal against a decision that had been taken on such charges. 32. In separate proceedings, the applicant lodged a claim for compensation, arguing that Article 27.4 required that a record of administrative arrest was to specify reasons for the arrest; the record of his arrest referred to the need to compile the administrative-offence record; such record had been compiled late at night on 9 December 2011; thereby the justification for his arrest had been exhausted and could no longer justify his continued deprivation of liberty on 10 and 11 December 2011. The applicant concluded from the above that the unlawful deprivation of liberty on those dates served as a legal basis for obtaining compensation on account of the non-pecuniary damage suffered. 33. By a judgment of 19 September 2012, the Town Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. The court considered that the matters relating to his being taken to the police station and the ensuing administrative arrest had been examined in the CAO case and there were therefore no reasons to award compensation. On 20 December 2012 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld that judgment. On 27 May 2013 the same court dismissed a cassation appeal lodged by the applicant, stating as follows: “... [The applicant] was escorted to the police station for the compiling of a record of administrative offence ... With a view to the correct and expedient examination of the case, he was subjected to the measure of administrative arrest ... The actions of the police officers relating to the escorting and the arrest procedures were assessed by the courts dealing with the administrative charge and were, in substance, declared lawful ... The claimant’s argument that the courts in a civil case should assess the lawfulness of the police actions is based on a wrong interpretation of the law ... It is not appropriate to challenge the procedure of administrative arrest within the procedure under Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, where there is a decision to engage the liability of a person for an administrative offence ...” 34. This application was lodged on 5 September 2014 by Aleksey Olegovich Dragomirov, who was born in 1980 and lives in Roslavl in the Smolensk Region, Russia. 35. On various dates between 2001 and 2008, including from 9 to 11 June 2008 (see below), the applicant was kept in a temporary detention centre. According to him, the cells had no toilet; he had had to relieve himself in a bucket; there was no running water available in the cells, and no access to shower facilities. 36. According to a written report by Officer S., at 2.45 p.m. on 9 June 2008 he arrested the applicant for being drunk and looking untidy in a public place, and took him to the police station where he then remained until he sobered up. It appears, however, that the applicant was actually arrested (apparently, by another officer) and then tested for alcohol intoxication around 6 p.m. and 10.45 p.m. respectively (see paragraph 38 below). On 10 June 2008 before a justice of the peace the applicant admitted that he had consumed vodka with a friend in the morning the day before but denied that he had appeared untidy at 2. 45 p.m. or had been drunk or otherwise behaving in a manner offending public morals or human dignity. On the same day, referring to S.’s report, a medical report (the contents of which are not clear) and an arrest record, the justice of the peace convicted the applicant of an administrative offence under Article 20.21 of the CAO on account of being drunk in a public place at 2.45 p.m. on 9 June 2008 while having an untidy appearance, thus offending human dignity and public morals. The justice of the peace sentenced him to five days of administrative detention. 37. The applicant started to serve his sentence on 10 June 2008. 38. The applicant appealed. On 11 June 2008 the Bolsheukovskiy District Court quashed the conviction and discontinued the case for lack of any evidence to confirm the facts as imputed to the applicant. The appeal court considered that there had been nothing to suggest that the applicant had had an untidy appearance which offended human dignity or public morals; around the same time the applicant had had an appointment at the prosecutor’s office and no complaint had been made concerning his appearance or any state of drunkenness. The appeal decision reads as follows: “The defendant was convicted of being drunk and looking untidy in a public place at 2.45 p.m. on 9 June 2008 ... [The applicant] stated that he had consumed vodka with a friend in the morning of 9 June 2008; had then attended a sauna, had put clean clothes, had had lunch and had then gone to attend a meeting in the district prosecutor’s office; he had not seen any police officer at 2.45 p.m. ... Mr Se. stated before the appeal court that he had had a meeting with [the applicant] at 3 p.m. While he could see that [the applicant] had consumed alcohol, he conducted himself, looked and spoke properly ... Officer S. stated that he had been told on 9 June 2008 of [the applicant] being drunk but he had actually not seen him at 2.45 p.m. and had actually not effected his arrest at that time ... The file contains a medical report compiled at 10.45 p.m. and the arrest record indicating that the defendant had been arrested at 6.05 p.m. There is no other evidence in the file. The trial court relied on S.’s report, the medical report and the arrest record. However, it has now been established that the defendant was examined and arrested much later than at 2.45 p.m. on 9 June 2008 ... S.’s presentation of facts is not truthful and contradicts his earlier report. Shortly after that time the defendant was at the district prosecutor’s office and testified before an investigator [Se.]. His appearance and conduct did not offend human dignity and public morals ... So it has not been established that the defendant committed any offence under Article 20.21 of the CAO ... The proceedings should be discontinued for lack of a corpus delicti ...” 39. The applicant was released on 11 June 2008. 40. The applicant brought civil proceedings, seeking compensation in the amount of RUB 100,000 (equivalent to EUR 2,000) in respect of nonpecuniary damage owing to the conditions of his detention and the unlawful penalty of administrative detention. By a judgment of 5 March 2014, the District Court awarded the applicant RUB 5,000 (EUR 100 according to the Bank of Russia rate on the relevant date) on the basis of the fact that the prosecution had been discontinued. On 4 June 2014 the Omsk Regional Court upheld that judgment. 41. This application was lodged on 24 October 2014 by Viktor Grigoryevich Torlopov, who was born in 1963 and lives in Syktyvkar, Komi Republic. The applicant was represented before the Court by Ms I. Buryukova, a lawyer practising in the Moscow Region. 42. Section 8 of the Public Events Act of 2004 banned public gatherings “in the immediate vicinity of court buildings”. Relying on that provision of the Act, in 2011 the Syktyvkar town administration decided to ban the holding of public events within a radius of 150 metres of any court, to be measured from the entrance to each court building in the town. 43. At 9 a.m. on 12 October 2011, as part of a series of solo demonstrations held in late 2011, the applicant placed himself within a fenced-off area around the building housing the prosecutor’s office. He was holding a poster that read “The prosecutor’s office should return Stefanovskaya Square to demonstrators!”. 44. After ten minutes the police ordered the applicant to stop the demonstration because it was being held in the vicinity of the Town Court building. He was handcuffed and, allegedly, physical force was used against him. He was then taken to the police station and subjected to the measure of administrative arrest. The relevant record reads as follows: “[The applicant] arrived at the police station at ‘11.25’ in connection with offences under: ‘Article 20.2, Article 19.3 of the CAO’ For (among the grounds listed in Article 27 of the CAO): for compiling a record of administrative offence ...” 45. The applicant was released at 8.30 p.m. He was later admitted to hospital. 46. By a judgment of 6 December 2011, a justice of the peace convicted the applicant under Article 20.2 of the CAO and sentenced him to a fine of RUB 500 (equivalent to EUR 12 at the time). On 14 March 2012 the Syktyvkar Town Court upheld the judgment. However, on 23 August 2013 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic set aside the above judgments and discontinued the case. The court considered that there had been no evidence that the place where the applicant had stood was assigned to the territory of the Town Court under the applicable laws and regulations. 47. The applicant brought civil proceedings for compensation on account of the unlawful deprivation of his liberty on 12 October 2011. By a judgment of 12 February 2014, the Town Court dismissed his claim. On 24 April 2014 the Supreme Court of the Komi Republic upheld that judgment. The court observed as follows: (a) Having regard to Articles 5, 10 and 11 of the Convention and the ruling of the Plenary Supreme Court of Russia dated 27 June 2013 (concerning the application of the Convention by courts of general jurisdiction), the police’s action in taking the applicant to the police station had been proportionate and had pursued a legitimate aim; it had been of short duration, and had not involved any recourse to physical force. (b) The measure of taking the applicant to the police station had been aimed at ensuring prosecution for an administrative offence, including the drawing up of an arrest record. 48. This application was lodged on 30 September 2015 by Kirill Valentinovich Svetlov, who was born in 1990 and lives in Cherepovets in the Vologodsk Region. 49. On 4 September 2015 the applicant’s car was stopped by the police. The applicant was accused of an administrative offence under Article 12.7 of the CAO because he had no valid driving licence. The applicant was taken to the police station where he went through the procedure of being placed under administrative arrest. His mobile telephone was seized. 50. According to the applicant, he was not informed of his procedural rights, including the right to remain silent, when he was pulled up by the police, or at the police station. 51. On 6 September 2015 (a Sunday) the applicant was taken before a justice of the peace. At the hearing, the applicant asked for a lawyer. The judge adjourned the hearing for thirty minutes to allow the applicant to contact a lawyer. According to the applicant, during the break in the hearing, a guard took him to a metal cage where defendants were kept; the applicant had no access to a telephone. According to the Government, the applicant was not kept in a metal cage but in a room measuring some twelve square metres. 52. According to the Government, after the adjournment the applicant waived his right to legal assistance and opted to defend himself. The applicant submitted that he had not made any such statement. 53. The justice of the peace convicted the applicant of the offence and sentenced him to five days of administrative detention, to be counted from 4 September 2015. The justice of the peace stated that the applicant’s guilt was confirmed by, inter alia, the record of administrative offence compiled by the police as well as by the applicant’s guilty plea. The justice of the peace had dismissed as unsubstantiated his argument that as a military officer, he could not be sentenced to administrative detention. 54. The applicant began his sentence the same day. 55. On 8 September 2015 the applicant appealed. In his statement of appeal he mentioned that he had had difficulties with legal assistance since no law firms would be open on a Sunday. He was released on 9 September 2015. 56. On 18 September 2015 the Cherepovets Town Court examined the applicant and upheld the judgment against him. It stated, inter alia, that the justice of the peace had not been provided with any proof that the applicant was a military officer. It is unclear whether the applicant adduced the relevant evidence in the appeal proceedings. 57. The applicant also lodged a constitutional complaint. By decision no. 2732-O of 19 November 2015, the Constitutional Court held that the immediate execution of the sentence of administrative detention had not contravened the Constitution (see “Relevant domestic law and practice”, paragraph 79 below). 58. On 26 November 2015 the Vologda Regional Court dismissed an application by the applicant for review of the court decisions of 6 and 18 September 2015. 59. On 1 April 2016 the Supreme Court of Russia dismissed a further application for review lodged by the applicant.","['13', '3', '5', 'P7']","['5-1', '5-5', 'P7-2']","['5-1-a', '5-1-c']","['5', '6']","['5-5', '6-2']",[],1

Azerbaijan (no. 2204/11, §§ 6-20, 22 October 2015). 6. The applicants stood as candidates in the parliamentary elections of 7 November 2010 and applied for registration as candidates in various single–mandate electoral constituencies (see Appendix). 7. The respective Constituency Electoral Commissions (“ConECs”) on various dates (see Appendix) refused the applicants’ requests for registration as a candidate after the ConEC working groups had found that some of the supporting voter signatures submitted by the applicants were invalid and that the remaining valid signatures had numbered fewer than 450, a minimum required by law. Signatures were found to be invalid on several grounds in each case. 8. None of the applicants, except the applicant in application no. 30750/11, were invited to the ConEC meetings where decisions to refuse their requests for registration were taken. In each case, despite the requirements of the law, all the relevant working group documents and the ConEC decision itself were made available to the applicants belatedly or never made available to them. 9. Each applicant lodged a complaint with the Central Electoral Commission (“the CEC”) against the ConEC decisions. The points raised in their complaints were similar to those made by the applicants in Tahirov (cited above, §§ 13-14) and Annagi Hajibeyli (cited above, §§ 11-12). 10. On various dates, the CEC also rejected the applicants’ complaints (see Appendix), after another examination of the signature sheets by members of its own working group, which had found in each case that large numbers of signatures were invalid and that the remaining valid signatures were below the minimum required by law. 11. None of the applicants were invited to attend the relevant CEC or working group meetings. Moreover, in each case, all the relevant CEC documents were only made available to the applicants after the CEC decision had been taken. 12. On various dates, each of the applicants lodged an appeal with the Baku Court of Appeal against the decisions of the electoral commissions. They reiterated the complaints they had made before the CEC concerning the ConEC decisions and procedures. They also raised a number of other points similar to those raised by the applicants in Tahirov (cited above, § 19) and Annagi Hajibeyli (cited above, § 17). 13. On various dates (see Appendix), the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed appeals by the applicants, finding that their arguments were irrelevant or unsubstantiated and that there were no grounds for quashing the decisions of the CEC. 14. The applicants lodged cassation appeals with the Supreme Court, reiterating their previous complaints and arguing that the Baku Court of Appeal had not carried out a fair examination of the cases and had delivered unreasoned judgments. 15. On various dates (see Appendix), the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants’ appeals as unsubstantiated, without examining their arguments in detail, and found no grounds to doubt the findings of the electoral commissions or of the Baku Court of Appeal. 16. In addition to the applicants in the present cases, at the material time Mr Intigam Aliyev, the applicants’ representative in applications nos. 2326/11, 8055/11 and 30750/11, was representing a total of twentyseven applicants in cases concerning the 2010 parliamentary elections and a number of applicants in other cases before the Court. 17. On 8 August 2014 criminal proceedings were instituted against Mr I. Aliyev, which are the subject of a separate application brought by him before the Court (application no. 68762/14). On 8 and 9 August 2014 the investigation authorities seized a large number of documents from Mr I. Aliyev’s office including all the case files relating to the pending proceedings before the Court, which were in Mr Aliyev’s possession and which concerned over 100 applications in total. The files relating to applications nos. 2326/11, 8055/11 and 30750/11 were also seized in their entirety. The facts relating to the seizure and the relevant proceedings are described in more detail in Annagi Hajibeyli (cited above, §§ 21-28). 18. On 25 October 2014 the investigation authorities returned a number of the case files concerning the applications lodged before the Court, including the file relating to applications nos. 2326/11, 8055/11 and30750/11, to Mr Aliyev’s lawyer.","['34', 'P1']",['P1-3'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were accredited journalists who were authorised to report from the national Parliament. On 24 December 2012 parliamentary proceedings were held on the Budget Act for 2013. The applicants, together with other journalists, were reporting from the Parliament gallery, which was situated above the plenary hall (“the chamber”) where members of parliament (MPs) were seated. The debate on the approval of the State budget attracted considerable public and media attention, owing to the conflict between opposition and ruling party MPs as to whether or not statutory procedure had been complied with. During the proceedings, opposition MPs approached the President of Parliament (“the Speaker”) and started creating noise by, inter alia, slapping his table. Soon thereafter, Parliament security officers entered the chamber. They pulled the Speaker out of the chamber and started forcibly removing the opposition MPs. At the same time, other security officers (four officers, according to the Government) entered the gallery and started removing the applicants and other journalists. The Government stated that the security officers had informed those in the gallery that they had to leave for security reasons. The applicants denied that the reasons for their removal had been explained to them. Whereas some journalists complied with those orders, the applicants refused to leave, as the situation in the chamber was escalating and they felt that the public had the right to be kept informed as to what was going on. However, the security officers forcibly removed the applicants from the gallery. 6. The Government submitted that according to official records (a copy of which was not provided) on that occasion the first applicant had forcibly removed the identification badge from one security officer and had injured him in his chest and leg. The applicants denied that they had injured any officer and submitted that no official document had been drawn up regarding the identity of the officer in question, the nature and severity of the injury or the alleged assailant. The Government further alleged that the applicants had been allowed to follow the events in the parliamentary chamber via a live broadcast in the Parliament’s press room and the adjacent hall. The applicants contested that there had been live stream while the ejection of the opposition MPs had been ongoing, given that the cameras had allegedly been turned against the walls. 7. At the same time, two opposing groups congregated in front of the Parliament building. According to the Government, several people were injured in those protests. No further information was provided. 8. In a letter of 26 December 2012 addressed to the media, the Speaker stated, inter alia: “Having regard to the announcements (најави) that the opposition would not allow the Budget Act to be adopted and that there would be protests and incidents, I requested, under section 43 of the Parliament Act, that the Parliament security service ensure proper work at the session. I would like to underline that the Parliament security service arranges and implements necessary measures to be taken ... having regard to the fact that the gallery is part of the plenary hall, the Parliament security service considered (донело оценка) that the gallery should be vacated in order to avoid an incident of a larger scale. As Speaker, I regret that such a measure regarding the journalists was taken ...” 9. On 26 December 2012 the Association of Journalists (represented by its president, the first applicant) sent a letter to the DCPS claiming that the forcible removal of the journalists had violated their rights under Article 10 of the Convention. In the letter, the journalists pushed for proceedings to be brought against those responsible for authorising and carrying out their removal from the gallery. 10. In a letter dated 6 January 2013, the DCPS informed the applicants that a group of MPs had surrounded the Speaker during the incident of 24 December 2012, and had attempted to physically confront him. They had also insulted and threatened him, whilst at the same time damaging technical equipment. Owing to the security risk, the Speaker had been removed to a place of safety. However, the disturbance in the chamber had continued. In the circumstances, the Speaker had requested, under section 43 of the Parliament Act (“the Act”, see paragraph 17 below), that the Parliament’s security service restore order so that the discussions could continue. Journalists had been asked to leave the gallery until order was restored. The letter further stated: “An MP who had been involved in the disturbance in the chamber and other people who could have disturbed the journalists in the performance of their tasks were in the gallery. In the meantime, there was information that the protests [in front of the Parliament building] could escalate and that police cordons could be violently broken. All that threatened the security in the Parliament. For these reasons, the journalists were asked to leave the gallery and to continue following the events from the press room, at a designated area. Most of the journalists understood the seriousness of the situation and complied with that request. A smaller group of people in the gallery, including [the applicants], confronted the security officers, disregarded their orders and resisted actively and passively. As a result, a [security] officer sustained an injury to his leg.” 11. The DCPS concluded that the law enforcement powers employed had not gone beyond the limit of what was acceptable, and that excessive force had not been used. 12. On 14 June 2013 the President of the State set up an ad hoc commission of inquiry regarding the events in the national Parliament of 24 December 2012. It was composed of five national members, two of whom were MPs. It further included two non-national observers appointed by the European Union. On 26 August 2013 the commission drew up a report, the relevant part of which reads as follows: ... 5. The absence of appropriate guidelines on dealing with such situations, including the absence of a strategy to deal with media in crisis, led to a situation in which journalists were removed from the Parliament gallery, which violated their rights to freedom of public information (слобода на јавно информирање) and publicity in the work of Parliament. Parliament should be particularly attentive and open with respect to the freedom of the press to report and to apply the best European practices in this matter ...” 13. The applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court in which they alleged a violation of their rights under Article 10 of the Convention. They submitted that the parliamentary debate and the related events regarding the approval of the State budget had been of particular public interest. The intervention of the Parliament security officers and the removal of the applicants from the gallery had been neither “lawful” nor “necessary in a democratic society”. With regard to the lawfulness of the measures taken, the applicants argued that section 43 of the Act could not be interpreted as allowing the forcible removal of journalists from the gallery by Parliament security officers. In any event, that provision had not been sufficiently foreseeable. As to the necessity of the measures, they argued that at the critical time, they had been in the gallery and had had no contact with the Speaker or MPs. Accordingly, they had not and could not have contributed to the disturbance in the chamber. Furthermore, they contested the DCPS’s arguments that there had been unauthorised people in the gallery and that the protests in front of the Parliament building had justified their forcible removal (see paragraph 10 above). They urged the court to hold a public hearing (јавна расправа) in accordance with Article 55 of the Rules of the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 24 below) and to find a violation of Article 16 of the Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) and Article 10 of the Convention. 14. At a hearing held on 16 April 2014 in the absence of the parties, the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicants’ complaint. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows: “On the basis of evidence submitted with the constitutional complaint and the reply of the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia, the court has established the following facts: ... There was an increased interest on the part of the public and the media in (the parliamentary proceedings) given the importance of the State budget and the fact that before the proceedings, namely in November and December, there had been long, intense and sometimes tense discussions between opposition and ruling party MPs regarding the draft Budget ... On 24 December 2012 ... before the plenary debate of Parliament started, there was a disturbance by a group of MPs who started destroying technical equipment in the chamber. They prevented access to the podium, surrounded the Speaker, preventing him from carrying out his duties, whilst at the same time insulting and threatening him. Due to the security risk, the Speaker was taken out of the chamber by security personnel. The disturbance in the chamber continued. Under section 43 of the Parliament Act, the Speaker ordered police officers responsible for parliamentary security to restore order in the chamber and enable the debate to start in an orderly manner. The security personnel considered it necessary to vacate the gallery, in order to ensure the safety of those in the gallery and in the chamber. All those in the gallery, including [the applicants], were asked to leave for security reasons and to follow the events from the press centre. Most of the journalists complied with that instruction. A smaller group of people, including [the applicants], confronted the security officers, disregarded their orders, and resisted actively and passively. As a result, a [security] officer sustained an injury to his leg. [The applicants] and other journalists, after having been removed from the gallery, remained in the Parliament building and were able to follow the live broadcast of the debate from other premises [the press centre, in a hall adjacent to the gallery]. At the same time, in front of the Parliament building, two opposing groups of people gathered. Several people were injured. The plenary debate of the Parliament of 24 December 2012 was public and it was entirely broadcast live on national television and streamed on the Parliament website. When the debate was over, the video material was made available to the public on that website ... ... The above provisions of the Parliament Act [see paragraph 17 below] and the Rules of Parliament [see paragraph 23 below] ... provide that the Speaker is responsible for maintaining order in the Parliament. In the event of disorder, he or she can take several measures (warning, denial of the right to speak, exclusion of MPs). Provisions regarding order during parliamentary proceedings concern all those participating in the session. The court considers that the removal of [the applicants] from the gallery amounted to an interference with their freedom to carry out their professional duties and to inform the public about events that were of considerable interest for the citizens of the Republic of Macedonia – the events in Parliament regarding the approval of the State budget for 2013, in which the public had significant interest in following and being informed about. ... The legal ground for the impugned measure was section 43 of the Parliament Act, which specified who was responsible for keeping order in the Parliament building – a special security unit, and which authorised the Speaker to decide and take measures in the event of disturbance of that order by MPs and other external persons participating in the work of Parliament. As to the necessity of the measure ... it has to be examined in the light of the the events that took place inside the Parliament building, namely in the chamber, as well as the disorder outside the Parliament building. The strained atmosphere in the chamber, which prevented a regular and normal start of the proceedings, has to be taken into account. In this connection it is to be noted ... that a larger group of MPs assaulted the Speaker, who was immediately removed from the chamber by security officers. There were a number of incidents, including damage to furniture, which culminated in objects being thrown in the chamber – some in the direction of the gallery. In such circumstances, the Parliament security service considered that in order to protect the journalists in the gallery, they should be moved to a safer place where they would not be in danger. Such an assessment should not be viewed as conflicting with the journalists’ right to attend parliamentary proceedings and report on events that they witnessed. In fact, the journalists – most of them on the same day – submitted and published their reports in the evening editions of their newspapers, which implies that there was no violation of their freedom of expression. The actions of the security officers constitute standard practice for these and similar situations in case of endangerment, i.e. protection of media representatives while reporting from places of crises, demonstrations and other potentially dangerous events ... The fact that the journalists had been present within and outside the Parliament building since the morning of 24 December 2012, and were reporting on the events as they occurred, confirms that, notwithstanding the indications and expectations that discussion about the approval of the Budget would be tense, they were allowed access to the Parliament building and the gallery in order to carry out their function and inform the public about the debate. Accordingly, there was no preconceived idea to prevent the journalists from reporting on the debate. After they left the gallery, [the applicants] and other media representatives were allowed to remain in the parliamentary press centre ... from where they could have followed the live broadcast on the Parliament website and on the dedicated TV channel. ... The physical removal of journalists from the gallery required by the concrete escalation of chaos and disorder aimed to protect them and ensure order in the chamber, and not to restrict their freedom of expression or to prevent them from carrying out their function, i.e. to inform the public.” 15. In a dissenting opinion, Judge N.G.D. of the Constitutional Court stated, inter alia, the following: “... My dissenting opinion mainly concerns the inability objectively to decide the case ... I consider that the written information, facts and evidence available to the court were insufficient ... The decision [of the Constitutional Court] contains contradictory reasons given that it ... establishes that the removal of journalists amounted to an interference with their right to carry out their function and to inform the public about an event of indisputable public interest, but it finds that such an intervention was justified ... without there being a solid factual basis in support of that finding. ... I think that it is of crucial importance that the Constitutional Court clarifies and explains the reasonableness of the assessment of the situation and the reason for which the journalists were removed from the gallery ... In order to establish the facts and assess the need for [their] removal ... it was necessary to determine the reason which prompted the security officers to remove them, despite the undisputed fact that all the incidents and disorder in the Parliament chamber were physically and clearly isolated and distant from [the gallery]. It is absurd that [such a removal] was carried out ‘for the safety of journalists’, when it is clear that they were in their seats and were completely passive; they did not participate in the events at all, but only observed ... It is a fact that the journalists did not contribute to the conflictual situation in any respect [not disputed by Parliament]; they did not disturb order in the Parliament building; they were in direct contact neither with the Speaker or the MPs, nor with the events outside the Parliament building ... Besides, it is clear that the journalists themselves did not feel threatened; so they did not seek and expect any protection.”","['10', '6']","['10-1', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1980 and is detained in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. 5. According to the applicant’s submissions, he left Kazakhstan in 2008 and lived in Saudi Arabia and Syria as a student until June 2011. He did not wish to return to his country as a number of people had been detained on charges of religious extremism in Kazakhstan and some of his friends had left the country after coming under pressure from the Kazakhstan government because of their political and religious identity. 6. In June 2011 the applicant arrived in Turkey. The Government submitted that subsequent to his arrival in Turkey, two entry bans were issued against him on the grounds that he was suspected of having provided logistical support to foreign nationals who were engaged in international terrorism. 7. On an unspecified date the applicant was taken into police custody and thereafter transferred to the Kumkapı Foreigners’ Removal Centre with a view to his removal to Kazakhstan. As the applicant applied for asylum while in detention, on 28 October 2011 he was released pending the determination of his asylum application. On the same day he was notified that he should go and reside in Denizli province. 8. On 4 November 2011 the applicant lodged his asylum application again – this time with the Denizli Governor’s Office. On the same day a police officer from Denizli Security Headquarters held a preliminary interview with the applicant. The applicant stated that he had learned that he was being sought for by the Kazakhstan authorities on terrorism charges and asked to be granted leave to stay in Turkey. He submitted that his removal to Kazakhstan would expose him to a risk of death. According to a report dated 22 November 2011 concerning the applicant’s interview of 4 November 2011, the interpreter who was appointed by the police authorities noted that the applicant spoke Turkish. 9. On 28 November 2011 the applicant was notified that his asylum application had been rejected. According to the report of 22 November 2011, the police officer who had interviewed the applicant found that the latter had failed to submit any concrete evidence concerning his nationality, identity and the problems he had experienced in Kazakhstan. The officer, however, found it established that the applicant feared to be returned to his country and that it was known to the Turkish authorities that he would be prosecuted if returned to Kazakhstan. 10. On 29 November 2011 the applicant objected to the rejection of his asylum application. He once again submitted that he would be exposed to a real risk of death if he were to be removed to Kazakhstan. 11. According to the Government’s submissions, on 26 December 2011 his objection was dismissed. 12. On 12 January 2012 the applicant lodged an application to be allowed to leave Turkey with the Denizli Security Headquarters and informed the police that he had been offered a visa to enter and live in Egypt. 13. On 18 January 2012 the police authorised the applicant to leave the country. 14. According to a document dated 6 January 2012 sent by the Deputy Director of the General Police Headquarters to a number of police authorities, during a meeting held on 4 January 2012 the ambassador of Kazakhstan in Ankara requested the Turkish Interior Minister to extradite Kazakhstan nationals who had been involved in terrorist acts and in respect of whom Kazakhstan had issued wanted notices (“Red Notices”) via Interpol. A formal extradition request in respect of such persons was submitted by the Kazakhstan embassy in Ankara to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 31 December 2011. According to the document prepared by the embassy, the applicant and four other persons were members of the “Islamic Jihad Union”, a terrorist organisation which carried out terrorist attacks in the western region of Kazakhstan. They had been detained by the Turkish authorities upon receipt of a Red Notice via Interpol by Kazakhstan. The embassy pointed out that subsequent to their asylum claims, four of those persons, including the applicant, had been released from detention in Turkey. The Kazakhstan authorities considered that these five persons had been in the process of preparing a new terrorist attack in their country and that following their release four of them had organised a terrorist attack in the Atyrau province of Kazakhstan, in co-operation with another terrorist organisation, Jund al-Khilafa (“Soldiers of the Caliphate”). The embassy accordingly requested the Turkish authorities not to grant asylum to them and to extradite them to Kazakhstan. 15. On 19 January 2012, while he was waiting at Istanbul Atatürk Airport to board a flight to Egypt, the applicant was taken into police custody on the basis of the extradition request submitted to the Turkish authorities by the Kazakhstan embassy. 16. On 23 January 2012 the Interpol-Europol department attached to the General Police Headquarters informed the Ministry of Justice and a number of security departments that a Red Notice had been issued by Kazakhstan via Interpol in respect of the applicant on the basis of terrorism-related offences. 17. On 24 January 2012 the Bakırköy Magistrates Court ordered the applicant’s detention within the context of the extradition proceedings for a period of forty days. The applicant was then placed in detention in Maltepe Prison, in Istanbul. 18. On 25 January 2012 the applicant lodged a petition with the Bakırköy Assize Court and challenged his detention. In his petition, he stated, inter alia, that a person who would be subjected to torture or other forms of ill-treatment in his country of origin should not be extradited to that country. 19. On 27 January 2012 the Bakırköy Assize Court dismissed the applicant’s petition challenging his detention. 20. On 28 February 2012 the Bakırköy Assize Court rejected the extradition request submitted by the Kazakhstan authorities. During the hearing held on the same day the assize court did not find it necessary to appoint an interpreter for the applicant as he spoke Turkish. According to the reasoning contained in the court’s decision, in his defence submissions the applicant had contended that he had been wrongly accused of being a member of alQaeda or Islamic Jihad and had asked the court not to extradite him to Kazakhstan. The Bakırköy Assize Court held that the applicant could not be extradited to Kazakhstan because the charge against him in Kazakhstan fell within the scope of one of the offence categories, precluding extradition, listed in Article 18 § 1 (b) of the Criminal Code, as in force at the material time (see paragraph 30 below). The court also ordered the applicant’s release from detention. The decision of 28 February 2012 became final as no appeal was lodged against it. 21. On 28 February 2012 the applicant was released from prison but was immediately transferred to the Kumkapı Foreigners’ Removal Centre in Istanbul. According to a document dated 29 February 2012, the applicant was informed that he was being held pending the outcome of the deportation procedure conducted in this respect. 22. On 7 March 2012 the Deputy Director of General Security ordered the Istanbul Police Headquarters to deport the applicant. 23. On 12 March 2012, while in detention, the applicant appointed his representatives to undertake the necessary legal and procedural actions on his behalf before the domestic authorities and the Court by way of a issuing a power of attorney before a notary public. 24. According to the applicant’s submissions, on 21 March 2012, when Mr Yılmaz, one of his representatives, went to the Kumkapı Foreigners’ Removal Centre to meet him, he was orally informed by officers at the centre that the applicant had been deported to Kazakhstan on 12 March 2012. 25. Upon a request by the applicant’s lawyer, on 31 May 2012 the Istanbul Police Headquarters sent a letter to the applicant’s lawyer informing him that the applicant had been deported to Kazakhstan on 12 March 2012. 26. In a letter dated 10 May 2014, Mr Yılmaz submitted that the applicant had been remanded in custody and placed in Atyrau Prison upon his return to Kazakhstan. The lawyer stated that he did not have information as to whether the applicant had been subjected to ill-treatment in Kazakhstan given that the applicant’s family members had refrained from answering his questions regarding that matter during their telephone conversations with him. 27. Between 28 February and 12 March 2012 the applicant was detained at the Kumkapı Foreigners’ Removal Centre. The applicant claimed that the centre had been overcrowded at the time of his detention. He had not been allowed exercise outdoors or any other type of social activity throughout his detention. The applicant further alleged that there had been hygiene problems at the centre and that the quantity of the food provided had also been poor. 28. The Government submitted that the Kumkapı Foreigners’ Removal Centre, where the applicant had been held, had a capacity of 300 persons and that a total of between 100 and 140 persons had been held during the period between 28 February and 12 March 2012. Detainees were accommodated on three floors: the first two floors were reserved for male detainees, and the third floor for females. There were four dormitory rooms on the first floor, respectively measuring 50, 58, 76 and 84 sq. m. On the second floor there were five dormitories measuring 50, 58, 69, 76 and 84 sq. m. There was a total of 120 bunk beds in the ten rooms reserved for male detainees and all rooms received natural light. There were also five showers and six toilets per floor, as well as a cafeteria measuring 69 sq. m, where breakfast, lunch and dinner were served daily on each floor. The detainees had the right to outdoor exercise if the physical conditions and the number of staff available allowed. A doctor was present on the premises every week and the detainees also had access to medical care in cases of emergency. As for the hygiene in the facility, there were six cleaning staff working full time.","['13', '3', '5']","['5-1', '5-4', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1

LATVIA,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time),George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. The applicant was born in 1965 and lives in Riga. 6. The applicant had been living with A.Z. since the summer of 2005. They were not married. In the course of that year, A.Z. became pregnant. After the birth of A.E.Z. on 24 May 2006, the applicant continued to care for the child and to support A.Z. and the child financially, including paying the rent and utility bills for the apartment in which they were residing. 7. On an unspecified date the applicant suggested to A.Z. that they officially register the birth of A.E.Z. and record the applicant’s paternity in the register of births. A.Z. refused. 8. The applicant informed A.Z. that he would try to have his paternity established by the courts. 9. Starting from 13 January 2007 A.Z. no longer permitted the applicant to meet the child. 10. On 15 January 2007 the applicant consulted a lawyer and on the same day requested a copy of a report of the registration of the child’s birth (izziņa par bērna dzimšanas reģistrāciju) from a civil registry office (dzimtsarakstu nodaļa). He received the requested report on 18 January 2007 and found out that the previous day, on 17 January 2007, a certain A.L. had voluntarily acknowledged his paternity and had been registered as the child’s father. According to the applicant, he did not know who A.L. was. 11. On 8 February 2007 the applicant lodged a claim with the Riga City Zemgale District Court. He asked the court to order forensic biological testing in order to establish the child’s descent, to strike the record of A.L.as the father of the child and to record himself, the applicant, as the child’s father instead. 12. On 4 April 2007 A.Z. and A.L. submitted a response, arguing that the fact that civil proceedings had been instituted had infringed their rights guaranteed by, inter alia, Article 8 of the Convention. The respondents also argued that the applicant lacked standing to contest paternity and denied that he had ever co-habited with A.Z. 13. The Zemgale District Court held hearings on 28 June, 31 August and 12 September 2007. On 13 September 2007 it decided to discontinue the proceedings. The court agreed with the respondents that the applicant lacked standing to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. It reached that conclusion by interpreting the Civil Law in conjunction with the Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock (“the Legal Status Convention”) and the 11 October 2004 judgment of the Latvian Constitutional Court, and found that the restrictions in section 156 of the Civil Law (see paragraph 53 below) were not contrary to the Legal Status Convention. 14. The applicant appealed on 24 September 2007. On 27 September 2007 the case was forwarded to the Riga Regional Court, which held hearings on 17 January and 22 September 2008, and quashed the lower court’s decision by a decision adopted on the latter date. It was found that the lower court had erred in not ordering forensic biological testing. The case was remitted to the Zemgale District Court. 15. The first hearing in the Zemgale District Court was held on 12 November 2008 and was attended only by the applicant’s lawyer. The hearing was adjourned. The verbatim record of the hearing shows that the court decided to invite a representative of the Guardianship Tribunal (bāriņtiesa) to attend the following hearing. 16. According to the applicant’s lawyer, the question of involving the Guardianship Tribunal had not in fact been discussed in court and therefore she requested the removal of the judge in charge of the case. 17. On 26 November 2008 the judge withdrew from the case. The proceedings were accordingly adjourned. 18. The next hearing was held on 26 January 2009 and was attended by the applicant’s lawyer, the two respondents and their lawyer, as well as by a representative of the Guardianship Tribunal. 19. On 4 February 2009 the Zemgale District Court ordered forensic genetic testing and ordered the applicant, A.Z., A.L. and the child to submit the necessary samples of genetic material before 31 March 2009. 20. On 1 April 2009 the court was informed that the applicant had submitted a tissue sample on 6 February 2009, while A.Z., A.L. and the child had not appeared at the testing laboratory. 21. On 8 April 2009 the applicant asked the court to order that the respondents and the child be delivered for genetic testing under constraint. The hearing organised on 26 May 2009 to decide that question was adjourned because the respondents and their lawyer had not appeared in court. 22. In the course of the hearing of 15 June 2009 the court rejected the applicant’s request on the grounds that the child was not a party to the case and therefore his delivery under constraint could not be ordered. No ordinary appeal lay against that decision. The applicant’s representative requested that the proceedings be adjourned so that an extraordinary complaint could be lodged with the Prosecutor General. 23. On 26 June 2009 the applicant asked the Prosecutor General to lodge an extraordinary complaint (protests) about the decision of the Zemgale District Court. On 16 July 2009 the Prosecutor General granted the applicant’s request and asked the Senate of the Supreme Court to quash the 15 June 2009 decision. On 28 August 2009 the Senate accepted the Prosecutor General’s complaint for examination. 24. On 13 January 2010 the Senate decided to uphold the Prosecutor General’s complaint, to quash the Zemgale District Court’s decision and to remit the case to another judge of the same court. 25. After adjourning the hearing of 15 March 2010 owing to the respondents’ failure to appear in court, on 16 March 2010 the Zemgale District Court decided to grant the applicant’s request and to order the municipal police to deliver the respondents and the child for genetic testing under constraint. The court also fined A.L. and A.Z. 50 Latvian lati (LVL) each for failing to appear at the hearing without a justified reason. 26. On 10 May 2010 the applicant informed the court that the decision of 16 March did not appear to have been sent to the municipal police. 27. That omission was admitted by the court in a decision of 14 May 2010, by which the court decided to order the State police to deliver the respondents and the child for testing under constraint. 28. On 22 June 2010 the director of the testing laboratory informed the Zemgale District Court that a tissue sample had been taken from A.L. on 18 June 2010 but that A.Z. and the child had not appeared at the laboratory for testing. 29. According to a letter sent by the police to the court on 17 June 2010, on several occasions police officers had not found A.Z. and the child at their stated address and a neighbour had informed the police that a woman with a small child was not residing there. 30. On 5 July 2010 the applicant asked the Zemgale District Court to order a search (izsludināt meklēšanā) for A.Z. and the child. 31. On 15 July 2010 the Zemgale District Court examined the applicant’s request on the merits. The respondents were absent. The court fined A.L. and A.Z. LVL 50 each for failing to appear at the hearing without a justified reason. 32. By a decision of 20 July 2010 the court granted the applicant’s request. 33. On 8 October 2010 a genetic sample was taken from the child at the testing laboratory. 34. On 13 October 2010 the testing laboratory issued a report, finding that the probability that the applicant was the father of A.E.Z. was 99.9999141 % and that it was impossible that A.L. was the father. 35. The next hearing of the Zemgale District Court was held on 11 November 2010. 36. On 25 November 2010 the Zemgale District Court adopted a judgment by which it rejected the applicant’s claim. The court held that, even though the applicant was the child’s biological father, the Civil Law did not give him the right to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity. 37. The applicant appealed on 15 December 2010. On 17 January 2011 the Riga Regional Court instituted appeal proceedings. The Regional Court held a hearing on 16 May 2011. 38. On 26 May 2011 the Regional Court decided to uphold the impugned judgment. In response to the applicant’s complaint that the overall length of the proceedings was excessive within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, the appeal court noted that such questions were outside its competence. 39. On 11 July 2011 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law, complaining, inter alia, that the time taken by the first-instance court to examine his claim had been excessive. 40. On 26 October 2011 the applicant asked the Senate of the Supreme Court to expedite the examination of the case, referring to Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and the urgent nature of cases relating to the interests of children. The Senate instituted cassation proceedings on 29 December 2011. 41. The Senate held the first hearing on 7 March 2012. On 21 March 2012 the Senate decided to examine the case in an extended composition (paplašinātā tiesas sastāvā) of seven judges instead of the usual three-judge composition. A final decision was adopted by the Senate on 16 May 2012. 42. The Senate disagreed with the lower-level courts’ interpretation of section 156 of the Civil Law. It held that that section could not be interpreted so as to deny a biological father the right to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity if the legal father had acknowledged paternity in the knowledge that he was not in fact the father of the child. On the other hand, having the standing to contest a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity did not mean that the claim should be automatically upheld, since the courts were obligated to balance the rights of the child and the rights of the biological father. 43. Turning to the facts of the specific case, the Senate noted that during the 16 May 2011 hearing of the appeal court, the representative of the Guardianship Tribunal had explained that the child was living in a “united family” (apvienotā ģimenē) and that upholding the applicant’s claim would be contrary to the child’s interests. The Senate found no reason to doubt the professional competence of the staff of the Guardianship Tribunal and agreed with its assessment of the interests of the child. 44. In conclusion, the Senate held that the appeal court had erred in deciding that the applicant lacked standing to contest the acknowledgment of paternity. However, “taking into account the unreasonable length of the proceedings”, the Senate, decided not to remit the case to the appeal court. The judgment of the appeal court was thus upheld. 45. The applicant submitted that after the decision became final, he learned of certain facts previously unknown to him. In particular, he found out that when the child was born and throughout the proceedings A.L. had been married to J.Z. and had five children in that marriage. In addition, from 2003 until March of 2012 A.L. had been living with yet another woman (D.B.) and several of his children from his marriage to J.Z. The applicant submitted to the Court a written statement from D.B. to that effect. 46. On 27 June 2012 the applicant submitted a complaint about the actions of representatives of the Guardianship Tribunal to the Children’s Rights Inspectorate (Valsts bērnu tiesību aizsardzības inspekcija). Among other things, he complained that the Guardianship Tribunal had come to the unsubstantiated conclusion that A.L. was living with A.Z. and the child, whereas in fact he had been living with another woman in a different town. 47. On 23 July 2012 the Inspectorate replied to the applicant, informing him that the Guardianship Tribunal was responsible for omissions (pieļāvusi trūkumus), which could have had a negative effect on the performance of its duty to protect the rights and legal interests of children. 48. On 2 October 2012 the applicant submitted the present application to the Court. 49. On 23 November 2012 the applicant requested that the Supreme Court reopen the proceedings in the light of the newly discovered circumstances, namely, the information set out in paragraph 45 above. 50. On 14 January 2013 the present application was communicated to the respondent Government. 51. On 5 March 2013 the Supreme Court examined the applicant’s request to reopen the proceedings and rejected it, finding that the circumstances invoked by the applicant could not be considered as “newly discovered” within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Law. 52. The applicant submitted an ancillary complaint and on 12 June 2013 the Senate of the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Supreme Court, examined the applicant’s request on the merits and upheld it, quashing the decision of the Riga Regional Court of 26 May 2011 (see paragraph 38 above). The case was sent for fresh examination to the Riga City Zemgale District Court, which held the first hearing on 3 October 2013. The court decided to invite the Guardianship Tribunal to submit a report concerning the family situation of the child. The proceedings have been adjourned until 13 February 2014.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1964, 1958, 1993, 1997, 1997, 2000, 1998, 1994, 1990 and 1989 respectively and live in Batman. 5. On 26 June 2005, the first two applicants’ son and the other applicants’ brother, A.O., aged fourteen at the time, went into Batman Stream to swim and subsequently drowned. 6. According to the applicants, the uncontrolled draining of sand from Batman Stream of Dicle River changed the stream’s ecological balance. Eventually, holes and vortexes which occurred as a result of uncontrolled sand drain allegedly contributed to A. O.’s drowning. 7. Criminal proceedings where initiated against the Beysan joint stock company (“the company”), which was conducting the sand mining business at the time of events, and the Batman Governor’s office which issued the necessary permits to run the sand mine. On 5 March 2005, the criminal proceedings before the Batman public prosecutor’s office concluded with a decision not to prosecute. On 12 March 2006, the first applicant appealed against the non-prosecution decision. However, on 19 March 2007 his appeal request was also rejected by the Batman Assize Court. 8. While the criminal proceedings were pending, the first applicant requested the determination of evidence from the Batman Magistrates’ Court into the incident which led to A.O.’s death. Two expert reports were issued following the scene investigation, conducted by the Batman Magistrates’ Court on 8 July 2005. According to the expert reports, it was stated that the uncontrolled sand draining from Batman Stream changed the natural flow of the water and caused artificial holes and vortexes which amounted to three meters in depth in some parts. Despite these dangers, there were no warning signs. 9. On 27 July 2005 the applicants being convinced that the failure of the authorities and the company to take necessary safety measures to protect A.O.’s right to life, applied to the civil court of first instance with a compensation request. They sought a total of 75,000 Turkish liras (TRY) (46,500 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation for both pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages. 10. The applicants also requested legal aid for the court fees. On 15 August 2005, the Batman Civil Court of First Instance ordered the Security Directorate in Batman to investigate the economical means of the applicants. According to the report submitted by the Security Directorate, it was revealed that the applicants were unemployed and lived on state benefits and help from their neighbours. Nevertheless, the trial court rejected the applicants’ legal aid request on the basis of Sıddık Onar, the father of the deceased’s, age and his ability to work. 11. On 1 December 2006 the trial court notified the applicants that they were required to pay a court fee of TRY 214.76 (approximately EUR 115) within ten days in order to continue the proceedings and that the proceedings would be discontinued if they failed to do so. 12. On 29 December 2006 the Batman Civil Court of First Instance decided to discontinue the proceedings as the applicants had not paid the court fees.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants are all Jehovah’s Witnesses, except for the ninth applicant, M. Kvergelidze. Their application to the Court is based on thirty cases of alleged violence and assault to which the applicants were subjected at different times. The applicants lodged approximately 160 complaints with the investigation authorities, including the General Prosecutor’s Office of Georgia (“the GPO”), with a view to criminal proceedings being brought against the perpetrators. The complaints failed to yield any concrete results. 6. At least four acts of religiously motivated violence were allegedly carried out with the direct participation of the police and other representatives of the authorities, while four other cases indicate their indirect involvement. Twelve of the thirty acts of alleged violence described in the application involved assaults on Jehovah’s Witnesses by the group of Orthodox believers run by Mr Basil Mkalavishvili (“Father Basil”), a priest defrocked by the Georgian Orthodox Church (see Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 71156/01, § 11, 3 May 2007). Although in all the cases the applicants complained to the investigation authorities, in only a few of the cases did they receive a written response. In at least fifteen of the cases, when the applicants challenged the inactivity and ignorance of the law enforcement authorities, the courts refused to hear their complaints. In the majority of the cases, the victims reported the original investigation authorities’ indifference and failure to act to the GPO, but the latter took no adequate action. In only three cases were the applicants able to take their complaints right up to the Supreme Court of Georgia, which then dismissed them. 7. The Public Defender of Georgia, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Amnesty International and national and international media repeatedly reported that Jehovah’s Witnesses had been the target of violence by private and Orthodox religious individuals, the majority of whom had been led by Father Basil, and that the relevant authorities had failed to prevent or stop it. 8. In support of the factual account set out below, the applicants produced the statements of more than 100 victims and witnesses of the alleged violence, photographs of police officers failing to take action while attacks were taking place, photographs of the injured applicants, as well as video recordings and photographs of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ meeting places that had been pillaged and ransacked. To illustrate the situation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Georgia at the material time, the applicants’ representatives also referred to the evidence submitted in two other applications made by Jehovah’s Witnesses before the Court (Members of the Gldani Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others, cited above, and Union of Jehovah’s Witnesses and Others v. Georgia, no. 72874/01, pending before the Court). The following account presents the facts as the applicants claim they occurred. 9. This part of the application concerns applicants K. Pirtskheliani, E. Pirtskheliani, G. Lemonjava, Z. Sartania, N. Pularia, D. Pachkoria, Z. Gogokhia, R. Tskhadaia, B. Tskhadaia, B. Kurashvili, N. Kantaria, L. Esebua, R. Karchava, D. Gulua, T. Biblaia, S. Kintsurashvili, K. Kutaladze, D. Samkharadze, L. Sabashvili and M. Berishvili (listed in the appendix as nos. 40-59). 10. On 23 August 2000, A.T., P.Ch., O.P, Z.G., D.Zh. and V.G., senior officials at the Zugdidi office of the Ministry of the Interior (Western Georgia) drew up a “plan for a protection operation to prevent the meeting of the religious movement of Jehovah’s Witnesses” in the village of Rokhi on 25 August 2000. The plan stated that “unofficial demonstrations against the meeting in question are likely to take place, requiring police intervention to prevent religious conflict.” The aims of the operation were defined as follows: to pick up individuals attending the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ meeting, to identify them for operational purposes, to gather information on the identified individuals by infiltrating their ranks; and to set up permanent and mobile checkpoints on the outskirts of the village of Rokhi, and on the roads around Rokhi and between neighbouring villages. 11. According to the applicants, the Rokhi religious convention was postponed by two weeks because of the on-going negotiations between the meeting organisers and local officials on the security measures to be put in place. 12. On 8 September 2000 a peaceful meeting of some 700 Jehovah’s Witnesses was taking place at the property of K. and E. Pirtskheliani (applicants nos. 40 and 41), when it was suddenly disrupted by the police. According to the applicants, the police opened fire inside their property. Masked police officers entered the house, turned it upside down and removed various items. Around fifty Jehovah’s Witnesses who were present were beaten, including applicants D. Gulua, M. Berishvili, K. Pirtskheliani and K. Kutaladze. E. Pirtskheliani, the aged co-owner of the house, was verbally assaulted and one of the attackers spat in her face. She was also made to watch her house being ransacked and plundered, and the stage set up in the courtyard set on fire. At the same time the police organised around seven buses to drive the participants of the religious meeting off from the scene. 13. Elsewhere, police checkpoints were set up on the main roads to impede a further 1,300 Witnesses – including the applicants B. Kurashvili, R. Tskhadaia and B. Tskhadaia – from reaching the meeting. According to applicant D. Samkharadze, he and L. Sabashvili were allegedly attacked and beaten on their way to the assembly, whilst N. Pularia, R. Karchava, Z. Gogokhia, Z. Sartania, S. Kintsurashvili, T. Biblaia, L. Esebua, and G. Lemonjava escaped physical aggression but were verbally assaulted and humiliated. 14. The applicants lodged complaints with the SamegreloZemo Svaneti regional prosecutor’s office in September 2000, and criminal proceedings were instituted under Article 178 § 3 (a) of the Criminal Code of Georgia (robbery) on 15 January 2001. The criminal file was sent to the investigation department of the Zugdidi office of the Ministry of the Interior and investigator B.Ch. was put in charge of the investigation. In FebruaryApril 2001 most of the applicants, along with other participants of the 8 September 2000 religious meeting, were questioned as witnesses; none of them was granted formal victim status. It appears that no other investigative measures were taken. 15. On 19 June 2001 the applicants were informed that the investigator had suspended the investigation on 15 April 2001 and that the regional prosecutor had upheld that decision on 20 April 2001. The reason stated was the failure of the investigation to establish the identity of the perpetrators. The applicants referred the matter to the regional prosecutor’s office, complaining that their statements, providing, among other things, the names of several police officers involved in the incident and the number plates of the vehicles used, had been disregarded. The investigator’s decision was set aside on 12 July 2001 and the case was referred back to the same investigator for further inquiries. However, the investigation was subsequently suspended again without the applicants being informed. They did not learn that their case had been closed until the respondent State submitted its observations to the Court in two other applications made by Jehovah’s Witnesses against Georgia on 31 December 2001. Consequently, on 17 January 2002, the applicants contacted the regional prosecutor to obtain a copy of the decision. They received no response. 16. This part of the application concerns applicants R. Tsartsidze, M. Gelashvili, R. Botchoidze, V. Gabunia, G. Sagaletovi, S. Bozoyani, Z. Martirosovi, Z. Baidoshvili, Sh. Simoniani and A. Gratiashvili (listed in the appendix as nos. 60-69). 17. According to the applicants, on 16 September 2000 a large number of Jehovah’s Witnesses departed for a meeting in Marneuli (Eastern Georgia). The police had set up checkpoints along the route, blocking the roads and preventing the Witnesses from arriving at their destination. Nineteen buses and several cars stopped by the police were obliged to turn back. Meanwhile, the police allowed a bus carrying Orthodox believers to continue to Marneuli. Upon arrival, the group of Orthodox believers burst into the property belonging to R. Tsartsidze (applicant no. 60) in which the meeting was to be held. They destroyed religious objects and removed items belonging to the owner of the property. The police officers present refused to intervene to protect the Jehovah’s Witnesses and at least some of them went as far as to beat members of the meeting. At least twenty-eight Witnesses were beaten and robbed during the attack. Property belonging to the Witnesses valued at several thousand US dollars was destroyed or stolen. In addition, according to an audit report submitted by the applicants, 1,500 kilograms of religious literature worth several thousand US dollars was burnt on that day. 18. R. Tsartsidze was assaulted and beaten by those who stormed his house, while Sh. Simoniani, G. Sagaletovi, Z. Martirosovi, R. Botchoidze and M. Gelashvili were stopped and beaten by a group of Orthodox believers on their way to the convention site. G. Sagaletovi submitted a medical certificate stating that he had sustained concussion as a result of the beatings. M. Gelashvili sustained bruises around his right eye and on his right knee. It appears that the next day he was further assaulted by two police officers on account of his participation in the events at hand. 19. S. Bozoyani was prevented by the roadblocks from travelling to Marneuli and thus escaped the attack unharmed, while V. Gabunia, Z. Baidoshvili and A. Gratiashvili did not submit any statements with regard to the treatment inflicted on them. 20. On 18 September 2000 the applicants filed a criminal complaint with the GPO. They received no information concerning the progress of their complaint. Therefore, on 24 December 2001, the applicants’ representative contacted the GPO requesting a copy of the decision taken with respect to the initial complaint. The GPO did not respond. On 25 March 2002, the applicants lodged a complaint against the authorities for their failure to reply. Their complaint was dismissed on 2 April 2002 by the Marneuli District Court on the ground that they could not file a complaint against a non-existent decision. 21. This part of the application concerns the applicants I. Papava, E. Baramia, M. Sakhokia, M. Chikovani, T. Todua and Z. Khargelia (listed in the appendix as nos. 34-39). 22. On 3 September 2000, several private individuals, including Z.O., K.T., and U.A., armed with guns and knives, burst into the home of I. Papava in Senaki (Western Georgia) where a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses was taking place. One of the assailants blocked the door, while the others proceeded to attack the applicants. A gun was pointed at the head of M. Sakhokia and he was punched in the face until his nose, which had been broken, began to bleed. T. Todua was cruelly beaten and a cigarette was stubbed out on his forehead. Z. Khargelia was punched in the face and stomach and threatened with a knife, and M. Chikovani jumped out of a window when one of the attackers took out his gun and pulled the trigger. She was taken to hospital by ambulance and placed in intensive care. I. Papava, the owner of the house, was not at home during the attack, but his wife, E. Baramia, was present and was also assaulted. 23. Along with their statements giving details of the incident, the applicants also provided the Court with a photograph of M. Chikovani, who, after jumping out of the window, sustained an injury to her back and was unable to walk for months, a photograph of M. Sakhokia with a broken nose, and a photograph of T. Todua with a cigarette burn on his forehead. 24. The police officers who arrived at the scene shortly after the incident insulted the victims and refused to record their complaints. On 22 September 2000, the applicants lodged a collective complaint with the city prosecutor. 25. On 15 October 2000, several of the applicants were summoned to give a statement. Their representative subsequently lodged a complaint in respect of the pressure and harassment to which the applicants had been subjected during questioning. He also denounced the investigators’ refusal to organise a medical examination of M. Chikovani and other victims of the attack. 26. On 22 February 2001, the applicants were notified of the decision of 20 December 2000 to take no further action in relation to their complaints. According to the decision, the investigating authorities had concluded that M. Sakhokia’s injuries had been self-inflicted, while M. Chikovani had jumped out of the window “of her own free will”. The decision also stated that the investigative authorities had established that one of the attackers had had a toy gun and had hence concluded that the meeting in question had not been violently disrupted. 27. Following an objection lodged by the applicants on 3 March 2001 with the regional prosecutor, the case was sent to the city prosecutor for further investigation. On 13 November 2001, the applicants went to the public prosecutor’s office to seek information on the progress of their case. They learnt that no further action would be taken and were denied a copy of the decision. On 26 November 2001, the applicants applied to the Senaki Court of First Instance but the judge refused to register their application. It was only following a complaint filed with the Chair of the Georgian Supreme Court that the Senaki court dealt with the applicants’ application on 4 January 2002 and quashed the decision of the public prosecutor’s office to take no action in their case. The case was sent back for additional investigation. Since then, the applicants have received no further news from the investigation authorities. 28. This part of the application concerns the applicants I. Geliashvili, E. Kakhelishvili, K. Javashvili, G. Poladashvili, L. Nozadze, T. Arabidze, B. Saralidze and S. Kvergelidze (listed in the appendix as nos. 26-33). 29. On 16 and 17 August 2000, a large group of Orthodox believers led by Father Basil burst into the courtroom of the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court of First Instance in Tbilisi, which was dealing with a criminal case against two Jehovah’s Witnesses. The group attacked the applicants, journalists and foreign observers present in the room. The court bailiffs guarding the courtroom did not move or intervene in the confrontation. The group of believers was equipped with big wooden crosses, which they used as weapons. They took control of the courtroom. The lawyer acting for the accused asked for the hearing to be adjourned, but the judge did not allow his request. The court imposed no penalties on the religious believers who had forcibly occupied the courtroom. The attack was filmed and broadcast on the Rustavi 2 and Kavkasia television channels. 30. Applicants E. Kakhelishvili, S. Kvergelidze, L. Nozadze and I. Geliashvili managed to escape the aggression unharmed, while K. Javashvili, G. Poladashvili, T. Arabidze and B. Saralidze, according to their statements, suffered verbal and physical abuse; they were all threatened with being beaten by the big crosses. 31. The applicants lodged various complaints. They were given no information as to the progress of their cases. On 3 July 2002 their lawyer asked for access to the file and discovered that criminal proceedings had been instituted on 17 August 2000 and that on that same day, an investigation unit had been set up. The case had since been assigned to three successive investigating officers. The first two had managed to secure an extension of the investigation period until 17 December 2000 and 17 February 2001 respectively. On 17 February 2001, the investigator responsible had decided to close the case on the grounds that it had been impossible “to identify the perpetrators of the attack”. The applicants pointed out that the video recording of the attack had been broadcast on television and that furthermore, many of the witnesses had recognised Father Basil’s religious group. 32. On 22 March 2001, the decision to take no further action was set aside and the file returned for further investigation. On 3 May 2002, the investigation period was extended to 20 September 2002. Following two years of investigation, none of the attackers was placed under investigation and no decision was served on the applicants and their lawyer. 33. This part of the application concerns the applicant G. Makharoblishvili (listed in the appendix as no. 16). On 29 January 2001, while walking along the road between the villages of Okami and Lamiskana (Eastern Georgia), the applicant was picked up by four private individuals, who were later identified as T.B., G.K., N.P., and J.B. They took him by car to the place of worship of Jehovah’s Witnesses living in Lamiskana. They threatened to kill him unless he crossed himself and went around the site carrying an icon. When the applicant refused, they dragged him into a forest and beat him. They stripped him and took his personal belongings, including religious literature, which they then set alight. They threatened to rape him if he did not do as they ordered. They placed the belt of his own trousers around his neck, dragged him by the hair and forced him to crawl to a sacred rock and kiss it. After an hour and a half, and having been warned not to mention the incident to anyone, the applicant was taken back to the attackers’ car. He was thrown out of the car outside the house of a villager. The villager took care of the applicant for two days until he was able to return home. 34. On 19 February 2002 the applicant reported the incident to the police. In support of his version of events he submitted, along with his detailed statement, a statement of the villager, who had taken care of him. When the attackers learnt that he had done so, they threatened him. The police contacted them and obtained a written undertaking that they would stop intimidating the applicant. The applicant was notified of the decision of 1 June 2001 not to open a criminal case two months later. On 28 August and 24 December 2001, his lawyer lodged an appeal with the regional prosecutor and the GPO respectively. He received no response. On 20 March 2002, the lawyer referred the matter to the Kaspi Court of First Instance. The court informed him verbally that the decision not to institute criminal proceedings would be set aside by the regional prosecutor and that the investigation would go ahead. On 2 April 2002, the regional prosecutor sent the matter for further investigation. Since that date, the applicant has received no further information as to the progress of his case. His lawyer’s requests for information have also been to no avail. 35. This part of the application concerns applicant S. Khojenashvili (listed in the appendix as no. 70). On 16 April 2001, the applicant was allegedly beaten up by V.A., in the Baghdadi region (Western Georgia) because he was a Jehovah’s Witness. The applicant went to the local hospital, which alerted the police. The medical certificate submitted by the applicant stated that he had sustained bruising on the back of his head and abrasions on his face, right cheek, forehead and the back of his left ear. 36. On 18 April 2001, the applicant filed a complaint with the Baghdadi police. He was pressurised on many occasions by the attacker and his family to withdraw his complaint. The police investigated, identified Mr V.A. as the attacker and forwarded the case file to the Baghdadi Court of First Instance. On 5 June 2001, before even questioning the applicant and the prosecution witnesses and after having questioned the defence witnesses, the trial judge decided not to institute criminal proceedings for lack of evidence of a crime. The applicant appealed to the Kutaisi Court of Appeal, which, by a decision of 8 October 2001, upheld the decision of the lower court. Both those courts established that V.A. had not beaten up the applicant while he had been touting his literature, but had merely pushed him to get away from him. The applicant had therefore been injured by falling. On 24 January 2002, the Supreme Court of Georgia dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. 37. This part of the application concerns applicant V. Dolidze (listed in the appendix as no.10). On 19 April 2000 the applicant, along with some thirty Jehovah’s Witnesses, was celebrating a religious feast in a private house in the city of Lanchkhuti (Western Georgia). Late in the evening some seventy persons approached the house and tried to interrupt the religious gathering. Several of them, who were apparently drunk, including L.Ch. and O.E., the latter being armed with a wooden stick, burst into the house and verbally assaulted the Witnesses; the applicant was physically assaulted by L.Ch. Police intervention was requested and the head of the city police, T.K., arrived but, according to the applicant, only to assist the attackers. He forced the applicant to go to a police station, where the latter was physically assaulted by T.K., insulted by other people, including an Orthodox priest, and threatened with further physical violence unless he stopped practising his religion in Lanchkhuti. He was detained at the police station for about three hours. 38. On 25 April 2000 the applicant lodged a complaint. By a decision of 15 May 2000 an investigator from the Lanchkhuti district prosecutor’s office discontinued the proceedings owing to the absence of evidence of a crime. He concluded, after having questioned several police officers, that there was no evidence substantiating the applicant’s allegation that T.K. had insulted him. The applicant was not informed of the above decision until 22 March 2001. He immediately appealed, complaining, inter alia, that his initial complaint had concerned not only the conduct of T.K. but also the violent dispersal of the Jehovah’s Witnesses meeting of 19 April 2000 and the physical and verbal assault on him that had ensued. On 22 April 2001 the refusal to institute criminal proceedings was upheld on appeal and no further investigation was ever conducted. The respective decision was served on the applicant only on 19 May 2002. 39. These parts of the application concern the applicants N. Sikharulidze, A. Aptsiauri and G. Gogia (listed in the appendix as nos. 7274, case no. 8); G. Markozashvili and L. Markozashvili (nos. 75 and 76, case no. 9); K. Vashakidze, N. Gabisonia, N. Gegia and M. Tchubabria (nos. 77-80, case no. 10); I. Bolotashvili, V. Gugulashvili, A. Toradze and M. Bekauri (nos. 82-85, case no. 11); A. Burjanadze and A. ElbakidzeJioeva (nos. 86 and 87, case no. 12); N. Butkhuzi (no. 88, case no. 13); and V. Begheluri and G. Todua (nos. 1 and 2, case no. 14) respectively. 40. On 16 January, 27 November, 19 and 26 December 2000, 8 June 2001, 19 and 26 December 2000, 11 November 2000 and 29 April 2001 respectively the applicants were subjected to various forms of aggressive behaviour because of their faith. A group of Father Basil’s followers in Tbilisi, a group of around thirty followers of Father Tsaava and Father Basilaia in Martvili, and other groups of laypersons followed the applicants in the streets or close to their homes; they insulted them; they attempted to break into their homes by forcing the doors, frightening children who had been left home alone (case no. 9); they tried to force one of the applicants to kiss the cross (applicant no. 80, criminal case no.10); and they seized their religious literature (case no. 14) and burned it (case no. 11). The homes of applicants A. Elbakidze-Jioeva and N. Butkhuzi at which the Jehovah’s Witnesses held their services were burgled and ransacked, and religious objects were stolen (cases nos. 12 and 13). 41. In certain cases, the police were present at the scene but did not intervene to protect the applicants (criminal cases nos. 9 and 10). 42. In all cases, the applicants lodged complaints, but apart from cases nos. 8 and 10, no response was ever received. The applicants contacted the Prosecutor General to obtain a written decision as regards their complaints but they never received a reply. In some cases the courts contacted the public prosecutor’s office themselves requesting written decisions, but received no response. 43. In criminal case no. 8, in reply to a complaint filed by applicants N. Sikharulidze, A. Aptsiauri and G. Gogia (nos. 72-74), the police informed them that they had issued a warning to Father Basil to stop attacking Jehovah’s Witnesses. The applicants requested several times a copy of the written decision not to institute criminal proceedings, but received no response. On 18 June 2002 the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court of First Instance refused to hear an objection lodged by the applicants on the grounds that they could not validly challenge a non-existent decision. The complaints filed by G. and L. Markozashvili (criminal case no. 9), I. Bolotashvili, V. Gugulashvili, A. Toradze and M. Bekauri (criminal case no. 11), N. Butkhuzi (criminal case no. 13) and V. Begheluri and G. Todua (criminal case no. 14) on 19 March 2002 had the same outcome; On various dates in March-June 2002 the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court of First Instance refused to examine the applicants’ complaints on the ground that they had failed to submit the decisions of the prosecutor’s office. 44. In criminal case no. 10, the applicants were notified of the prosecutor’s decision of 30 July 2001 to take no further action. This decision was set aside by the court authorities and the case was referred back for further investigation. Subsequently, on 8 May 2002 the Martvili prosecutor upheld the initial refusal to institute criminal proceedings. The prosecutor concluded, on the basis of various witness testimonies, that neither of the Jehovah’s Witnesses had been subjected to verbal or physical abuse during the alleged incident; they had been merely prevented by the local priests and population from attending a religious gathering of Jehovah’s Witnesses at the home of N. Gabisonia (applicant no. 78) in order to avert an escalation of religious conflict in the city. 45. In criminal case no. 12, following several written complaints which have been left unanswered, on 5 June 2002 the head of the local police informed the applicants in person that no investigation had been carried out because they had never received their written complaints. 46. This part of the application concerns the applicant Kh. Japiashvili (listed in the appendix as no. 89). On 6 May 2000, the applicant was travelling to the village of Shakasheti with various religious books belonging either to him or to the local congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses. He was stopped by police officer Z.D. and taken to Agara police station, where the books were confiscated. His attempts to object resulted in verbal abuse and he was released. The applicant returned to the police station some time later accompanied by two other Jehovah’s Witnesses, who were the other owners of the confiscated literature. On arrival, they noticed the charred remains of their books. On 8 May 2000, they lodged a complaint. 47. On 10 June 2002 the applicant was notified of a decision of 23 May 2000 not to open a criminal case for lack of evidence of a crime. 48. This part of the application concerns the applicants K. Gagua and A. Gegelia (nos. 90 and 91). On 30 June 2000, G.Ts., an Orthodox priest, accompanied by several police officers, including B.B., approached K. Gagua, who was sitting on a bus in the city of Martvili, and demanded that he show them his bag. On the instructions of the priest, the police officers confiscated the religious literature and personal documents found in the bag. The applicant filed a complaint at the police station. 49. On 16 July 2000, both applicants were walking through the central square in the village of Didi Chkhoni (Martvili municipality) when they were stopped by a group of fifteen men. The applicants were cruelly beaten because of their faith. The head of the local police, R.A. and two police officers, K.T. and N.A, were close by and witnessed the act of violence, but failed to intervene to protect the victims. On the contrary, they threatened to arrest the applicants. The applicants filed a complaint. In support of his complaint, A. Gegelia submitted a medical report which stated that he had sustained bruises around his left eye, on his forehead and on both thighs. 50. The applicants’ complaints were never followed up. On 24 December 2001, their lawyer contacted the GPO but received no reply. On 29 March 2002, the applicants took legal action in respect of the investigation authorities’ failure to act. On 10 April 2002, the Martvili Court of First Instance refused to hear the complaint on the ground that the applicants could not validly challenge a non-existent decision. On 22 April 2002, the applicants filed the same complaint with the same court. On 16 May 2002, that court responded that the case had been referred back to the prosecutor’s office for a written decision. In reply to their query of 19 August 2002, the responsible investigator informed the applicants that on 28 May 2002 a decision had been taken to close the case. He based his decision on the statements of the alleged perpetrators. He dismissed the medical evidence and concluded that no crimes had been committed. The decision also stated that the time-limit for initiating a private legal action had expired. 51. This part of the application concerns the applicant A. Mikirtumovi (listed in the appendix as no. 97), a Jehovah’s Witness pastor. On 21 September 2000 the applicant was visiting a congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Tetritskaro. Having been stopped in the street by unidentified individuals, he was taken to the police station where he was jeered at and insulted. The police threatened to arrest him if he were ever to be seen practising his religion in Tetritskaro again. The applicant was expelled from the town and the bus driver was ordered not to let him off the bus before the terminus in Tbilisi. 52. On 22 September 2000 the applicant lodged a complaint. He received an acknowledgment of receipt but no further information as to the progress of his case. On 24 December 2001, he contacted the GPO asking for a decision. No response followed. On 19 March 2002, the applicant referred the matter to the Tetritskaro Court of First Instance. On 5 June 2002, the first-instance judge informed him that the court’s attempts to obtain the file and the decision from the public prosecutor’s office had failed and that he was therefore unable to investigate his complaint. One month later, the court managed to obtain a copy of the prosecutor’s decision, which it forwarded to the applicant. It appeared from the 30 June 2001 decision that the prosecutor had decided not to initiate criminal proceedings. He concluded, on the basis of the statement of the two police officers involved in the incident, that the applicant had been taken to the police station for his own safety in order to prevent any conflict with the local population. The prosecutor also stated that there was no evidence to substantiate the applicant’s allegations of abuse. 53. The prosecutor’s refusal to institute criminal proceedings was upheld by the Tetritskaro Court and the Supreme Court of Georgia on 20 August and 10 October 2002 respectively. 54. This part of the application concerns the applicant Z. Kvaratskhelia (listed in the appendix as no. 98). On 15 August 2001, the applicant was stopped in a Tbilisi street by police officer N.M., who asked him what he had in his bag. The religious literature and the Bible in his bag were confiscated. The police officer and two passers-by insulted the applicant. On the following day, the applicant went to the police station to request the return of his books and Bible. In response to his request, officer N.M. threw a bag he was holding towards the applicant and kicked him out of the police station. 55. On 21 August 2001 the applicant filed a complaint but received no response. On 24 December 2001, his lawyer contacted the GPO but received no reply. The applicant referred the matter to the Vake-Saburtalo Court of First Instance in Tbilisi. At the hearing of 12 April 2002, the applicant obtained a copy of the decision of the public prosecutor’s office not to institute criminal proceedings dated 5 November 2001. The court set aside that decision and referred the case back to the public prosecutor’s office for further investigation. On 21 June 2002, the applicant’s lawyer tried unsuccessfully to obtain information on the progress of the file. 56. This part of the application concerns the applicants B. Gogoladze, A. Tvaradze and M. Kapanadze (nos. 13, 14 and 15). On 1 April 2001 the applicants were returning from a religious meeting. In the village of Dviri (Borjomi district, Western Georgia), they were attacked by a group of villagers accompanied by Mr S.Kh., and Mr J.B., administrative head of the county town of the district and administrative head of the village respectively. One of the attackers, a private individual, struck B. Gogoladze, who started bleeding and grabbed his bag containing a Bible and other religious literature. The same person then attacked the other two applicants, lashing them with the strap of the bag belonging to Gogoladze. The two administrative heads condoned the violence and insulted the applicants. They then ordered the villagers to stop and left the scene with them. 57. On 5 April 2001 the applicants filed a complaint. On 24 August 2001, they were notified of the decision to close the proceedings. On 6 September 2001, the applicants challenged that decision before the regional prosecutor, who dismissed their action on 1 October 2001. The applicants complained to the GPO on 28 November 2001, but no reply followed. 58. This part of the application concerns the applicants V. Begheluri, I. Janashvili, M. Makievi, Kh. Makieva, E. Tabaghua, E. Begheluri, J. Gogokhia, T. Kolbaia, L. Gelashvili and N. Maisuradze (listed in the appendix as nos. 1, 6 and 17-24). 59. On 28 July 2000 in Tbilisi, followers of Father Basil stopped a bus that was carrying Jehovah’s Witnesses to a religious meeting in Marneuli. They punctured the tyres, forced the applicants along with other Jehovah’s Witnesses out of the bus and assaulted them, verbally and physically. The men, including M. Makievi, E. Begheluri and V. Begheluri, were particularly severely beaten; N. Maisuradze was also personally targeted because she was video recording the attack. In particular, after forcefully getting of the bus, she was chased by two men who assaulted her and then took the camera away from her. They shortly returned to her a broken camera, but the video recording was missing. They also threatened her not to make any recordings in the future. 60. On 31 July 2000 forty-eight Jehovah’s Witnesses, including the applicants, filed a complaint. In August-September 2000 they in addition submitted individual statements detailing the violent incident. On 24 December 2001, their lawyer contacted the GPO asking for a decision to be taken. They received no response. On 19 March 2002, the applicants complained to the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court of First Instance in Tbilisi of the investigation authorities’ failure to take action, which had amounted to a rejection of their complaint. On 19 June 2002, the court informed the applicants that in the absence of any written decision, their complaint could not be examined. 61. On 15 September 2001 the applicant M. Gaprindashvili (listed in the appendix as no. 99) was walking along a street in the city of Kutaisi, when he was subjected to physical and verbal abuse because of his faith. Notably, he alleged that he had been beaten and insulted by a passer-by while he was distributing religious literature. Accompanied by his attacker, the applicant went to the police station where he was allegedly hit by a police officer, T.K., while other police officers thanked the attacker. In support of his allegations, the applicant submitted the statements of four eyewitnesses. 62. On 19 September 2001 the applicant lodged a complaint. On 12 October 2001, the Kutaisi prosecutor decided not to institute proceedings against the passer-by, identified as L.M., and police officer T.K. Noting that the applicant’s statement and those of the eyewitnesses supporting his version of the events were controversial, the prosecutor concluded that there was no evidence of a criminal offence committed by either of them. The applicant challenged that decision. After having questioned the parties concerned, the lower court dismissed the case on the ground that the applicant’s injuries had not been confirmed by a medical report. An appeal by the applicant to the Supreme Court of Georgia was dismissed on 18 June 2002. 63. This part of the application concerns the applicants M. Salukashvili, L. Kikalishvili, V. Burduli and I. Janashvili (listed in the appendix as nos. 36, case no. 22); L. Khitarishvili, N. Kobaidze and M. Kvergelidze (nos. 7-9, case no. 23); E. Gabelaia (no. 81, case no. 24); and S. Barsegyani, I. Dalakishvili-Barsegyani, and T. Arabyani (nos. 12, 92 and 93, case no. 25) respectively. 64. According to the applicants, because of their faith they were subjected to threats, verbal assault and theft of their religious literature and personal belongings while walking in the streets on 13 February 2000, 3 April 2000, 13 July 2000 and 20 June 2001 respectively. The attacks were carried out in different parts of the country. The perpetrators were followers of Father Basil or just laypersons hostile to Jehovah’s Witnesses. Most of them were identified by the victims. 65. The applicants in all the cases complained to the police. When filing the complaint, some of them were subjected to verbal abuse by police officers (case no. 22). In response to their complaints, some of the applicants were informed verbally that the police had already warned the attackers to stop abusing Jehovah’s Witnesses. Hence, when E. Gabelaia (case no. 24) complained to the police on 18 July 2000 that she had been repeatedly assaulted by S.G. and his friends, the police limited themselves to contacting S.G. and obtaining a written undertaking that he would stop intimidating the applicant. The latter was informed in this respect verbally by head of police on 20 July 2000. According to the case file, she took no further action in response. 66. The applicants in criminal cases nos. 22, 23 and 25 were not informed of any decision taken by the relevant national authorities in connection with their complaints. The applicants complained to the courts of the inaction of the investigation authorities, but the courts refused to deal with their cases in the absence of a written decision. The respective court decisions were delivered on 3 April (criminal case no. 25) and 18 June 2002 (criminal cases nos. 22-23). 67. This part of the application concerns the applicants V. Marikyani and S. Barsegyani (listed in the appendix as nos. 11 and 12, case no. 26), K. Korchilava (no.71, case no. 27), A. Turkia and T. Galdava (nos. 94 and 95, case no. 28), D. Margiani (no. 96, case no. 29) and G. Kokhreidze (case no. 30). According to the applicants, while walking in the street they were subjected to verbal and physical abuse because of their faith. They were beaten up and their personal belongings were stolen on 3 August and 24 September 2000, 20 June and 1 August 2001, and 19 April 2000 respectively. In support of their version of the events the applicants submitted detailed statements as well as medical evidence where available. 68. Applicants V. Marikyani and S. Barsegyani (criminal case no. 26), who were allegedly beaten by a group of fifteen supporters of Father Basil in a street during daylight hours in Tbilisi, had to seek medical assistance in a hospital. Two days after the attack they filed a criminal complaint with the GPO in which they provided a detailed account of the incident, indicated the number plates of the vehicles involved, and identified two of the alleged attackers by name. While being questioned as witnesses, the applicants were pressured by the police to withdraw their complaint. In a ruling of 9 January 2001 the Gldani-Nadzaladevi Court of First Instance concluded, having regard to the relevant case file, that the assault in question, as a result of which the applicants had sustained minor bodily injuries, had clearly had a religious motive and had been committed by followers of Father Basil. The judge noted, however, that it had been impossible to identify the alleged perpetrators and referred the case file back to the prosecution authorities. As it appears from the materials at hand, the applicants were informed in June 2002 that their case file was subsequently lost. 69. In case no. 27, the applicant was assaulted by a private individual, L.L. He filed a complaint with the local police the day after the attack. He also underwent a medical examination. He resubmitted his criminal complaint to the district prosecutor of Abasha one week later, together with the results of the medical examination. He received a reply on 5 October 2000 stating that criminal proceedings had been instituted. Since then, however, the applicant has not inquired about the progress of the investigation. 70. Applicant A. Turkia (criminal case no. 28) was assaulted by a layperson, M.J., in the city of Abasha on 20 June 2001. The incident was witnessed by applicant T. Galdava, who apparently escaped the attack unharmed. According to Mr Turkia’s statement, he suffered serious physical and verbal abuse and was also threatened with a knife. On 25 June 2001 he filed a complaint with the GPO. Mr Turkia claimed that it was not the first attack of this type involving M.J. On 9 July 2001 the deputy head of the Abasha regional police decided not to follow up the complaint. He concluded, on the basis of the alleged attacker’s statement as well as several eyewitnesses’ depositions, that M.J. had simply asked Mr Turkia to stop disseminating religious literature in the city and that Mr Turkia had suffered no physical injuries. The decision was upheld on appeal by a prosecutor on 23 July 2001. On 24 July 2002 the Abasha District Court judge set aside the prosecutor’s decision. He referred to the results of Mr Turkia’s medical examination, and to a photograph of him taken the day after the alleged incident. He concluded that there was evidence of an offence and remitted the case for further investigation. Applicant Turkia was not informed of the progress of the subsequent investigation. 71. In case no. 29 the applicant, who was verbally and physically assaulted by a group of private individuals, among them M.T. and G.C. residents of the village Narazini (Western Georgia), was informed by police that they had issued a warning to M.T. to stop attacking Jehovah’s Witnesses. A decision was taken not to initiate a criminal investigation. The applicant challenged the refusal. On 4 January 2002 the Zugdidi District Court remitted the case for further investigation. The trial judge concluded that no identification procedure had taken place and that the investigation had disregarded the accusations voiced with respect to G.C. On 23 January 2002 a Zugdidi prosecutor after having questioned the alleged attackers maintained the refusal to open a criminal case owing to the absence of elements of crime. 72. G. Kokhreidze (criminal case no. 30) was assaulted while hosting several Witnesses at a dinner in her home on 19 April 2000. She complained to police claiming that one of the assailants, U.S. had been systematically attacking her. Police informed her that they had warned U.S. and that no proceedings had been instituted. Subsequently, the applicant requested a copy of the written decision not to institute criminal proceedings, but received no response.","['14', '3', '9']",['9-1'],[],"['14', '3']",[],[],1

De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Otwock. 6. The applicant was arrested on 11 July 2000. 7. On 12 July 2000 the Jarosław District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded him in custody on suspicion that, together with two accomplices, he had attempted to extort money from J.G. and M.G. by depriving the alleged victims of their liberty and threatening to kill them. 8. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention on remand was extended by the Jarosław District Court on 9 October and 29 December 2000 and 3 April, 25 June, 18 September and 29 October 2001. Interlocutory appeals brought by the applicant against those decisions were rejected. The Jarosław District Court justified its decisions to impose and, later, to extend the preventive measure with reference to the strong evidence against the applicant, the severe punishment which was likely to be imposed if he was convicted and the risk that he would abscond or go into hiding if released. In the domestic court’s opinion, the latter risk was real in the light of the fact that in the past, the applicant had rarely lived at his permanent address. 9. On 13 December 2001 the Jarosław District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The period which he had already spent in detention, namely one year, five months and three days (from 11 July 2000 until 13 December 2001), was deducted from his sentence. 10. On 23 April 2002 the Krosno Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the first-instance court. 11. The applicant’s detention was continued by the Krosno Regional Court on 22 March 2002 and the Jarosław District Court on 4 June and 8 October 2002 and 9 January, 3 April, 7 July and 9 October 2003. At this stage of the proceedings the domestic courts referred to the original grounds for the applicant’s detention. They also noted that the trial was pending and that delays had occurred for reasons not attributable to the court. Interlocutory appeals against those decisions were rejected, as were requests for release lodged by the applicant and his lawyer. 12. On 7 November 2003 the Jarosław District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The time which he had already spent in detention, namely three years, three months and twenty seven days (from 11 July 2000 to 7 November 2003), was deducted from his sentence. 13. On 23 March 2004 the Krosno Regional Court upheld the firstinstance judgment in respect of the applicant. 14. On 9 December 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. 15. Throughout the entire proceedings the applicant was represented by two lawyers of his choice. 16. The applicant did not lodge any complaint about the length of these proceedings under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints of a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (Ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”) 17. On 10 November 2000 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court remanded the applicant in custody on the grounds that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and deprived the victims of their liberty. The court also considered that the measure was justified by the severity of the punishment which was likely to be imposed if he was convicted and the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. The applicant lodged an interlocutory appeal. On 29 November 2000 the Siedlce Regional Court upheld the detention order. 18. The applicant lodged several applications for release. He claimed that his mother suffered from a “back illness” and required his personal care. All those applications were dismissed, both at first instance and on appeal. 19. On 29 January 2001 the Siedlce Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy) lodged an indictment against the applicant and two co-accused, charging them with armed robbery and false imprisonment. At that stage the prosecutor ordered that nine witnesses be heard. 20. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention on remand was extended by the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court on 6 February, 11 April, 12 July and 15 October 2001, and on 10 January 2002. Three of these decisions were upheld by the Siedlce Regional Court on 1 March, 29 August and 7 November 2001 respectively. The domestic courts referred to the same grounds as previously, noting that prior to his arrest the applicant had not lived at his permanent address and that his whereabouts were unknown. It was also observed that the trial had still not begun because the applicant had challenged the judges who would be hearing his case. 21. On 14 June 2002 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court dismissed a request by the applicant for release. 22. Meanwhile, on 2 April 2002 the applicant’s case was severed from that of his coaccused, to be dealt with in a different trial. The first hearing was scheduled for 18 June 2002 but was ultimately adjourned. The subsequent hearing was likewise adjourned. 23. Subsequently, the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court further extended the applicant’s detention on 9 April and 12 July 2002. The earlier decision was upheld by the Siedlce Regional Court on 8 May 2002. The courts reiterated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention, also noting that there was a real risk that he would obstruct the proceedings if released in the light of the fact that many of his alleged accomplices were still at large. 24. On 30 July and 29 August 2002 the trial court held the first two hearings in the case and on 27 August 2002 it ordered that the applicant undergo psychiatric observation. 25. On 6 September 2002 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court extended the applicant’s detention on remand. This decision was upheld by the Siedlce Regional Court on 2 October 2002. Both courts referred to the original grounds, also noting that the applicant’s case had not yet reached the trial stage since proceedings against him before a different criminal court were pending at the time and there was a need to obtain an expert report which, in turn, required him to undergo psychiatric observation in a specialist institution. 26. On 22 October 2002 the Siedlce Regional Court rejected an application by the applicant to have his detention on remand replaced with a different preventive measure. 27. On the same date, as the period of the applicant’s detention on remand was approaching two years, the trial court lodged an application with an appellate court under Article 263 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego hereinafter, “the Code”), seeking to extend the preventive measure for another five months. 28. On 30 October 2002 the Lublin Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) declared that it lacked jurisdiction and transferred the applicant’s remand file to the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court. The appellate court referred to the uniform and well-established line of interpretation given to Article 263 of the Code by the Supreme Court. It reiterated that the statutory time-limit of two years for detention on remand was considered to run only in so far as a person had been effectively deprived of his or her liberty in the particular case in the framework of which the preventive measure had been applied (see paragraphs 73 and 74 below). The appellate court concluded that since the applicant had been deprived of his liberty, either on remand or after conviction, from 12 July 2000 onwards in the first criminal case, the term of his “effective detention on remand” in the second criminal case had not yet begun. 29. On 5 November 2002 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court once more extended the applicant’s detention. On 4 December 2002 the Siedlce Regional Court upheld that decision. Both courts held that the three original grounds for the applicant’s detention and the need for him to undergo psychiatric observation were sufficient to extend the preventive measure in question even though the proceedings had not yet reached the trial stage. In addition, the second-instance court addressed the arguments which had been raised in an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against the District Court’s decision. To that effect, the Regional Court reiterated the view of the Lublin Court of Appeal that the applicant’s detention on remand was not effective because he had been first deprived of his liberty within the framework of the first criminal case. It also considered that only the most severe preventive measure and not bail, as the applicant had suggested, could ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. 30. On 17 December 2002 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court stayed the proceedings pending the enforcement of the court’s decision of 27 August 2002 ordering the applicant to undergo psychiatric observation (see paragraph 24 above). On 5 February 2003 the Siedlce Regional Court dismissed an interlocutory appeal brought by him against this decision. It was observed that he could not at that stage be placed under psychiatric observation because his presence was necessary in the court before which his other criminal case was pending and because that court had not authorised the measure. 31. In the meantime, on 28 January 2003 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court once again extended the applicant’s detention on remand, referring to the risk that he might attempt to obstruct the proceedings if released. 32. On 27 February 2003 the Siedlce Regional Court quashed that decision and ordered the applicant’s release from custody. The court found that the grounds for his detention were no longer valid in the light of the fact that the proceedings had been stayed. 33. The Government submitted that on 3 March 2003 the applicant had actually been released to his home. He on the other hand maintained that he had remained in custody as he had concurrently been in detention on remand in connection with his first criminal trial, pending at the time before the Jarosław District Court (see paragraphs 6-13 above). 34. On 12 November 2003 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court barred the applicant from leaving the territory of Poland. 35. On 11 December 2003 the Jarosław District Court ordered that the applicant undergo psychiatric observation in the psychiatric wing of the Warszawa-Mokotów Remand Centre. 36. On 30 December 2003 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court resumed the proceedings in the applicant’s case in view of that decision and the fact that the psychiatric observation could be scheduled to start in March 2004. On the same date the court again remanded him in custody on the grounds that the evidence showed a significant probability that he had committed armed robbery. It also had regard to the severity of the punishment that could be expected and the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings. 37. On 28 January 2004 the Siedlce Regional Court dismissed an interlocutory appeal brought by the applicant against this decision. The appellate court acknowledged that the applicant had not to date attempted to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. Nevertheless, the likelihood that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were convicted was considered to be sufficient reason for his continued detention. 38. On 6 February 2004 the applicant applied to the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court for the preventive measure to be changed. On 24 February 2004 the court dismissed his request. 39. On 23 March 2004 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court further extended the applicant’s detention on remand. The court gave the argument that strong evidence had been obtained against him, that it was likely that a severe sentence would be imposed in the case, and that, if released, he would attempt to persuade witnesses to give false evidence or would, by other unlawful means, try to obstruct the proceedings, especially in the light of the fact that the psychiatric observation was underway. 40. Appealing against the latter decision, the applicant’s lawyer argued that his client had already been detained for almost four years and that the District Court did not have jurisdiction to decide on the preventive measure. Moreover, it was argued that since the applicant had never attempted to obstruct the proceedings, there was no risk that he would try to do so in the current stage of the case. 41. On 28 April 2004 the Siedlce Regional Court dismissed that appeal. It was observed that the actual period of the applicant’s detention on remand in the case in question had not reached two years because he had been concurrently deprived of his liberty in the framework of the first set of criminal proceedings. As to the grounds for extending his detention on remand, the appellate court held that, even though he had not attempted to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings, the likelihood that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were to be convicted was sufficient reason to uphold the preventive measure in question. 42. On 24 June 2004 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court again decided to extend the applicant’s detention on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and the severity of the punishment that could be expected. This decision was upheld on 15 July 2004 by the Siedlce Regional Court. 43. On 23 August 2004 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court rejected a request by the applicant for release, relying on the same grounds as in the decision described above. 44. Subsequently, the applicant’s detention on remand was extended by the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court on 9 September and 22 December 2004 and 24 March and 23 June 2005. The decisions were upheld by the Siedlce Regional Court on 29 September 2004, on an unspecified date and on 13 April and 28 July 2005 respectively. All the decisions in question were based on the grounds that there was strong evidence against the applicant, that a severe punishment would be imposed if he were convicted and, since the court proceedings were only at the initial stage, that if released, he would attempt to persuade witnesses to give false evidence or, by other unlawful means, obstruct the proper course of the proceedings. It was also stressed in the earlier decisions that the trial court had not yet started its examination of the applicant’s case on the merits. 45. On 1 September 2005 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. The period he had already spent in detention on remand, namely one month and twenty-one days (from 11 July until 1 September 2005), was deducted from his sentence. The remainder of his incarceration was considered to have comprised the prison sentence which had been imposed by the Jarosław District Court in the separate criminal case (see paragraph 12 above). It appears that the first-instance court held fourteen and adjourned five hearings. It decided applications by the applicant challenging the judges, opposing the psychiatric observation and requesting a fresh examination of the case. 46. On 10 February 2006 the Siedlce Regional Court quashed the judgment of 1 September 2005 (see paragraph 45 above) and remitted the case to the first-instance court, ordering it to gather additional evidence. 47. On 7 March 2006 the Mińsk Mazowiecki District Court extended the applicant’s detention. That decision was upheld on 29 March 2006. The domestic courts considered that the actual period of detention on remand in the framework of the second case had only started running on 11 July 2005, when he was no longer deprived of his liberty in connection with the first criminal case. The courts also referred to the two original grounds for the applicant’s continued detention, namely a reasonable suspicion that he had committed armed robbery and the severity of the punishment that could be expected. In the courts’ view, the latter element in turn created a presumption that the applicant would attempt to obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings if released. 48. On 29 March 2006 the Siedlce Regional Court fully adhered to the reasoning of the first-instance court and upheld the above-mentioned decision. 49. On 11 April 2006 the case was transferred to the Siedlce Regional Court as the competent court because, in the meantime, the charges against the applicant had been modified. 50. Pending trial the applicant’s detention was extended by the Siedlce Regional Court on 31 May and 21 June 2006, on an unspecified date and on 13 November 2006 and 19 January 2007. The decisions were upheld by the Lublin Court of Appeal. The domestic courts reiterated the original grounds for the applicant’s detention on remand and stressed that the preventive measure in question had not lasted more than two years, regard being had to the fact that from 7 November 2003 to 11 July 2005 he had been serving a prison sentence imposed in the first set of criminal proceedings. 51. The first hearing took place on 29 June 2006. 52. On 6 July 2007 the Siedlce Regional Court convicted the applicant as charged and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. It appears that the court held seven hearings in the case. The period the applicant had already spent in detention on remand, namely one year, eleven months and twenty five days (from 11 July 2005 until 6 July 2007) was deducted from his sentence. 53. On 9 April 2008 the Lublin Court of Appeal quashed that judgment, lifted the preventive measure and remitted the case to the lower courts. The following day the applicant was released from the remand centre. He has remained at liberty ever since. 54. On 23 October 2009 the Siedlce Regional Court convicted the applicant on a number of charges and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. It held fourteen hearings in the case. Two years and nine months of the applicant’s detention on remand (from 11 July 2005 to 10 April 2008) were deducted from his sentence. It appears that he was not ordered to serve the remainder of his sentence. 55. On 12 February 2010 the applicant appealed. 56. On an unspecified date before March 2011 the Lublin Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance judgment. 57. The applicant did not wish to take his case to the Supreme Court, believing that a cassation appeal would not have any prospects of success. 58. He did not lodge a complaint about the length of the second set of criminal proceedings under the 2004 Act. 59. On 29 November 2006 the applicant made a constitutional complaint (skarga konstytucyjna) under Article 191, read in conjunction with Article 79 of the Constitution (see paragraph 86 below), asking for Article 263 §§ 3 and 4 of the Code (see paragraph 73 below) to be declared unconstitutional (SK 39/07). He alleged that the provision infringed, inter alia, the right to personal inviolability and security under Article 41 § 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 71 below). On 30 January 2007 the applicant finalised his complaint. The applicant challenged two aspects of Article 263 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 60. Firstly, he alleged that Article 263 §§ 3 and 4 were unconstitutional in so far as, under the legal principle (zasada prawna) of the Supreme Court (see paragraph 74 below), they concerned only effective detention on remand, that is to say only the actual period of deprivation of liberty on the basis of a detention decision issued in a particular case because they denied a detainee sufficient protection of his liberty if he had earlier been convicted or otherwise deprived of his liberty on the basis of decisions issued in another set of proceedings. 61. Secondly, the applicant challenged Article 263 § 3 in so far as it defined a maximum statutory period for the length of detention on remand only until the delivery of a first judgment by the trial court. Consequently, people such as him who remained in detention while their criminal proceedings were pending de novo after the quashing of the first judgment of the first-instance trial court, were not protected against unreasonably lengthy detention on remand. Article 263 § 3 of the Code was silent in that respect and because of that, the authorities could extend the preventive measure for an indefinite period following the quashing of the first judgment of a trial court. 62. On 15 January 2008 the Ombudsman joined the proceedings, asking that Article 263 § 3 of the Code be declared unconstitutional in so far as it left a legal loophole which was filled in by an erroneously developed wellestablished court practice not to include in the calculation of the statutory two-year period of detention on remand (prior to the first judgment of the first-instance court) periods of the detainee’s concurrent deprivation of liberty on the basis of a criminal sentence. 63. On 10 March 2009 the Constitutional Court discontinued the application under section 39 of the Constitutional Court Act of 1 August 1997, which provided for such a possibility in the event a ruling was considered to be redundant (zbędne). 64. It was observed that, despite the obvious differences in scope, the essence of the first part of the applicant’s complaint, concerning Article 263 §§ 3 and 4 of the Code (see paragraph 60 above), had already been examined on the merits by the Constitutional Court in case no. SK 17/07. The provision had been declared unconstitutional in so far as it was interpreted to the effect that the statutory maximum period of two years allowed for a person’s detention on remand prior to the first judgment of the first-instance court had not comprised the term of the prison sentence the detainee was serving in another case, concurrently to his detention on remand, thus allowing for an extension of the preventive measure beyond two years by a first-instance court on general grounds (see paragraphs 7781 below). 65. In connection with the second part of the complaint (see paragraph 61 above), the Constitutional Court held that the applicant did not have the standing to challenge Article 263 § 3 of the Code because this provision had not been applicable to his detention in the relevant period. The preventive measure in question had been extended during the proceedings which had been pending before the first-instance court de novo, after the original judgment had been quashed by the appellate court. In these circumstances, the legal basis for extending the applicant’s detention was Article 263 § 7 of the Code (see paragraph 74 below). 66. On 8 June 2001 the applicant informed the Przemyśl prosecutor’s office about an offence allegedly committed by staff of Przemyśl Prison. He claimed that they had been selling alcohol, cigarettes and drugs to prisoners. On 29 November 2002 the Przemyśl prosecutor’s office discontinued the criminal investigation against the alleged culprits. This decision was upheld by the Przemyśl District Court on 27 February 2003. 67. When, on 26 November 2001, the applicant lodged his application with the Court he had been detained on remand in relation to the first and second sets of criminal proceedings against him. On 31 July and 30 November 2001 and on 10 and 14 March 2003 he sent letters to his defence lawyer, W.J. The envelopes bear the stamp “Jarosław District Court” and a handwritten note stating “censored on...” (ocenzurowano dn.). 68. On 18 July 2003 the Lubaczów District Prosecutor discontinued criminal proceedings against several judges of the Jarosław District Court who, in the applicant’s view, had monitored his correspondence with his lawyer. The court held that none of the individuals concerned had opened and read the applicant’s correspondence. This decision was upheld by the Lubaczów District Court on 25 November 2003. The court found that the applicant’s correspondence had not been read and the words “censored” had been automatically stamped on the applicant’s letters. 69. On 4 December 2001, the Registry of the Court received its first letter from the applicant, dated 26 November 2001. The envelope bears the stamp “Jarosław District Court” and a handwritten note stating “Censored on 30 November 2001” (Cenzurowano dn. 30 XI 2000). 70. On 8 August 2002 the Registry of the Court received another letter from the applicant, dated 22 July 2002. It was delivered in an envelope bearing the stamp “Jarosław District Court” and a handwritten note stating “Censored on 26 July 2002” (Cenzurowano dn. 26 VII 2002).","['5', '8']","['5-3', '8-1']",[],['5'],['5-1'],[],1

SLOVAKIA,4,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life),Branko Lubarda;Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Maryland (the United States of America). 6. In 1999 the applicant married A., a Slovak national. There were three children of the marriage: B., born in 1999, C., born in 2002, and D., born in 2004. The children are all Slovak nationals, while B. is also a Peruvian national, and C. and D. also have the United States nationality. 7. For about eight years, until July 2010, the family lived together in one household in Maryland. A. then moved to stay with friends, took the children with her, the couple agreed on alternating custody, and they started receiving marriage counselling. Nevertheless, A. filed for divorce, but then withdrew her petition. 8. On 25 August 2010 A. left the United States for Slovakia, taking the children with her. The following day she informed the applicant that they had left and that she had no intention of coming back. 9. In September 2010 A. filed for divorce in Slovakia and requested that the children be entrusted to her custody by way of an interim measure. The status and outcome (if any) of these proceedings is not known. 10. On 14 October 2010 the applicant filed an application for the return of the children to the United States as the country of their habitual residence, relying on the (Slovakian) International Private and Procedural Law Act (Law no. 97/1963 Coll., as amended), the Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility, and the Hague Convention. 11. On 25 November 2010 the applicant’s Hague Convention application was transmitted to the Bratislava I District Court, through the intermediary of the Slovak Central Authority responsible for implementing the Hague Convention. 12. On 21 January 2011 the District Court ordered the children’s return to the United States, having found that it was the country of their habitual residence, that they had been removed from there wrongfully, and that no obstacles to the return had been established. 13. On 28 April 2011 the Bratislava Regional Court dismissed an appeal filed by A. and upheld the return order. The matter thus became resolved by force of a final and binding decision on 9 May 2011. 14. On 31 May 2011 the applicant filed for judicial enforcement of the return order. 15. Upon several unsuccessful attempts at having A. comply with the order voluntarily, the Komárno District Court acceded to the petition on 28 November 2011 by issuing a warrant for the order’s enforcement. 16. On 29 June 2012 the Nitra Regional Court quashed the enforcement warrant following an appeal by A. It observed that, meanwhile, A. had challenged the decision of 28 April 2011 by way of a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended) to the Constitutional Court; that on 15 December 2011 the Constitutional Court had declared that complaint admissible; and that, at the same time, it had suspended the enforceability of the return order pending the outcome of the proceedings on the merits of the complaint of A. (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below). The Regional Court concluded that, in those circumstances, an essential prerequisite for the enforcement of the return order had lapsed. Consequently, the matter was remitted to the District Court for a new decision to be taken in the light of the outcome of the constitutional complaint of A. 17. The applicant challenged the decision of 29 June 2012 by way of an appeal on points of law. He pointed out that there had been no hearing before the Regional Court and that it was only from the Regional Court’s decision that he had learned of the Constitutional Court’s decisions underlying it and of other new relevant facts, such as that the applicant had applied for the enforcement proceedings to be stayed. As the Constitutional Court’s decisions had not been served on him and he had had no knowledge of those facts, he had been deprived of an opportunity to comment and to consider the taking of other legal steps. This was contrary to the principles of adversary proceedings and equality of arms and, in the applicant’s submission, he had thereby been “prevented from acting before the court”, which constituted an admissibility ground for his appeal under Article 237 (f) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Law no. 99/1963 Coll., as amended – “CCP”). 18. On 6 December 2012 the Supreme Court declared the appeal inadmissible. It observed that the Regional Court had of its own motion obtained a copy of the Constitutional Court’s decision to suspend the enforceability of the return order, that it had based its decision on it, and that a copy of the Constitutional Court’s decision had never been served on the applicant. However, the Supreme Court also noted that the Constitutional Court’s decision was binding upon the Regional Court and considered that, therefore, having it served on the applicant and having allowed him to comment could not have had any impact on the Regional Court’s decision. Therefore, in the Supreme Court’s conclusion, the ground invoked by the applicant for the admissibility of his appeal had not been given. 19. In consequence, it became incumbent upon the District Court to rule on the applicant’s enforcement petition anew, which it did on 18 January 2013 by dismissing it. The District Court observed that on 16 May 2012 the Constitutional Court had quashed the decision upholding the return order and that it had remitted the appeal of A. against that order to the Bratislava Regional Court for a new determination (see paragraph 23 below). The return order was thus pending on appeal and, as such, it was no longer enforceable. The District Court’s decision became final and binding on 8 February 2013. 20. On 6 July 2011 A. challenged the decision of 28 April 2011 to uphold the return order (see paragraph 13 above) by way of a complaint to the Constitutional Court. It was directed against the Regional Court and, in it, she submitted that the applicant had filed observations in reply to her appeal against the return order; that she had not been served a copy of these observations; that her appeal had been determined without a hearing; and that she had accordingly been deprived of the opportunity to comment on those observations, which was contrary to her rights under Articles 46 § 1 (right to judicial protection), 47 § 3 (equality of parties to judicial proceedings) and 48 § 2 (right to comment on the evidence assessed) of the Constitution, as well as Article 6 § 1 (fairness) of the Convention. In addition, A. requested that the Constitutional Court indicate an interim measure to the effect that the enforceability of the contested decision be suspended. 21. On 15 December 2011 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint admissible and ruled that the enforceability of the decision of 28 April 2011 should be suspended pending the outcome of the constitutional proceedings on the merits. As to the latter ruling, the Constitutional Court found (i) that the suspensive measure was not contrary to any important public interest, (ii) that not having the enforceability of the return order suspended could lead to an irreversible situation and “cause detriment to the property sphere” of A. in potential violation of her fundamental rights and freedoms, and (iii) that having the enforceability suspended “gave rise to no risk of damage to any party concerned”. 22. In the ensuing proceedings on the merits, the Bratislava Regional Court as the defendant of the complaint submitted, inter alia, that there was no statutory requirement for observations in reply to an appeal to be communicated to the appellant for further observations, unless the former observations had a substantial impact on the determination of the appeal. However, the applicant’s observations in reply to the appeal by A. had had no such impact. 23. In a judgment of 16 May 2012 the Constitutional Court found a violation of the rights of A. as identified above (see paragraph 20), quashed the decision of 28 April 2011, remitted the case to the Regional Court for a new determination of the appeal of A. against the return order, and awarded her legal costs. In principle, the Constitutional Court fully embraced the line of argument advanced by A. 24. The Constitutional Court also noted that the applicant had sought leave to intervene in the proceedings as a third party. In that respect, it observed that constitutional proceedings were conducted in the procedural framework laid down in the Constitutional Court Act (Law no. 38/1993 Coll., as amended), as a lex specialis, and in the CCP, as a lex generalis. The Constitutional Court Act however envisaged no standing for third parties to intervene in proceedings on individual complaints, and its quality of a lex specialis excluded the application of the third-party-intervention rules under the CCP. For that reason, the Constitutional Court observed specifically that it had taken no account of the submissions made by the applicant. 25. The applicant obtained a copy of the Constitutional Court’s judgment on 16 August 2012. 26. On 28 February 2013 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court, alleging inter alia a violation of his rights under Article 46 § 1 of the Constitution and Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (fairness) in the enforcement proceedings, in particular in their phase before the Regional Court and the Supreme Court, and raising in substance the same arguments as in his appeal on points of law (see paragraph 17 above). The applicant pointed out, in addition, that that it had been for substantially the same reasons that the Constitutional Court itself had found a violation of the rights of A. in relation to her appeal against the return order. 27. On 5 November 2013 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. It fully endorsed the reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s decision of 6 December 2012 (see paragraph 18 above) and concluded that, accordingly, the complaint was manifestly ill-founded. The decision was served on the applicant on 9 December 2013. 28. Following the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 16 May 2012, on 21 September 2012, the Bratislava Regional Court decided again on the appeal by A. against the return order of 21 January 2011 by quashing that order and remitting the case to the Bratislava I District Court for a new determination. 29. In the subsequent period a number of hearings were held at first instance and courts at two levels of jurisdiction dealt with various procedural matters such as translations of documents into a language the applicant understood, court fees and costs of the translations, the applicant’s visiting rights in relation to his children pending the outcome of the proceedings on the merits, an injunction prohibiting A. to leave and remove the children form the territory of Slovakia, admission of the mother of A. to the proceedings as a third party, two procedural fines on A., her challenges to the first-instance judge for bias, her request for a legal-aid lawyer and establishing her whereabouts. There is no indication that any of the fines and interim rulings were actually enforced. 30. No decision on the merits was taken and the District Court decided to terminate the proceedings on 28 November 2014. It referred to Article 12 (last sentence) of the Hague Convention, which permits termination of the proceedings if there is an indication that the child in question has been taken to another State, and observed that A. and the children had moved to Hungary and had established residence there. 31. On 7 January 2015 the applicant appealed and his appeal appears to be still pending.",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1956 and lives in Staryy Oskol. 5. The applicant took part in the cleaning up operation at the Chernobyl nuclear disaster site. 6. On 5 July 2002 the Staryy Oskol Town Court of the Belgorod Region granted the applicant’s action against the Belgorod Regional Administration and awarded him and his family, comprising two members, a flat in the town of Staryy Oskol and 3,000 Russian roubles (approximately 100 euros) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage. The representative of the Regional Administration did not attend the hearing: in writing he had requested the Town Court to adjudicate the case in his absence. 7. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 15 July 2002. 8. On 19 August 2002 the Staryy Oskol Town Court issued a writ of execution and enforcement proceedings were instituted. 9. On 9 October 2002 the Belgorod Regional Administration lodged a statement of appeal against the judgment of 5 July 2002. The Administration also asked the Town Court to restore the ten-day time-limit for lodging the appeal. The Administration claimed that it had received a copy of the judgment of 5 July 2002 by fax on 8 October 2002. The Administration asked to stop the enforcement proceedings. 10. The applicant insisted that there had been no reason to restore the time-limit. He noted that a copy of the judgment had been forwarded to the Regional Administration at the end of July 2002. 11. On 14 October 2002 the Staryy Oskol Town Court restored the time-limit for lodging the appeal, accepted the Administration’s statement of appeal and stopped the enforcement proceedings. 12. On 19 November 2002 the Belgorod Regional Court examined the Administration’s appeal, quashed the judgment of 5 July 2002 and remitted the case for a fresh examination to the Town Court. 13. On 20 January 2003 the Staryy Oskol Town Court, in the new examination of the case, accepted the applicant’s action in part. The relevant part of the judgment read as follows: “Order that the Belgorod Regional Administration should provide ... Mr Babynin G.A. and his family with housing premises, which satisfy sanitary and technical requirements, in their turn according to the housing waiting list of families having persons with disabilities and individuals who had taken part in the cleaning operation at the site of the Chernobyl nuclear plant. Dismiss [the claim] for compensation for non-pecuniary damage.” 14. The judgment was not appealed against and became final on 31 January 2003. 15. On 13 February 2003 a writ of execution was issued and enforcement proceedings were instituted. 16. According to the applicant, from 5 to 12 March 2004 a group of five people, including the applicant, began a hunger strike to protest against the poor level of welfare protection provided for the Chernobyl victims. 17. On 16 April 2004 the mayor of Staryy Oskol decided to provide the applicant with a flat measuring 55,05 m². 18. On 21 April 2004 the applicant received from the mayor an occupancy voucher in respect of the flat assigned to him. He found the flat satisfactory.","['6', 'P1']","['6-1', 'P1-1']",['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1
68,001-164315,ENG,HRV,CHAMBER,2016,CASE OF RADOBULJAC v. CROATIA,4,Violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression -{General} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression),Julia Laffranque;Nebojša Vučinić;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Zagreb. 6. He is an advocate. In that capacity, he represented the plaintiff in civil proceedings instituted on 5 February 2009 before the Vukovar Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Vukovaru), in which his client sought payment of a certain amount of money from the defendant. 7. On 16 November 2009 the Municipal Court held a hearing, which the applicant attended. At the end of the hearing, the court scheduled the next one for 17 December 2009. 8. The applicant did not attend the hearing of 17 December 2009, at which the court made a decision to suspend the proceedings (mirovanje postupka) in accordance with section 216(1) of the Civil Procedure Act (see paragraph 18 below). 9. On 31 December 2009 the applicant, on behalf of the plaintiff, lodged an appeal against that decision. 10. He explained that he had been unable to attend the hearing owing to a vehicle malfunction, and that he had tried to contact the court and the defendant’s representative, with a view to informing them of the reason for his absence. He further stated that, after the hearing, he had spoken by telephone with the defendant’s representative, who had told him that, despite his (the representative’s) suggestion to proceed and hear the defendant’s testimony, the court had decided to adjourn the hearing and suspend the proceedings. The applicant argued that, if that was true, the court’s decision to suspend the proceedings had had no legal basis. He explained that suspending proceedings was an instrument for maintaining procedural discipline, the effect of which was to delay proceedings and thereby penalise the parties for their inaction. Yet, in his case, he and his client had been penalised by a delay even though it was through no fault of his own that he had failed to attend the hearing. He then stated: “With a view to highlighting the unacceptable conduct of the judge, the following circumstances have to be mentioned. The parties’ representatives and the defendant attended the hearing held on 16 November 2009. The plaintiff did not attend because no testimonies from the parties were scheduled, he is of low income, and he resides in Pula. The hearing in question was characterised by the fact that the party present at court did not give evidence and the judge attempted to adjourn the hearing without scheduling another one. The judge [eventually] adjourned the hearing, and only at the insistence of the plaintiff’s representative scheduled another one for 17 December 2009. Such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable. In behaving in this way, he seeks to give the impression that he is proceeding with the case [i.e. that the case is being dealt with], whereas, essentially, hearings are being held which are devoid of substance. Since the plaintiff’s representative has no reason to doubt the defendant’s representative’s statement that he had suggested hearing the defendant’s testimony at the hearing in question [the hearing of 17 December 2009], that statement indicates that the court could not have issued the contested decision. ... The contested decision should therefore be quashed.” 11. By a decision of 13 January 2010, Judge M.R. – who was the first-instance single judge in the above case – fined the applicant 1,500 Croatian kunas (HRK) for contempt of court. The relevant part of that decision reads: “... the advocate in the appeal ... first admitted not having attended the hearing scheduled for 17 December 2009 ... owing to a vehicle malfunction ... Instead of asking for the proceedings to be restored to the status quo ante [restitutio in integrum ob terminem elapsum, povrat u prijašnje stanje] as a result of objective reasons and force majeure, the advocate in question, for no reason whatsoever, states on the second page of the appeal, ‘Such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable. In behaving in this way, he seeks to give the impression that he is proceeding with the case [i.e. that the case is being dealt with], whereas, essentially, hearings are being held which are devoid of substance.’ [T]hat statement is certainly offensive to the court and the judge [concerned], and as such constitutes unacceptable communication between the court and the advocate representing one of the parties. By making that offensive statement, the advocate in question implies that the judge hearing the case proceeds pointlessly, and most likely proceeds pointlessly with all other cases, which represents a serious insult to both the court and the judge. For that insult, the court fined the advocate HRK 1,500. Such a fine will most likely [discourage] the advocate from insulting the court and judge hearing the case in future, in his appeals and [other] submissions, and encourage him to pay them due respect in all circumstances.” 12. The applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that his statement had not been offensive or demeaning. Rather, by making that statement, he had criticised the first-instance court’s inefficiency in conducting the proceedings. In particular, in his appeal, the applicant wrote, inter alia, the following: “The operative provisions [of the contested decision] indicate that the fine was imposed for offending the court in the appeal of 31 December 2009 by stating, ‘Such conduct from the judge is absolutely unacceptable. In behaving in this way, he seeks to give the impression that he is proceeding with the case [i.e. that the case is being dealt with], whereas, essentially, hearings are being held which are devoid of substance’. I consider the contested decision to be without basis. The quoted statement does not represent an insult. [Rather,] it is an assessment of how usefully the proceedings in the present case were conducted. The statements quoted in the contested decision ... cannot in themselves, and especially having regard to the behaviour of the judge hearing the case, [be regarded as] disrespectful, which would justify the need to issue a decision on the fine. ... In addition to the plaintiff’s representative, the defendant and [her] representative attended the hearing scheduled for 16 November 2009. The record [of that hearing] states that [the plaintiff] reaffirmed his action and the submissions of 30 March 2009, and that the defendant maintained the arguments expressed in [her] response ... of 11 March 2009. Beside this, nothing else happened at that hearing. ... Apart from acknowledging the facts as stated above, the judge hearing the case did not carry out any action intended to bring the proceedings to an end, except for scheduling the next hearing. At that hearing, he did not even oblige the defendant to provide evidence for the claims expressed in [her] response. At that hearing, not even a decision to hear testimonies from the parties was adopted. Only at the request of the plaintiff’s representative did the judge decide to schedule the next hearing. ... In the circumstances, it is evident that the hearing scheduled for 17 December 2009 would have been identical ... to the previous hearing. The plaintiff’s representative considers such conduct to be at odds with the purpose of law. ... Given that the purpose of a hearing is concentrated deliberation, that purpose is frustrated when such concentrated deliberation is lacking. One should also bear in mind that such conduct increases the costs of proceedings ... [without] rational justification. ... No intention to offend was expressed in the submissions in question [that is, the appeal of 31 December 2009]. The quoted statement represents a view assessing how usefully the proceedings were being conducted. In the reasoning [of the contested decision], it is stated that the representative implies that the judge hearing the case ‘most likely proceeds pointlessly with all other cases’. That view is not supported by any argument and has no basis [in what was written in the appeal].” 13. By a decision of 7 July 2010 the Vukovar County Court (Županijski sud u Vukovaru) dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance decision. The relevant part of that decision, which was served on the applicant on 16 July 2010, reads: “When deciding to fine the representative for contempt of court ... the first-instance court correctly held – and gave valid reasons for its view – that such statements constituted unacceptable communication between the court and an advocate ..., the assessment of which is within the discretion of the court before which the proceedings are pending. Those statements ... go beyond the limits of an advocate’s role in the proceedings ... and may be legally characterised as abuse of process on account of inappropriate communication.” 14. On 17 August 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions of the ordinary courts. In so doing, he complained that those decisions were in breach of his freedom of expression. He explicitly relied on Article 38 of the Croatian Constitution (see paragraph 16 below) and Article 10 of the Convention. 15. By a decision of 27 January 2011 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the grounds that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review. That decision was served on the applicant on 11 February 2011.",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1971. He is a migrant worker who arrived in Voronezh in 2002 and has been working on construction sites and in repairs. He lives in the village of Mikhnevo, Nizhnedevitskiy district of Voronezh region. 6. At about 2 p.m. on 26 April 2009 the applicant arrived at a meeting place as requested by his employer, Mr G., who was acting on police instructions. Three police officers in plain clothes knocked the applicant to the ground, handcuffed him and pushed him into their unmarked car. They did not explain who they were, where they were taking him or why. According to G., who witnessed the scene, they were armed with pistols. 7. The police officers took the applicant to the Zheleznodorozhniy district police department of Voronezh (отдел внутренних дел Железнодорожного района г. Воронежа, “the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD”), where he was led to an office on the upper floor. Two police officers in uniforms demanded that he confess to a murder. He refused to do so and was punched. 8. The uniformed police officers and those in plain clothes subjected the applicant to various acts of physical violence. They removed the handcuffs from him and bound his hands with scotch tape instead. He was seated on the floor with his arms around his bended knees. A metal bar was passed under his knees. The police officers lifted him and hung him on the bar, the ends of which were put on two tables. The police officers continued punching him in the head and the rest of his body. The pressure caused by the bar behind his knees was such that it prevented his blood from circulating. The police officers hit him several times on the head with an empty glass beer bottle. The applicant felt unwell. He was taken off the bar and untied for a short time. The police officers then hung him again in the same way and attached wires from a special device to his ears. They subjected him to electric shocks by rotating a handle on the device. The applicant felt sharp pain. 9. Then four men in masks and rubber gloves entered the office. They undressed the applicant completely, including his underwear, tied his arms and legs with his own shirt and leather belt, and hung him with a rope on the door of the office, head down. They showed him a syringe containing a yellowy fluid and threatened him with an intravenous injection. One of them tied a rope to his penis and pulled it, thereby opening and shutting the door on which the applicant was hanging. They squeezed his testicles. Several times the applicant said that he agreed to confess to the murder, but his answers did not satisfy the policemen. At some point they loosened the rope and he fell onto his head. 10. The treatment described above continued until the next morning, when the applicant was placed in a cell for administrative detainees at the same police station. A young man who was detained in that cell advised him to do as the police had requested. Two or three hours later the applicant was taken to an office and given some food. His questioning by the police officers continued. He was warned that he would not be able to support two more days of such treatment. He then confessed to the murder of a certain D., as dictated by them. In the evening he was again placed in the cell for administrative detainees, where he spent the night. 11. On 28 April 2009 police officers B. and E.S. took the applicant in handcuffs to the Zheleznodorozhniy district investigation department of the investigative committee at the Voronezh regional prosecutor’s office (Следственный отдел по Железнодорожному району Следственного управления Следственного комитета при прокуратуре РФ по Воронежской области, “the district investigative committee”) for questioning by an investigator as a witness in a criminal case concerning the murder of D. During the questioning the applicant remained in handcuffs. He was requested to sign a paper in Russian, which he could not read. He was then transferred back to the cell at the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD. 12. At the end of the day the applicant was taken out of the cell and given back his papers and mobile phone. He was asked to sign a document which he could not read and was released. The applicant’s landlady, Ms S., who had been phoning the police in vain for the past two days to find out about his whereabouts, saw him arrive home at about 8 p.m. with a swollen eye, bruises on his wrists, a swollen leg, a lesion on his right ear resembling a burn mark and suffering from sharp pains in his chest. 13. No criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant. 14. The following morning, on 29 April 2009, accompanied by his landlady, the applicant was examined at the emergency unit of town hospital no. 1 and received a medical certificate diagnosing him with bruising of the soft tissue of his face and his rib cage. 15. On 30 April 2009 the applicant was examined at the Voronezh Regional Forensic Medical Bureau. He described his ill-treatment at the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD. According to the expert’s forensic medical report (акт судебномедицинского освидетельствования), the applicant had bruises each measuring 3 to 4 centimetres above and below his right eye and on his left eyelid, a bruise on his right cheek, bruises on his chest (two bruises measuring 3 to 4 cm and a bruise of 1 to 2 cm), a bruise of 3.5 to 4.5 cm on his scrotum, abrasions on his forearms and right wrist, a bruise of 4 to 5 cm on his left forearm, and bruises measuring 1 to 2 cm and 2 to 3 cm behind his right and left knees respectively. 16. On 14, 15 and 18 May 2009 the applicant was examined at town clinic no. 3. On the basis of an Xray examination he was diagnosed with a fracture of the ninth rib on the right side. 17. According to a report prepared as a result of a forensic medical examination of the applicant carried out on 19 and 20 October 2009, his injuries could have been inflicted on 26-28 April 2009. 18. According to police records, at 9.15 p.m. on 27 April 2009 police officer M. arrested the applicant, who had allegedly used obscene language in the street, and at 9.30 p.m. brought him to the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD. The applicant was found guilty of petty hooliganism and sentenced to a 500 Russian rouble (RUB) administrative fine. He was allegedly released at 12 noon on 28 April 2009. 19. On 16 July 2009 the applicant was given access to documents concerning the administrative proceedings against him. On 29 July 2009 the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court of Voronezh examined an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD of 28 April 2009 to give him an administrative fine. The District Court quashed the decision and terminated the administrative proceedings against the applicant for lack of an administrative offence. 20. According to the applicant, on 7 May 2009 the deputy head of the district investigative committee refused to receive his complaint of illtreatment by the police and allegedly threatened to call the migration service and have him deported from the country. 21. On 14 May 2009 the applicant’s counsel lodged a complaint of illtreatment with the district investigative committee, describing the illtreatment in detail. She supported the allegations by submitting the medical certificate of 29 April 2009 (see paragraph 14 above) and the forensic medical report of 30 April 2009 (see paragraph 15 above). She requested that criminal proceedings be brought against the police officers concerned for abuse of power (Article 286 of the Criminal Code) and torture (Article 117 of the Criminal Code). She asked for specific investigative measures to be carried out, in particular an opportunity for the applicant to identify the police officers who had been on duty on 2628 April 2009 and a forensic medical expert examination of the applicant with a view to establishing the possible cause and time of the infliction of the injuries. 22. An investigator of the district investigative committee carried out a preinvestigation inquiry. He interviewed the applicant, who gave a detailed account of his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraphs 6-12 above), Ms S., who saw the applicant arrive home with the injuries after his alleged illtreatment (see paragraph 12 above), and police officer B., who stated that on 26 April 2009 he had stayed home and that on 27-28 April 2009 he had performed duties at the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD which had had nothing to do with the applicant. The investigator also interviewed police officers Sh. and E., who stated that on 28 April 2009 they had held a “conversation” (беседа) with the applicant in one of their offices, at the request of the head of the criminal unit of the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD, about the applicant’s involvement in the murder of D. After the “conversation” they had taken the applicant, at the request of their supervisor, to investigator G. of the district investigative department. Both of them denied any violent behaviour on their part. The investigator also obtained the police records, according to which the applicant had been brought to the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD at 9.30 p.m. on 27 April 2009 (see paragraph 18 above). 23. On 25 May 2009 the investigator refused to institute criminal proceedings concerning the applicant’s complaint for lack of elements of a crime in the acts of police officers Sh. and E., pursuant to Article 24 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“CCrP”). 24. The applicant appealed against the decision to the Voronezh Zheleznodorozhniy District Court under Article 125 of the CCrP. On 18 June 2009 the District Court terminated the proceedings because the previous day a deputy head of the district investigative committee had quashed the investigator’s decision as unlawful and unfounded. In particular, he had ordered that the head of the criminal police unit of the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD, S., be interviewed in the course of an additional preliminary inquiry. 25. The investigator’s subsequent decisions of 27 June and 6 August 2009 that no criminal proceedings would be instituted on the applicant’s allegations were likewise revoked on the same grounds by the district investigative committee (on 27 July and 1 September 2009). Court appeals lodged by the applicant were not examined for the same reason (the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court’s decisions of 28 July and 1 September 2009). In his decision of 1 September 2009 the head of the district investigative committee ordered that police officers M. and Se., who had brought the administrative proceedings against the applicant, be interviewed. He also noted that the identity of all the police officers present during the “conversation” with the applicant at the ROVD had not been established. 26. On 11 September 2009 the district investigative committee again refused to institute criminal proceedings for lack of elements of a crime in the acts of police officers Sh., E., S. and R. On 8 October 2009 the investigative committee at the Voronezh regional prosecutor’s office (следственное управление Следственного комитета при прокуратуре РФ по Воронежской области, “the regional investigative committee”) set aside as unlawful and unfounded the district investigative committee’s refusal. It noted, in particular, that the applicant’s allegations were supported by the forensic medical report of 30 April 2009 (see paragraph 15 above), the explanations of Ms S. (see paragraph 12 above) and the police records certifying the applicant’s presence at the police station at the relevant time (see paragraph 18 above). It concluded that there were sufficient data disclosing elements of a crime under Article 286 § 3 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 42 below) committed by unidentified police officers at the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD, and opened criminal proceedings. 27. On 16 October 2009 the applicant was given victim status in the criminal proceedings. 28. On 8 April 2010 the criminal proceedings were suspended for failure to establish the identity of a person to be charged, pursuant to Article 208 § 1 (1) of the CCrP. 29. The proceedings were subsequently reopened and suspended again on the same grounds several times, the last time on 25 November 2010. The investigator established in that decision that at about 2 p.m. on 26 April 2009 three unidentified police officers had taken the applicant to the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD by force and in handcuffs. In an office on the upper floor of the ROVD two other unidentified police officers in uniforms had demanded that the applicant confess to a murder. He had refused and had been beaten up by the officers who had taken him in. During the period from 26 to 28 April 2009 both uniformed and plain-clothes police officers had subjected the applicant to various acts of physical violence, in particular punching him and hitting him with a glass bottle on his head and other parts of his body, subjecting him to electric shocks via wires attached to his ears and genitalia, and to other forms of torture, as a result of which he had confessed to the murder of D. 30. During the preliminary investigation the regional investigative committee had questioned witnesses, including police officers who had been on duty at the ROVD during the relevant period, the head of the criminal police unit and his deputies, the police officers of the criminal investigation unit, witnesses to the applicant’s apprehension, persons detained in the cells for administrative offenders during the period concerned and the doctor who had examined the applicant on 29 April 2009. It examined the offices where the illtreatment could have taken place and held identification parades to enable the applicant to identify the alleged perpetrators from among a number of the police officers who had been working at the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD. While a number of those identification parades had not resulted in an identification (for example, police officer D.M. who was found to have been using a phone number from which calls to the applicant’s employer G. had been registered (see paragraph 6 above) had not been identified by the applicant), the applicant had identified police officers B. and S. as participants in his ill-treatment. The investigator found their identification insufficient for the prosecution in view of its alleged inconsistency with the applicant’s statements describing the perpetrators and in view of their alibi, as neither of them had according to their statements allegedly been present at the ROVD during the period concerned. 31. On 9 March 2011 the first deputy to the Voronezh regional prosecutor dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the investigator’s decision of 25 November 2010 (see paragraph 29 above). On 19 April 2011 judge G. of the Leninskiy District Court dismissed a further appeal lodged by the applicant under Article 125 of the CCrP. That decision was upheld by the Voronezh Regional Court on 14 June 2011. In particular, the applicant, represented by his counsel, argued in the court proceedings that the identity of the alleged perpetrators had been established since he had identified police officers B. and S.; hence, it had been wrong to suspend the proceedings for failure to identify the alleged offenders. The courts rejected his submissions and found the investigator’s decision lawful and well-reasoned. 32. Some of the applicant’s allegations – notably that the administrative charge of petty hooliganism against him had been trumped up and that police officer B. had unlawfully handcuffed him on 28 April 2008 when taking him for questioning to the investigator in the murder case – were the subject of separate proceedings. The district investigative committee’s initial refusal to open a criminal case was followed by the regional investigative committee’s decision of 5 December 2011 to open criminal proceedings concerning the alleged forgery of administrativecase documents under Article 292 § 2 of the Criminal Code and their subsequent suspension. On 7 September 2012 the district investigative committee’s initial refusal to open a criminal case into the applicant’s handcuffing was revoked and an additional preliminary inquiry was ordered. 33. The applicant’s counsel requested the transfer of the criminal cases concerning the applicant’s ill-treatment to a new division at the Central Federal District investigative department, which had been created pursuant to order no. 20 of the chairman of the investigative committee to investigate crimes committed by police officers (see paragraph 43 below). 34. On 31 August 2012 the regional investigative committee replied to the applicant that firstly, it was not competent to take such a decision as, under Article 152 § 6 of the CCrP, a criminal case could only be transferred for investigation to a superior investigative authority by a reasoned decision of the head of that authority, and that secondly, order no. 20 did not provide for obligatory transfer of cases of this kind to the new investigative divisions. 35. On 28 September 2012 the central office of the investigative committee of the Russian Federation sent the applicant’s transfer request back to the regional investigative committee, which, in a letter of 6 November 2012, gave the applicant the same reply as before (see paragraph 34 above). 36. The applicant brought civil proceedings for damages sustained as a result of his unlawful arrest, detention at the police station, torture, handcuffing and unlawful questioning about his involvement in a criminal offence. He claimed RUB 1,200,000 in respect of non-pecuniary damage and RUB 1,435 in respect of pecuniary damage. Judge Sh. of the Leninskiy District Court of Voronezh held a hearing with the participation of the applicant, his lawyer and his interpreter, representatives of the Ministry of Finance, the Voronezh regional department of finance and budget policy and the Voronezh regional police department acting as a third party, and a prosecutor. 37. In its judgment of 29 November 2011 the District Court noted that the investigative measures conducted by the investigative committee after the opening of a criminal case had allowed it to establish the fact of the applicant’s unlawful arrest, handcuffing and detention during the period from 26 to 28 April 2009 in the offices of police officers of the criminal investigation unit (сотрудников уголовного розыска) of the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD and in a cell for administrative detainees, as well as the fact that he had been subjected to physical violence with the aim of obtaining his confession to a murder and had had bodily injuries inflicted on him on the premises of the Zheleznodorozhniy ROVD (see paragraph 29 above). As a result of the physical and psychological violence, the applicant had confessed to a murder. He had not been detained as a suspect, nor charged with, or found guilty of, any crime. 38. On the basis of the preliminary investigation, which had established the elements of a crime under Article 286 § 3 (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, the Zheleznodorozhniy District Court’s judgment of 29 July 2009 terminating the administrative proceedings against the applicant for lack of an administrative offence (see paragraph 19 above) and the evidence submitted by the applicant in the civil proceedings, the District Court found it established that the applicant had been subjected to the abovementioned unlawful acts by police officers, despite the failure to identify them all. Of those identified, the District Court noted M., G. and Ch., who had signed the records and the decision concerning the administrative offence allegedly committed by the applicant. The physical violence to which the applicant had been subjected had not been made necessary by his conduct, had diminished his human dignity and had as such been a violation of the law. The District Court awarded the applicant RUB 840,000 in respect of nonpecuniary damage and RUB 835 in respect of pecuniary damage, to be paid by the federal and regional treasuries, and rejected the remainder of his claims. 39. According to the internet site of the Voronezh Regional Court, on 22 March 2012 it examined the case following appeals lodged by the respondent authorities. No appeal against the Leninskiy District Court’s judgment had been lodged by the applicant, who was represented before the appeal court by his counsel. The Regional Court rejected the appeals and upheld the judgment. 40. A complaint about the applicant’s ill-treatment was also lodged with the Voronezh regional police department, which informed the applicant’s counsel on 23 July 2009 that police officer M. had been disciplined for his failure to identify an alleged witness to the applicant’s administrative offence. 41. Police officer S., identified by the applicant as one of those who had participated in his illtreatment (see paragraph 30 above), was promoted on 1 October 2010 as head of a district police department.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Zagreb. 6. On 19 May 2011 the Split Office of the National Police Unit for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Policijski nacionalni ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta, Odjel za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta Split; hereinafter: “the police”) lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant before the State Attorney’s Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Državno odvjetništvo, Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta; hereinafter: “the State Attorney’s Office”), alleging that he had participated in an organised international drug-trafficking scheme. 7. On the basis of the extensive evidence collected during the preliminary investigation, including through mechanisms of international legal assistance in criminal matters from the authorities in Spain, Slovenia and the Netherlands, and the results of secret surveillance measures, on 20 May 2011 the State Attorney’s Office opened an investigation in respect of the applicant and nine other persons suspected of drug trafficking. In particular, it was alleged that the applicant had participated in an organised drug-trafficking scheme by securing the means of communication between other members of the group. 8. During the investigation, the State Attorney’s Office questioned a number of witnesses and obtained further voluminous evidence from the police. It also commissioned telecommunication expert reports and requested assistance in obtaining evidence from the authorities in Spain, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Netherlands. 9. On 9 November 2011 the State Attorney of the Republic of Croatia (Glavni državni odvjetnik Republike Hrvatske) extended the investigation for a further six months. 10. Following the completion of the investigation, on 16 May 2012 the State Attorney’s Office indicted the applicant and nine other defendants in the Split County Court (Županijski sud u Splitu) on charges of drug trafficking. It alleged that the applicant had facilitated communication between other members of the group operating an international drug-trafficking scheme. 11. On 18 May 2012 the investigating judge forwarded the indictment to the defendants, instructing them that they could submit their comments on it within a period of eight days. 12. On 28 May 2012 the applicant denied the charge, alleging numerous substantive and procedural flaws. 13. Several hearings for the confirmation of the indictment were held before a three-judge panel of the Split County Court. Meanwhile, the defence lawyers challenged the decision on the admissibility of evidence before the Supreme Court. 14. On 23 November 2012 the applicant complained to the Supreme Court of a lack of diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. He pointed out that the Supreme Court had not yet decided on the question of the admissibility of the evidence, which was incompatible with the requirement of due diligence in the conduct of the proceedings. 15. On 25 January 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court confirmed the indictment and referred the case to trial. 16. The criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending. 17. On 19 May 2011 the applicant was arrested in connection with the criminal complaint lodged against him by the police (see paragraph 6 above). 18. The next day, after hearing the applicant’s defence, the State Attorney’s Office ordered that he be remanded in custody for a period of forty-eight hours. 19. Following the opening of the investigation against him, on 20 May 2011 the State Attorney’s Office asked an investigating judge (sudac istrage) of the Split County Court to order the applicant’s pre-trial detention (istražni zatvor). It also requested that the other defendants be remanded in custody. 20. On the same day the investigating judge accepted the request and ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention for one month under Article 123 § 1 (2), (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of collusion, risk of reoffending and gravity of charges). He also ordered the pre-trial detention of nine other defendants in the proceedings. The relevant part of the decision reads: “Reasonable suspicion that the suspects committed the offences at issue follows from the criminal complaint lodged by [the police] and the [supporting material] ... The pre-trial detention of all the suspects, save for Đ.F. and N.E. who are detained in Spain, was ordered under Article 123 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The suspects Š.L. and D.J. ... are still at large and there is therefore a risk that if the other suspects were at large, they could hinder the proper conduct of the proceedings by influencing [Š.L. and D.J.]. In addition, a number of witnesses should be questioned concerning the offences at issue ... and, since they know the suspects or are relatives of theirs, there is a risk that the suspects, if at large, could hinder the proper conduct of the proceedings by influencing the witnesses ... The pre-trial detention of all the suspects was also ordered under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given the scale of the alleged criminal activity, the period in which it has taken place, the extent of the [suspects’] organisation, and the fact that they have allegedly smuggled over 700 kilograms of cocaine, 338 kilograms of which has been seized in Spain, this court finds that it suggests special circumstances justifying the fear that they may reoffend. ... The pre-trial detention of all the suspects, save for S.R., was also ordered under Article 123 § 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This court finds it necessary to order detention under this provision also so as to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given that the case concerns a particularly grave offence under Article 173 § 3 of the Criminal Code for which a sentence of long-term imprisonment has been prescribed. Specifically, it is alleged that the suspects have smuggled over 700 kilograms of cocaine, which can be used to make a significant number of individual doses and thus to endanger the health of a high number of persons. Moreover, the suspects have allegedly operated on the territories of several countries, where they organised networks of persons helping them in the commission of the offences, which suggests a particularly organised and systemic approach in the commission of the offences. Apparently large sums of money were also spent for the [distribution and] transport of the drugs from South America. This suggests, in the view of this court, that the circumstances of the offence are particularly serious, surpassing the circumstances in which such offences are ‘usually’ committed ...” 21. The applicant challenged the decision of the investigating judge before a three-judge panel of the Split County Court, arguing that the judge had failed to take into account the extent of his specific participation in the alleged offences at issue. He pointed out that his alleged role in the commission of the offences was peripheral and irrelevant, since his only contact with the case was through the third defendant, whom he had known from the past but had not suspected of being involved in a criminal activity. The applicant also stressed that he was a self-employed car mechanic and had had no previous conflict with the law. He therefore requested that less severe preventive measures be applied for securing his proper participation in the proceedings. 22. On 6 June 2011 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the appeals lodged by the applicant and two other defendants. The relevant part of the decision reads: “It is alleged that the suspects, acting within an organised group, obtained cocaine abroad and transported it to Croatia for the purpose of its further distribution. The proceedings at issue concern not only a serious and socially dangerous offence, but there are also other specific circumstances showing the seriousness of the case. The suspects obtained the drugs in South America, in large quantities of several hundreds of kilograms, and the whole process of transporting the drugs required a high degree of organisation and distribution of work. The quantity of drugs found, namely around 370 grams [sic] of cocaine, is higher than in other [similar cases]. The investigating judge thus correctly concluded that in respect of the suspects S.K. and Vlatko Šoš the circumstances of the offence are particularly serious, which also justifies the fear that the suspects might reoffend. There are therefore sufficient reasons for pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. ... Furthermore, since in the further course of the proceedings, as indicated in the investigating judge’s decision, it is necessary to question a number of witnesses who have relevant knowledge of the offences at issue and know the suspects S.K., Vlatko Šoš and S.R., the investigating judge correctly ordered the detention under Article 123 § 1 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given that the investigating judge’s decision ordering the detention is justified, there are no grounds for accepting the requests of the suspects, put forward in the appeals, to replace their detention by alternative measures.” 23. On 17 June 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for two months under Article 123 § 1 (2), (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of collusion, risk of reoffending and gravity of charges), reiterating his previous arguments. 24. The applicant challenged that decision,. On 7 July 2011 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed his complaints, endorsing the reasoning of the investigating judge. 25. On 18 August 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for two months under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges). He found that all the relevant witnesses had been questioned and that there was no further possibility of remanding the applicant in detention on the grounds of the risk of collusion. As to the other grounds relied upon for the applicant’s detention, the investigating judge reiterated his previous findings. 26. The applicant lodged an appeal against that decision before a three-judge panel of the Split County Court, arguing that his detention had been constantly extended without providing any reasons relevant to his particular situation. He also requested that his detention be replaced by house arrest. 27. On 27 September 2011 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, endorsing the findings of the investigating judge. It provided no reasoning concerning the applicant’s request for the replacement of his detention by house arrest. 28. On 18 October 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for two months under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges). The relevant part of the decision reads: “The pre-trial detention of all the suspects was also ordered under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given the scale of the alleged criminal activity, the period in which it has taken place, the extent of the [suspects’] organisation, and the fact that they have allegedly smuggled over 700 kilograms of cocaine, 338 kilograms of which has been seized in Spain, this court finds that it suggests special circumstances justifying the fear that they may reoffend. ... The pre-trial detention of all the suspects, save for S.R., was also ordered under Article 123 § 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This court finds it necessary to order detention under this provision, also so as to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given that the case concerns a particularly grave offence under Article 173 § 3 of the Criminal Code for which a long prison sentence has been prescribed. Specifically, it is alleged that the suspects have smuggled over 700 kilograms of cocaine, which can be used to make a significant number of individual doses and thus to endanger the health of a high number of persons. Moreover, the suspects have allegedly operated on the territories of several countries, where they organised networks of persons helping them in the commission of the offences, which suggests a particularly organised and systemic approach in the commission of the offences. Apparently large sums of money were also spent for the [distribution and] transport of the drugs from South America. This suggests, in the view of this court, that the circumstances of the offence were particularly serious, surpassing the circumstances in which such offences are ‘usually’ committed ...” 29. The applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision, asking to be released and for less severe preventive measures to be applied. On 28 October 2011 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded, reiterating its previous arguments and without providing further reasons for refusing the applicant’s request. 30. On 15 November 2011 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) against those decisions, arguing that the reasons given for his continued detention were neither relevant nor sufficient. He pointed out that the Split County Court had collectively extended the pre-trial detention of all the defendants in the proceedings, without taking into account his specific arguments. 31. On 18 November 2011 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a further two months under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges). In his decision, the investigating judge stated that the initial grounds for the applicant’s detention had not changed. The judge also noted that owing to the complexity of the case, the investigation would be extended for a further six months. 32. The applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that it lacked the relevant reasoning. He also asked to be released on bail or for the application of other less severe preventive measures. 33. On 6 December 2011 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, reiterating its previous arguments. It held that, in view of the gravity of the offences at issue, the applicant’s detention could not be replaced by less severe preventive measures, nor could he be released on bail. 34. On 9 and 16 December 2011 the applicant urged the Constitutional Court to decide on his constitutional complaint of 15 November 2011 (see paragraph 30 above). 35. On 22 December 2011 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint of 15 November 2011 inadmissible on the ground that a new decision on his detention had been adopted in the meantime, namely on 18 November 2011 (see paragraph 31 above), and that his detention was no longer based on the impugned decision. This decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 10 January 2012. 36. On 18 January 2012 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s detention for a further two months under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges) on the ground that the relevant circumstances warranting his detention had not changed. 37. The applicant lodged an appeal against the above decision, arguing that it lacked the relevant reasoning and asking that his detention be replaced by less severe preventive measures. 38. On 31 January 2012 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, reiterating its previous arguments concerning the necessity of the defendants’ continued detention. 39. On 14 February 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court, arguing that in extending his detention throughout the investigation, the court had always used the same wording and phrases. He pointed out that the Split County Court had failed to make a proper assessment of the necessity of his continued detention given that its decisions were merely a reproduction of the same wording provided in the initial decision ordering his detention on 20 May 2011. 40. On 22 February 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the Split County Court. The relevant part of the decision reads: “The impugned decision of the investigating judge ... provides detailed and clear reasoning with regard to the relevant legal circumstances related to the appellant’s [detention]. The Constitutional Court finds that the impugned decisions comply with the relevant constitutional [requirements] concerning the extension of the appellant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” 41. On 16 March 2012 the investigating judge extended the applicant’s detention for a further two months under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges) on the ground that nothing had changed in the relevant circumstances warranting his continued detention. 42. The applicant appealed against that decision, reiterating his request for release and the application of less severe preventive measures. 43. On 29 March 2012 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, reiterating its previous arguments. It found that it was not possible to release him and to apply less severe preventive measures in view of the particular gravity and seriousness of the charges against him. 44. Following the submission of the indictment against the applicant to the Split County Court (see paragraph 10 above), on 18 May 2012 a three-judge panel of that court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges) without setting any time-limits for the detention. The relevant part of the decision reads: “Against the defendant: ... 9. Vlatko Šoš ... the pre-trial detention is extended and it should continue further ... on the basis of Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure ... Statement of reasons ... Reasonable suspicion that the suspects have committed the offences at issue follows from the indictment submitted by the [State Attorney’s Office] and the evidence listed in the indictment. ... With regard to the defendants P.Ć., M.V., A.Ć., S.K. and Vlatko Šoš the detention was extended under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given the scale of the alleged criminal activity, the period in which it has taken place, the extent of [the defendants’] organisation, and the fact that they have allegedly smuggled large quantities of cocaine for the purpose of its further distribution, 338 kilograms of which has been seized in Spain, this panel finds that it suggests special circumstances justifying the fear that they may reoffend. The detention of the defendants P.Ć., M.V., A.Ć., S.K. and Vlatko Šoš was also extended under Article 123 § 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This panel finds that the case concerns a particularly grave offence under Article 173 § 3 of the Criminal Code for which a sentence of long-term imprisonment has been prescribed. Specifically, the very fact that [the case] concerns a large number of persons organised in a criminal enterprise for the purpose of trafficking large quantities of cocaine, for which purpose the defendant P.Ć. established a criminal organisation in Croatia, as well as the fact that a venture of trafficking of large quantities of the drug, such as the one smuggled by the defendants, is not undertaken by individuals who are not aware of the trafficking, suggest that the circumstances of the offence are particularly serious. The defendants are charged with acting on the basis of a prepared plan and agreement for permanently trafficking large quantities of cocaine, and in the period between January 2010 and 19 May 2011 they smuggled large quantities of [that drug] for the purpose of further distribution. The undisputed purity of the last shipment of the seized cocaine, amounting to 338.29 kilograms, means that it could have been used for making at least 3,000 doses for individual use ... which on the black market could have endangered the health of a high number of persons. These circumstances of the offence surpass the usual circumstances in which [such offences] are committed, and therefore they suggest its particular gravity.” 45. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) against the above decision, arguing that the Split County Court had failed to adduce any relevant reason warranting his continued detention. He pointed out in particular that the individual circumstances of his case had not been examined, such as the fact that he had not had any previous conflict with the law. This called into question the findings of the Split County Court that he could reoffend. He also asked that his detention be replaced by less severe preventive measures. 46. On 15 June 2012 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, endorsing the decision of the Split County Court. It did not examine the possibility of replacing the applicant’s detention by the application of alternative preventive measures. With regard to the applicant’s specific arguments, the Supreme Court held: “The importance of the reasons making the detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure necessary and the only appropriate measure for averting the risk of reoffending has not been called into question by the appeal arguments of the defendants S.K. and Vlatko Šoš that they did not have a criminal record. The fact that ... prior to his arrest [Vlatko Šoš] was well-known as a hardworking and decent person who was earning money by working as a car mechanic could be taken into account in the sentencing, in the event of his conviction.” 47. On 13 August 2012 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court again extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges), reiterating its previous arguments and without setting any time-limits for the applicant’s detention. It did not examine the possibility of replacing his detention by the application of less severe preventive measures. 48. The applicant challenged the decision of the Split County Court before the Supreme Court, arguing that the courts had extended his detention throughout the period of his remand by constantly repeating the same phrases and almost identical wording, and without a proper assessment of the individual circumstances of his case. He also asked that his detention be replaced by less severe preventive measures. 49. On 12 September 2012 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded on the ground that there was nothing calling into question the findings of the Split County Court concerning the necessity of his continued detention. It also stressed that, in view of the gravity of the charges and the persisting risk of reoffending, the applicant’s detention could not be replaced by less severe preventive measures. 50. On 22 October 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the above decision. He contended that the lower courts had constantly extended his pre-trial detention throughout the proceedings, always using the same stereotyped formulae and phrases. He considered, therefore, that they had failed to adduce any relevant and sufficient reasons for his continued detention. He pointed out the wording of the decisions extending his detention and the fact that his detention had been extended during the trial without setting any time-limits. 51. On 6 November 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. In particular it held: “The Constitutional Court finds in the case at hand that the impugned decisions were adopted on the basis of the competent courts’ careful assessment of the reasons justifying the extension of the appellant’s t issue is punishable by long-term imprisonment) and that the [competent courts] provided sufficient reasons justifying [the detention].” 52. On 9 November 2012 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant’s detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges), without setting any time-limits for the detention. The relevant part of the decision reads: “With regard to the defendants P.Ć., M.V., A.Ć., S.K. and Vlatko Šoš the detention was extended under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Given the scale of the alleged criminal activity, the period in which it has taken place, the extent of [the defendants’] organisation, and the fact that they have allegedly smuggled large quantities of cocaine for the purpose of its further distribution, 338 kilograms of which has been seized in Spain, this panel finds that it suggests special circumstances justifying the fear that they may reoffend. The detention of the defendants P.Ć., M.V., A.Ć., S.K. and Vlatko Šoš was also extended under Article 123 § 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This panel finds that the case concerns a particularly grave offence under Article 173 § 3 of the Criminal Code for which a sentence of long-term imprisonment has been prescribed. Specifically, the very fact that [the case] concerns a large number of persons organised in a criminal enterprise for the purpose of trafficking large quantities of cocaine, for which purpose the defendant P.Ć. established a criminal organisation in Croatia, as well as the fact that a venture of trafficking of large quantities of the drug, such as the one smuggled by the defendants, is not undertaken by individuals who are not aware of the trafficking, suggest that the circumstances of the offence were particularly serious.

These circumstances of the offence surpass the usual circumstances in which [such offences] are committed, and therefore they suggest that the charges are particularly serious.” 53. The applicant appealed against the above decision to the Supreme Court. On 28 November 2012 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded, upholding the decision of the Split County Court. 54. On 25 January 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) and (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending and gravity of charges), reiterating the wording of its previous decision and without setting any time-limits for the detention. 55. The applicant appealed against the decision on his pre-trial detention to the Supreme Court, arguing that it lacked relevant and sufficient reasons. 56. On 20 February 2013 the Supreme Court found that the applicant’s detention was to be extended only under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending). It explained that the 2013 amendments to the Criminal Code provided that the offence at issue was punishable by a prison sentence of between three and fifteen years and no longer by long-term imprisonment. It was therefore not possible to remand the applicant on the grounds of the gravity of the charges since the possibility of imposing a sentence of long-term imprisonment was one of the conditions for extending pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (gravity of charges). 57. On 20 April 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending), relying on its previous reasoning and without setting any time-limits for the detention. 58. The applicant appealed against that decision before the Supreme Court, reiterating that his continued detention had not been based on relevant and sufficient reasons. On 24 May 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal as ill-founded. 59. Meanwhile, on 17 May 2013, following the expiry of the maximum period of the applicant’s pre-trial detention, a three-judge panel of the Split County Court exceptionally extended this maximum time-limit for his detention for a further six months, relying on section 35 of the Act on the Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (see paragraph 71 below). It held that the time-limit for his detention before the adoption of the first-instance judgment would expire on 19 November 2013. 60. The applicant challenged the extension of the time-limit for his pre-trial detention before the Supreme Court, arguing that such a measure was unreasonable. He pointed out that the first-instance judgment could not be adopted before 19 November 2013 given that so far only the preparatory hearing had been scheduled. The applicant also contended that the impugned decision lacked relevant and sufficient reasons warranting his continued detention on the ground of the risk of reoffending. 61. On 7 June 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the decision to extend the time-limit for his pre-trial detention. 62. On 2 August 2013 a three-judge panel of the Split County Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of reoffending), reiterating its previous reasoning and without setting a time-limit for the detention. It also held that the applicant’s detention could not be replaced by less severe preventive measures. 63. The applicant challenged that decision before the Supreme Court,, his continued detention was unreasonable. 64. On 9 September 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, upholding the decision of the Split County Court. 65.

The applicant was born in 1975 and is detained in Kahramanmaraş. 6. On 19 November 2003 the applicant was taken into police custody on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation, namely the PKK/KADEK (Workers’ Party of Kurdistan/Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress). It appears that at some point the applicant confessed to committing an armed attack on a prison vehicle in Adana and, as a result, on 21 November 2003 at 3 p.m. was required to participate in a reconstruction of the events (yer gösterme). According to the record drafted by police officers and signed by the applicant, the latter described in detail what steps he had taken before the attack on a prison vehicle in Adana and indicated how he had opened fire on that vehicle. 7. On the same day, he was taken to the Dörtyol police station for questioning. The questioning took place between 8.10 p.m. and 11.50 p.m. the same day and 10 a.m. and 3.45 p.m. the following day. The applicant’s statements to the police were transcribed on pre-printed forms, the relevant part of which was filled in to indicate, inter alia, that the applicant was suspected of membership of an illegal organisation and of carrying out armed activities on behalf of that organisation. On the first page of the forms there was a pre-printed message stating, inter alia, that the person being questioned had the right to remain silent and the right to choose a lawyer. It appears from the form that the applicant had refused legal assistance since the first page of the record includes a pre-printed phrase stating “No lawyer sought” with the applicant’s signature underneath. He was thus questioned in the absence of a lawyer. 8. In his statement, the applicant admitted that he was a member of the PKK/KADEK and that he was active in the organisation. In particular, he gave detailed information about, inter alia, an armed attack on a prison vehicle in Adana. He also stated that his code name was “Hüseyin”. 9. On 23 November 2003 he was brought before the Dörtyol public prosecutor, where he partly confirmed and partly denied the content of his statements to the police made in the absence of a lawyer. Prior to this he had been told his rights, including the right to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer. He further stated that he was a member of the PKK/KADEK and had been involved in some of its activities in northern Iraq but had not taken part in any political or armed activities in Turkey. 10. On the same day, an investigating judge of the Adana State Security Court took statements from the applicant. Prior to the interview, the applicant was informed of his rights under Article 135 of the former Code of Criminal Procedure. He did not ask for a lawyer. During the interview, the applicant stated that his statements made to the police and the public prosecutor had been correct. He maintained, in particular, that his statements made to the police in respect of the armed attack in Adana had been entirely correct. The court ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention. 11. During the applicant’s period in custody, specifically from 19 to 23 November 2003, he was examined six times by doctors. The medical examinations conducted before and at the end of his custody period revealed no signs of ill-treatment on his body. 12. Prior to the applicant’s arrest, on 27 October 2003, a certain H.K., who was a co-accused, had claimed during questioning that he had organised the armed attack, acting with someone whose code name was “Hüseyin”. Later, at the first court hearing, he retracted his statements to the police, alleging that they had been extracted under duress. 13. On 23 December 2003 the Adana public prosecutor lodged an indictment, charging the applicant with the offence of breaking up the unity of the State and seeking to remove part of the national territory from the State’s control, under Article 125 of the former Criminal Code. 14. On 16 March 2004, at the first hearing in the case, the applicant retracted his statements made to the police, the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, alleging that they had been obtained through coercion and death threats by the police. He admitted that he was a member of the PKK/KADEK while denying involvement in the armed attack in Adana. When asked about the reports of the reconstruction of events, the applicant submitted that he had not accepted the evidence against him. 15. State Security Courts were abolished on 16 June 2004 pursuant to Law no. 5190. The case was therefore transferred to the Adana Assize Court. 16. On 10 February 2005 the applicant’s lawyer applied to the court to have a certain F.Y. summoned as a witness and to hold a confrontation with the applicant, as F.Y. had stated in his witness statements dated 16 October 2003 that he had seen the perpetrators of the attack. He also asked the court to enquire of the banks as to whether there had been any money transferred between the applicant’s father and H.K. The court dismissed the application concerning the attendance of a witness, on the grounds that the witness would not remember the incidents given the long time which had elapsed and that he would not tell the truth owing to the nature of the incident. It further dismissed the other request concerning the transfer of money, considering it not to be essential for the purposes of the case. 17. On 11 December 2005 the applicant sent a letter to the trial court in which he explained the threats and coercion he had been subjected to in detail and asked the court not to take his co-accused’s statements into consideration. 18. On 22 December 2005 the Adana Assize Court convicted the applicant as charged. 19. On 28 December 2005 the applicant’s lawyer appealed against that judgment and alleged, inter alia, that the applicant’s statements had been taken without notifying him of his rights and as a result of coercion and death threats by the police. The applicant’s lawyer gave detailed accounts of such treatment and asked the Court of Cassation not to rely on these statements which had been obtained by impairing the applicant’s will. 20. On 12 October 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the conviction for procedural shortcomings. 21. At a hearing on 22 June 2007, the applicant’s lawyer once again maintained that the applicant’s confessions had taken by coercion and that the applicant had been forced by the police to sign his statements. He asked the trial court not to rely on those statements. At the same hearing, the first-instance court again convicted the applicant under Article 125 of the Criminal Code then in force, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. It relied, inter alia, on the consistent confessions of the applicant and H.K. made during questioning, which were later repeated before the public prosecutor and the investigating judge, and the record of the reconstruction of events. It also took into account the weapons, bullets and explosives seized by the judicial authorities and the organisational documents as well as the incident report, hotel records, an autopsy and expert reports, photographs, witness statements and investigation reports. The trial court’s reasoned judgment did not contain any pronouncements as regards the admissibility of the applicant’s pre-trial statements. 22. On the same day, the applicant’s lawyer appealed against that judgment and alleged, inter alia, that the applicant’s statements had been taken without notifying him of his rights and as a result of coercion and death threats by the police. The applicant’s lawyer gave detailed accounts of such treatment and asked the Court of Cassation not to rely on these statements which had been obtained by impairing the applicant’s will. 23. On 12 February 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction. 24. On 18 February 2009 the judgment was pronounced in the absence of the applicant and his lawyer.",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1
72,001-180305,ENG,TUR,CHAMBER,2018,CASE OF SEVEN v. TURKEY,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Robert Spano;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström,"5. The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Ankara. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows. 7. At the time of the events giving rise to the application the applicant was serving as a chief police officer in Ankara. 8. On 12 April 2002 a woman named S.K. filed a criminal complaint with officers at Demirfırka police station, alleging that she had been taken into a police car by two officers on the pretext of her being a suspect. Afterwards, they had driven her around in the car and finally had taken her to an empty plot of land where she had been raped in the car by one of the police officers. He had been wearing glasses and had held a police radio in his hand. She identified the vehicle’s licence plate. 9. The applicant and the other police officer were immediately called into the police station for questioning as they had been assigned to the vehicle which had the licence plate identified by S.K. 10. In his statement to the police, made in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant said that he had picked up S.K. around 2 a.m. while he was patrolling with his colleague, S.A., on Talatpaşa Boulevard. He submitted that S.K., who had looked intoxicated, had hailed them, stopped their car, and told them that she worked as a “konsomatris”, a bar hostess who entertains male guests by keeping them company. She had asked for their help to go to a safe place and the applicant had offered to take her to her home, which she had declined. According to the applicant they had also offered to take her to the police station, which she had also declined. Finally, they had taken her to S.A.’s home with the intention of sobering her up. The applicant stated that when S.A. was in the kitchen preparing something to eat, S.K. had started behaving strangely, taking off her clothes and acting in a sexually inviting manner. The applicant said that as a result of being aroused he had simply ejaculated in his own hand but had not touched her. He had then called S.A. and told him that they had to leave immediately. The applicant stated that they had left S.K. in front of a hotel at 3 a.m. and had continued with their patrol until they had been called into the police station for questioning. 11. S.A. confirmed the applicant’s version of events in his statement to the police on the same day. 12. In an additional statement to the police, also made on the same day, S.K. told the police that she could not remember whether the police officers had taken her to an apartment or some other place as she had been very intoxicated. 13. A forensic medical examination of S.K. was carried out on the same day, showing that she had no bruises on her body. 14. A forensic expert report drafted on 15 April 2002 stated that the underwear that the applicant had been wearing on the night in question had S.K.’s and his own DNA on it. Furthermore, napkins found in the rubbish bin on the balcony of S.A.’s apartment had traces of the applicant’s semen. 15. On 6 June 2002 the Ankara governor decided to authorise the prosecution of the applicant and S.A. for alleged rape and abuse of authority. The applicant lodged an objection with the Ankara District Administrative Court seeking annulment of the governor’s decision, but it was dismissed. 16. On 15 November 2002 the Ankara public prosecutor filed an indictment with the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance, charging the applicant and S.A. with abuse of public authority and the unlawful use of a public vehicle under Article 240 of the former Turkish Criminal Code and section 16 of the Law on Vehicles (Law no. 237). 17. In her statement in the first-instance proceedings, S.K. said that she had flagged down a police car that day to ask for help. As she had been intoxicated, she could not remember exactly what had happened later or which officer had raped her. 18. The chief public prosecutor submitted an opinion on the merits and stated that the applicant’s conduct should be reclassified as rape and unlawful detention and that of S.A. as having aided and abetted those acts. He therefore argued that the case should be referred to the Ankara Assize Court, which has jurisdiction to hear such charges. 19. On 13 July 2004 the Ankara Criminal Court of First Instance ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the case. It found that the offences committed by the applicant while performing his official duties were rape and the unlawful detention of an adult, which were governed, inter alia, by Articles 251, 416 § 1 and 429 § 1 of the former Criminal Code, and the unlawful use of a public vehicle, which came under section 16 of Law no. 237. It stated that those offences had to be tried by assize courts and it therefore referred the case to the Ankara Assize Court. 20. At a hearing held on 24 March 2005, the Ankara Assize Court heard S.K. who, contrary to her previous statements, submitted that the officers had not raped her and had not taken her anywhere without her consent. She then submitted that she wished to withdraw her complaint. 21. On 13 September 2005 the Ankara Assize Court acquitted the applicant and S.A. of all charges, holding that there was no evidence of force on S.K.’s body, one of the constituent elements of the offences of rape and unlawful detention. The court further held that despite S.K.’s statement of 24 March 2005, the forensic report of 15 April 2002 had established that the applicant had had intercourse with her. In the absence of evidence that corroborated the fact of the applicant having forced himself on S.K., it could not be established beyond doubt that the act of sexual intercourse itself had not been consensual. The court stated in that connection that even if S.K. had been drunk that night, her allegations of rape and of being held against her will needed to be supported by some sign of resistance. In the light of the conclusion that there had been no indication of a criminal offence committed by the police officers, the court then held that the applicant and S.A. could not be deemed to have committed the separate offence of the unlawful use of a public vehicle. It therefore acquitted them of all the charges. 22. On 21 September 2005 the acquittal became final as no appeals had been made. 23. In the aftermath of the events of 12 April 2002 a preliminary disciplinary investigation was launched against the applicant and S.A. on 24 April 2002. 24. On 2 and 29 May 2002 the applicant was questioned in relation to the allegations of rape against him. He submitted that he had not had sexual intercourse with S.K. He repeated his earlier statements that S.K. had seduced him to the point where he had had to ejaculate in his own hand. The applicant was also requested to submit a written defence statement. He wrote that he had taken S.K. into the police car with the intention of helping her and had not forced himself on her, as alleged by S.K. He pointed out that the forensic expert evidence had established that there had been no traces of violence, whether on S.K.’s body or in the form of any other type of evidence, such as damage to property or blood stains at S.A.’s apartment or inside the police car. 25. An investigation report dated 6 June 2002, prepared by the police investigator, concluded that the applicant had committed the offence of rape, while S.A. was guilty of the offence of conduct unbecoming and incompatible with the civil service and therefore recommended that the applicant be sanctioned with a deferral of advancement to a higher rank for a period of twenty-four months. The report further stated that a recommendation for a separate criminal investigation against the applicant and S.A. had already been submitted to the governor’s office for authorisation. 26. On 28 November 2002, the Supreme Disciplinary Council found the applicant guilty of abuse of his authority as a police officer and of sexually assaulting S.K. Noting that the applicant’s appraisal scores had only been average for the years 1999 and 2000, and taking account of the shameful nature of the act he had committed, it found that the applicant could not be given a penalty that was less severe than the one decided on. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows: “... the victim complained to the police and confirmed the event by giving the licence plate number of the vehicle and accurately describing the officer as wearing glasses and holding a police radio in his hand. The applicant, on the other hand, hid the facts by denying that he had had intercourse with S.K. [D]espite the fact that the vaginal examination of the victim did not reveal the presence of any active or passive semen, the victim’s statement that she was menstruating on the night in question and the forensic evidence finding traces of both the applicant’s and S.K.’s DNA on the applicant’s underwear and the two napkins found in S.A.’s apartment containing the applicant’s DNA, point to the conclusion that the applicant must have ejaculated prematurely before sexual intercourse. He has therefore committed the offence of ‘sexual assault’ and he furthermore used his position as a police officer by calling the victim a ‘suspect’ in order to lure her into the police car ... Criminal proceedings are pending against the applicant on charges of abuse of authority under Article 240 of the Turkish Criminal Code. ... It has been decided unanimously to dismiss the accused from the police force, in accordance with section 8(6) and (7) of the Disciplinary Regulation of the Security Forces on the grounds that it has been proven that he has committed the offence of sexual assault and of using his position as a police officer for personal ... advantage.” 27. On an unspecified date the applicant objected to the Supreme Disciplinary Council’s decision before the Ankara Administrative Court. The applicant argued that his dismissal on the basis of a finding that he had committed sexual assault, although he had not been found guilty of that offence by a criminal court, had violated his right to the presumption of innocence. 28. On 4 July 2003 the Ankara Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s case, holding that the decision to dismiss the applicant from the police force had been in accordance with the law. The relevant parts of the judgment read as follows: “Acts, conduct and behaviour of the kind listed in section 8(6), ‘... rape, sexual assault, ... or attempting to commit any of those offences’ and in section 8 (7), ‘using his position as a police officer for his own or another person’s advantage’, are sanctioned with dismissal from the police force. After examination of the file, it appears that the case concerns the applicant’s dismissal from the police force on the basis of a disciplinary investigation which established that he had intercourse with a woman without her consent on the pretext of calling her a suspect .., by asking her to get into a police car so that he could verify her identity at the police station, although in the end he took her to a piece of empty land and had intercourse with her without her consent. On the basis of the case file, statements, the forensic report and other information, the veracity of the accusation is reinforced and therefore the decision to dismiss the applicant is in accordance with the law.” 29. On 13 March 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal by a majority by endorsing the reasons provided by the Ankara Administrative Court. One judge out of the five expressed a dissenting opinion, reasoning that the applicant had been acquitted of the charges in the parallel criminal proceedings, including of rape, and that therefore the disciplinary decision to dismiss him from the police force on those grounds could no longer be upheld. The dissenting judge further argued that the courts should have reclassified the applicant’s conduct as conduct that was incompatible with the reputation and trust inherent in the functions of an official and sanctioned him with the corresponding penalty of the deferral of moving to a higher rank for a period of sixteen months. 30. On 23 June 2006 the applicant submitted a request to rectify the decision of 13 March 2006, arguing in the main that the fact that he had been acquitted in the criminal proceedings and had been found innocent of the allegations of rape had not been taken into account in the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision. He further argued that the contradictory conclusions of the criminal and administrative courts in relation to what had happened on the night in question had cast doubt on his innocence. 31. The Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s request on 17 June 2008, holding that none of the reasons for rectification he had put forth fell within the exhaustive list of permissible grounds for such a decision in section 54 (1) of the Administrative Procedure Act (Law no. 2577). 32. In their observations the Government submitted that on 26 November 2008 the applicant had brought proceedings against the Ministry of the Interior and had requested that the reopening of the proceedings for his dismissal from the police force. The applicant relied on the Ankara Assize Court’s final judgment of 13 September 2005, acquitting him of the charges of, inter alia, attempted rape and abuse of authority. He argued before the Ankara Administrative Court that the establishment of his innocence should be regarded as new grounds for reopening the dismissal proceedings. On 27 May 2009 the applicant’s request was dismissed. The Court was not provided with a copy of that decision; however, the Government provided a summary of parts of it, which was not contested by the applicant. According to the Government, the administrative court held that “the decision of the Assize Court was available on the dates the Supreme Administrative Court examined the applicant’s appellate review and request for rectification of the decision, and that accordingly the court in question made an assessment of the decision rendered by the Assize Court”. 33. According to the information submitted by the Government, the applicant did not appeal against that decision.",['6'],['6-2'],[],[],[],[],1

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5. On 25 March 1996 the applicant brought a compensation claim for damages suffered as a consequence of an expropriation of his property against the Municipality of Bar and one of the local primary schools before the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Bar. 6. On 11 April 1996 the applicant’s representative informed the Court of First Instance that he had initiated a separate set of proceedings to determine the value of the above-mentioned damages. The Court of First Instance suspended the above mentioned civil proceedings pending the final resolution of this matter. 7. No document was submitted by the parties as to whether or not the compensation proceedings have ended in the meantime. Accordingly, it would appear that the said two sets of proceedings are still pending before the Court of First Instance. 8.

Serghides;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"6. The applicant was born in 1927 and lives in Izhevsk, the Republic of Udmurtiya. 7. The applicant is a retired person and a World War II veteran with a category 2 disability. 8. He is the owner of two-thirds of a house with outbuildings and an adjacent plot of land located in the vicinity of a public highway in Izhevsk. His wife lived there with him from 1958 until her death in 2011. They cultivated their garden to grow their own fruit and vegetables. 9. Between 2000 and 2002 the municipal authorities repaired the highway and raised the level of the road surface. 10. Since the completion of the repair works the applicant’s house and plot of land have been submerged by melted snow and groundwater every year. The house has been seriously damaged and, according to the applicant, is no longer habitable. 11. In 2004 the applicant brought proceedings against the municipal authorities and the municipal company that had repaired the road. He claimed that a drainage pipe had been installed in breach of technical requirements and in the absence of any specific project documentation. The authorities had not properly supervised or validated the works carried out, despite numerous technical shortcomings. This had resulted in his house being inundated by melted snow and groundwater in May 2002. Since then it had been regularly flooded. The applicant claimed compensation for the pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage he had sustained as a result of the flooding. He also asked the Industrialnyy District Court of Izhevsk (“the Industrialnyy District Court”) to order the municipal authorities to develop specific project documentation for the installation of a new drainage pipe and carry out the necessary repairs to the road. 12. On 19 March 2007 the Industrialnyy District Court examined the applicant’s claims. It established that between 2001 and 2002 the municipal authorities had carried out repair works to the public highway in the vicinity of the applicant’s house and had installed a drainage pipe. Regarding the flooding of the applicant’s house in May 2002, the court held that he had not proved the extent of the damage and that “no casual connection had been established between the actions of the municipal authorities and the damage”. Accordingly, there were no grounds to award the applicant compensation for pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage. The court also noted that according to an expert report issued in October 2006: “... the most probable cause of the inundation of the applicant’s house in 2002 was its position below the level of the road, lack of preparatory and protective engineering measures, road construction in the absence of project documentation ...” 13. The Industrialnyy District Court concluded that the flooding resulted from a malfunctioning drainage pipe located under the road surface. The authorities were therefore under an obligation to arrange for works to be carried out related to the collection of wastewater from the road and the area near the applicant’s house. 14. On 5 July 2007 the Supreme Court of the Republic of Udmurtiya (“the Supreme Court”) quashed the part of the judgment of 19 March 2007 refusing to award the applicant compensation for pecuniary damage and adopted a new decision to that effect. It held that the case material confirmed that since 2000 the applicant’s house had been regularly inundated by surface water coming from the road, which had not been properly maintained by the town administration. As a result, his property had been damaged. The Supreme Court awarded the applicant 68,900 Russian roubles (RUB) (about 1000 euros (EUR)) in compensation for the pecuniary damage sustained as a result of his house being flooded. It upheld the remainder of the judgment of 19 March 2007. 15. On 12 May 2009 the bailiffs’ service initiated enforcement proceedings. On an unspecified date the town administration engaged the services of the municipal highway service to unclog the drainage pipe. According to the certificate of acceptance, the highway service finished the works in July 2009. 16. On 23 November 2009 the bailiffs’ service terminated the enforcement proceedings. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision. 17. In April 2007 the applicant’s house and plot of land were again flooded. He sued the municipal authorities, claiming that his home and property had been flooded because the town administration had not complied with its obligation to install a waste water collection system for the road. He also claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 18. On 20 October 2008 Oktyabrskiy District Court of Izhevsk (“the Oktyabrskiy District Court”) terminated the proceedings in respect of the applicant’s claim regarding the municipal authorities’ obligation to repair the road, since it had already been examined and decided by the Industrialnyy District Court on 19 March 2007. 19. On 30 October 2008 the Oktyabrskiy District Court examined the remainder of the applicant’s claims. It established that since 2000 the applicant’s house had been regularly flooded because the town administration had not carried out the necessary repairs to the road. It further established that the town administration had not enforced the final judgment of 19 March 2007 and as a result the applicant’s house had been regularly flooded since its adoption. Having regard to the above, the court concluded that the flooding of the house in spring 2007 had been the fault of the town administration, which had not properly maintained the road. The court awarded the applicant RUB 132,017 (about EUR 2,000) in compensation for pecuniary damage and dismissed his claim in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 20. On 21 January 2009 the Supreme Court upheld that judgment. 21. In September 2010 the applicant brought a new set of proceedings against the municipal authorities. He submitted that his house had been regularly flooded because of the failure of the local authorities to install a waste water collection system next to his house. The flooding had continued after the enforcement of the judgment of 19 March 2007. As a result of regular flooding his house had been almost destroyed, the living conditions did not conform to the established sanitary standards and the air inside and around the house was permanently damp. The applicant also claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage. 22. The Oktyabrskiy District Court ordered an expert construction examination in the applicant’s case. According to the expert report dated 9 January 2013, which relied on Russian Building Regulations pertaining to roads and urban development (see paragraphs 42-48 below): “... the installation of a drainage system ordered by the judgment of 19 March 2007 ... has not been carried out ... [the applicant’s] house has been flooded since July 2009 [up to the date] of examination of [his] case in court. The waste water is collecting in [four neighbouring] streets, including the applicant’s. The road next to the applicant’s house is essentially horizontal and the diversion of [melted snow] ... has not been technically finalised (the diameter of the pipe has not been technically justified, its route and gradient not calculated) ... The water collection system which existed previously has been modified due to the unauthorised elevation of parts of the road and its surface and the newly constructed road ...” In the expert’s opinion, in order to protect the applicant’s house from yearly flooding it was necessary to carry out a land survey, draft a plan of the project, make the necessary calculations and perform repairs. 23. On 21 January 2013 the Oktyabrskiy District Court examined the applicant’s claims. It held that it was competent to do so in so far as they concerned the flooding of his house which occurred after enforcement of the judgment of 19 March 2007. 24. The court allowed the applicant’s claims in part. It established, in particular, that after enforcement in 2009 of the judgment of 19 March 2007 the applicant’s house had been regularly flooded as a result of the authorities’ failure to comply with their obligation to properly maintain the applicant’s street and the road near his house. The court ordered the municipal authorities to commission a project with a specialist firm for the construction of a drainage pipe on the part of the road adjacent to the applicant’s house, and to carry out construction works in accordance with that project by 1 July 2013. It dismissed the applicant’s claims in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage as there was “no causal link between the action or inaction of [the authorities] and the damage sustained [by the applicant]”. 25. On 22 April 2013 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 21 January 2013. It appears that the applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision. 26. On 16 August 2013 the Oktyabrskiy District Court issued a writ of execution. 27. On 4 September 2013 the bailiffs’ service instituted enforcement proceedings. 28. On 24 February 2014, after three formal demands under the writ of execution and in the absence of any action on the part of the town administration, the bailiffs’ service found it liable for the administrative offence of non-compliance with a writ of execution, and issued a fine of RUB 5,000 (about EUR 80). 29. In spring 2014 the applicant’s house was again flooded. 30. On 13 and 16 September 2014 the town administration signed two municipal contracts under the terms of which it engaged two companies to perform road repairs and anti-flood works on the part of the road adjacent to the applicant’s house. On 13 and 31 October 2014 respectively the works were completed. 31. On 5 November 2014 the bailiff terminated the enforcement proceedings following an on-site inspection and determined that the judgment of 21 January 2013 had been fully enforced. 32. The applicant appealed against that decision, complaining that the judgment in question had not been fully enforced. 33. On 4 February 2015 the Oktyabrskiy District Court dismissed his appeal, finding that the judgment had been fully enforced. 34. On 29 April 2015 the Supreme Court quashed that decision and adopted a new decision allowing the applicant’s complaint regarding the bailiff’s decision to terminate the proceedings. It held, in particular, that that decision had been unlawful and ordered the bailiffs’ service to reopen the enforcement proceedings. On 27 May 2015 the chief bailiff overturned the decision to terminate the enforcement proceedings in the applicant’s case. 35. On 8 July 2015 the Oktyabrskiy District Court examined the applicant’s claim concerning the failure of the town administration to enforce the judgment of 21 January 2013 within a reasonable time. The applicant claimed RUB 98,000 (about EUR 1,600) in respect of nonpecuniary damage. The court acknowledged that he had undeniably sustained non-pecuniary damage and awarded him RUB 10,000 (about EUR 160). It also noted that the necessary repairs had been carried out in October 2014 and that the applicant’s representative, Mr K., had stated in the proceedings that the flooding of the house had stopped. 36. On 19 October 2015 Mr K. acknowledged in writing that the judgment had been enforced. On 20 October 2015 the bailiff terminated the enforcement proceedings. 37. On 16 September 2013 the applicant applied to the Interdepartmental Commission (“the Commission”) attached to the Industrialnyy District administration to have his house declared unfit for habitation on account of the damage caused by regular flooding. 38. On 11 October 2013 the Commission held that over the years the applicant’s house had lost a number of its features. However, it was still possible to recover them by carrying out structural repairs. 39. On 18 October 2013 the head of the Industrialnyy District administration approved those conclusions and held that the applicant’s house was in need of structural repairs, that it was possible to carry them out and that they should be carried out by the owner. 40.

The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Moscow. 6. The applicant is a political activist, opposition leader, anticorruption campaigner and popular blogger. These five applications concern his arrests on seven occasions at different public events. 7. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 8. On 5 March 2012 the applicant took part in a meeting at Pushkinskaya Square, Moscow, which began at 7 p.m. It was devoted to the allegedly rigged presidential elections in Russia and had been approved by the municipal authorities. 9. At the end of the meeting, at 9 p.m., State Duma deputy Mr P. addressed the participants, inviting the public to stay after the meeting for informal consultations, which began at about 9.30 p.m. and were attended by some 500 people. According to the applicant, he stayed among others at Pushkinskaya Square for a meeting with the deputy; they remained peacefully within the pedestrian area of the square and did not obstruct the traffic or access. According to the Government, the applicant was holding an irregular gathering without prior notification and was shouting political slogans. 10. At 10.45 p.m. the police arrived and arrested the applicant, among many others. He was taken to the Tverskoy District police station. 11. On the same evening two policemen drew up a report on the administrative offence, stating that the applicant had been arrested at 10.45 p.m. “in a fountain” at Pushkinskaya Square; that he had taken part in an irregular public gathering and that he had ignored police orders to disperse. The applicant was charged with a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events, an offence under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The applicant was released at 12.15 a.m. on 6 March 2012. 12. On 15 March 2012 the Justice of the Peace of Circuit no. 369 of the Tverskoy District examined the administrative charges against the applicant. The applicant challenged the authenticity of the police reports and the witness statement of the two police officers on the grounds that he had been arrested by different police officers, but his objection was dismissed. On the basis of the written statements and testimony of two police officers the Justice of the Peace found the applicant guilty of taking part in an irregular public gathering conducted without prior notification and fined the applicant under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences 1,000 Russian roubles (RUB), at the material time equivalent to about 25 euros (EUR). 13. On 10 April 2012 the Tverskoy District court of Moscow examined the applicant’s appeal. The applicant was absent, but he was represented by a lawyer. The court examined one more eyewitness, a journalist, who testified that before being arrested the applicant was standing “in a fountain, holding hands with others” and chanting political slogans. He also testified that the police officers who had placed the applicant in the police bus were the same officers who had signed the report and who had appeared at the first-instance hearing. The court examined two video recordings submitted by the applicant. It found that the State Duma deputy had indeed called a public meeting, but concluded that at the time of his arrest the applicant was not meeting the deputy but was participating in a protest assembly. It upheld the judgment of 15 March 2012. 14. On 8 May 2012 the applicant took part in an overnight “walkabout”, an informal gathering whereby activists met at a public venue to discuss current affairs. On this occasion, several dozen activists met up to discuss the inauguration of Mr Putin as President of Russia the previous day. On 8 May 2012 some areas of central Moscow were restricted for traffic and pedestrians due to the presidential inauguration and the Victory Day festivities. 15. At 4.30 a.m., according to the applicant, or at 4 a.m., according to the Government, the applicant was walking down Lubyanskiy Proyezd, accompanied by about 170 people. The group stopped on the stairs of a public building for a group photograph. While the applicant was taking the photograph he was arrested by the riot police. At 8 a.m. he was taken to a police station where an administrative offence report was drawn up. The applicant was charged with a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events, an offence under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The applicant was released at 10.50 a.m. on that day. 16. On the same day, at 11.55 p.m., according to the Government, or at 11 p.m., according to the applicant, the applicant was walking down Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street in a cluster of about fifty people. According to the applicant, they stayed on the pavement, had no banners or sound equipment, and were causing no nuisance. They were surrounded by the riot police and the applicant was arrested without any order or warning. 17. At 11.58 p.m. on the same day the applicant was taken to a police station where an administrative offence report was drawn up. He was charged with a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events, an offence under Articles 20.2 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The applicant was released at 2.50 a.m. on 9 May 2012. 18. On 30 May 2012 the Justice of the Peace of Circuit no. 387 of the Basmannyy District examined the charges concerning the applicant’s administrative offence at Lubyanskiy Proyezd. The applicant was absent from the proceedings, but he was represented by his legal counsel, who contested the applicant’s participation in an irregular assembly and claimed that the latter had not chanted any slogans. He asked the Justice of the Peace to admit video evidence and to examine certain eyewitnesses, but she refused to do so. On the basis of written statements by two police officers the Justice of the Peace found the applicant guilty of taking part in a meeting conducted before 7 a.m., in breach of regulations, and fined him under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences RUB 1,000. This judgment was delivered in full on 1 June 2012. It was upheld on 6 July 2012 by the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow. 19. On 1 June 2012 the Justice of the Peace of Circuit no. 380 of the Presnenskiy District examined the administrative charges concerning the applicant’s administrative offence at Bolshaya Nikitskaya Street. The applicant was absent from the proceedings, but he was represented by his legal counsel, who contested the applicant’s participation in an irregular assembly and claimed that the latter had not chanted any slogans. The Justice of the Peace questioned the police officer who had arrested the applicant and three eyewitnesses. The police officer testified that he had arrested the applicant because he was walking in a big group of people, obstructing traffic and chanting political slogans. The eyewitnesses testified that the applicant was walking down the street among about fifty or sixty people, and that the police had blocked their way and had arrested them without any warning; they denied hearing any slogans or amplified sound. The Justice of the Peace refused to admit video evidence and dismissed the eyewitness statements on the grounds that they were likely to be the applicant’s supporters and were therefore biased. The applicant was found guilty of taking part in a meeting conducted in breach of regulations and was fined under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences RUB 1,000. This judgment was upheld on 25 June 2012 by the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow. 20. On 9 May 2012 the applicant arrived at 5 a.m. at Kudrinskaya Square in Moscow to take part in an informal meeting with a State Duma deputy and to attend the Victory Day festivities. He was among 50 to 100 people “walking about” and discussing current affairs. According to the applicant, this gathering was not a demonstration: there had been no banners, no noise, and no one was chanting any slogans or giving speeches. 21. At 6 a.m. riot police arrived at the site of the meeting and arrested the applicant without any orders or warning. The applicant submitted a video recording of his arrest. 22. At 8.50 a.m. on the same day the applicant was taken to the Strogino District police station. At 11.50 a.m. the applicant was searched and then an administrative offence report was drawn up. According to the applicant, he was detained at the police station for more than three hours before he was brought before a Justice of the Peace. The Government confirmed that the applicant had been detained pending trial, but did not specify the time. 23. At an unidentified time on the same day the applicant was brought before the Justice of the Peace of Circuit no. 375 of the Presnenskiy District of Moscow. The Justice of the Peace refused the applicant’s requests for the police officers who had arrested him to be called and examined, and for video evidence to be admitted, but granted his request for three eyewitnesses to be examined. The witnesses testified that there had been a public meeting with a State Duma deputy to discuss current political developments; that no one had chanted slogans or made noise or obstructed traffic; and that the police had not given any orders or warnings before arresting the applicant. On the basis of the written statements of two police officers the court established that the applicant had taken part in an irregular public meeting and had disobeyed a lawful order from the police to disperse. It also found that the applicant had chanted the slogans “Russia without Putin!” and “Putin is a thief!” and had refused to leave the square, which needed to be cleared for the Victory Day festivities. The Justice of the Peace has rejected the statements of three eyewitnesses, on the grounds that they had different estimates of the number of people present at the venue, the number of police officers who arrested the applicant, and the time of his arrival at the meeting. The applicant was found guilty of disobeying the lawful order of the police, in breach of Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and was sentenced to fifteen days’ administrative detention. 24. On 10 May 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal. 25. On 12 December 2012 the Presnenskiy District Court of Moscow examined the appeal. The applicant asked for the police officers on whose reports and statements the Justice of the Peace had based the judgment to be cross-examined, as well as eight eyewitnesses, and for the video recording of the arrest to be admitted as evidence. The court dismissed these requests and upheld the judgment of 9 May 2012. 26. On 27 October 2012 the applicant held a static demonstration (“picket”, пикетирование), which was a part of series of pickets held in Moscow in front of the Russian Investigation Committee to protest “against repressions and torture”. According to the applicant, his demonstration was a solo picket (одиночное пикетирование) which was not subject to a prior notification to the competent public authority. In total, about thirty people consecutively took part in this event. 27. At 3.30 p.m. the police arrested the applicant. According to the applicant, at the moment of arrest he had finished picketing and was walking down the street on the pavement; he was not chanting or carrying any banners, but he was being followed by some people including journalists whose number he estimated as “two dozen”. According to the Government, the applicant had organised an irregular march without prior notification. The applicant was taken to the police station at 4.10 p.m. He was charged with a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events, an offence under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. He was released at 7.17 p.m. the same day. 28. On 30 October 2012 the Justice of the Peace of Circuit no. 387 of Basmannyy District examined the charges. She examined three eyewitnesses called at the applicant’s request, but his request for the police officers who had arrested him to be called and examined was refused. The applicant’s request for a video recording of the relevant events to be admitted as evidence was also refused, as was the request for a written report from an NGO that had observed the pickets to be admitted in evidence. At the applicant’s request the Justice of the Peace examined three eyewitnesses, who testified that the applicant, after he ended his picket, walked down the street while speaking with a fellow activist, surrounded by journalists; he remained on the pavement, did not chant slogans, and carried no banners; several other participants in the picket remained standing with their banners, at a certain distance from each other; the police arrested the applicant without any warning or explanation. On the basis of the written reports by two police officers the Justice of the Peace found the applicant guilty of taking part in a march which had not been duly notified to the authorities and fined him under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences RUB 30,000 (at the material time equivalent to about EUR 740). She dismissed the witness statements in the applicant’s favour on the grounds that they contradicted the evidence in the case file. 29. On 7 December 2012 the Basmannyy District Court upheld the judgment of 30 October 2012. 30. On 24 February 2014 at 12 noon the applicant went to the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow to attend the hearing of the activists on trial for participation in mass disorders at Bolotnaya Square in Moscow on 6 May 2012. On that day the judgment was to be delivered at a public hearing. The court-house was cordoned off by the police, and the applicant could not get in. He therefore remained outside among other members of the public wishing to attend the hearing. According to the applicant he was standing there silently, but the police suddenly rushed into the crowd and arrested him, without any order, warning or pretext. According to the official version, he was holding an irregular gathering and was chanting political slogans. 31. At 12.50 p.m. on the same day the applicant was taken to the police station. He was charged with a breach of the established procedure for conducting public events, an offence under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The applicant was released at 3 p.m. the same day. 32. Later that day, at about 7.45 p.m., the applicant took part in a public gathering following the pronouncement of the judgment concerning mass disorders at Bolotnaya Square in which several activists had been sentenced to prison terms. The gathering of about 150 participants took place at Tverskaya Street. The applicant was arrested while he was standing on the pavement talking to a journalist. According to the applicant he had received no order or warning, and he did not resist the police. According to the police report, when the applicant was being seated in the police vehicle he was waving at the crowd trying to attract media attention, thus demonstrating refusal to comply with the police order and resisting the officers in the performance of their duties. 33. At 8.20 p.m. the applicant was taken to the Tverskoy District police station, where an administrative offence report was drawn up. The applicant was charged with disobeying a lawful order of the police, an offence under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences. He was remanded in custody. 34. On the following day, 25 February 2014, at an unidentified time, the applicant was brought before the judge of the Tverskoy District Court, who examined the charges under Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences. The applicant’s request for two eyewitnesses to be examined was granted. They testified that the police had not given the applicant any orders or warnings before proceeding to his arrest. The court admitted and examined the video recording of the contested events and questioned the two police officers on whose reports the charges were based. The court established that the applicant had taken part in an irregular meeting and had disobeyed the lawful order of the police to disperse. The applicant was found guilty of disobeying a lawful order of the police, in breach of Article 19.3 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and was sentenced to seven days’ administrative detention. 35. On 7 March 2014 the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court examined the charges relating to the applicant’s alleged participation on 24 February 2014 in an unauthorised public gathering in front of the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court. The applicant requested that two eyewitnesses present at the court-house and the two policemen on whose reports the charges were based be examined. These requests were dismissed. The court admitted a video recording of the contested events, but decided not to take cognisance of its content because it had no date and because it had not reproduced a full sequence of events. On the basis of the written reports by two police officers the judge found the applicant guilty of taking part in a meeting which had not been notified to the competent authority in accordance with the procedure provided by law, and fined him under Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences RUB 10,000 (equivalent to about EUR 200). 36. On 24 March 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 25 February 2014. 37. On 22 May 2014 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment of 7 March 2014.","['11', '5', '6']","['11-1', '5-1', '6-1']",[],['6'],['6-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1992 and lives in Baku. 6. A demonstration was planned to be held on 12 March 2011 in Baku. Prior to the assembly, on 7 March 2011, the organisers, members of the opposition, gave notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). 7. The BCEA refused to authorise the demonstration at the place indicated by the organisers and proposed a different location on the outskirts of Baku – the grounds of a driving school situated in the 20th habitable area of the Sabail District. 8. The organisers nevertheless decided to hold the demonstration in the centre of Baku. According to the applicant, the demonstration was intended to be peaceful and was conducted in a peaceful manner. The participants were protesting against, inter alia, corruption and demanding the resignation of the President of the State. 9. The applicant attended the demonstration, but shortly after it had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered. The applicant was arrested during the dispersal operation and was taken to three different police stations consecutively. 10. According to the applicant, he was arrested at around 2 p.m. His arrest and custody in the police stations were video recorded on a mobile phone by one of the protesters, Mr A.H. 11. On the day of the applicant’s arrest, an administrative-offence report (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) was drawn up in respect of him by police officer E.G. The report stated that at around 2.55 p.m., at Fountains Square in Baku, the applicant had attempted to hold an unlawful demonstration and had disobeyed a lawful order of a police officer. He had been charged with administrative offences under Article 298 (violation of the rules on holding public assemblies) and Article 310.1 (failure to comply with a lawful order of a police officer) of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”). 12. On the same day two police officers, M.A. and H.A., prepared a report (raport) for a superior, stating that at around 4 p.m. during the demonstration they had arrested ten individuals. The report contained a list of the arrested protesters. According to the applicant, his name – the eleventh on the list – was added to the report later in different handwriting. 13. According to the official records, the administrative-offence report in the applicant’s respect was prepared on the basis of the abovementioned report drawn up by police officers M.A. and H.A. 14. According to the applicant, he has never been served with a copy of the administrative-offence report or with other documents from his case file. He was also not given access to a lawyer after the arrest or while he was in police custody. 15. On the day of his arrest the applicant was brought before a firstinstance court, the Sabail District Court. 16. A State-funded lawyer was appointed to assist the applicant. None of the material submitted to the Court contains any record showing that the State-funded lawyer, Mr E.N., made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicant. 17. No witnesses were questioned during the court hearing. 18. By a decision of 12 March 2011, the court convicted the applicant under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to eight days’ administrative detention. 19. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal with the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that his arrest and conviction were in violation of his right to freedom of assembly and that the hearing before the firstinstance court had not been fair. He argued that he had participated in the demonstration because he had had a constitutional right to do so, but that he had not disobeyed any order of a police officer. 20. The applicant also asked the appellate court to summon and examine witnesses on his behalf (namely, Mr A.H., Mr A.M. and Mr R.M.) who, according to the applicant, had witnessed his arrest and time in custody, and to examine the video recordings made by Mr A.H., which, according to the applicant, showed his arrest and custody in the police stations. He further asked the court to order a handwriting examination of the report prepared by police officers M.A. and H.A., in order to establish whether his name had been added to it by one of those two police officers. The applicant alleged that his name had been added to the mentioned report as the eleventh person in the list later and in different handwriting. 21. The applicant was represented before the Baku Court of Appeal by a lawyer of his own choosing. 22. On 18 March 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal partially granted the applicant’s appeal and remitted the case to the first-instance court for reexamination. The Court of Appeal found that the first-instance court had failed to examine the report prepared by police officers M.A. and H.A. The court also held that the case-file contained only a photocopy and not the original of that report and, therefore, it had not been possible to order its expert examination. The court did not address the applicant’s abovementioned requests to summon and examine the witnesses on his behalf and to examine the video recordings. 23. On 12 April 2011 the Sabail District Court re-examined the case. 24. According to the applicant, he was not given an opportunity to appoint a lawyer of his own choosing. 25. A State-funded lawyer was appointed to assist him. 26. The only witnesses questioned during the court hearing were police officers M.A. and E.G. The former testified that the applicant had been detained for having participated in an unlawful assembly, making noise and disobeying the lawful orders of the police. The latter testified that he had prepared the administrative-offence report. 27. By a decision of 12 April 2011, the court convicted the applicant under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to seven days’ administrative detention. 28. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed. He argued before the Baku Court of Appeal that his arrest and conviction had been in violation of his right to freedom of assembly. He also complained that his arrest had been unlawful, and that the rehearing before the first-instance court had not been fair. 29. The applicant again requested that witnesses on his behalf (namely, Mr A.H., Mr A.M., Mr R.M. and Mr R.B.) be summoned and heard. In addition, he challenged the reliability of the official records related to his arrest and police custody. He pointed out in particular the discrepancy between the time of arrest indicated in the administrative-offence report and the report prepared by police officers M.A. and H.A. The applicant repeated his allegation that his name had been added as the eleventh person on the list in the mentioned report later. The applicant asked the appellate court to hear at least three individuals listed along with him in the report prepared by police officers M.A. and H.A. He further asked the court to examine certain photographs and the video recordings made during his arrest and time in police custody. 30. The applicant was not represented before the Baku Court of Appeal by a lawyer. 31. On 28 April 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance court’s decision. 32. The appellate court did not address the applicant’s above-mentioned requests to summon and hear the witnesses and to examine the photographs and video recordings. 33. On 8 August 2014 Mr I. Aliyev, who represented the applicant before the Court, was arrested on charges of large-scale tax evasion, abuse of power and illegal entrepreneurship. On the same day he was detained pending trial. The circumstances relating to Mr Aliyev’s arrest and detention are the subject of a separate application brought by him before the Court (application no. 68762/14). 34. On 8 and 9 August 2014 the prosecuting authorities conducted a search of Mr Aliyev’s home and office. During the search the domestic authorities seized a large number of documents, including all the case files relating to the pending applications before the Court, which were in Mr Aliyev’s possession as a representative. The file relating to the present case, which, it appears, included copies of all the documents and correspondence between the Court and the parties, was also seized in its entirety. No adequate inventory of the seized files relating to the Court proceedings was made in the search and seizure records of 8 and 9 August 2014. 35. On an unspecified date Mr Aliyev lodged a complaint with the Nasimi District Court, claiming that the search had been unlawful. He further complained about the seizure of the documents and files relating to the pending court proceedings before the Court and the domestic courts. 36. On 12 September 2014 the Nasimi District Court dismissed Mr Aliyev’s claim. It held that the searches had been conducted in accordance with the relevant law. As to the seizure of the documents relating to the cases pending before the Court and the domestic courts, it found that they could not be returned to the applicants at that stage of the proceedings. Following an appeal, on 23 September 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court’s decision of 12 September 2014. 37. On 25 October 2014 the investigating authorities returned a number of the case files concerning the applications lodged with the Court, including the file relating to the present case, to Mr Aliyev’s lawyer. The investigator’s relevant decision specified that “since it has been established that among documents seized on 8 and 9 August 2014 there were files concerning applications by a number of individuals and organisations lodged with the European Court of Human Rights, which have no relation to the substance of the criminal proceedings [against Mr Intigam Aliyev], [those files] have been delivered to [Mr Aliyev’s lawyer] Mr Javad Javadov”.","['11', '34', '5', '6']","['11-1', '5-1', '6-1', '6-3']",[],[],[],[],1

ROMANIA,3,Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 11 - Freedom of assembly and association (Article 11-1 - Freedom of association);Pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage - award,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Nona Tsotsoria,"5. On 28 June 2005 the applicant association lodged an application with the Bucharest District Court, seeking to be granted legal personality and to be registered as an association in the Register of Associations and Foundations kept by that court. According to its Articles, the founders of the applicant association were the other nine applicants. The Board of the association had five members, while Ms Neagu was designated as the President of the Association. In support of its application, the applicant association appended a document issued by the Ministry of Justice confirming that the name chosen for the association was available, as well as a copy of its Memorandum (act constitutiv) and Articles (statut), which, in their relevant parts, read: “The goal of the association is to protect the rights and the legitimate interests of its members before all domestic authorities with the capacity to administer, supervise and/or enact justice. The objectives of the association are: - to support and promote the relationship between its members and those authorised by law to protect their rights and interests; - to monitor the activity of the Romanian justice system with the aim of reporting to the relevant authorities any injustice, irregularities or illegalities committed by Romanian judges; - to present in the media any cases of manifest unfairness or bias in the application of the law, in so far as the public has the right to be aware of any negative aspects of the activities of the Romanian justice system; - to support its members in their undertakings before any international court; - to organise any form of protest (marches, public gatherings, picketing), with prior authorisation from the authorities and in accordance with the law; - to signal the gravity and the public danger represented by an non-impartial or an incompetent judicial system; - to create a database of all cases involving its members that are pending before the authorities; - to cooperate with the legislative bodies by providing them with ideas, projects, proposals, etc. with the aim of improving the functioning of the Romanian judicial system.” 6. On 30 November 2005 the court rejected the application, holding that the goal of the applicant association was in breach of Article 40 § 2 of the Romanian Constitution, which states that “an organisation which, by its aims or activity, militates against political pluralism, the principles of a State governed by the rule of law, or against the sovereignty, integrity or independence of Romania shall be unconstitutional”. The court noted as follows: “In its Articles, the applicant [association] starts from the premise that a group of individuals who consider themselves victims of judges – as a result of having had their own cases brought before the judicial authorities – want to form an association which would promote their interests, notably by using any legal means for publicising any alleged injustice, irregularity or illegality, and also by lawfully protesting against all of these aspects. Such a premise, also implicit in the name of the association, is profoundly unconstitutional in that a group of individuals is stating proprio motu that a judgment can be unfair or irregular or an expression of illegality. All these aspects encourage non-compliance with courts’ judgments and represent a form of attack on one of the State’s powers, namely the judiciary.(...) The infringement is prescribed by law ... in so far as the association is not constitutional because of its aims. The measure aims to protect public order and the rights of others. (...) The measure is necessary in so far as the image of the justice system is currently a matter of national interest, and any attack on the courts is therefore an issue of particular gravity which justifies the refusal to grant legal personality to an association that wants to promote an unfavourable image of justice, in the light of the fact that none of its members has the authority to note (calitatea sǎ constate) any “injustice, irregularity or illegality committed by the judges” because it is only the State authorities appointed to make inquiries in that regard which have jurisdiction to pronounce a conclusion on such matters.” The court did not consider it necessary to give the applicant association the opportunity to remedy the impugned irregularity by modifying its Articles, as prescribed by Article 9 of Government Ordinance no. 26/2000, in so far as it considered that any modification of the aims of the applicant association rendering it constitutional would alter the very essence of the association. 7. The applicant association appealed against the judgment before the Bucharest County Court. It stressed that, according to its Articles, all the association’s activities had to be conducted in compliance with the law and its aim could therefore not be regarded as unconstitutional. 8. On 16 February 2006 the Bucharest County Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the reasoning given by the first-instance court. The court referred also to the provisions in the applicant association’s Articles, according to which the Board of the association was competent to accept or reject a membership request on the basis of its own assessment of whether or not the aspiring member was a victim of a breach of his or her rights in a trial before a judge. Such competence was unlawful in so far as the Board thus exercised a form of discretion in assessing whether there were breaches of rights, legitimate interests and/or law by the judges. In claiming to have such competence, the Board was attempting to usurp the domestic and international institutions empowered to make such assessments, which was unconstitutional, illegitimate and unlawful. Furthermore, the court held that the Articles did not comply with legal requirements concerning the disposal of the association’s assets in the event of its dissolution. The Articles prescribed that “in event of dissolution, the disposal of the assets would be decided by the General Meeting, in compliance with the provisions of Article 60”, while the law, namely article 6 § 3 g) of the Ordinance “required that the procedure should be set down in the Articles itself”.",['11'],['11-1'],[],[],[],[],1

81,001-159926,ENG,HUN,CHAMBER,2016,CASE OF MIRACLE EUROPE KFT v. HUNGARY,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Tribunal established by law),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant is a limited liability company registered under Hungarian law, with its seat in Budapest. 6. In a dispute concerning a construction project envisaged in public procurement, in January 2012 the applicant company brought an action in damages against a university. 7. The President of the territorially competent Budapest High Court requested the National Judicial Office (“NJO”) to reassign the case to another court of the same jurisdictional level. In the request the President provided particulars about the case to be reassigned and indicated the data and the circumstances which prevented the adjudication, within a reasonable time, of this case, deemed to be of high importance, by relying on, in particular, the case-load of judges hearing civil cases, significantly exceeding the national average. 8. The President of the NJO examined the case-load statistics of the Budapest High Court, including the volume of highly important and priority cases and the workload of judges hearing civil cases. She found that, in view of the short statutory time-limits, the adjudication of the case within a reasonable time could only be ensured by reassigning the case to another court. 9. By requesting information from the President of the Zalaegerszeg High Court, the President of the NJO also examined the case-load and the operational conditions, including staff and facilities, of the Civil Division of the Zalaegerszeg High Court. On the basis of this information, the President of the NJO was satisfied that the reassignment of the case to the Zalaegerszeg High Court would not impose a disproportionate burden on that court. 10. For the sake of judicial economy as appreciated above, on 16 February 2012 the President of the NJO case assigned the case to the Zalaegerszeg High Court (decision no. 29/2012. (II.16.) OBHE), acting within the powers conferred upon her by the law. 11. The Zalaegerszeg High Court heard the case and dismissed the claim on 5 June 2012. That decision was confirmed by the Pécs Court of Appeal on 18 September 2012, a ruling served on 12 October 2012. The latter’s territorial competence to hear the appeal was a consequence of the case having been assigned to the Zalaegerszeg High Court. 12. Meanwhile, on 17 September 2012 the National Judicial Council issued decision no. 58/2012 on “the guidelines to be observed in respect of case reassignment”. 13. On 7 September 2013 the Kúria upheld the decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal in review proceedings. The courts held in essence that the applicant company’s perception according to which the university had unlawfully backed out of the investment contract (namely, the construction of a dormitory) was nothing more than a misconception of the law and a tendentious interpretation of the circumstances, and that the facts of the case did not reveal any compensation liability on the respondent’s side, for want of unlawfulness. 14. Meanwhile, on 13 December 2012 the applicant filed a constitutional complaint. It counted – and complied with – the statutory sixty-day time-limit to do so from the service of the final decision in the case, i.e. from 12 October 2012. It claimed firstly that the domestic courts had reached their decisions in an arbitrary manner and, secondly, that it was deprived of a “tribunal established by law”, since by decision no. 29/2012. (II.16.) OBHE the President of the NJO had reassigned the case from the originally competent court to the Zalaegerszeg High Court. 15. The constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible on 10 June 2013 (decision no. 3123/2013. (VI. 24.) AB). The Constitutional Court held that the case as a whole did not reveal any arbitrariness or unfairness as such. As regards the specific complaint about the reassignment, it held that this issue was severable from the main procedure. It was of the view that the sixty-day statutory time-limit had run, in that respect, from the very reassignment decision of 16 February 2012 – rather than from 12 October 2012 as construed by the applicant – and for that reason this part of the motion was time-barred. 16. On 2 December 2013 the Constitutional Court adopted decision no. 36/2013. (XII.5.) AB in the matter of reassignment, in pursuit of constitutional complaints originating in cases other than that of the applicant. It held that the regulations which entitled the President of the NJO to reassign cases among courts (notably, sections 62 and 63 of Act no. CLXI of 2011 on the Organisation and Administration of Courts, as in force between 1 January and 16 July 2012, see paragraph 20 below) had been unconstitutional and in violation of Article 6 of the Convention. According to the Constitutional Court, the right for one’s “natural” (lawful) judge flows from the right to have one’s case examined by a court “established by law” and requires that a case be heard by a judge belonging to the court with competence and territorial jurisdiction and designated by the pre-established objective rules of case assignment of that court. In the Constitutional Court’s view, the impugned regulations, which had conferred responsibility for the reassignment of cases, at least in the material period, entirely on the President of the NJO, had been in breach of those principles. Moreover, it had violated the requirement of the appearance of impartiality. The Constitutional Court also held that the lack of a remedy against the decision of the President of the NJO had violated the Fundamental Law, as well as Article 13 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court did not prescribe any particular legal consequence of this decision for the ongoing procedures concerned by re-assignment. Consequently, the Constitutional Court’s decision did not invalidate any reassignment decisions taken previously (see paragraphs 19 and 24 below).",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1977. According to the most recently available information, in June 2013 the applicant was placed by a court under house arrest in the town of Bryanka, Ukraine. The applicant has not informed the Court of his current whereabouts. 6. In January 2012 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking. 7. On 30 January 2012 the applicant was placed in the Starobilsk Pre-Trial Detention Centre (Старобільський слідчий ізолятор) (“the SIZO”). On arrival the applicant was examined by a general practitioner, a psychiatrist, a dentist, a tuberculosis specialist and a dermatologist. According to the Government, the applicant was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (“HIV”) (clinical stage 3), chronic bronchitis, toxic encephalopathy and neuropathy caused by prolonged use of drugs, and tuberculosis residual changes. At that time the applicant’s weight was 55 kg. The applicant is 1.78 metres tall. 8. According to the Government, on 1 February 2012 the applicant was offered a CD4+ cell count, which he refused. The case-file material includes a written note dated 7 February 2012 that the applicant refused “a blood test”. It is signed by a member of staff of the SIZO medical unit. 9. According to the Government, between 30 January 2012 and 8 January 2013 the applicant did not ask for any medical assistance in the SIZO. However, it appears from the applicant’s medical file that in September 2012 he was examined by a tuberculosis specialist and underwent an X-ray. According to the medical records provided by the Government, in November 2012, while briefly detained in a different temporary detention facility, the applicant had bronchitis and complained of kidney pain. 10. On 8 January 2013, following the applicant’s complaint of a cough and a fever, he was diagnosed with chronic bronchitis and was prescribed treatment. 11. On 9 January 2013 the applicant was found unconscious in his cell. 12. On the same day the Head of the SIZO requested the Bryankivskyy Local Court to accelerate the proceedings in the applicant’s case or to release him on an undertaking not to abscond, since the applicant needed urgent medical treatment in a specialised hospital. 13. On 10 January 2013 the above court decided that the applicant should remain in pre-trial detention but should be placed either in a specialised prison hospital or in a civilian hospital. 14. According to a medical certificate, between 9 and 11 January 2013 the applicant was in hospital. He was diagnosed with acute serose meningoencephalitis. It was noted that the applicant was “in a soporose state”. 15. On 11 January 2013 the applicant was returned to the SIZO, where he stayed in the medical unit until 15 February 2013. During this period the applicant was also an inmate at least once in the Alchevsk Temporary Detention Facility (“Alchevsk ITT”) (Алчевський ізолятор тимчасового тримання). 16. On 17 January 2013 the applicant requested under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that the respondent Government be asked to place him in a hospital. It was argued that the applicant needed additional examination, in particular by a psychiatrist, in order to be prescribed anti-retroviral therapy (“the ART”), and for the stage of his tuberculosis to be correctly determined and for appropriate treatment to be prescribed, as well for him to be provided with adequate medical assistance in respect of the epilepsy from which the applicant allegedly suffered. 17. According to the applicant’s lawyer, Ms Semenyuk, at the end of January 2013 she received a call from an unknown man who presented himself as an employee of a prosecutor’s office. The person wanted to know whether Ms Semenyuk indeed represented the applicant and whether the applicant had lodged an application to the European Court of Human Rights. Ms Semenyuk replied positively to both questions. 18. On 4 February 2013 the Bryankivsk Medical Unit (Брянківське територіальне медичне об’єднання) informed the applicant’s lawyer that since 11 October 2010 the applicant had been registered as receiving regular medical examinations by a doctor of the “Trust” practice based in the Bryanka Central City Polyclinic. He was diagnosed as HIV-positive (clinical stage 2), with chronic bronchitis and toxic encephalopathy. On 27 October 2010 his CD4+ cell count was 374 (18.7%). The applicant refused treatment despite the deterioration of his condition. In 2011 he was diagnosed as HIV-positive at clinical stage 3. The applicant did not take ART, as he had refused the relevant examination. On 8 February 2013 the same information was submitted to the SIZO. 19. The Government submitted that between 11 January and 15 February 2013 the applicant had received treatment for acute serous cerebromeningitis. Moreover, on 5 February 2013 he was X-rayed and seen by a tuberculosis specialist. Following the results of those examinations the applicant was diagnosed with residual changes in the right lung as a result of tuberculosis from which he had already recovered. There was no need for anti-tuberculosis treatment. 20. On 6 February 2013 the applicant was examined by a neuropathologist. He was diagnosed with HIV (clinical stage 3) and toxic encephalopathy. 21. On 19 February 2013 the Bryankivskyy Local Court sentenced the applicant to six and a half years’ imprisonment for drug trafficking. 22. On 26 February 2013 the applicant’s CD4+ cell count was performed with a result of 119 cells (13.1%). 23. By a letter of 7 March 2013 the Government informed the Court that there was no need for the applicant to be hospitalised. 24. On 12 March 2013 the applicant was examined by an infectious diseases specialist and diagnosed with HIV (clinical stage 3), chronic bronchitis, residual effects of tuberculosis, and toxic encephalopathy. ART was recommended. On 14 March 2013 the Lugansk Regional Prisons Department approved the applicant’s admission to the Lugansk Temporary Detention Centre No. 17 Hospital (лікарня при Луганському слідчому ізоляторі №17). 25. The applicant was in that hospital between 20 and 25 March 2013. In addition to the above diagnosis the applicant was diagnosed with weight loss of more than 10% and chronic hepatitis C. The applicant underwent a full blood count, biochemical blood test, sputum and urine test, X-ray and ultrasonography. The applicant was given medication. On discharge a CD4+ count was recommended, among other things. 26. On 22 March 2013 the Court refused the applicant’s request under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. 27. The applicant was also in the Lugansk Temporary Detention Centre Hospital between 29 March and 5 April and between 12 April and 12 May 2013. On 3 April 2013 he had a CD4+ cell count with a result of 13.5%, or 519 cells. On 16 April 2013 ART was prescribed for the applicant. 28. On 24 May 2013 the Lugansk Regional Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 19 February 2013 in the criminal case against the applicant and remitted the case for a fresh court consideration. 29. On an unknown date the applicant’s lawyer applied to the local court for the applicant’s release, stating that between 20 January 2012 and 9 January 2013 the applicant had received no medical treatment. After 9 January 2013 the applicant was in hospital for some time, but was not now receiving in-patient care. 30. On 19 June 2013 the Bryankovskyy Town Court released the applicant and placed him under house arrest. The court noted that the case-file materials contained enough evidence to satisfy the applicant’s lawyer’s request. The court further noted that the applicant required medical treatment which he could not receive in detention. 31. On 25 January 2013 the applicant was placed in the Alchevsk ITT for the duration of the consideration of his case by the court. 32. At 9 a.m. on 30 January 2013 an ambulance was called for the applicant as he had acute pain in the liver. The applicant was examined and it was recommended that he see a gastroenterologist. The applicant was then taken to Bryanka Central Town Hospital and brought back to the ITT at around 4 p.m. 33. According to the applicant, at around 5.25 p.m. he was beaten up in the ITT by two policemen allegedly from the regional police office. They told him to write that the SIZO had provided him with adequate medical treatment. One of the police officers hit the applicant six or seven times in the liver and the other hit him four times in the kidneys. After that the applicant wrote the statement requested. 34. On 31 January 2013 the applicant’s lawyer, S., complained about this matter at a court hearing. An ambulance was called for the applicant and he was diagnosed with a “possible blunt abdominal trauma”. He was taken to hospital and examined by a surgeon. The latter noted that the applicant complained of pain in the upper abdomen and weakness, but upon examination the applicant’s abdomen was “soft and pain-free”. It was concluded that there was no “acute surgical pathology” and that the applicant could be detained in the ITT. 35. On the same day the applicant and his lawyer complained about the beatings to a prosecutor. The applicant stated that on 30 January 2013 at 5.25 p.m. unknown policemen had visited him in the ITT. He was subjected to physical and psychological pressure and forced to withdraw his application about lack of adequate medical assistance. They also forced him to confess to a crime he was charged with. 36. In the course of the investigation the applicant further testified that on 30 January 2013 at around 5.20 p.m. two unknown policemen had questioned him in the ITT. When he refused to write that he had no complaints about the medical treatment in the SIZO, the policemen hit him several times in the abdomen and kidneys. After that the applicant wrote that he had been provided with adequate medical assistance in the SIZO, that he had no complaints, and that there had been no psychological or physical pressure. The policemen took a written statement from him and he was taken to the shower room and then back to his cell. 37. On 14 February 2013 the forensic medical expert, having examined the medical conclusion of the surgeon of 31 January 2013 and the testimonies of the same surgeon given during the investigation, concluded that “when examined by a surgeon on 31 January 2013 the applicant had no injuries”. 38. On 25 February 2013 the Alchevsk Town Prosecutor terminated the proceedings for absence of evidence of crime. Police officers and others present in the ITT on 30 January 2013 gave a detailed description of what had happened there that day and stated that nobody had beaten the applicant. In particular, at around 4 p.m. the applicant complained that he wanted a different pillow. The applicant was guided to the room where the bedding was kept. The applicant spent around 15-20 minutes there but did not choose a pillow. Then he was guided to the room where personal belongings were kept because he wanted something from his bag. After that the applicant wanted to take a shower but was told that there was no hot water. Since he wanted to check this himself an ITT guard guided him to the shower. Later the applicant was placed back in his cell. The surgeon, who examined the applicant on 31 January 2013, testified that the applicant had been brought to him in order to check whether the applicant could be detained in the ITT. The applicant had no injuries. The prosecutor also referred to the conclusion of a forensic medical examination that the applicant had no injuries. 39. The applicant appealed against this decision to a court. On 26 March 2013 the Alchevskyy Town Court quashed this decision. The court questioned the applicant and his cellmate, K., and considered that the investigation had not been thorough, since the applicant’s cellmates had not been questioned. 40. On 24 April 2013 the ambulance station informed the Bryanka Prosecutor’s Office that on 31 January 2013 the applicant had been examined and diagnosed with “blunt abdominal trauma”. He had complained that he had been beaten up in detention. The applicant was taken to hospital for the diagnosis to be confirmed. 41. On 25 April 2013 the proceedings were terminated for absence of evidence of crime. In addition to those previously questioned more evidence was added. 42. In particular, in the course of the investigation the applicant’s cellmate K. testified that on 30 January 2013 the applicant had been taken out of the cell. He was absent for approximately 40-60 minutes. Upon return the applicant told him that two unknown policemen had forced him to refuse medical treatment in the SIZO. When the applicant refused to do so he was beaten. After that the applicant agreed to write that he did not need medical assistance. According to K., the applicant had a red cheek and cheekbone as well as a swollen liver. The policeman who brought the applicant back to the cell allegedly said that one of the officers was a certain So. from Perevalsk Correctional Colony No. 15. 43. Another of the applicant’s cellmate testified that when he arrived at the ITT he saw the applicant lying on the bed. The applicant told him that policemen had beaten him to force him to confess. The applicant’s cellmate P. testified that he had been sleeping and knew nothing, while the applicant’s cellmate B. refused to testify at all. A police officer, So., was also questioned and testified that on 30 January 2013 he had been at his work place. It was also noted that the surveillance system in the ITT was not working between 26 January and 4 February 2013. 44. On 3 June 2013 the decision of 25 April 2013 was quashed by the Alchevsk Town Prosecutor. It was noted without any further details that “the decision to terminate criminal proceedings had been premature and unsubstantiated, and that a number of procedural steps had not been performed”. 45. On 27 June 2013 the criminal proceedings were again terminated for the absence of evidence of crime. 46. On 4 November 2013 the Alchevskyy Town Court quashed the decision of 27 June 2013. The court found that after 3 June 2013 an investigating officer had not properly looked into the applicant’s lawyer’s complaint. It was also not established why it was impossible to hold a confrontation between the applicant and the police officer So. 47. No further information about these proceedings was provided by the parties.",['3'],[],[],"['3', '34']",[],[],1

Serghides;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"4. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Nizhnevartovsk, in the Khanty-Mansiyisk Region. 5. At the material time the applicant leased a flat in a block of flats in Noyabrsk (a town in the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Region). On 16 February 2006 at about 6 a.m. the applicant’s neighbours called the police. They informed the police of loud screams that they had heard from the applicant’s flat. Two police officers arrived at 6 a.m. and took the applicant to the Noyabrsk police station (“the police station”). 6. According to a logbook of people taken to the police station, the applicant arrived at the station at 7.05 a.m. and was handed over to an investigator “for further proceedings” at 7.55 a.m. on 16 February 2006. According to the applicant, the investigator, Ch., repeatedly questioned him as “a witness to the incident”. 7. According to the applicant, he was released on 16 February 2006 at about 11 p.m. and summoned to appear before the investigator the next day at 2 p.m. The applicant alleges that he was under the constant supervision of police officers between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m. on 16 February 2006 and was not allowed to leave the police station. 8. In 2011 the applicant sued the police station, claiming compensation for unrecorded detention. 9. On 5 August 2011 the Noyabrsk Town Court of the YamaloNenetskiy Region dismissed his claim. 10. On 5 September 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal against that decision. However, he was required to correct some errors in his claim. 11. On 28 September 2011 the Noyabrsk Town Court returned the claim to the applicant, stating that he had failed to correct the errors in his claim. 12. The applicant did not lodge an appeal against that decision. 13. On 17 February 2006 the investigator opened a criminal investigation into an offence of rape. The applicant formally became a suspect. On the same day the investigator arrested him and drew up formal records of his arrest. Between 18 February 2006 and 22 June 2006 the applicant was kept in the temporary detention centre of the Noyabrsk police station (“the IVS”). 14. The applicant provided the following description of the conditions in the IVS. He was held in cell no. 9 measuring 15 sq. m. The cell housed between nine and twelve inmates who took it in turns to sleep. The overcrowding caused a lot of conflict and tension between the inmates. 15. The window of the cell measured 0.6 m by 0.3 m and was covered with metal blinds blocking access to daylight and fresh air. There was no ventilation in the cell. The lack of air was aggravated by the detainees’ smoking. 16. There was no sink with a tap or toilet. The inmates had to use a bucket, which smelled very bad and was only emptied once a day in the morning. The bucket was not separated from the main area. The dining table was only 1.5 m away from the bucket. The detainees were provided with meals once a day. The quality of the food was completely unsatisfactory. There was not enough drinking water for everybody. 17. The detainees were allowed to take a shower once every ten days for fifteen minutes, and there were three shower heads for nine to ten people. The drains in the shower room did not work, and the water temperature was not adjustable. There was no changing room, the detainees had to undress before the shower and dress after it in a corridor. Only twice during the applicant’s detention in the IVS was he allowed to have outdoor exercise. 18. The ceiling of the cell was covered with mould. The cells were infested with bugs, lice, cockroaches and rats, and the administration did nothing to disinfect the facility. 19. It was cold in winter (there was a maximum temperature of 6˚C) and hot in summer (a maximum temperature of 45˚C). 20. The detainees were provided with neither bedding nor items of personal hygiene. They were also unable to buy them in the IVS. Mattresses had tar stains, and there was no possibility to wash clothes. Inmates were not provided with newspapers, reading material, or any information concerning their rights. The applicant was held in a cell with persistent offenders and ill persons. 21. On 15 June 2006 the Noyabrsk Town Court convicted the applicant of rape and sentenced him to six and a half years’ imprisonment in a “strictregime correctional colony”. 22. On 28 August 2006 the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Regional Court upheld the judgment of 15 June 2006 on appeal. Between 29 September 2006 and 16 June 2011 the applicant served his sentence in correctional colony IK-8 located in Labytnangi, in the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Region. 23. The applicant provided the following description of the conditions of his detention in the correctional colony, and submitted a detailed plan of the accommodation, with a description. The dormitory where he lived consisted of two sections measuring 132 and 144 sq. m respectively and accommodated 230 to 250 individuals. 24. The sanitary facilities were extremely busy: all the detainees had to use five taps and four toilets. There was not enough water. Water was only available from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. and from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. While there was no running water, the detainees had two water tanks at their disposal – one which contained drinking water and the other which contained water which was not drinkable. Per day, they could use 50 litres of drinking water and 300 litres of water which was not drinkable. This was clearly not enough, since the water in the tanks would be used up by about 10 a.m. The toilets smelled extremely unpleasant, since there was no water to flush them after 10 a.m. 25. The floor of the dormitory was based on a frame made of used railway sleepers impregnated with creosote. It smelled so strongly that the detainees had to leave the windows open permanently, even in winter, to get rid of the smell. The smell caused headaches and the open windows caused colds. The roof of the dormitory had at least eighteen visible leaks and there would be puddles on the floor if it rained. The dining room in the dormitory measured 32 sq. m and was equipped with one electric stove with four burners, one refrigerator and four sockets. The dormitory was infested with rats. 26. The detainees were allowed to take a shower once a week for fifteen minutes, and there were ten shower heads for up to forty people. Just before the applicant’s release, four extra shower heads were installed, but the time for washing was reduced to ten minutes. 27. According to the applicant, in 2008 the detainees were provided with winter clothes only at the end of November when the temperature dropped below minus 28˚C. 28. As regards the conditions of the applicant’s detention in IK-8 in Labytnangi, the Government submitted information which can be summarised as follows: 29. They also submitted that the toilets had been separated from the canteen and dormitory, and the units had been naturally ventilated and regularly disinfected. No failures in the water or electrical supply system had been identified. Detainees had taken showers weekly and had been provided with food and clothes “in accordance with the established schedule”. 30. On an unspecified date in 2010, while serving his sentence in the correctional colony, the applicant brought civil proceedings against the Noyabrsk police station and the Russian Ministry of Finance, seeking compensation in respect of non-pecuniary damage resulting from the poor conditions of his detention in the IVS in 2006. The applicant was not represented in those proceedings. 31. On 23 July 2010 the Noyabrskiy Town Court dismissed the applicant’s claim in his absence. 32. On 30 August 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal against the decision of 23 July 2010. He complained in particular that he had not been allowed to personally address the court, despite a request he had made to this effect, and he asked the appeal court to arrange for him to attend the appeal hearing. 33. On 25 November 2010 the Yamalo-Nenetskiy Regional Court upheld the decision of 23 July 2010 on appeal. It stated that the law did not make provision for transporting detainees to a civil court hearing.","['13', '3', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
84,001-183126,ENG,MLT,CHAMBER,2018,CASE OF GAFÀ v. MALTA,4,Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Conditional release;Length of pre-trial detention),Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bošnjak;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani,"5. The applicant was born in 1972 and is currently detained at the Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola. 6. On 11 December 2010 the applicant was arrested by the police on suspicion of having murdered his former partner. 7. On 13 December 2010 he was charged before the Court of Magistrates, as a Court of Criminal Inquiry, with inter alia, wilful homicide. He was remanded in custody thereafter. 8. It appears from the acts of the proceedings that from the applicant’s arraignment until August 2012, the applicant filed ten requests for bail which were all rejected after the relevant submissions were made, including oral hearings. Apart from the hearings related to the bail applications and other specific requests, fourteen hearings were held where scores of witnesses gave evidence and another six hearings were held where nothing happened and the case was adjourned. 9. In the meantime on 10 April 2012 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings before the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence. He complained of a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in so far as he had been detained for more than fifteen months since his arrest. 10. By a judgment of 27 June 2012 the Civil Court (First Hall) rejected the applicant’s claims. By a judgment of 23 November 2012 the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the appealed judgment. 11. After the applicant had been held in custody for the maximum period of detention allowed by law, he became entitled to bail in accordance with Article 575(6)(a)(iii) of the Criminal Code (see relevant domestic law). 12. Consequently, following his request of 17 August 2012, by a decree of 22 August 2012, the Court of Magistrates granted the applicant bail subject to the following conditions: that he appears for all the scheduled hearings in the criminal proceedings; that he does not go abroad or abscond; that he does not contact or approach, directly nor indirectly, witnesses for the prosecution; that he does not commit a crime of a voluntary nature while released on bail; that he present himself at the District Police Station every day between eight a.m. and eight p.m.; that he be home not later than ten p.m. and that he does not leave home before six a.m. of the following day; that he inform the Police of any change of address by not later than twelve hours of such a change; that he deposit by way of security the amount of 15,000 euros (EUR) in the court registry; and that he undertake a personal guarantee of EUR 25,000. In the event of any bail condition being breached, the entire amount of EUR 40,000 would be forfeited in favour of the State. 13. On 3 September 2012 the Attorney General appealed against the decision of 22 August 2012, as he considered the conditions too lenient and that they would not serve as a sufficient deterrent against absconding or interfering with the proper administration of justice. He requested the court to set a higher deposit reflecting the nature of the crimes with which the applicant was accused and to amend the conditions by disallowing the applicant to be in locality R. where the victim and her family resided. 14. On 6 September 2012 the applicant objected to the Attorney General’s appeal, noting that he had remained in detention precisely because he could not fulfil the conditions imposed. At the same time he filed an application requesting the court to reduce the amount to be deposited by him. He explained that since he had been detained for more than twenty months he was unemployed, and thus he could not pay the relevant amount. He submitted two documents showing that he received unemployment benefits in the sums of EUR 1,262.22 and EUR 1,573.34 in 2009 and 2010 respectively and offered to explain his financial situation ( if necessary with further documentary evidence) during an oral hearing. It appears from the acts of the proceedings that he then submitted tax assessment forms of the previous twelve years. 15. By a decision of 7 September 2012 the Criminal Court, having examined the documents submitted by the applicant, rejected the Attorney General’s request to increase the deposit but added the condition that the applicant could not be in the vicinity of locality R. It also rejected the applicant’s request considering that the Court of Magistrates had correctly applied its discretion. 16. On 9 October 2012 the applicant filed another application requesting the court to reduce the amount of the deposit. He complained that although he had been in detention for twenty-two months, and was entitled to bail, he had nevertheless remained in detention since he (and his family) could not afford to pay such an excessive amount by way of deposit. He further noted that the main witnesses had already been heard in the committal proceedings. 17. On 10 October 2012 the Attorney General objected to the applicant’s new request, noting that the applicant was not reliable, and that his inability to pay the deposit showed that he would be unable to pay the personal guarantee if he were to breach his conditions. Moreover, the family of the victim, particularly her daughter, lived in fear of the applicant. 18. By a decree of 18 October 2012, having seen the request and the reply submitted by the Attorney General, the court rejected the applicant’s request. 19. On 4 December 2012 the applicant filed another application requesting the court to reduce the amount that he had to deposit. He noted that he had remained in detention for three and half months since the decree granting him bail due to his inability to pay. The Attorney General objected in view of the seriousness of the crime. 20. On 7 December 2012 the court again rejected the applicant’s request; it noted that its previous decisions had determined the deposit in order to strike the requisite balance between, on the one hand, the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment, and, on the other hand, the obligation of the accused to fulfil the imposed conditions. 21. On 29 January 2013 the applicant filed yet another application requesting that the amount of deposit be reduced. He noted that he had been in detention for another five months since the decree granting him bail, and yet he was still not in a position to benefit from such bail - to which he was entitled by law - since he could not pay the deposit imposed. The Attorney General objected considering that the amount imposed was adequate in view of the severity of the crime and the circumstances of the case. On 5 February 2013 the applicant filed a note reiterating his request. 22. By a decree of 5 February 2013 the court, having considered the parties submissions, as well as its decree of 7 December 2012, was of the view that it should not alter the considerations made in the latter decision. It, thus, rejected the applicant’s request. 23. On 22 July 2013 the applicant requested the court to accept his mother Ms J.G. (and other relatives) as surety in lieu of the deposit. He referred to a property the relatives had inherited which they were willing to put forward as a guarantee instead of the deposit. The Attorney General requested that the applicant submit relevant evidence of the inheritance and the value of the property and that the court hear relevant witnesses in this connection, before making his final submissions. He further highlighted that a public deed would be required for the purposes of the relevant hypothec. 24. On 30 July 2013 the applicant submitted all the relevant documents concerning the property at issue which was valued at EUR 95,000. 25. On 2 August 2013 the court accepted that the applicant’s mother stand as surety by means of a hypothec on the above-mentioned property which she owned together with other relatives. Such property was to serve as a guarantee for the applicant observing the conditions imposed; in the event of a breach of any of those conditions, the property would be forfeited in favour of the Government of Malta. 26. Subsequently on 6 August 2013 the applicant having signed a personal guarantee of EUR 25,000 and his mother having effected the relevant hypothec as guarantee, the applicant was released from custody after thirty-two months of pre-trial detention. 27. In the meantime the committal proceedings and hearing of witnesses continued throughout this time; further witnesses were heard during three hearings and another four hearings were adjourned. On 31 July 2013 the prosecuting authority had declared that it did not have further evidence to produce. 28. In the meantime on 6 February 2013 the applicant instituted a new set of constitutional redress proceedings, complaining of a violation of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention in connection with the “exorbitant sum” requested (in particular reference to the sum set as deposit) which did not allow him to effectively enjoy bail. 29. By a judgment of 3 July 2013 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence rejected the applicant’s claims. It held that when a court accepted that an applicant had to be granted bail, that court had to establish the proper conditions which the applicant had to satisfy to be released and yet appear for court proceedings. If the guarantees included the deposit of a sum of money, such pecuniary condition had to be considered by reference to the person of the accused and his means as well as his relation with the person who would act as his surety. The court referred to the Court’s judgment of Iwanczuk v. Poland (no. 25196/94, § 66, 15 November 2011) where it had been held that the accused whom the judicial authorities declared themselves prepared to release on bail must faithfully furnish sufficient information, that can be checked if need be, about the amount of bail to be fixed. The court noted that the applicant did not satisfy this obligation. It was his duty to provide the courts with information on his income, savings and list his assets. Nevertheless, the applicant had only provided copies of self-assessment forms for purposes of income tax for the years between 1998 and 2011. According to the court, if an applicant argued that the deposit was too high, he had to show the court what he could afford by providing a list of his assets and property, even if this meant that he had to conduct researches in the Public Registry, and provide the relevant documentation. In its view an applicant had to show not only that he did not have the necessary means to deposit the sum requested but also that he was in an objective impossibility of finding the necessary means. He further had to show that he was unable to find persons who offered to act as surety. It was only when all this was shown that an applicant would have satisfied his duty to furnish sufficient information, thus enabling the court to make an objective assessment. 30. In the court’s view, in the present case, bearing in mind the seriousness of the crime and the potential punishment, the applicant had not brought enough evidence before the courts of criminal justice to substantiate his claim that those courts had imposed excessive conditions (including that referring to the amount of deposit). It further noted that the Constitutional Court [in the first round of proceedings] had not been convinced that there would be no tampering with evidence. Indeed even though the collection of evidence had come to an end, one had to guarantee that the evidence remained intact and thus relevant guarantees were necessary. 31. The applicant appealed. 32. By a judgment of 31 January 2014, the Constitutional Court rejected the applicant’s appeal and confirmed the judgment of the first court. 33. The Constitutional Court referred to its judgment in the case The Police v. Austine Eze and Osita Anagboso Obi, of 25 October 2013, where it had held that there must be proportionality between the amount to be deposited by the applicant for his release on bail and his financial circumstances. The level of bail set out should not be too high and it should ensure the presence of the accused at the various stages of the criminal proceedings. It also made reference to the Court’s judgment in Mangouras v. Spain ([GC], no. 12050/04, § 79, ECHR 2010) as well as the Constitutional Court’s judgment Salvatore Gauci v. Attorney General, of 31 July 1998, where it had been held that in establishing the amount to be deposited as security, the court must also consider other circumstances such as the seriousness of the offence and the danger to society. 34. The Constitutional Court held that the onus of proving that the amount of deposit was too high for the applicant when considering his financial means lay with the applicant himself. An applicant must provide information to the court on his financial situation and on the real possibility of finding a surety able to guarantee the observance of the conditions imposed. In the present case, the Constitutional Court held that the latter option had not been contemplated by the applicant and it was only after various requests to have the amount reduced that he eventually proposed his mother to act as a surety. It noted that although the applicant’s mother did not own the tenement she had used for the purposes of the guarantee, it was already in her possession for a period of time before the last application for the reduction of the amount was filed. Thus, the applicant could not argue that he could not have taken this course of action before. Although the applicant relied on the Court’s judgment of Iwanczuk (cited above), where a violation had been found on the basis that it took four months for the Polish authorities to adjust the conditions for bail, the Constitutional Court held that (even if this were the case), the applicant – who was legally represented had not explored all avenues to satisfy the courts with an adequate guarantee for the observance of the conditions of bail. No explanation as to why he only obtained a guarantee in the form of a surety at a subsequent stage was provided by the applicant. 35. Noting that the applicant had stated that at times he worked as a bus driver and as a horse trainer, apart from other activities, the Constitutional Court distinguished the applicant’s case from that of a person who was living on relief payments. The fact that the applicant had at times worked and had a salary or wage made the need to provide information to the court on his means more relevant. 36. On the fixing of the amount of the deposit, the Constitutional Court referred to Article 576 of the Criminal Code (see relevant domestic law below) which provided the factors to be considered for this purpose. Under Maltese law these included the seriousness of the offence and the applicable punishment. The Constitutional Court considered that although the law also referred to the financial situation of the person accused, this factor was not to be taken in isolation – it was for the court fixing the amount of deposit to consider all the factors taken together and not separately. In the present case bearing in mind those factors, the amount of deposit of EUR 15,000 was justified especially since the law provided for the opportunity to provide a surety – a course of action subsequently undertaken by the applicant. 37. In the Constitutional Court’s view the criminal courts’ concern that the applicant did not give the necessary guarantees that there would not be any tampering with evidence, subsisted throughout the whole criminal proceedings. 38. By a decision of 7 April 2014 the applicant was found guilty of breaching his bail conditions and his bail was revoked. Further bail requests were lodged and rejected until 26 January 2015 when a bill of indictment was issued against the applicant. From August 2013 until his indictment some ten hearings were held where nothing happened and the case was adjourned. 39. On 16 June 2015 the Criminal Court was informed that a plea bargain had been concluded between the applicant and the prosecution. 40. On 20 July 2015, following the applicant’s admission to all the charges against him, the Criminal Court pronounced a guilty verdict and sentenced the applicant to thirty-five years imprisonment and to the payment of court experts’ fees.",['5'],['5-3'],[],[],[],[],1

UKRAINE,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing;Equality of arms),Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska,"4. The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Yuzhnoukrayinsk. At the time of the events he was the director of a private joint stock company. 5. In November 2003 the local court delivered a judgment ordering a debt recovery by a certain Mr Ts. to the applicant. On 12 December 2003 Mr Ts.’s wife, acting under a power of attorney, authorised the applicant to use their car. On 9 March 2004 she revoked her power of attorney. The car, however, remained with the applicant. 6. On 25 and 29 March 2004 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of forcible assertion of private rights and extortion, following a complaint by Mr Ts. The latter claimed that the applicant was arbitrarily retaining his car and was extorting money for it. 7. On 30 March 2004 the applicant was arrested in his office as a criminal suspect. He was placed in the Arbuzynka Temporary Detention Facility (“the Arbuzynka ITT”). Following a search of the company’s premises, the police seized the car in question. 8. Two days later, on 1 April 2004, Mr Ts. wrote a receipt confirming that the applicant had paid him 1,700 US dollars (USD) in respect of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage and that he had no claims against the applicant. He addressed the receipt in question to the investigator dealing with the applicant’s criminal case. 9. On the same day the applicant was released subject to a commitment not to leave the town. 10. On 20 April 2004 the Yuzhnoukrayinsk Town Court (“the Yuzhnoukrayinsk Court”) quashed the decisions of 25 and 29 March 2004. On 3 June 2004 and 5 April 2005 the Mykolayiv Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld that ruling. The courts held that there had been no grounds for instituting criminal proceedings against the applicant as there was no indication of a criminal offence. 11. On 21 September 2005 the applicant lodged a claim for damages against the local prosecutor’s office and police. He claimed compensation for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage in respect of the following four issues: his arbitrary criminal prosecution, his unlawful arrest, the allegedly unlawful search of the company’s premises, and the seizure of the car as having amounted to his deprivation of property. More specifically, the applicant complained that there had been no reasons to arrest him and that he had never been summoned to the police. He further noted that his arrest had taken place in his office, in front of his colleagues, and that he had suffered stress and humiliation. He also observed, in the context of the complaint about his unlawful detention, that the conditions of his detention in the Arbuzynka ITT had been very poor (poor food and dirty linen, and impossibility to receive any parcels from the outside). 12. The applicant’s claim in respect of pecuniary damage included the amount of the debt owed by Mr Ts. to him, which the applicant estimated as being equivalent to the value of the impounded car. The applicant therefore claimed that that car should be returned to him. Furthermore, he claimed an equivalent to USD 5,000, which he had allegedly been forced to pay to Mr Ts. as a result of the unlawfully instituted criminal proceedings (whereas Mr Ts. had indicated a lower amount, USD 1,700, in his receipt – see paragraph 8 above). The applicant also claimed UAH 150,000 (at the time equivalent to EUR 24,650) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. 13. On 5 May 2006 the Yuzhnoukrayinsk Court allowed the applicant’s claim in part. It awarded him UAH 8,585 in compensation for pecuniary damage, as that was the amount (equivalent to USD 1,700) paid by the applicant to Mr Ts. and confirmed by the latter’s receipt. The court also awarded the applicant UAH 25,000 (at the time equal to about EUR 3,800) in respect of non-pecuniary damage. It relied, in particular, on the Compensation Act and Article 5 of the Convention. The aforementioned amounts were to be paid to the applicant from the State budget. 14. The applicant, the State Treasury of Ukraine and the Mykolayiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office appealed. 15. By a letter of 6 July 2006 the Court of Appeal sent the applicant copies of the defendants’ appeals and informed him that he could comment on them by 14 July 2006. The letter also contained a court summons for 19 July 2006. As indicated on the post stamp, it was dispatched on 14 July 2006. The applicant received that letter on 19 July 2006. 16. On 19 July 2006 the Court of Appeal, following a hearing with the participation of the defendants, but in the applicant’s absence, quashed the judgment of 5 May 2006 and issued a new one. It agreed with the first-instance court’s conclusion that the applicant “had suffered distress as a result of the illegal actions of law-enforcement officials”, but considered the compensation award to be unreasonably high. The appellate court awarded the applicant UAH 5,000 (around 750 euros at the time) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage and UAH 1,000 in costs and expenses. In rejecting his claim for compensation in respect of pecuniary damage, the court noted that the car did not belong to the applicant and the State was not required to reimburse him money paid to a private individual. 17. Neither the decision of the appellate court nor the verbatim records of its hearing contain any information regarding the notification of the applicant of that hearing. 18. The applicant appealed on points of law. He complained, in particular, that he had received the summons on the day of the hearing before the appellate court, which prevented him from participating in it. 19. On 26 November 2007 the Kherson Regional Court of Appeal, acting as a court of cassation, rejected the applicant’s appeal on points of law with broadly couched reasoning that it was unsubstantiated.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1973 and until his arrest lived in the town of Volzhskiy, Volgograd Region. 7. On 16 October 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of attempted drug trafficking and placed in custody. He remained in detention throughout the investigation and trial. 8. On 28 May 2008 the Volzhsk Town Court (“the Town Court”) convicted the applicant of attempted drug trafficking and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. The court noted that the term of the applicant’s detention was to be calculated with effect from the date of his arrest on 16 October 2007. 9. On 9 September 2008 the Volgograd Regional Court upheld the sentence on appeal. It mentioned, inter alia, that at the time of the hearing the applicant was detained in temporary detention facility no. IZ-34/5 in the town of Leninsk in the Volgograd Region. 10. The applicant asked the Presidium of the Volgograd Regional Court to re-examine his case by way of a supervisory review. In February and March 2009 the applicant submitted additional observations to the Presidium, which were dispatched from facility no. IZ-34/5. The application for supervisory review was rejected. 11. The applicant’s request for a re-examination of his case by way of a supervisory review was, however, granted by the Supreme Court of Russia, which on 13 January 2010 reduced the applicant’s sentence to five years and six months’ imprisonment. 12. Having served his sentence in full, the applicant was released from detention on 15 May 2013. 13. On 15 July 2013 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of another episode of attempted drug trafficking. 14. On 27 September 2013 the Town Court convicted the applicant of attempted drug trafficking and sentenced him to three years’ imprisonment in a high-security correctional colony. 15. On 11 October 2014 the applicant died in detention. 16. The applicant and the Government offered different versions of the applicant’s detention and treatment in the temporary detention facility. 17. According to the applicant, from 18 October 2007 to 27 June 2009 he was detained mostly in facility no. IZ-34/5. His letters to the Court dated 13 May and 7 December 2008 and 26 August 2009 were dispatched from that facility. A letter from the Court dated 8 June 2009 was sent to and received by the applicant in the same facility. 18. The applicant also submitted that on several occasions he had been transported to court hearings and to penal medical institution no. LIU-15 in Volgograd (“institution no. LIU-15”) and that he had spent very short periods, in transit, in temporary detention facility no. IZ-34/1 of the town of Volgograd. In particular, the applicant had been sent to institution no. LIU15 in 2008, where he had undergone successful treatment for tuberculosis. A chest X-ray examination on 14 January 2008 indicated that his tuberculosis had been cured, although extensive calcification and fibrosis remained in his lungs. On 17 January 2008 a medical commission confirmed his recovery. The applicant was prescribed anti-relapse treatment, but this was never provided to him after his return to the temporary detention facility. 19. The applicant filed a number of complaints ‒ for instance with the Prosecutor’s Office of the Volgograd Region ‒ arguing that he had not been afforded adequate medical treatment in facility no. IZ-34/5. On 31 March 2008 the Prosecutor’s Office re-directed the applicant’s claim to the Federal Service for the Execution of Sentences in the Volgograd Region. A month later the authorities rejected the applicant’s claim as ill-founded. They confirmed that from 18 October 2007 he had been detained in facility no. IZ-34/5. Referring to the decision of the medical commission on 17 January 2008, the authorities held that the applicant’s tuberculosis had been fully cured. 20. The Government, relying on a certificate issued on 18 December 2013 by the head of facility no. IZ-34/1, asserted that from 15 July 2007 to 22 October 2009 the applicant had been detained in that facility. In their observations of 31 January 2014, however, the Government mentioned the applicant’s detention in facility no. IZ-34/5, but did not provide any further details. 21. Despite the Court’s request for the applicant’s entire medical file, the Government submitted no medical documents dating from the period after his arrest and up until 29 October 2009. They merely noted that the applicant had contracted hepatitis C and tuberculosis before his arrest. The applicant did not dispute that submission. 22. On 27 June 2009 the applicant was transferred to correctional colony no. IK-154/9 of the Volgograd Region. 23. According to the applicant, the medical service in the colony was very poor. The colony did not employ a tuberculosis specialist and the detainees’ access to drugs, which were often out of stock, was limited. The applicant only received basic anti-fever medication. 24. The Government did not provide any information regarding the medical assistance afforded to the applicant in colony no. IK-154/9 and did not submit his medical record or any medical certificates from his time there. 25. On 29 October 2012, after the applicant complained of coughing up blood, he was transferred to institution no. LIU-15. 26. The Government provided the Court with copies of the applicant’s medical documents for the period 29 October 2012 to 15 May 2013. 27. The medical records show that on admission to institution no. LIU15 the applicant had undergone a general medical examination, a chest X-ray examination and a clinical blood test. A sputum culture test was performed the next day. The applicant was diagnosed with recurrent smear-positive infiltrative tuberculosis of the upper lobe of his left lung at the stage of lung tissue destruction caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (“MBT”). He was prescribed protiocomb, a complex medicine containing protionamide, pyrazinamide, ethambutol hydrochloride, lomefloxacin hydrochloride and vitamin B6. 28. On 6 November 2012 the applicant was tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B and C. The test confirmed his hepatitis C infection, but no antibodies associated with the other infections were found. 29. A week later the applicant again underwent a chest X-ray examination. It revealed that the cavity in the lung had decreased in size, and some negative changes in the lung tissues had progressed further. 30. On 20 November 2012 the applicant was examined by a doctor, who noted in the “epicrisis” (medical report issued on the applicant’s discharge) that no significant changes in the applicant’s health had occurred and prescribed continued treatment with protiocomb and ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic used to treat a number of bacterial infections. 31. On 1 December 2012 the applicant’s treatment was modified. He was prescribed a combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs and injections. A chest X-ray examination on 19 December 2012 showed no changes in the applicant’s lungs. 32. The applicant sent an application to the Dzerzhinskiy District Court of the town of Volgograd seeking early release on medical grounds. That request was dismissed on 27 December 2012 upon the court’s finding that the applicant’s state of health did not warrant his release from detention. 33. In February 2013 the applicant’s blood was twice taken for testing and his liver function was tested for the first time. On three further occasions in the same month the institution carried out a sputum culture test and also performed the first drug susceptibility test. The test was smear-positive. It revealed that the MBT was resistant to streptomycin. On 13 and 19 February 2013 the applicant underwent a chest X-ray examination and a tomography examination. They showed no changes. The treatment regimen was modified. The applicant was prescribed, among other medicines, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, prothionamide, cycloserine, rifampicin and isoniazid. 34. As follows from the epicrisis of 27 February 2013 and a “regime violation record” dated 6 March 2013 signed by two deputy heads of institution no. LIU-15 and the head of the detention ward, the applicant refused to take the drugs pyrazinamide, ethambutol, prothionamide and cycloserine ‒ citing their adverse effects on his health through inducing negative development of his hepatitis C ‒ and claiming that doctors should first treat his hepatitis. According to the same record, the applicant also refused to give a written explanation of the reasons for his refusal. 35. On 15 March 2013 the applicant’s X-ray examination established increased infiltration of the left lung tissue. According to a medical certificate dated 20 March 2013, his health had deteriorated due to his consistent refusal to take the prescribed medicines. 36. According to an extract from the applicant’s medical history, on an unspecified date he agreed to take isoniazid, rifampicin and capreomycin on condition that he would be provided with hepatoprotectors. 37. On 15 May 2013 the applicant was released from detention with a diagnosis of infiltrative contagious tuberculosis of the left lung at the stage of lung tissue destruction. 38. From 27 May to 15 July 2013 the applicant received in-patient medical treatment in a civilian anti-tuberculosis hospital, where he was diagnosed with active chronic fibrous-cavernous pulmonary tuberculosis at the stage of infiltration with bacilli emission, as well as hepatitis C. There is no information in the Court’s possession concerning the details of the applicant’s treatment during that period. 39. The parties did not provide the Court with any information about the applicant’s detention and treatment after his renewed arrest on 15 July 2013. The applicant’s letters to Ms Yusupova submitted to the Court indicate that between 16 July and 21 October 2013 he was detained in facilities nos. 34/5 and 34/1, that he had no access to medical treatment, and that institution no. LIU-15 had refused to admit him for treatment before his conviction. 40. On 18 October 2013 the applicant underwent a chest X-ray examination which indicated negative changes in his right lung. The volume of his left lung had decreased, its tissue was infiltrated and it contained a number of cavities. 41. Following the fresh conviction, on 21 October 2013 the applicant was admitted to institution no. LIU-15. He was examined by a doctor, who diagnosed him with hepatitis C and MBT positive infiltrative tuberculosis of the left lung at the stage of tissue destruction. The doctor ordered blood, urine, sputum culture and drug susceptibility tests and an electrocardiogram examination. The applicant was prescribed a long list of medicines, including capreomycin, isoniazid, ethambutol and hepatoprotectors. 42. A week later, after the results of the tests had been received, the applicant’s treatment was slightly modifed to include ofloxacin. 43. In the first half of November 2013 the applicant was examined on four occasions by doctors, who recommended continuing the prescribed treatment. 44. On 14 November the applicant’s electrocardiogram examination revealed that he had mitral insufficiency. 45. A medical record drawn up on 14 November 2013 by the applicant’s attending doctor indicated that the applicant had refused to take tuberculosis medicines on that date. The following entries in the applicant’s medical record dated 19, 21, 25, 27 and 29 November do not contain any similar information. The Government did not submit any other document (for instance, a regime violation record) showing that the applicant had refused to continue the treatment. 46. On 6 December 2013 a medical commission examined the applicant and established no significant changes in his condition. The most recent entry in the medical record, made on 16 December 2013, showed no significant development in his health. 47. No further information about the applicant’s treatment was provided after 16 December 2013. 48. The applicant was certified as having second-degree disability on 1 May 2014. 49. A medical panel examined the applicant on 15 August 2014 with the aim of determining whether his state of health warranted early release. The panel stated that the applicant was suffering from multi-drug resistant progressive tuberculosis aggravated by cavernosal fibrosis of the lungs and cardiopulmonary decompensation in the third stage. The applicant’s left lung was completely destroyed by the infection. The panel concluded that his state of health could warrant his release on parole. 50. On 11 October 2014 the applicant died from tuberculosis in institution no. LIU-15. 51. The documents from the case-file, including a court judgment, indicate that the applicant was not married. According to certificate no. 35/6/9-Ю-1ГР issued by institution no. LIU-15 on 20 October 2014, when being asked about his relatives, the applicant stated that he had a partner, Ms Yusupova. The authorities noted that statement in the applicant’s personal file and allowed Ms Yusupova to visit him in detention as his de facto wife. By a telegram on 11 October 2014 the authorities informed Ms Yusupova of the applicant’s death, addressing her as his wife. 52. According to Ms Yusupova’s submissions, which were not contested by the Government, she was in a close family-like relationship with the applicant from 2010 until his death in detention. She visited him on many occasions, sent him letters and parcels. In 2013 when the applicant was released from detention they lived together and ran a common household. 53. Ms Yusupova submitted that she had had intense and intimate correspondence with the applicant before his death. She provided the Court with two letters sent to her by the applicant in September 2013 to confirm that they had shared strong feelings for each other. 54. On 11 September 2013 the applicant formally authorised Ms Yusupova to withdraw money from his bank account. In his letter to the Court on 1 March 2014 the applicant expressly asked the Court to award her non-pecuniary damage if he died.","['13', '3']",[],[],[],[],[],1

ROMANIA,4,Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention),Alvina Gyulumyan;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicant was born in 1957 and lives in Târgu-Jiu. 6. On 25 August 2003 the applicant, who was the director of a local bank branch, was arrested and charged with several economic crimes, namely approving loans without respecting the legal requirements, abuse of office, fraud, forgery and conspiracy to commit crimes. Seven other individuals were also charged with various bank frauds allegedly committed in association with the applicant between January 2002 and April 2003. 7. On 27 July 2007 the Sibiu County Court acquitted the applicant of all the charges against him. The court held that the applicant was not guilty of the crimes of abuse of office, fraud, forgery and conspiracy to commit crimes. As regards the crime of approving loans without respecting the legal requirements, the court held that from 26 March 2007 this was no longer an offence in law and therefore acquitted the applicant of this offence too. On 2 November 2011 the applicant’s acquittal was finally upheld by a judgment of the High Court of Cassation and Justice. 8. Following the applicant’s arrest on 25 August 2003 for a period of three days, the investigating prosecutor requested the Gorj County Court to confirm the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a total period of thirty days. The prosecutor reasoned the request by quoting the text of Article 148 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provided for the cases in which a defendant may be arrested, namely that the defendant had made preparations to abscond from the authorities; that there was sufficient evidence that the defendant had tried to obstruct the investigation by influencing witnesses and destroying evidence; that the defendant had committed crimes for which the punishment was imprisonment for more than four years; that there was evidence that if released the defendant would pose a danger to public order and that there were sufficient data to justify the concern that the defendant would exert pressure on the victim or that he would try to make a fraudulent settlement of the case with the latter. No specific reference was made to the applicant’s situation or to the application of the legislation quoted in his particular case. 9. On 26 August 2003, on the basis of the reasons advanced by the prosecutor, the Gorj County Court granted this request and remanded the applicant in pre-trial custody for twenty-seven days. By the same judgment and with the same reasoning the court remanded the other three co-defendants who were arrested at the same time as he applicant in pre-trial custody. 10. On 29 August 2003 the Craiova Court of Appeal rejected an appeal by the applicant on points of law against the above-mentioned interlocutory judgment as ill-founded. The court held “In the current case the applicant has committed the above-mentioned offences and their nature leads to the conclusion that the defendant’s release would constitute an actual danger to public order.” 11. The applicant’s and his co-defendants’ pre-trial detention was subsequently extended on 10 September 2003, with the reasoning that the motives which had justified their arrest still existed. In taking this decision the court also held relevant the fact that two more suspects had been arrested since the beginning of the investigation. An appeal by the applicant on points of law against this judgment was rejected by the Craiova Court of Appeal on 12 September 2003; the court held that the applicant’s release had been correctly deemed by the lower court to be a threat to public order. 12. Between 10 September and 2 December 2003 the applicant’s and his co-defendants’ pre-trial detention was extended each month by the Gorj County Court with the same reasoning, namely that there was sufficient evidence for the conclusion that the defendants had committed the offences for which they were on trial, and that therefore their release would constitute a danger to public order. On 2 December 2003 the Gorj County Court additionally held that the defendants’ pre-trial detention was also justified by the fact that new crimes had been discovered by the investigators to have been committed at the same bank branch. No details were given about these crimes or about the defendants’ personal situation in this connection. 13. From 23 December 2003 to 24 June 2004 the Gorj County Court extended the applicant’s and his co-defendants’ pre-trial detention jointly, with the reasoning that there were no new facts capable of justifying a revocation of the remand in custody, the defendants had not yet been heard in court, and the financial losses caused by the crimes had not yet been recovered. 14. On 24 June 2004 the Gorj County Court decided to allow the applicant’s request for the replacement of his pre-trial detention with a prohibition on leaving the town. The court noted that the applicant had already been held in pre-trial detention for approximately one year, and there was no evidence that he had tried to obstruct the investigation during this period. An appeal by the prosecution on points of law against this decision was allowed on 28 June 2004 by the Craiova Court of Appeal. The court of appeal held that pre-trial detention continued to be justified for all the defendants because of the high number of offences involved, the severity of the punishment provided by law for these offences, and the fact that the defendants had rendered the investigation more difficult by requesting expert reports as well as submitting documents in their defence for the first time before the court and not during the investigation phase. 15. Between 8 July and 9 November 2004 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended a number of times, on the basis of the same reasoning, relying on the severity of the offence and the implied danger to public order. On 30 September 2004 the Gorj County Court additionally held that the defendants’ pre-trial detention was also justified by the fact that new accusations had been made against three of them including the applicant. 16. The applicant appealed against all the decisions extending his pre-trial detention, alleging that there was not enough evidence from which to acquire a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences, and there was no proof that if released he would present a danger to public order. The applicant also emphasised to the courts that the investigation was based mainly on bank documents which had all already been seized, and therefore it would not be possible for him to obstruct the investigation if released from prison. He further mentioned that he was a respected person in his local community, with a family and three minor children for whom he was responsible. He made numerous requests to the courts for his pre-trial detention to be replaced with a prohibition on leaving the town. However, his appeals were rejected as ill-founded, the courts considering that the reasons for his initial pre-trial detention still existed, without analysing the applicant’s specific allegations or his personal situation. 17. On 11 November 2004 the Gorj County Court again decided to revoke the applicant’s pre-trial detention, but that decision was quashed by the Craiova Court of Appeal on 15 November 2004, with the reasoning that not all the evidence gathered by the prosecutor had been produced before the court. 18. On 6 December 2004 the High Court of Cassation and Justice decided to grant a request made by one of the defendants and changed the location of the trial to the Sibiu County Court. 19. At the time he was placed in pre-trial detention the applicant was suffering, among others, from chronic coronary heart disease. 20. On 15 September 2003 the applicant submitted a request to the Gorj County Court for the revocation of his pre-trial detention for medical reasons. He requested a forensic medical expert report and enclosed medical documents attesting to his state of health. 21. At a hearing on 13 January 2004 the court ordered that the applicant be examined by the Gorj Forensic Medicine Service. 22. On 11 February 2004 the Gorj Forensic Medicine Service submitted to the court a forensic report concluding that the applicant was suffering from several diseases. The report estimated that the applicant’s conditions required treatment under strict medical supervision and further cardiology, neurology and orthopaedic tests, hence making him unable to cope with the detention regime. The report also suggested that the suspension of the applicant’s detention was necessary for a period of three months in order for him to seek treatment in a civil hospital. Finally, the report concluded that a failure to undertake the treatment recommended by a specialist doctor might endanger the applicant’s life. 23. The court requested on 12 February 2004 that the forensic report be supplemented with specific medical recommendations for the applicant’s health problems. A new amended report was submitted on 25 February 2004. 24. On 4 March 2004, at the request of the prosecutor, the court ordered the revision of the amended report by the Craiova County Control Commission (Comisia de avizare si control a actelor medico-legale) for more clarifications. 25. At the hearing of 25 March 2004 the court took note that the Craiova County Control Commission had confirmed the forensic report drafted by the Gorj Forensic Medicine Service, but had recommended the suspension of the applicant’s pre-trial detention for only one month instead of three. Again at the request of the prosecutor, the court ordered clarifications from the Control Commission, given that the suspension of the pre-trial detention was not provided by law. 26. In view of the lack of response from the Control Commission, on 13 May 2004 the court ordered a new forensic report to be drawn up by the Bucharest National Institute of Forensic Medicine. 27. On 16 September 2004, the court took note of the receipt of the opinion from the Bucharest Control Commission, which concluded that the applicant’s condition required a coronarography procedure, which could be done in detention and did not require him to be released for one month as previously recommended. Therefore, the court decided that the applicant could be treated within the prison health system, and refused his request for revocation of his pre-trial detention for medical reasons. An appeal by the applicant on points of law against this decision was rejected as ill-founded on 22 September 2004 by the Craiova Court of Appeal. 28. On 30 November 2004 the applicant complained to the court that his state of health had worsened during his detention, and requested a new forensic expert report to establish whether he could be treated within the prison health system. The court granted the applicant’s request and ordered the report to be carried out by the Gorj Forensic Medicine Service. No such report was ever submitted to the court. 29. On 5 January 2005, on the basis of the medical documents available in the file, the Sibiu County Court ordered the revocation of the applicant’s pre-trial detention for medical reasons. The applicant was ordered not to leave his town of residence without authorisation. An appeal by the prosecutor against this judgment on points of law was rejected on 10 January 2005 by the Alba Iulia Court of Appeal. The applicant was released the same day. 30. In 2012, after his final acquittal by the judgment of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of 2 November 2011, the applicant brought a civil action before the domestic courts which was based on the provisions of Article 504 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He requested pecuniary damages, alleging that his pre-trial detention had been unlawfully ordered by the prosecutor and excessively and unlawfully extended by the courts, an issue which had caused him material losses and also caused his state of health to worsen. 31. On 4 February 2013 the Craiova Court of Appeal finally refused the applicant’s request. The court held that the applicant was acquitted of one of the offences he had been charged with because it was no longer punishable by law. Therefore, given that he was not held in detention once the new law entered into force, his pre-trial detention was lawful and he was not entitled to receive any kind of damages.",['5'],['5-3'],[],[],[],[],1

Serghides;Helen Keller;Johannes Silvis;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"6. The applicant was born in 1953 and lived in Magnitogorsk, in the Chelyabinsk Region until his arrest. 7. On 28 June 2011 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of having committed a criminal offence. He remained in custody throughout the investigation and trial. 8. On 29 March 2012 the Pravoberezhniy District Court of Magnitogorsk sentenced him to thirteen years and ten months’ imprisonment. The sentence was upheld on appeal by the Chelyabinsk Regional Court on 16 August 2012. 9. In 2012, following a complaint by the applicant of pain in his lower abdomen, he was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate gland and underwent surgery in relation to that condition. 10. In April 2013 the applicant was transferred to the prison tuberculosis hospital in Chelyabinsk for testing of his urogenital system. Two operations were performed in the hospital, but various problematic symptoms relating to his urinary system persisted. 11. In February 2014 a biopsy of prostate tissue revealed the presence of cancer cells. The applicant was diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer which had spread to his liver and inguinal lymph nodes. His condition was aggravated by a wasting syndrome and paraneoplastic syndrome. 12. According to the applicant, he did not have access to the required medication in the hospital, and therefore his condition worsened. 13. On 30 October 2014 a medical panel confirmed his diagnosis, adding a list of secondary illnesses to it. The doctors concluded that the applicant’s medical condition made him eligible for early release. 14. On 26 January 2015 the Metallurgicheskiy District Court of Chelyabinsk “the District Court” examined the applicant’s request for early release on health grounds. In the proceedings the applicant was represented by Mr A. Lepekhin, a lawyer from Agora. 15. At the hearing the doctor who was treating the applicant testified that his condition had significantly deteriorated since the beginning of 2014. He received painkillers in hospital, but effective medical treatment was unavailable, owing to a lack of the required medication. 16. The acting head of the hospital stated that the applicant could only receive adequate medical treatment in another hospital. 17. The prosecutor opposed the applicant’s being released, citing his failure to reform while in detention. He also stated that the release was not necessary, as the applicant could receive the required medical treatment within the prison system. 18. The court rejected the applicant’s request for release. It found that he had failed to improve himself, that is to say, the aim of reforming him as a prisoner had not been achieved. His medical condition did not preclude further detention, as the requisite medical treatment was available within the prison system. To receive it, the applicant only needed a transfer to a different hospital. 19. On 7 April 2015 the Chelyabinsk Regional Court upheld the above decision on appeal, having fully endorsed the reasoning of the lower court. It also noted that, in addition to pain relief and therapy to relieve symptoms, the applicant could have chemotherapy, should the prison hospital receive the required medication. 20. In the meantime, on 26 March 2015 the applicant sought interim measures from this Court under Rule 39 to ensure adequate medical treatment or his release from detention. 21. On 27 March 2015 the Court decided to apply Rule 39, indicating to the Government that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant should be immediately examined by medical experts who were independent of the prison system, with a view to determining: (1) whether the treatment he was receiving in the prison hospital was adequate with regard to his condition; (2) whether his state of health was compatible with detention in prison hospital conditions; and (3) whether his condition required his placement in a specialist, possibly civilian, hospital. Furthermore, the Government were also to ensure his transfer to a specialist hospital, should the medical experts conclude that he required it. 22. On 9 April 2015 the Government responded to the Court’s letter of 27 March 2015, asserting that the scope and quality of the applicant’s medical treatment in the prison hospital corresponded to his needs. They alleged that, owing to the gravity of the applicant’s condition, only treatment of his symptoms was recommended, and such treatment was being provided in full. They submitted the following documents: a typed copy of the applicant’s medical file; certificates from detention facilities summarising the applicant’s treatment and describing his state of health; a report by a medical panel of 30 October 2014 confirming his eligibility for early release; a copy of the District Court’s decision of 26 January 2015; a statement by the acting head of the hospital in which he noted that the District Court had misinterpreted his testimony given on 26 January 2015, as he had never discussed the possibility of the applicant being treated in another hospital; and a statement by the head of the prison hospital in which he confirmed that the cancer treatment was only possible in a special oncological centre, and that he had never argued that it was accessible within the prison system. 23. On 28 May 2015 the applicant’s lawyer submitted that the Government had not made arrangements for the independent medical examination indicated by the Court to be carried out. However, two independent doctors summoned by the applicant’s lawyer had assessed the quality of his medical treatment in detention and the compatibility of further detention in the prison hospital with his state of health. In an expert report dated 23 May 2015 the doctors had concluded that the treatment the applicant was receiving in the prison hospital was inadequate. The belated diagnosis of prostate cancer and the failure to provide active treatment, such as glandular therapy, radiation therapy or surgery were mentioned among other major shortcomings on the part of the medical authorities. The doctors had also noted that the applicant could not be provided with adequate medical treatment in the prison hospital, because it had no licence for inpatient treatment of cancer patients and urological diseases. Accordingly, the experts had concluded that his detention in that facility did not correspond to his medical needs, and threatened his life. 24. Over the following months the applicant’s health continued to deteriorate, and the wasting syndrome progressed. 25. On 24 August 2015 the medical panel prepared a new report, again recommending the applicant’s early release on health grounds. A court hearing on the matter was scheduled for 11 September 2015. Four days before that date the applicant died of cancer. 26. At the request of the applicant’s lawyer, Mr A. Lepekhin, the Investigative Committee carried out a preliminary inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the applicant’s death, which ended with a decision of 15 October 2015 not to open a criminal case.","['3', '34']",[],[],[],[],[],1

The five applicants are Iraqi nationals. They now live in Switzerland, where they were granted asylum in July 2017 (see paragraph 31 below). The first and second applicants, Mr S.F. and Mrs W.O., born respectively in 1975 and 1978, are spouses. The other three applicants, Mr Y.F., Mr S.F. and Mr A.F., born respectively in 1999, 2004 and 2014, are their sons. 6. On 14 August 2015 the applicants, who had fled from Iraq, covertly crossed the Turkish-Bulgarian border. They were travelling with four other families. From there, they took taxis which drove them to the outskirts of Sofia, where they slept under the open sky for two nights. On 17 August 2015, they hired other taxis to drive them to the Bulgarian-Serbian border, somewhere around the town of Bregovo. Shortly before the border, the applicants switched cars, getting into a Toyota sports utility vehicle, which was supposed to take them through a wooded area to the border itself. They intended to cross that border covertly as well, and from there continue towards Western Europe. 7. At that time, the second applicant was three months pregnant. 8. According to media reports, over the last few years the abovementioned route has been a popular one for migrants trying to cross Bulgaria covertly on their way to Western Europe. According to a report submitted by the Government, in August 2015 the Bulgarian border police intercepted 350 adult migrants and 132 minor migrants near Bregovo and took them into custody. 9. In the late afternoon of 17 August 2015 the applicants were driven in the Toyota towards the Bulgarian-Serbian border near the village of Rabrovo, which is about fifteen kilometres south of Bregovo, twenty-five kilometres west of the town of Vidin, and about two kilometres from the border. It was also transporting the four other families; together with the applicants, it carried a total of eighteen passengers, eight of whom were minors. 10. At about 5 p.m., when the Toyota was just a few metres away from the border, two officers of the Bulgarian border police intercepted it. The driver fled. One of the officers gave chase, while the other ordered all the passengers to step out of the vehicle. The first officer could not catch up with the driver and came back. According to the applicants, he was apparently annoyed about his inability to detain the driver and hit one of the passengers. The applicants submitted that they had been afraid that he might hit them as well. 11. Half an hour later, two more officers came to the scene; subsequently, a bus, with a driver and a photographer, also arrived. According to the applicants, the officers insulted the arrestees, called them “mice” (the applicants did not specify in what language), and made insulting gestures. They ordered the applicants and the other passengers to get into the bus and drove them to the Bregovo Border Police Department’s detention facility in Vidin. According to the applicants, the drive took about an hour. According to the Government, the drive could not have taken less than three hours. The preparation of the documents relating to the applicants’ arrest then took another hour, and the written declarations that they had been acquainted with their rights were stamped as having been signed at 9 p.m. The applicants could not have therefore been placed in their cell earlier than 10 p.m. 12. Upon their arrival at the border police’s detention facility in Vidin, the applicants were searched. According to them, all their effects – including travelling bags, mobile telephones, money, food, and even the fifth applicant’s nappies, baby bottle and milk – were taken away from them, except for a mobile telephone belonging to the third or the fourth applicant, which they managed to conceal. According to a search report submitted by the Government, when searching the second applicant the authorities seized from her four mobile telephones, SIM cards, a USB flash drive, two digital video disks and cash. The Government also pointed out that in a video submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 15 below), travel bags and personal effects were visible inside their cell. 13. After the search, the arrestees were split into two groups. The applicants and another family were put in one cell, and the others in an adjoining one. In the application form, the applicants stated that both cells were on the detention facility’s second floor. 14. According to the applicants, the cell was hot and its window could not be opened. 15. The applicants also submitted a video, which according to them had been shot with the mobile telephone that they had managed to conceal during the search (see paragraph 12 above). It shows that the cell was at ground level, about 4 by 4 metres, with a large double window (secured on the inside by a mesh grille), an open door, and a padlocked metal grille on the door. In the video the cell looks run-down, with dilapidated walls, paint coming off the ceiling in flakes, and a dirty floor partly covered with dirty (and in places damp) cardboard sheets. The furniture consists of two old and dilapidated bunk beds and a single bed, with four or five bare soiled mattresses. Two of the mattresses are on the floor, one is on the single bed, and one is on the bottom bunk of one of the bunk beds. A single crumpledup bed sheet lies on one of the mattresses on the floor. Personal effects, such as a small shoulder bag, training shoes and some litter, are strewn about. Other random objects – food remains, empty plastic bottles, rubbish and a torn blanket – are piled up in a corner. The third and fourth applicants can be seen sitting on one of the bunk beds, whereas the fifth applicant (the toddler) can at first be seen sitting on the floor beside the door and then being picked up and carried around by the first applicant. Apart from the five applicants, three other people can be seen in the cell: a middleaged woman lying on the single bed, a boy (perhaps two or three years old), and the man shooting the video. 16. The video was submitted by the applicants on a digital video disk containing two video files. One is in .mpg format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 5.36 p.m. on 17 September ‎2015; and the other is in .mp4 format and bears a time stamp according to which it was last modified at 3.27 p.m. on 15 December 2015. The footage in both files is identical, except that: (a) the faces of the applicants in the first one have been pixelated (whereas in the second they have not); (b) the running time of the first video is one minute and twenty-one seconds (whereas that of the second is one minute and thirty-two seconds, as it continues for another ten seconds); and (c) in the first file the footage is horizontal whereas in the second it is rotated to the right at a ninety-degree angle. The footage in the first file has a definition of 1,280 by 720 pixels and is at twenty-four frames per second, whereas that in the second file has a definition of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels and is at twenty-nine frames per second. 17. The applicants explained that the above-mentioned dates and times corresponded with when they had copied the video files in Switzerland, and that they had in fact recorded the original video on 18 August 2015, at about noon. Since they had taken the SIM cards out of the mobile telephone several times in the course of their journey and then re-inserted them, the telephone had not indicated the correct time and date, making it impossible to pinpoint the exact date and time when the video had been recorded. 18. In a letter to the Government Agent, an official from the Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Sofia, having compared the video footage with the photographs in the applicants’ migration files, stated that he could confirm that the applicants were indeed the people featured in the video. 19. According to the Government, the border police’s detention facility in Vidin was equipped in accordance with the relevant regulations. They did not provide further details in that respect. 20. According to the applicants, after being put in the cell, they were not given anything to eat or drink, or allowed to go to the toilet. Since there was no toilet or a bucket in the cell, they had to urinate onto the floor. The Government did not comment on that point. 21. About four hours later, at about 10 p.m., officers came and took the first applicant to another building in order to take his picture and to digitally fingerprint him. After that, the officers took out the second applicant for fingerprinting. After the fingerprinting procedure, the officers left the applicants in the cell for the night. 22. Between 10.30 a.m. and 11 a.m. and between 11 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. the next day, 18 August 2015, a border police investigator interviewed respectively the first and the second applicants. The interviews were conducted in English and translated into Bulgarian with the help of an interpreter. 23. According to the applicants, after the interview the second applicant asked the guards to give her back her bag, so that she could prepare a baby bottle for her toddler (the fifth applicant), and the guards did so. The Government did not comment on that point. 24. After that, the guards took the applicants one by one out of the cell to go to the toilet. 25. According to the applicants, later that day, a ten-month-old child in the adjoining cell touched an electrical wire and suffered an electric shock. That caused panic among the detainees, and the guards allowed all of them out of their cells. An ambulance was called. When hearing that the applicants had not had anything to eat or drink since their arrest, the nurse who came with the ambulance argued with the guards and took the second applicant and her youngest child, the fifth applicant, to a hospital in Vidin, where the second applicant was examined by a gynaecologist between 8.05 p.m. and 8.35 p.m., and the fifth applicant was examined by a paediatrician between 8.20 p.m. and 8.40 p.m. Two or three hours later they were taken back to the detention facility. 26. According to the applicants, at that point the guards told them that they would give them food if they paid for it; the guards then took money from their bags and gave them two loaves of bread, a yoghurt, four bottles of Coca-Cola, one kilogram of tomatoes, one kilogram of cucumbers, one kilogram of bananas, and a small piece of paté. According to the Government, the applicants were provided with food and water, in accordance with the relevant regulations. In support of their assertion, the Government submitted a table setting out the prescribed daily rations for adult and minor detained migrants and a report, drawn up by the head of the Bregovo Border Police Department on 1 September 2015, which listed the names of all migrants – including the applicants – which had been detained in the Department’s detention facility in Vidin during the month of August 2015 and provided with food there. 27. Then, at about 10 p.m. or 11 p.m., the applicants were put back in the cell. According to them, they were allowed to go to the toilet before that, but had not been able to do so during the night. The Government did not comment on that point. 28. The next day, 19 August 2015, the applicants were served with orders for the first and second applicants’ removal from Bulgaria and for their detention pending removal, all issued the previous day. It does not appear that separate orders were issued with respect to the third, fourth and fifth applicants, who were mentioned as accompanied minors in the orders for the first and second applicants’ detention (see paragraph 33 below). 29. According to the applicants, at about midday on 19 August 2015 they were given back their belongings and driven to an immigration detention facility in Sofia. According to the Government, that happened much earlier that day, at about 6 a.m. or 7 a.m., since the relevant records showed that the applicants had been placed in the detention facility in Sofia at 2.45 p.m., and the normal travel time between the two facilities was about six or seven hours. 30. On 24 August 2015 the applicants sought international protection in Bulgaria. Their applications were registered by the State Agency for Refugees on 31 August 2015, and they were released from the immigration detention facility in Sofia and settled in an open facility for the accommodation of asylum-seekers. On 23 September 2015 those proceedings were, however, discontinued because the applicants had vanished from the facility. 31. In the meantime, the applicants made their way to Switzerland, where they likewise sought international protection on 8 September 2015. On 8 January 2016 the Swiss authorities decided not to examine their applications but rather to transfer them back to Bulgaria under Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a thirdcountry national or a stateless person (“the Dublin III Regulation”), which also applies to Switzerland (see A.S. v. Switzerland, no. 39350/13, §§ 12-13, 30 June 2015). Following legal challenges by the applicants, on 7 July 2016 the Swiss authorities varied their own decision and proceeded with the examination of the applications. Just over a year later, on 27 July 2017, the applicants were granted asylum in Switzerland.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

POLAND,4,Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect),András Sajó;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1966 and is detained in the Suwałki Prison. 6 7. On 30 April 2003 the Suwałki Regional Prosecutor’s Office issued an arrest warrant against the applicant on suspicion of his being the leader of an international organised criminal group and six counts of kidnapping for ransom committed by members of that group. On the same day the Suwałki District Court issued a decision ordering the applicant’s detention on remand, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It attached great weight to the possibility that the applicant might attempt to obstruct the proceedings by bringing pressure to bear on witnesses and other suspects. 8. On 22 April 2003 the applicant was arrested in the Netherlands. 9. The extradition request, arrest warrant and detention order were sent to the Netherlands. The applicant was transferred to Poland on 20 October 2003. 10. On 8 April 2004 the Suwałki Regional Prosecutor indicted the applicant before the Augustów District Court. The case was later transferred to the Lublin Regional Court. 11. The applicant’s appeal against the detention order, his further appeals against subsequent decisions extending his detention, and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful. 12. In the meantime, in another set of criminal proceedings, on 1 April 2005, the Suwałki Regional Court convicted the applicant of armed robbery and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment (II K 96/04). The judgment was upheld on appeal. He served this sentence from 21 January 2006 until 20 July 2010. 13. The bill of indictment was first lodged with the Augustów District Court, which declared itself not competent to deal with the case on 14 April 2004. The case was then transferred to the Lublin District Court, where the trial commenced on 21 September 2004. The court held many hearings and heard witnesses. On 26 January 2006 the prosecutor submitted a request for the case to be transferred to the Lublin Regional Court. Following various appeals and challenges, on 26 September 2006 the Warsaw Court of Appeal finally decided that the Lublin Regional Court was competent to deal with the applicant’s trial. The trial commenced before the Lublin Regional Court in December 2006. The court held at least sixty-five public hearings lasting up to four hours. 14. At the hearings before the Lublin District Court and Lublin Regional Court the applicant had the services of a Lithuanian interpreter. On a few occasions a Russian interpreter was provided as the applicant agreed that he spoke Russian well enough. On 4 January 2007 the applicant expressed his preference for a Lithuanian interpreter and one was provided until the end of the trial. 15. On numerous occasions the applicant, assisted by an interpreter, examined the file. According to the Government, the file was examined on 14 November and 2 December 2007, 3 January, 7, 17 and 31 March and 5 May 2008 at the very least. At the applicant’s request the trial court provided him with translations of documents. In addition, at four hearings in 2005 the applicant requested copies of the relevant documents in Polish. 16. On 5 October 2007 the applicant asked the trial court to allocate another legal aid lawyer to him. He contended that he had argued with the incumbent lawyer and could not communicate with him. It appears that at the hearing the lawyer endorsed the request made by the applicant, but the court dismissed it. 17. At the hearing of 7 January 2009 the applicant challenged the presiding judge. However his challenge was dismissed. 18. On 27 January 2010 the Lublin Regional Court (IV Ka 338/06) convicted the applicant as charged. In particular he was convicted on six counts of kidnapping for ransom and leading an organised criminal gang. The applicant was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. The period of the applicant’s detention from 22 April 2003 until 20 January 2006 was credited towards the sentence. 19. During the trial before the Lublin District and Regional Courts the applicant was represented by Mr M.C. a lawyer from Białystok, appointed for him by the court. The lawyer prepared an appeal on his behalf. In his appeal he raised, inter alia, a breach of the applicant’s defence rights under Article 6 of the Convention and argued that the applicant had not had access to his lawyer in the presence of an interpreter and full access to the case file in his own language. 20. On 7 December 2010 the Lublin Court of Appeal (II AKa 235/10) upheld the conviction. The court dismissed the allegations regarding the impossibility of communicating with his lawyer, who spoke only Polish, as manifestly ill-founded. The court established that the applicant had had access to a sworn interpreter during the entire trial, including meetings with the lawyer. The appellate court also found that the applicant had not been hindered in his right of access to the case file, which he consulted on many occasions in the presence of his interpreter. The court stated: “During the entire proceedings the accused benefited from free counsel with whom he could communicate in the presence of an interpreter. The regional court even organised recesses during the hearing in order to enable the applicant to contact his lawyer in the presence of a sworn interpreter. Consequently, one cannot share the accused’s allegation of a breach of Article 6 of the Convention or other provisions. Moreover, throughout the proceedings the first-instance court provided him with copies of the requested documents...” 21. A new lawyer allocated to the applicant at this stage of the proceedings, Mr A.D., lodged a cassation appeal against the judgment. He argued that the contact with the lawyer during recesses in the trial had occurred in the presence of police officers and sometimes lay judges or judges’ assistants. That rendered respect for the applicant’s defence rights illusory. The requests for unsupervised meetings with the lawyer in the presence of the interpreter had been dismissed by both the trial court and the court of appeal. In the cassation appeal he further argued that the trial court never actually provided the applicant with copies of the translated documents although it had agreed to do it. Moreover, the court had asked the applicant to pay for them although he did not have any financial means. 22. On 4 April 2012 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. The translation into Lithuanian of this judgment had been received by the applicant on 7 July 2012. As regards the arguments put forward in the cassation appeal, the court stated that the applicant had been detained on remand and had therefore had to be accompanied by guards during the meetings with the lawyer which had taken place during recesses in the trial court hearing. The court further noted that the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention had been fulfilled as the applicant had had translations of the most important documents necessary for his comprehension of the case, even if not the entire file. 23. On 21 October 2003 the Suwałki Remand Centre requested to classify the applicant as a so-called “dangerous detainee”. In their request the authorities pointed out that the applicant had been charged with having committed several counts of kidnapping for ransom, robberies and attempted murder and of being a leader of an international, armed, criminal group. The applicant was searched by an arrest warrant and apprehended in Amsterdam. The remand centre authorities stated: “his personal situation, character and behaviour pose a serious danger to society or to the security of a remand centre”. They further indicated that the security of all transfers of the applicant be strengthen “given the character and the manner in which the offences had been committed and the fact that [the applicant] had previously practiced box and combat techniques”. The request ends: “He is a person of high degree of depravity”. On the same day the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission decided to classify the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. The commission stated that the main reason for the classification was the suspicion that the applicant had committed offences within an organised criminal group (Article 212a § 3 and §4 (c) of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences). 24. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a complaint with the Lublin Regional Prison Service Inspectorate concerning the constant monitoring of his cell, repeated body searches and the lack of unsupervised visits. On 15 February 2010 the complaint was declared manifestly illfounded. 25. Every three months the Lublin Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission reviewed and reaffirmed its decision to classify the applicant as a “dangerous detainee”. The relevant decisions were limited to short descriptions of the nature of the charges laid against him, and later offences of which he had been convicted which, together with his “personal situation”, justified the maintaining of the previous decisions. In the requests for extension of the regime issued prior to each decision of the commission, the director of the remand centre emphasised the violent nature of the crimes which the applicant had allegedly committed. In the requests of 19 October 2004 and 9 January 2005 the authorities referred to the applicant’s “personal circumstances (ruthless and cruel manner in which the crimes were committed taken together with the knowledge of box and combat techniques)”. In the more recent requests the remand centre authorities pointed out that the applicant had not taken any active part in the “social rehabilitation process” and had been of low moral character. All the commission’s decisions and the requests by the remand centre issued between April 2005 and 2012 had similar wording. 26. The applicant appealed against some of those decisions. In particular, he appealed against the decision of 2 April 2009, but this was dismissed by the Lublin Regional Court on 8 June 2009. The applicant also appealed against the commission’s decision of 29 April 2011 and on 6 September 2011 the Białystok Regional Court upheld it. In addition to that, the applicant submitted that he had appealed against the decision of 4 August 2011 which was dismissed on 11 October 2011. On 26 March 2012 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed his appeal against the decision of the commission issued on 27 January 2012. The domestic courts examined the legality of the impugned decisions and found that they had been given in accordance with the law and after a thorough analysis of the case. In particular due consideration had to be given to the nature of the offences allegedly committed by the applicant and of which he had been later found guilty. The courts also found that the authorities based their decisions on an exhaustive assessment of the applicant’s behaviour. 27. On 25 July 2012 the Białystok Remand Centre Penitentiary Commission decided to lift the measure. The commission considered that the applicant no longer posed a threat to the security of the remand centre. 28. On 11 October 2007 the Lublin Regional Court granted the applicant’s request to be allowed to make phone calls from the detention centre. During his subsequent detention in the Lublin and Suwałki Remand Centres the applicant was authorised to make two telephone calls per week, each lasting ten minutes. For a short period of time in 2010 the use of telephone was limited to once a week but the call duration extended to 15 minutes. 29. In addition to that, the applicant was often granted additional telephone conversations with his family, daughter, lawyer, or diplomatic representatives. In 2010 these took place on eight occasions and in 2011 on seven occasions. At his request, on seven occasions in 2010 the authorities extended the allotted time to fifteen minutes. 30. The visits by the applicant’s family, his common-law wife and daughter, were subject to restrictions, but he had been able to receive them regularly. The first visit from his common law wife took place in August 2004, followed by two other in the same year. From the list of visits submitted by the Government and not contested by the applicant, it appears that between 2004 and 2009 he had had between two and four visits every year at least. In 2010 he had in total eight visits mostly from his wife and daughter. Each visit lasted between thirty minutes and two hours. 31. The applicant was not restricted in receiving correspondence from his family. 32. The Government acknowledged that during the hearings before the Lublin Regional Court the applicant had been held in a metal cage separating him from the judges and the public, and whilst in the cage, his hands had remained handcuffed. 33. The parties failed to provide a detailed description of the cage, in particular its dimensions. It is also not clear whether the guards were positioned inside the cage with the applicant or next to it. 34. The parties disagreed as to the number of hearings during which the applicant remained in the cage. The applicant stated that he was placed in the metal cage, with his hands and legs shackled, during all the hearings before the trial court, approximately 104 of them. The Government submitted that he was placed in the cage, handcuffed, during some hearings before the Lublin Regional Court but not all of them. 35. The Government also submitted that on 7 October 2010 the applicant received disciplinary punishment for having verbally threatened a prison guard.",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1950 and lives in Nova Gorica. 6 7. On 29 October 2002 the applicant lodged a civil action against company X, her former employer, seeking payment of 3,285.89 euros (EUR) and statutory default interest in respect of contributions made by her into the employee share scheme (trajne vloge delavca). On 24 May 2011 the Nova Gorica Local Court (“the Local Court”) dismissed her claim and on 13 June 2011 the judgment was served on her lawyer. 8. The time-limit for appealing against the judgment expired at midnight on 28 June 2011. At 6.54 p.m. on that day the applicant’s lawyer sent a document of six pages by fax to the Local Court. The next day, after the expiry of the time-limit, the applicant’s lawyer sent the appeal against the first-instance judgment, consisting of six pages, by registered mail. On 12 July 2011 the Local Court rejected the appeal as out of time. It held that the applicant had lodged her appeal on 29 June 2011, which was after the time-limit. 9. On 30 July 2011 the applicant appealed against this decision, arguing that she had lodged her appeal by fax within the prescribed period. In this connection, she submitted a fax confirmation page according to which on 28 June 2011 at 6.54 p.m. her lawyer had sent a six-page document to the Local Court’s fax number. 10. On 12 August 2011, at the request of the Koper Higher Court (“the Higher Court”), the competent judge of the Local Court enquired about the faxes received by the registry of that court on 28 June 2011 from 6 to 7 p.m. The confirmation page showed that the Local Court had received a document of six pages from the applicant’s lawyer at 6.59 p.m. On 24 August 2011 the competent judge was informed that the fax from the applicant’s lawyer had been saved in the fax machine’s memory, but had not been printed out. Subsequently, this information was sent to the Higher Court. 11. On 14 November 2011 the Higher Court dismissed the appeal, noting that the Local Court had received the documentation that had been lodged by mail only on 29 June 2011. It held that the appeal allegedly lodged on 28 June 2011 by fax would have been regarded as within the prescribed time-limit only if it had been delivered to the court before its expiry. The burden of proof that the appeal had been lodged in due time was on the applicant. The Higher Court acknowledged that the confirmation page submitted by the applicant indeed showed that on 28 June 2011 the applicant had sent a document of six pages by fax. However, the confirmation page made no reference to the type of document sent, its content and to which case it referred. 12. On 5 June 2012 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. She pointed out that section 112 of the Civil Procedure Act allowed the submission of an application by fax and that according to the existing case-law of the Supreme Court an application was deemed to be submitted in due time if delivered to the competent court before the expiry of the time-limit regardless of how it was subsequently handled by the court, which was a matter of the court’s internal organisation. The applicant submitted that the Local Court had received her appeal by fax in due time but then most probably failed to print it out and the document had automatically been deleted from the fax machine’s memory. Hence, she argued that the date when the fax had been sent should be considered as the date the appeal had been lodged and that she should not be made to bear the burden of proof in a case where the document had not been printed out by the court. She further emphasised that a timely delivery should not have any negative consequences for the parties to the proceedings. Furthermore, as regards her failure to prove the content of the fax that had been sent to the Local Court on 28 June 2011, the applicant submitted: firstly, that the confirmation page from her lawyer’s fax machine had showed the date of the transmission, the number of pages sent and the time it had taken to deliver the document to the receiving machine; secondly, on the following day, 29 June 2011, the applicant had lodged the relevant document by registered mail which, according to her, proved that the document in question was in fact the appeal against the judgment of 24 May 2011. The applicant added that, according to information given to her by a telecommunications company and a fax-machine manufacturer, it was not possible to prove the content of a document sent by fax as those transmissions were encrypted. 13. On 20 June 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. It referred to its decision of 4 April 2013 (II Ips 603/2009 and II Ips 718/2009) in which it had held that proof that a fax was sent did not necessarily mean proof of receipt of the document. In the Supreme Court’s opinion, there was a possibility that the court would not receive the relevant document in due time because of faults in the telecommunications network or similar technical reasons (lack of paper, an empty ink cartridge, the machine shutting down, and so on). Such a risk was borne by the applicant in the same manner as if the document were sent by regular – as opposed to registered – mail, whereby the risk of late receipt of a motion was borne by the sender. Since the applicant had failed to prove the content of the document sent by fax on 28 June 2011, the Supreme Court confirmed that the Higher Court had correctly taken into consideration only the appeal sent by registered post the next day. 14. On 18 October 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint in which she reiterated the arguments raised before the Supreme Court. 15. On 11 November 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaint for lack of significant disadvantage and for not raising an important constitutional question. On 15 November 2013 this decision was served on the applicant. 16. Meanwhile, on an unspecified date, the applicant requested that the Local Court reinstate her case. On 7 February 2012 the Local Court dismissed the applicant’s request. The applicant lodged an appeal which she subsequently withdrew.",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1981 and, according to the latest information available to the Court, lives in Aksaray. 5. On 2 April 2011 the applicant, who had been living in Turkey since 2008, was taken into custody in the context of an investigation into murder by a person or persons unknown. He was placed in the Yedikule Security Directorate in Istanbul. 6. On 4 April 2011 the applicant delivered his witness statement before a criminal court in relation to the aforementioned investigation. However, he was not released after delivering the statement; instead he continued to be detained in the Yedikule Security Directorate for having outstayed his visa. 7. On 5 April 2011 the applicant was transferred to Şehit Tevfik Fikret Erciyes police station in Fatih, Istanbul (“Fatih police station”), where he was placed in a custodial cell for the next five days. 8. On 10 April 2011 the applicant was sent to Kumkapı Removal Centre with a view to being deported. According to the applicant’s account, Kumkapı Removal Centre was severely overcrowded at the time of his detention. He had to share a dormitory measuring approximately 3035 sq. m with twenty-four to forty-five other people and the overcrowding of the centre resulted in hygiene problems. The building was infested with insects and the quality and quantity of the food provided was also fairly poor. Moreover, there was no provision for outdoor exercise. 9. On 12 April 2011 the applicant lodged an application with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for refugee status. 10. On 27 April 2011 he claimed asylum from the Ministry of the Interior. 11. On 29 April 2011 the applicant was granted a temporary residence permit in the province of Aksaray as an asylum seeker and he was released from Kumkapı Removal Centre on the same day. It appears that the applicant was subsequently permitted to reside in Konya. 12. According to the latest information provided to the Court, the applicant’s applications for asylum and refugee status are still pending before the domestic authorities and the UNHCR respectively.","['13', '3', '5']","['5-1', '5-2', '5-4', '5-5']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Asvag (Norway). 6. In 2000 the applicant married a Slovak national (A.) in Norway. There were two children from the marriage, born in 2000 and 2002 respectively. 7. The family lived together in Norway until May 2004, when the applicant left the family home. On 18 August 2004 an administrative decision was taken in Norway on the couple’s separation. 8. On 7 September 2004 the Vesterålen District Court (tingrett) issued an interim order that, until the resolution of the matter on the merits, the children should be the joint responsibility of both parents and should remain in the care of A. The court also determined the applicant’s visiting rights and forbade both parents to remove the children from the Norwegian territory without the consent of the other parent. 9. Nevertheless, on 8 July 2005 A. left Norway for Slovakia, taking the children with her. 10. On 21 September 2005 the Vesterålen District Court ruled that the children be put under the exclusive parental responsibility and in the care of the applicant. It also determined the visiting rights of A. and issued an order that she should not remove the children from the territory of Norway. This judgment was upheld by the Hålogaland High Court (lagmannsrett) on 10 March 2006 following an appeal by A., and her request for leave to appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court (Høyesteretts kjæremålsutvalg) on 23 May 2006. 11. On 14 December 2005 the applicant initiated proceedings in Slovakia against A. under the Hague Convention, seeking an order for the return of the children to their country of habitual residence ‒ Norway. 12. The action was examined by the courts in four rounds, two of which were followed by enforcement proceedings. They are described below in turn. 13. The first examination resulted in the dismissal of the action by the Liptovský Mikuláš District Court (Okresný súd) on 23 May 2006 and of the applicant’s appeal (odvolanie) by the Žilina Regional Court (Krajský súd) on 28 February 2007. These decisions became final and binding (právoplatnosť). 14. The applicant subsequently petitioned the Prosecutor General (“the PG”) to exercise his discretionary power to challenge these decisions by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law (mimoriadne dovolanie) on the applicant’s behalf. However, in a letter of 25 October 2007 he was informed that, under the applicable procedural rules, no such extraordinary appeals were available in family law matters. 15. Meanwhile, on 30 May 2007, the applicant had challenged the ordinary courts’ decisions by way of a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended). 16. Upon examining this complaint, on 12 June 2008, the Constitutional Court (Ustavný súd) found a violation of the applicant’s rights under Article 6 § 1 (fairness), but no separate issue under Article 8 of the Convention. As a result, it quashed the decision of 28 February 2007 and remitted the matter to the Regional Court for reexamination of the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 23 May 2006. 17. In consequence, on 7 October 2008 the Regional Court re-examined the appeal and decided to quash the decision of 23 May 2006 and to remit the case to the first-instance court for reexamination. 18. In the second round of examination, an order for the return of the children was issued by the District Court on 16 April 2009 and, following an appeal by A., it was upheld by the Regional Court on 23 June 2009. As the order thereby became final and binding, on 13 August 2009 the applicant petitioned for enforcement. 19. However, the return order was quashed by the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) on 7 September 2010, following an appeal on points of law (dovolanie) by A. The matter was consequently remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination and, on 30 September 2010, the enforcement proceedings were discontinued. 20. In the third round of examination, a new order for the return of the children was issued by the District Court on 22 October 2010 and, following an appeal by A., it was upheld by the Regional Court on 25 January 2011. The order thus became final and binding and, on 24 February 2011, the applicant petitioned for enforcement. 21. However, the return order was again quashed by the Supreme Court, on 27 July 2011, following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the PG on behalf of A. Among other things, the Supreme Court observed that the courts were duty-bound to examine as carefully as possible the overall situation to which the children would return in the place of their habitual residence. On the facts of the present case, the lower courts had based their assessment regarding the social situation of the applicant on reports drawn up by the Norwegian Central Authority responsible for implementing the Hague Convention. However, these reports dated back to February and April 2009 and, in the circumstances, they were outdated. For this reason and others, the matter was again remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination and the enforcement proceedings were terminated. 22. The fourth and final round of examination resulted in the dismissal of the applicant’s petition by the District Court on 21 November 2011. This decision was appealed against by the applicant and the public prosecution service, who had previously joined the proceedings but later withdrew their appeal. 23. On 8 February 2012 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the appeal by the public prosecution service and declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for being out of time. 24. On 20 February 2012 the Regional Court corrected its decision of 8 February 2012 in so far as the applicant’s appeal was concerned. In particular, having established an error in its previous calculation of the applicable statutory time-limit, the Regional Court ruled that the applicant’s appeal had in fact been lodged in good time and that the proceedings on it were to continue. A. then challenged this decision by means of an appeal on points of law, but her appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on 28 June 2012 as being inadmissible. 25. The Regional Court heard the applicant’s appeal on 22 October 2012 and dismissed it on 6 November 2012. 26. In dismissing the petition and the appeal, the courts relied on the Supreme Court’s judgment of 27 July 2011 (see paragraph 21 above) and took into account the fact that the children wished to stay with A. in Slovakia, that they had spent more than half of their lives in Slovakia, and that they were integrated there. The courts concluded that it was therefore in the best interests of the children that they should not be returned to Norway. The matter was settled by force of a final and binding decision on 31 December 2012. 27. Meanwhile, on 3 September 2012 the applicant had turned to the Constitutional Court with a fresh individual complaint. Directing it against the District Court, the Regional Court, and the Supreme Court, he alleged a violation of his rights under Articles 6 (fairness and length) and 8 of the Convention and their constitutional equivalents. In particular, the applicant contended that the proceedings had been pending for nearly seven years, and that in the given situation the excessive length thereof worked against him. In addition, he argued that the District Court’s decision of 21 November 2011 violated his right to respect for his private life and, challenging in substance mainly the Supreme Court’s decision of 27 July 2011, he asserted that the proceedings had been unfair inter alia because the PG had lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law on behalf of A., although such a remedy had been denied to the applicant on the grounds that it was not available as a matter of law (see paragraphs 14 and 21 above). 28. On 30 October 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible. At the time of the Constitutional Court’s decision, the applicant’s Hague Convention petition was still pending before the Regional Court on his appeal against the first-instance ruling of 21 November 2011 in the fourth round of examination (see paragraphs 22 et seq. above), after the second final and binding return order had been quashed by the Supreme Court on 27 July 2011 following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the PG on behalf of A. (see paragraph 21 above). As regards the length of the proceedings, the Constitutional Court observed that the Supreme Court and the District Court had determined the matter on 27 July and 21 November 2011 respectively. Therefore, at the time the constitutional complaint was introduced, these courts were no longer dealing with the case. Examination of the length of the proceedings before these courts could thus no longer aid their acceleration and, consequently, the applicant could not be deemed to have the requisite interest in having it examined. In addition, the length of the proceedings before the Regional Court being relatively short, the remainder of the length-of-proceedings complaint was manifestly ill-founded. In so far as the constitutional complaint concerned the Supreme Court’s decision of 27 July 2011, it had evidently been lodged outside the statutory two-month time-limit and, as the proceedings on the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 21 November 2011 were still pending, any complaint in relation to their outcome was premature. The decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 4 December 2012.","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were born in 1962 and 1994 respectively and live in Makhachkala, Republic of Dagestan, Russia. They are the mother and the wife of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, who was born in 1990. 6. At the material time Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and the applicants, along with other relatives, lived together at 115A Magomed Dalgata Street, Makhachkala, Dagestan. According to the applicants for about eighteen months prior to the events in question Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been suspected of illegal activities and had been followed by Dagestani law enforcement agencies, in particular by the Centre against Extremism of the Dagestan Ministry of the Interior (“the CPE”) (Центр по Борьбе с Экстремизмом МВД по Республике Дагестан (ЦПЭ)). 7. At about 6 p.m. on 20 May 2013 Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev drove in his white GAZ Volga-3110 car along Engelsa Street to visit his relatives, who lived about a ten-minute drive from his house in Makhachkala. At about 6.45 p.m. his car was stopped and he was abducted by a group of eight armed men who were driving two civilian vehicles: a silver-coloured VAZ-21014, which had a registration number which partially read “A067”, and a black VAZ-21099. The men were dressed in civilian clothing and were masked. The applicants’ relative, Mr Ub.Ub., called Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev during the abduction and upon hearing him screaming immediately informed the applicants that there was a problem. Directly after that Mr Ub.Ub., together with the first applicant, went along Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s route and found his car in the street with two police vehicles and officers from the Sovetskiy district police station in Makhachkala (“the Sovetskiy ROVD”) (Советский районный отдел внутренних дел (РОВД)) next to it. The police told the first applicant and Mr Ub.Ub. that they had arrived a couple of minutes ago and that a few minutes prior to their arrival a man had been abducted. They told the applicant and Mr Ub.Ub. to wait at home for a telephone call from the police and took Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s car to the premises of the Sovetskiy ROVD. 8. Approximately twenty days after the abduction, that is to say between 9 and 12 June 2013, police officers from the CPE searched the applicants’ house. 9. About a month after the events, on or around 20 June 2013, the applicants obtained video footage of the abduction from a local resident (see paragraph 23 below). They recognised one of the abductors by his voice as the CPE officer named “Shakir” and informed the authorities of this. 10. On 1 July 2013 a burnt male corpse was found five kilometres from Gurbuki village in the Karabudakhkenstrkiy district in Dagestan. 11. On 23 December 2013 the body was identified by the authorities as that of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev (see paragraph 53 below). The applicants and their relatives disagreed with that conclusion (see paragraphs 54-55 below). 12. According to the applicants, they have had no news of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev since his abduction. 13. The Government did not dispute the facts as presented by the applicants, but denied any involvement of State agents in the incident. 14. In reply to the Court’s first request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government provided ninety-eight copied pages of documents from it reflecting steps taken by the authorities between 14 June and 26 October 2013. 15. In reply to the Court’s further request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government submitted 372 copied pages of the relevant documents, some of which were illegible. The contents of the legible documents can be summarised as follows. 16. Immediately after the incident the applicants went to the Sovetskiy ROVD, informed the police of the abduction and gave statements to the police investigator. They also conducted their own search for eye witnesses to the incident and found several of them in nearby shops and blocks of flats. The applicants informed the investigators of their findings (see, for example, paragraph 23 below). 17. On 20 May and then on 24 May 2013 the applicants complained of the abduction to the Sovetskiy district investigations department (“the investigations department”). In their second complaint they stated that, in their opinion, the police were wilfully postponing steps in the investigation of the incident. 18. On 3 June 2013 the investigators examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected. 19. On 6 June 2013 the investigators examined the car from which Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been abducted; two fingerprints were collected from the chassis of the vehicle. On the same date a forensic examination of the fingerprints was ordered. 20. On 14 June 2013 the investigations department opened criminal case no. 302564 into the abduction. The applicants were informed thereof. 21. On 18 June 2013 the investigators granted Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s father, Mr A.A., victim status in the criminal case and questioned him. His statement was similar to the applicants’ account submitted to the Court. The witness stated, amongst other things, that he had not witnessed the abduction and had learnt of it from his relatives. According to the witness, his son had no unpaid debts or personal enemies and had the mobile telephone number 8-903-481-61-47. 22. On 18 June 2013 the investigators questioned Mr Ub.Ub. whose statement concerning the incident was similar to the applicants’ account before the Court. 23. According to the applicants, shortly after their initial complaint to the authorities they identified witnesses to the incident and informed the investigators accordingly. As a result, on 21 June 2013 the investigators questioned Mr Ma.Ma. who stated that at about 6.45 p.m. on 20 May 2013 he had been smoking on his balcony at 3 Engelsa Street when he had heard men arguing. He had looked out and seen a group of six or seven masked men with pistols in their hands. Four of those men had been trying to pull the driver out of a white GAZ Volga-3110 car but the latter had been resisting. Then the men had started beating him and had somehow managed to pull him from his seat into the back seat of the car. Three of them had got inside the vehicle. In about two or three minutes the masked men had carried the immobilised driver out of the car and put him in a silvercoloured VAZ-2114. Then all of the masked men had driven off in that car and a black VAZ-21099 car. Immediately afterwards the witness had gone outside and asked a passerby to call the police. In about five minutes the police had arrived at the scene. According to the witness, he had recorded the abduction on his mobile telephone camera and then copied it to a CD. 24. On the same date, 21 June 2013, the investigators seized the abduction footage made by Mr Ma.Ma. On 25 June 2013 they examined the video, the contents of which were similar to the applicants’ account of the abduction submitted to the Court. 25. On 25 June 2013 the investigators questioned the second applicant’s mother, Ms G.G., whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to the applicants’ account before the Court. She had not witnessed the incident and had learnt of it from her relatives. 26. On the same date, 25 June 2013, the investigators questioned the first applicant, whose statement was similar to the applicants’ submission before the Court. In addition the investigators obtained samples of the first applicant’s saliva for DNA testing and for its database. 27. On 20 August 2013 the investigators ordered a comparison of the first applicant’s DNA samples with those from the DNA database. 28. On 30 August 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that in June and July 2013 she had received text messages on her telephone from two unknown numbers. The first message contained the following: “Congratulations, your son became a shahid on the path of jihad in the Karabudakhkenstrkiy district ... May Allah accept his shahada and take him to the gardens of Firdous. Allahu Akbar!” The second message contained the following: “...Your son and son-in-law were set up by your neighbour Makhmud who worked for the 7th department [of the police]. If you don’t believe it, have your men follow him. I could not do nothing about it as I have got nobody who could help me eliminate him. This beast spares no one. I hope you will believe me as I have got no other way out. My brother was the only tower of strength in my life. Friend.” 29. On the same date, 30 August 2013, the investigators seized the first applicant’s mobile telephone to examine the above messages. It was established that the first message had been received on 15 June 2013 from a mobile telephone located that day in Popovicha Street in Makhachkala; the second message – received on 20 July 2013 – came from a different telephone number. 30. On 5 September 2013 the investigators requested the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala to grant them permission to obtain from the relevant mobile phone operator the call logs of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s telephone number (8-903-481-61-47) between 20 April and 1 September 2013. 31. On 9 September 2013 the investigators received the court’s permission and examined the call logs of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s telephone calls. According to the logs, at about 6.35 p.m. on 20 May 2013 he had received a telephone call from Mr Ub.Ub and after that the handset had been switched off. On 16 August 2013 a five-second call had been received on Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s number; the caller had been located in the area of Dachi in Makhachkala. 32. On 9 September 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that on the morning of 5 September 2013 she had received a call on her mobile telephone from a man who had not introduced himself but had stated that he was an officer of the Federal Security Service (“the FSB”) (Федеральная Служба Безопасности (ФСБ)) and that he was holding Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev. The man, who had called from 8988-059-41-98, had told her that he would release her son in one day in exchange for 250,000 Russian roubles (RUB). The applicant had passed the telephone to her husband who had told the man they had had only RUB 150,000 and that they would pay RUB 50,000 at once and then RUB 100,000 after their son’s release. The man had told them that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev was being held about a ten to twelve hour drive from Makhachkala and that he was in a bad state of health. Between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. on that date (5 September 2013) the first applicant’s husband and the man had called each other several times. The applicant’s husband had been ordered to deposit RUB 50,000 in the account of mobile telephone number 8-964-519-62-69, which he had done on the same day. The man had confirmed receipt of the money and told the applicant and her husband to wait for his call. But he had not called back and his telephone number had been disconnected since 5 September 2013. 33. On 25 September 2013 the forensic experts informed the investigators that the fingerprints collected from Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s car (see paragraph 19 above) were not fit for identification. The applicants were informed thereof on 21 December 2013. 34. On 30 September 2013 the investigators requested that the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala grant them permission to obtain the call logs of telephone number 8-988-059-41-98 (used by the alleged FSB officer on 5 September 2013) between 1 August and 30 September 2013. Permission was received on 4 October 2013. 35. On 7 October 2013 the investigators searched Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s house. No evidence was collected. 36. On 7 October 2013 the investigators questioned the second applicant whose statement concerning the abduction was similar to that submitted by the applicants to the Court. She had not witnessed the incident but had learnt of it from her relatives. 37. On 9 October 2013 the investigators received the call logs of the telephone number 8-988-059-41-98. According to these logs, the caller who had contacted the first applicant and her husband on 5 September 2013 (see paragraph 32 above) had been located in Volgograd. 38. On 10 October 2013 the first applicant requested the investigators to order an expert analysis of the voice of one of the abductors from the video footage of the incident (see paragraph 23 above); according to her, Mr Ub.Ub. had identified that voice as belonging to a Dagestan CPE officer named Shakir whom he would be able to identify if necessary. The applicant requested that the investigators examine the video and compare the abductor’s voice to that of Shakir. 39. On 16 October 2013 the investigators granted the first applicant’s request and ordered that steps be taken to identify the CPE officer Shakir and to analyse the voice on the video. The applicants were informed thereof. 40. On 26 October 2013 the investigators questioned Mr T.G. who stated that he lived next to the scene of the abduction but had not witnessed it and learnt of it from his neighbours. 41. On 28 October 2013 the investigators questioned police officer A.A. who stated that on 20 May 2013 he had been on duty at the Sovetskiy ROVD and had been called to the abduction scene. According to the witness, the investigators had examined the crime scene and had towed away the white GAZ Volga-3110 car left behind after the abduction to their police station. After about a month the car had been picked up by an unnamed individual. 42. On 1 November 2013 the investigators questioned Shakir N., an officer with the Dagestan CPE, who stated that he did not have information pertaining to the abduction, but that he had participated in the search of the applicants’ house in June 2013 (see paragraph 8 above). The witness also confirmed that in June 2013, about two days after the search, he had spoken with Mr Ub.Ub. who had visited the CPE with his son Mr A.Ub., who had been suspected of involvement in illegal armed groups. Mr Ub.Ub. had requested his assistance in the criminal case against his son Mr A.Ub. but the witness had refused to help him. Due to the passage of time the witness could not recall where he had been on the evening of 20 May 2013 but stated that he had not met Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and had not participated in a special operation against him. The witness’ mobile telephone number was 8-967-395-69-75 and he had been using that number since June 2012. 43. On 3 November 2013 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that, in her opinion, her son had been abducted by special forces servicemen or law-enforcement officers as they had suspected Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev of aiding members of illegal armed groups. Twenty-four days after the abduction the CPE officers had searched her house (see paragraph 8 above). According to the applicant, Mr Ub.Ub. had met officer Shakir in the middle of June when he had gone to the CPE with his son. 44. On 5 November 2013 the investigators received the call logs of the telephone number used for the deposit of RUB 50,000 (see paragaph 32 above). According to the list, on 5 September 2013 the caller had been located in Volgograd, Russia. 45. On 19 November 2013 the investigators ordered an expert analysis of the voices in the abduction video (see paragraph 23 above). It can be seen from the documents submitted that on an unspecified date between 19 and 28 November 2013 the experts concluded that the voice on the footage was not fit for identification (see paragraph 47 below). 46. On 24 or 25 November 2013 the investigators requested the Sovetskiy District Court in Makhachkala to grant them permission to obtain the call logs for between 10 a.m. and 11 p.m. on 20 May 2013 from the telephone number belonging to officer Shakir N. (see paragraph 42 above). This was granted on 28 November 2013. 47. On 28 November 2013 the Dagestan Ministry of the Interior conducted an internal inquiry into the applicants’ allegations of the involvement of the CPE officers in the abduction and concluded, amongst other things, the following: “... On 20 May 2013 A.A. complained of the abduction of his son Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev to the Investigations Department ... ... According to the witness statements of the first applicant, Mr R.M., Mr Ub.Ub. and Mr A.Ub., enclosed with the complaint, officers of the CPE were involved in the abduction ... In their statements Mr Ub.Ub. and Mr A.A. directly indicate the CPE officers Ra.M. and Shakir; the latter they had been able to identify from the video posted on Youtube under the title “Abduction of Mr S. Abakargadzhiyev”. According to the statement of the CPE operational search officer Shakir N. given to the inquiry, ... in June 2013 he had participated with his colleagues from the CPE in the search of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s home ... After the search, prior to the departure, he and his colleagues had asked Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s relatives to ensure that Mr A.Ub. would appear at the CPE. The latter, who had been related to Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, had been listed in the CPE’s database as a supporter of terrorist groups, had been told to report to the CPE to help with enquiries ... several days later Mr A.Ub. had been arrested and charged with the same crimes for which he had been investigated. After the arrest, the father of Mr A.Ub., Mr Ub.Ub., had asked the witness and Captain Ra.M. to assist him in persuading the authorities to be lenient towards his son, but his requests had been refused by the officers ... On the date of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s abduction the witness had taken a detainee, Mr M.D., to the court ... he had had nothing to do with the abduction. In addition, the witness explained that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been an ardent supporter of Wahabiism and on several occasions had aided members of Dagestani terrorist groups, in particular, Mr S.Gu., and had participated in the attack on Dagestan traffic police officers near Agachul in February 2013 ... When questioned, the head of the operational search divison of the Dagestan CPE, Captain Ra.M., confirmed the above statement and explained that neither he nor his subordinate officers had had anything to do with the abduction. Mr Ub.Ub. had told lies about them as he and the servicemen of his department had arrested his son Mr A.Ub. in connection with the investigation of criminal case no. 30284. According to the evidence submitted by the CPE, they had obtained information concerning planned attempts on the lives of law-enforcement officers committed by Mr S.G., Mr A.Kh., Mr G.A. and Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev on 6 February 2013. The CPE officers did not arrest or detain Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev and no operational measures were taken against him... ... It can be seen from the case file that according to the expert analysis of the video “Abduction of S. Abakargadzhiyev” it was imposssible to analyse and identify the voices therein ... Thus, the internal inquiry was not able to verify the first applicant’s complaints concerning the unlawful actions of the CPE officers owing to significant discrepancies between the statements of those questioned during the inquiry; those discrepancies could be resolved only within the framework of a criminal case ...” 48. On 4 December 2013 the investigators received the call logs of officer Shakir N.’s mobile telephone for 20 May 2013, according to which on that date his telephone had been located in Makhachkala. 49. On 12 December 2013 the investigators questioned forensic expert Mr M.U., who had fingerprinted the white GAZ Volga-3110 car (see paragraphs 19 and 33 above). According to the witness, nobody else had touched the vehicle until after the examination. 50. On 30 December 2013 the investigation was suspended. The applicants were informed thereof. 51. On 28 January 2014 the investigation was resumed and the applicants were informed accordingly. The decision stated, amongst other things, the following: “... the investigation established that Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev’s corpse had been found five kilometres north-west of Gurbuki village ... In connection with this, on 1 July 2013 the Kaspiysk Investigations Department opened criminal case no. 329105 ...” 52. On 29 January 2014 the investigators examined the contents of criminal case file no. 329105. According to the contents, there was a 99.93% DNA match between the DNA of the burnt corpse and that of the first applicant taken from the DNA database, as shown by the results of a forensic examination of 23 December 2013. 53. On 3 February 2014, having established that the burnt body found on 1 July 2013 had been that of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev, the investigations in criminal cases nos. 302564 and 329105 were joined by the investigators under the number 302564. The decision stated that the body had been found in a VAZ-2107 vehicle in which a home-made explosive device had been detonated. 54. On an unspecified date between February and March 2014 the investigators asked the first applicant to identify the body found on 1 July 2013. According to the applicant, she was not shown the actual corpse, but a photograph of it. She was able to tell from the photograph that it was not the body of her son Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev: according to the police, the corpse had at least five gold teeth; Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev did not have any. 55. On 12 March 2014 the first applicant’s husband asked the investigators to question him and the first applicant again about the circumstances of the abduction, to order another expert forensic examination of the corpse and to further examine and identify the voice of Shakir N. recorded by Mr Ub.Ub. The outcome of this request is unknown. 56. It appears from the documents submitted that the proceedings are still pending. 63. The applicant maintained that it was beyond reasonable doubt that the men who had abducted their relative Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev on 20 May 2013 had been State agents. In support of their allegation they referred to the following: the abduction had taken place in broad daylight, in an area surrounded by CCTV cameras, in the presence of witnesses; the perpetrators had acted openly, without fear of arrest by law-enforcement authorities; the authorities had wilfully delayed the investigation of the incident by conducting, for instance, the crime scene examination almost two weeks after the applicants’ complaints about it (see paragraphs 17 and 18 above) and by taking further steps either belatedly or with major deficiences (see, for example, paragraphs 19 and 33 above); the CPE officer Shakir N. had been present in the vicinity of the abduction scene during the incident (see paragraphs 38 and 48 above) and the applicants had informed the investigators of his and his colleagues’ alleged involvement in the crime; Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev had been suspected of involvement in illegal activities and, therefore, the authorities had had motives for his abduction (see paragraphs 38, 43 and 47 above). The applicants also referred to a number of abductions allegedly perpetrated by State authorities in Dagestan between 2011 and 2012 in similar circumstances, where some of the abducted men had subsequently been found in State custody. 64. The Government denied any involvement of State agents in the events. In particular, they stated that only in October 2013 had the first applicant alleged that law-enforcement officers had been involved in the incident (see paragraph 38 above). 65. The Court points out that a number of principles have been developed in its case-law as regards applications in which it is faced with the task of establishing facts on which the parties disagree. As to the facts that are in dispute, the Court reiterates its jurisprudence requiring the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” in its assessment of evidence (see Avşar v. Turkey, no. 25657/94, § 282, ECHR 2001-VII). Such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact. In this context, the conduct of the parties when evidence is being obtained has to be taken into account (see Taniş and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, § 160, ECHR 2005VIII). 66. The Court is sensitive to the subsidiary nature of its role and recognises that it must be cautious in taking on the role of a first-instance tribunal of fact, where this is not rendered unavoidable by the circumstances of a particular case (see, for example, McKerr v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 28883/95, 4 April 2000). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny (see, mutatis mutandis, Ribitsch v. Austria, 4 December 1995, § 32, Series A no. 336, and Avşar, cited above, § 283) even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place. 67. The Court reiterates that it has noted the difficulties for applicants to obtain the necessary evidence in support of allegations in cases where the respondent Government are in possession of the relevant documentation and fail to submit it. Where the applicant makes out a prima facie case and the Court is prevented from reaching factual conclusions owing to the lack of such documents, it is for the Government to argue conclusively why the documents in question cannot serve to corroborate the allegations made by the applicants, or to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation as to how the events in question occurred. The burden of proof is thus shifted to the Government and if they fail in their arguments, issues will arise under Article 2 and/or Article 3 of the Convention (see Toğcu v. Turkey, no. 27601/95, § 95, 31 May 2005, and Akkum and Others v. Turkey, no. 21894/93, § 211, ECHR 2005II). 68. The Court notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev the Government produced the relevant documents from the file (see paragraphs 14 and 15 above). 69. The Court has found the Russian State authorities responsible for a number of extra-judicial executions or disappearances of civilians perpetrated in the Chechen Republic at the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s, even in the absence of final conclusions from the domestic investigation (see Khashiyev and Akayeva v. Russia, nos. 57942/00 and 57945/00, 24 February 2005; Luluyev and Others v. Russia, no. 69480/01, ECHR 2006-XIII; Estamirov and Others v. Russia, no. 60272/00, 12 October 2006; and Baysayeva v. Russia, no. 74237/01, 5 April 2007). It has done so taking into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and on the basis of witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of military or security personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. It has relied on references to military vehicles and equipment, on witness accounts, on other information on security operations and on the undisputed effective control of the areas in question by the Russian military. On that basis, it has concluded that the areas in question were “within the exclusive control of the authorities of the State” in view of the military or security operations being conducted there and the presence of servicemen (see, mutatis mutandis, Akkum, cited above, § 211, and Zubayrayev v. Russia, no. 67797/01, § 82, 10 January 2008). 70. However, in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred do not warrant an unequivocal conclusion that State agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants’ relative for the following reasons. As regards the general background, the events complained of took place not in Chechnya, but in Dagestan in May 2013, and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving civilian vehicles. Noting that the applicants’ version of the events was based on the statements of those who had not witnessed the abduction themselves, except for the statement of Mr Ma.Ma., that the video of the abduction had not assisted in the identification of the culprits (see paragraphs 24 and 45 above) and taking into account that the abductors drove ordinary vehicles and were wearing balaclavas and civilian clothing, the Court has little evidence to rely upon. However, bearing in mind that after the events the applicants received information alleging knowledge of their relative’s whereabouts which they submitted to the authorities with a delay varying from several days to several weeks (see, for example, paragraphs 28 and 32 above), along with the subsequent discovery of the burnt body and the experts’ evaluation concerning its identity (see paragraphs 52 and 53 above), the Court is not persuaded that the abduction of the applicants’ relative by State agents is the only possible explanation of the events in question. 71. Accordingly, the information in the Court’s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a “security operation” had been carried out in respect of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev. 72. To sum up, it has not been established to the required standard of proof that State agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr Sakhrab Abakargadzhiyev; nor does the Court consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government.",['2'],['2-1'],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],1

De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani,"5. The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Tauragė. 6. On 23 July 2006 officers of the State Border Guard Service were patrolling the border between Lithuania and Russia in the Jurbarkas Region, by the river Nemunas. At around 2 a.m. the officers noticed several cars approaching the river and heard the sound of a boat in the water. The officers approached one of the cars and found cartons of cigarettes inside, which they suspected had been smuggled from Russia. The three individuals who had been in the car, K.B., E.L. and M.G., were arrested. During the arrests K.B. received a gunshot wound and the officers took him to a hospital in Jurbarkas (hereinafter “the hospital”). 7. At around 3.30 a.m. E.L.’s mobile telephone began to ring and a border officer answered it. The caller stated that he would “find and shoot” the officer who had injured K.B. A subsequent forensic examination identified the caller’s voice as probably (tikėtinai) that of the applicant. 8. At around 4 a.m. the applicant arrived at the hospital and approached the border officers guarding K.B. The applicant used various swearwords towards the officers, demanded that they release K.B. and said that he would beat them up or kill them. It appears that no physical altercation occurred between the applicant and the officers and that the applicant subsequently left the hospital. 9. On the same day the State Border Guard Service opened a pre-trial investigation against the applicant and several other individuals. The applicant was suspected, among other things, of threatening to murder or seriously injure law enforcement officers and obstructing and verbally abusing them in the exercise of their official duties, under Articles 145 § 1 and 231 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 21-22 below). 10. On 5 December 2006 the Jurbarkas district prosecutor (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) discontinued the pre-trial investigation against the applicant for lack of evidence. As to the words and statements used by the applicant in his interaction with the border officers (see paragraphs 7 and 8 above), the prosecutor noted that the applicant could have committed the administrative offence of minor hooliganism under Article 174 of the Code of Administrative Offences (see paragraph 26 below). The prosecutor’s decision was forwarded to the State Border Guard Service, instructing them to decide whether administrative proceedings against the applicant should be instituted. However, three days later a senior prosecutor annulled that decision and reopened the pre-trial investigation. 11. On an unspecified date administrative proceedings were instituted against the applicant; the information available to the Court does not indicate which authority was in charge of them. On 18 December 2006 the Jurbarkas District Court held that the applicant had committed the administrative offence of minor hooliganism when he had used swearwords in the presence of border officers in the hospital (see paragraph 8 above). He was given a warning. The decision was not appealed against and became final after the expiry of the ten-day time-limit for appeal. 12. On 6 August 2008 the prosecutor charged the applicant with threatening to murder or seriously injure law enforcement officers, and insulting them in the exercise of their official duties, under Articles 145 § 1 and 290 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 21 and 24 below). The indictment alleged that the applicant had committed the offences in the hospital on 23 July 2006 (see paragraph 8 above). The case was transferred to the Jurbarkas District Court for examination on the merits but in June 2009, at the prosecutor’s request, the case was returned for additional investigation. 13. On 23 October 2009 the prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation, stating that the applicant’s actions had not amounted to the criminal offence of threatening to murder or seriously injure the officers because there had not been any objective circumstances indicating that he could have carried out those threats. The prosecutor also held that the applicant could not be prosecuted for insulting the officers because he had already been given an administrative penalty for the same conduct (see paragraph 11 above) – continuing the criminal proceedings against him would be in breach of the ne bis in idem principle. 14. On 11 June 2010 the Prosecutor General’s Office annulled the prosecutor’s decision and reopened the investigation, noting that the administrative penalty given to the applicant “did not automatically preclude” the criminal proceedings against him. 15. The applicant appealed against that decision to a senior prosecutor at the Prosecutor General’s Office but on 30 June 2010 his appeal was dismissed. The senior prosecutor held that, in line with the case-law of the domestic courts, an administrative penalty did not preclude the institution of subsequent criminal proceedings concerning the same conduct; however, in order to comply with the ne bis in idem principle, if a person was found guilty in the criminal proceedings, the previous administrative penalty had to be annulled or, if that was impossible, it had to be taken into account during sentencing. Accordingly, the prosecutor considered that the administrative penalty given to the applicant did not preclude the continuation of the criminal proceedings against him. 16. On 2 November 2010 the Jurbarkas District Court upheld the applicant’s appeal and overruled the prosecutor’s decision of 30 June 2010. It held that criminal proceedings against the applicant could be continued only after the administrative penalty had been annulled, but since that had not been done, any further proceedings concerning the same conduct would be in breach of the ne bis in idem principle. However, on 8 December 2010 the Kaunas Regional Court quashed the lower court’s decision, reiterating the reasoning of the prosecutor’s decision of 30 June 2010 (see paragraph 15 above). That decision was not subject to any further appeal. 17. In June 2011 the case was transferred to the Jurbarkas District Court for examination on the merits. The amended indictment alleged that the applicant had committed the offences set out in Articles 145 § 1 and 290 of the Criminal Code because of the words and statements which he had used when speaking to the border officers on the telephone (see paragraph 7 above) and in the hospital on 23 July 2006 (see paragraph 8 above). 18. On 6 September 2011 the Jurbarkas District Court terminated the criminal proceedings against the applicant as time-barred. That decision was not appealed against and became final.",['P7'],['P7-4'],[],[],[],[],1

AUSTRIA,4,No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8 - Expulsion),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Iulia Motoc;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Marko Bošnjak;Nona Tsotsoria;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Kosovo. 6. The applicant entered Austria for the first time on 14 January 1994 when he was 19 years old. 7. In November 1994 the applicant was arrested for working illegally, and on 16 November 1994 the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority (Bezirkshauptmannschaft) issued a decision imposing a five-year residence ban (Aufenthaltsverbot) on him. 8. On 5 January 1995 the applicant lodged an asylum claim, which on 27 January 1995 was dismissed by the Federal Asylum Office (Bundesasylamt) as unfounded. His appeal against that decision was dismissed, and he voluntarily returned to Kosovo in September 1997. 9. On 1 July 1998 the applicant returned to Austria and lodged a fresh asylum claim on 8 July 1998, this time together with his wife and their daughter. The asylum claim was dismissed by the Federal Asylum Office on 12 August 1998, but the applicant and his family were granted subsidiary protection. They received a temporary residence permit, which was extended several times. 10. The applicant’s temporary residence permit, which was based on his right to subsidiary protection, expired in December 2009, as he had not applied for its renewal. 11. On 2 March 2003 the Dornbirn District Court (Bezirksgericht – hereinafter “the District Court”) convicted the applicant of bodily harm and sentenced him to a fine of 350 euros (EUR), suspended in part on the basis of a probationary period. 12. On 29 August 2003 the Feldkirch Regional Court (Landesgericht – hereinafter “the Regional Court”) convicted the applicant of bodily harm. He was sentenced to a fine of EUR 400, which was suspended on the basis of a probationary period. 13. On 30 October 2003 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of aggravated burglary and sentenced him to twelve months’ imprisonment, eight and a half months of which were suspended on the basis of a probationary period. He was in pre-trial detention and then prison from 28 July to 11 November 2003. 14. On 26 July 2004 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of participating in a brawl, for which he was sentenced to a fine of EUR 720. 15. On 17 January 2006 the District Court convicted the applicant of bodily harm and sentenced him to a fine of EUR 600. 16. On 13 March 2007 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of several offences under the Drugs Act (Suchtmittelgesetz) and aggravated threat, and he was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment. The suspension of the eight and a half months’ imprisonment in the sentence of 30 October 2003 (see paragraph 13 above) was revoked. The applicant was in prison from 23 May until 12 November 2007. A part of the prison sentence was postponed until 18 November 2009, when the applicant started serving the remainder of the sentence. 17. On 21 January 2010, hence while he was in prison, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of an offence under the Drugs Act and sentenced him to a fine of 400 EUR. 18. On 12 May 2010 the Bregenz District Court convicted the applicant, who was still in prison at that time, of attempted bodily harm, bodily injury caused by negligence, and endangering the physical integrity of others, and sentenced him to a fine. 19. On 2 August 2012 the Regional Court convicted the applicant of aggravated threat and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment. It was his ninth criminal conviction in Austria. 20. On 13 September 2007, as a consequence of his criminal convictions, the Dornbirn District Administrative Authority issued the applicant with a ban prohibiting his return to Austria (Rückkehrverbot, see paragraph 33 below), which was valid for ten years. It however remained without effect as long as his subsidiary protection status was still valid (see paragraph 34 below). The Vorarlberg Security Police Authority (Sicherheitspolizeidirektion) confirmed the ban in a decision of 5 November 2007. The applicant did not appeal against that decision. 21. On 29 March 2010 the Innsbruck Federal Asylum Office instituted proceedings to withdraw the applicant’s subsidiary protection. On 7 April 2010 it conducted an interview with him, during which he stated the following concerning his living situation in Austria. He had four children, born in 1997, 1999, 2000 and 2006 respectively. His parents, his three siblings and their spouses and children all lived in the same city as him. His parents and his older brother were recognised refugees. He and his parents lived in the same house. He was working as a maintenance man and translator for Albanian and German, and his wife was also working. Both had a regular income. His father still owned some land and three shops in Kosovo, which were run by relatives at that time. The applicant stated that if he had to return to Kosovo he would not know what to do there or where to go. He had a “bad feeling” about returning, but did not fear any repression. The security situation was bad, and the views of society were primitive. His wife and children would not have to fear any problems upon returning to Kosovo, and would probably join him if he were expelled. He would, however, prefer to stay in Austria, where his children went to school. 22. On 17 May 2010 the Federal Asylum Office withdrew the applicant’s subsidiary protection status under section 9 (1) of the Asylum Act (Asylgesetz). It found that there was no longer a risk of a violation of the applicant’s rights under Article 2 or 3 of the Convention if he was returned to Kosovo, and declared his expulsion admissible. Quoting international sources, it explained that the security situation in Kosovo had significantly improved in recent years and was now considered to be stable. There was no threat from the Kosovo Liberation Army (Ushtria Çlirimtare e Kosovës) anymore, which the applicant had initially alleged when applying for asylum. 23. Turning to the applicant’s rights under Article 8 of the Convention, the Federal Asylum Office acknowledged how established his private and family life was in Austria, where his family members were living. However, it referred to his numerous convictions for crimes against life and limb as well as property, and concluded that the public interest in his expulsion outweighed his personal interest in remaining in the country. The Federal Asylum Office specifically mentioned the two convictions for drug offences in 2007 and 2010, which it considered particularly serious. Further, it held that the applicant still had ties with Kosovo, because he had grown up there, spoke Albanian, and was physically capable of working in order to earn a living. According to the applicant’s own statements, his father still owned some land and three shops in Kosovo, so it could be assumed that he could find work. Given that the applicant’s wife had her own income, the Federal Asylum Office further assumed that she would be able to take care of the needs of the family, and that the applicant could send her financial maintenance from Kosovo. 24. On 27 June 2011 the Asylum Court (Asylgerichtshof) confirmed the relevant parts of the Federal Asylum Office’s decision. It held that, according to Article 19 § 3 in conjunction with Article 37 § 1 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch), the fines the applicant had received for his criminal convictions (1460 daily rates in total), amounted to almost twentyfour months’ imprisonment (see paragraphs 35-36 below). The actual prison sentences he had received amounted to twenty-two months in total, which was considerable. The Asylum Court concluded that, even though the applicant had strong private and family ties in Austria, the public interest in his expulsion in order to prevent crime outweighed his personal interest in continuing his family life in Austria. He had reoffended even after he had been issued with the ban prohibiting his return to Austria, a fact which did not speak in his favour. Also, he could reapply for a residence permit in 2017 when the ban expired. 25. The applicant lodged a complaint against that decision with the Constitutional Court. Among other things, he stated that one of his daughters had in fact been born as a result of an extra-marital relationship with an Austrian citizen, and was living with her Austrian mother and not with him. The applicant claimed that it would be difficult to maintain contact with her if he were expelled to Kosovo. 26. The Constitutional Court then asked the Asylum Court to submit a statement regarding this new fact. The Asylum Court replied on 13 September 2011 that the applicant had spoken of four children throughout the proceedings, but had never mentioned that one of them had in fact been born as a result of an extra-marital relationship and had never lived with him in the same household. He could continue to pay financial maintenance from Kosovo for his daughter. The Asylum Court expressed the view that the decision to declare the applicant’s expulsion admissible was nonetheless proportionate to the aims pursued, as his family life with his illegitimate daughter was in any event much less established than that with his other family members. 27. On 14 December 2011 the Constitutional Court refused to deal with the applicant’s complaint. That decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 9 January 2012. 28. The applicant was in pre-trial detention and prison from 1 June 2012 (in relation to the criminal conviction of 2 August 2012, see paragraph 19 above) until he was placed in detention pending his expulsion on 4 January 2013. 29. On 5 January 2013 the applicant was expelled to Kosovo. His family decided to remain in Austria. 30.

101,001-152268,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,TANTILOVI v. BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,Guido Raimondi;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicants, Ms Maria Stefanova Tantilova and Ms Anka Stefanova Tantilova, are Bulgarian nationals, who were born in 1923 and 1922 respectively and live in Plovdiv. They were represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv. 2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, Ms M. Kotseva and Ms L. Gyurova, of the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicants’ mother owned a building and a plot of land of 1,370 square metres in Plovdiv. The property was expropriated in 1975, against the payment of monetary compensation of 1,911 old Bulgarian levs (BGL). Initially, the plot was designated for the creation of a public garden and in 1984 it was allocated for the construction of a street. However, none of these projects took shape. In 1983 the municipal authorities rented the property to the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Plovdiv. 5. On 2 April 1992, following the adoption of the 1992 Restitution Act (see paragraph 17 below), the applicants requested the mayor of Plovdiv to quash the expropriation order and restore their property rights to the plot of land and the building on it. On an unspecified date the mayor rejected their request, reasoning that the building previously owned by the applicants’ mother had been pulled down and that a new building used as a church had been erected in its place, and that the area around this new building had been developed. 6. The applicants sought judicial review of the above decision. 7. In a decision of 10 May 1994 the Plovdiv Regional Court set aside the mayor’s decision and quashed the 1974 expropriation order, finding that the preconditions for restitution under the Restitution Act had been met. None of the projects for which the property had been taken, namely the creation of a public garden and the construction of a street, had been pursued. The domestic court noted in addition that the expropriated building existed and, in so far as in 1983 it had been reconstructed to serve as a church, such reconstruction had not been envisaged by the respective urban development plans. 8. In the meantime, on 27 June 1993 the applicants paid back the sum received in compensation at the time of expropriation, to allow the quashing of the expropriation order to take effect. As a result of inflation and the depreciation of Bulgarian currency, at that time the sum represented about 115 German marks (DEM). On 15 February 1995 the mayor of Plovdiv ordered the strike out of the plot of land from the register of municipal properties, in accordance with the decision of the Plovdiv Regional Court, but refused to do so in regard of the “building erected by permission no. 124 of 20 June 1983”. 9. The applicants were thus unable to take possession of the property, which continued to be occupied by the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Plovdiv. On 17 June 1996, the applicants brought a rei vindicatio action against the Church. Initially the claim was also directed against the Union of the Evangelical Pentecostal Churches in Bulgaria; however, subsequently the proceedings in respect of it were dropped. 10. In the course of the proceedings, the Evangelical Pentecostal Church (and, in the beginning, the Union of the Evangelical Pentecostal Churches) argued that the preconditions for restitution had not been met, in particular because the building formerly owned by the applicants’ mother had been demolished as it had been entirely “worn out”, and the Church had built a completely new and bigger building, through donations from its parish and according to the approved construction plans. In order to establish these facts, the Church presented plans and called witnesses. Still, the Church conceded that the land and the building it was using were municipallyowned and that it rented the property. In the event that the courts would find that the property was to be returned to the applicants, the Church claimed that the applicants had to be ordered to reimburse the cost of the improvements made by it, and requested to be allowed to retain the property until payment. 11. On 21 February 1997 the Plovdiv Regional Court, which examined the case at first instance, allowed a request by the Evangelical Pentecostal Church of Plovdiv for the Plovdiv municipality to be joined to the proceedings as a third party. The municipality also argued in the course of the proceedings that the building claimed by the applicants was a new one, which meant that the preconditions for its restitution were not satisfied. 12. On 4 March 1999 the Regional Court allowed the applicants’ claims, finding, first, that they were the owners of the plot of land on the strength of the decision of 10 May 1994, and, second, that they were also the owners of the new building, which had been erected without the requisite re-allocation of the plot for that purpose and all necessary authorisations, and property to which had to follow property to the land. It found further that the defendant church was occupying the property without any valid legal basis. 13. On 22 December 2000 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal quashed that judgment and remitted the case to the Regional Court, which once again allowed the applicants’ claim in a judgment of 13 January 2003. Again, it found that the applicants were the owners of the land and the building and that, after the restitution, the defendant church was occupying them without any legal basis. 14. Upon an appeal by the defendant church, on 3 May 2004 the Plovdiv Court of Appeal quashed the Regional Court’s judgment and allowed the applicants’ claim in part. It found that in 1983, when it had been rented out to the defendant church, the building taken from the applicants’ mother had been pulled down and a much bigger, entirely new building had been built; it had become the property of the State, later of the municipality. It was irrelevant under the Restitution Act whether the new building’s construction had been duly authorised or not. Accordingly, the new building, the land on which it was standing, and the necessary adjoining land, totalling 744 square metres, could not be subject to restitution. On the other hand, the applicants’ property rights had been validly restored in respect of the remaining 626 square metres of the land and the defendant church had to vacate that part of the property. 15. As to the decision of 10 May 1994, the Court of Appeal noted that “it did not have res judicata effect as regards the property dispute”. 16. The applicants appealed on points of law. In a final judgment of 29 April 2004 the Supreme Court of Cassation dismissed their appeal. It confirmed the Court of Appeal’s finding that the building claimed by the applicants was not the one taken from their mother, but a new one, erected in 1983 and thus not subject to restitution. It held in addition as follows: “The main issue in the case, as raised in the appeal on points of law is: what is the significance for the legal dispute of the [decision of 10 May 1994]? The Supreme Court of Cassation finds that the Court of Appeal was right to reach the conclusion that the decision at issue had been given in administrative proceedings concerning the revocation of the expropriation. It does not have res judicata effect in respect of the dispute concerning the ownership of the property at issue ... Of course, in the present litigation the court is obliged, on the basis of the evidence presented, to establish all the circumstances related to the alleged property rights disputed by the parties.” 17. The Restitution of Property Expropriated under Building Planning Legislation Act (Закон за възстановяване на собствеността върху някои отчуждени имоти по ЗТСУ, ЗПИНМ, ЗБНМ, ЗДИ и ЗС, “the Restitution Act”) entered into force in February 1992. Its most relevant provisions have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Decheva and Others v. Bulgaria (no. 43071/06, §§ 28-31, 26 June 2012). 18. The provisions of domestic law concerning the res judicata effect of court judgments have been summarised in the Court’s judgment in the case of Kehaya and Others v. Bulgaria (nos. 47797/99 and 68698/01, §§ 34-55, 12 January 2006). 19. According to settled judicial practice under the Restitution Act, third parties claiming property rights could not intervene in the ex parte proceedings under that Act or challenge any decision restoring the former owners’ rights, but could have their claims examined in separate judicial proceedings, in which the courts exercised “indirect judicial review” (косвен контрол) of the restitution decision. The scope of that review was discussed in an Interpretative Decision of 10 May 2006 of the Supreme Court of Cassation, which noted that a third party claiming rights to a restituted property was not bound by a decision given under the Restitution Act and could dispute all preconditions for restitution as provided for under that Act, as this was its sole means by which to defend its rights (Тълкувателно решение № 6 от 10.05.2006 г. на ВКС по т. гр. д. № 6/2005 г.). 20. The relevant provisions of domestic law concerning remedies in respect of the length of proceedings have been summarised in the Court’s decisions in the cases of Balakchiev and Others v. Bulgaria ((dec.), no. 65187/10, §§ 18-37, 18 June 2013) and Valcheva and Abrashev v. Bulgaria ((dec.), nos. 6194/11 and 34887/11, §§ 47-66, 18 June 2013).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
102,001-178701,ENG,AUT,COMMITTEE,2017,CASE OF STANDARD VERLAGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH v. AUSTRIA,4,No violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{general} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression),Erik Møse;Yonko Grozev;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"6. The applicant company, a limited liability company based in Vienna, owns and publishes the daily newspaper Der Standard and the online news portal derstandard.at. 7. The Carinthian Regional Hospital Operating Company (Landeskrankenanstalten-Betriebsgesellschaft – hereinafter “the KABEG”) is a public-law institution (Anstalt öffentlichen Rechts) which operates five hospitals in Carinthia previously owned by the Region of Carinthia (Land Kärnten). 8. The KABEG is governed and represented by the board of management (Vorstand) which consists of at least one person and is appointed and supervised by the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat). The supervisory board consists of three members of the Regional Government, one person who is appointed by the Regional Government and two representatives of the employees of the KABEG. The chairperson of the supervisory board is appointed by the Regional Government. 9. In 2011 I.M. was the member of the board of management in charge of human resources. K.S. was the chairperson of the supervisory board and leader of the parliamentary group (Fraktionsführer) of the Freedom Party of Carinthia (Freiheitliche Partei in Kärnten) in the Carinthian Regional Parliament (Landtag). His brother, U.S., was Deputy Governor of the Region of Carinthia. 10. Because of financial problems, rehiring (Wiedereinstellung) of highlevel managers and accusations of tortious interference on the part of politicians in the recruitment process, management errors and corruption within the KABEG, a public debate arose in 2010. On 28 October 2010 the medical director of Klagenfurt Regional Hospital (Landeskrankenhaus), who was in charge at that time, criticised I.M. in a confidential employees’ meeting of the medical doctors of the hospital. Only a few hours later the medical director was dismissed without notice. 11. On 25 November 2011 on the internet news portal derstandard.at and on 26 November 2011 in the daily newspaper Der Standard the following article was published: “Spying accusation against KABEG board of management ... The [KABEG] board of management ..., [I.M.], is under heavy pressure. According to the minutes of a meeting disclosed on Friday, she is supposed to have ordered the spying on a confidential employees’ meeting [Betriebsversammlung] for doctors of Klagenfurt Regional Hospital herself. These minutes were drafted after the employees’ meeting on 28 October 2010 in the course of a subsequent meeting in the office of the board of management and they state: ‘[I.M.] explains that she has, as a precaution, sent an informant, who wrote up a transcript [Wortprotokoll].’ ‘Stasi methods’ Prominent victim of this informant was the medical director, [M.A.], who had accused the KABEG management of using ‘Stasi methods’ against insubordinate doctors. M.A. was dismissed without notice immediately after the employees’ meeting. The informant was a trainee lawyer under [I.M.]’s lawyer. [I.M] always claimed that she had not been aware of this operation, that the KABEG lawyer had acted on his own volition. [He] took the blame and therefore had to explain himself before the bar association. K.S. ([Freedom Party of Carinthia]), chairperson of the supervisory board, who also put pressure on journalists in respect of critical reports on the KABEG, is supposed to be the spiritus rector of the spying operation. The now disclosed minutes (which are at the disposal of Der Standard) cast doubts on [I.M.]’s version ...” 12. On 10 January 2012 K.S., referring to the statement, that he was supposed to be the spiritus rector of the spying operation, initiated private prosecution proceedings for defamation under the Media Act (Mediengesetz) against the applicant company. He claimed compensation and demanded publication of the judgment, arguing that the statement had been a statement of fact, lacked any factual basis and was untrue. 13. The applicant company argued that the statement was a critical but permissible value judgment and had had a factual basis: K.S. had cultivated a friendship with I.M. and had supported her in the ongoing public debate; moreover, he had been associated with other spying accusations and had even announced in public that he would investigate and spy on politically unpopular individuals in order to get information to discredit them in public. The article did not allege that K.S. had personally initiated or ordered that a spy be sent to the employees’ meeting; however, by regularly applying and publicly announcing such practices he had created a climate and environment where such unfair methods were anticipated as “normal” and commonplace. 14. On 21 March 2012 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court (Landesgericht für Strafsachen) rejected K.S.’s claims under the Media Act as inadmissible, reasoning that the term spiritus rector was neither defamatory nor mocking, nor did it allege specific conduct. Being called a spiritus rector meant being seen as a spiritual or ideological guide (geistiger oder weltanschaulicher Führer), which, especially for politicians, could not be seen as a negative quality and only suggested that others felt inspired by this person. 15. On 18 April 2012, following a prior complaint lodged by K.S., the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) quashed the Regional Criminal Court’s decision of 21 March 2012 and ordered it to initiate proceedings under the Media Act against the applicant company. It held that, taking into account the contents of the whole article, the statement suggested that K.S. had been the “spin doctor” (Ideengeber) of the spying operation. Based on this interpretation, the article would qualify as defamatory and originate a claim under the Media Act. It was thus required to examine the factual basis of the article. 16. In the subsequent proceedings before the Regional Criminal Court the applicant company explicitly declared that it would not provide evidence as to the truth (Wahrheitsbeweis) of K.S. having acted as a spin doctor or the like. It maintained its position that the statement was a value judgment. 17. On 15 May 2012 the Vienna Regional Criminal Court ordered the applicant company, under Section 6 of the Media Act, to pay 3,000 euros (EUR) (EUR 1,500 for each publication of the article) in compensation to K.S. on account of defamation, and to publish the judgment. Assuming that the statement was to be understood in the way set out in the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 18 April 2012, and noting that the applicant company had not provided evidence as to the truth of the allegation, it found that the article and statement qualified as defamation within the meaning of Article 111 § 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch). 18. On 26 September 2012 the Vienna Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant company’s appeal against this decision. It held that describing someone as the spiritus rector of a negatively connoted spying operation had left no doubt for the readers addressed that the suggestion had been that this person had been the initiator and spin doctor of this operation. The statement implied a “specific and sufficiently concrete” (spezifisch und hinreichend konkretisiert) accusation of conduct and thus qualified as a statement of fact, as to the truth of which the applicant company had failed to provide evidence. As regards the applicant company’s complaint about the amount of compensation granted, the Court of Appeal held that it did not even amount to 10% of the maximum compensation permitted by law, and was not excessive in relation to the circulation of the newspaper and the online news portal. 19. That decision was served on the applicant company’s counsel on 24 October 2012. 20. The applicant company subsequently lodged an application for renewal of the criminal proceedings (Erneuerung des Strafverfahrens) under Article 363a of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozeßordnung) with the Supreme Court (Oberster Gerichtshof), complaining under Article 10 of the Convention of a violation of its right to freedom of expression. 21. On 26 June 2013 the Supreme Court rejected the application. It stated that the Court of Appeal’s considerations as to the qualification of the statement as a statement of fact did not raise concerns, and held that such statements of fact, which had not been proven to be true and were thus defamatory, were not protected by Article 10. It concluded that the interference with the applicant company’s right to freedom of expression had been prescribed by law, had pursued the legitimate aim of protecting the reputation of others and had been necessary in the circumstances of the case, in particular taking into account the low amount of compensation granted. 22. On 10 January 2012 K.S. also lodged an injunction suit under Article 1330 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) against the applicant company, requesting that the latter be ordered to refrain from alleging or disseminating that K.S. had been or was supposed to have been the spiritus rector of a spying operation on a confidential employees’ meeting for doctors of Klagenfurt Regional Hospital. 23. On 5 March 2012 the applicant company requested that the proceedings be suspended until the termination of the proceedings under the Media Act (see paragraphs 12 et seq. above), arguing that the assessment of the factual elements in those proceedings, which would presumably lead to a rejection of K.S.’s application, would have a binding effect on the civil proceedings. 24. On 19 March 2012, during a hearing, the Vienna Commercial Court (Handelsgericht) suspended the proceedings until the termination of the proceedings under the Media Act, holding that they should only be continued at one party’s request. 25. At K.S.’s request of 1 October 2012, the Commercial Court resumed the proceedings on an unspecified date. 26. On 19 November 2012 the Commercial Court granted the injunction, finding that the criminal conviction in the proceedings under the Media Act had binding effect on the injunction proceedings. 27. On 29 June 2013 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant company’s appeal against that decision. It confirmed that, in line with the Supreme Court’s case-law, the conviction in the proceedings under the Media Act was binding, both in relation to the established elements of facts and the legal assessment. In particular, a final conviction under section 6 of the Media Act establishing that a particular media content fulfilled the objective elements of defamation would determine – in a way that was binding and not revisable in the civil proceedings – that the audience understood the media content as defamatory. Referring to the Supreme Court’s case-law on the issue, the Court of Appeal did not grant leave to lodge an ordinary appeal on points of law (ordentliche Revision) with the Supreme Court. 28. The applicant company did not lodge an extraordinary appeal on points of law (außerordentliche Revision) with the Supreme Court.",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0

POLAND,4,No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention),George Nicolaou;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku,"5. The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Puck. 6. On 19 September 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking and of membership in an organised criminal group. The investigation against him and several other persons was conducted by the Puck District Prosecutor (Prokurator Rejonowy). 7. On 21 September 2007 the Wejherowo District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might induce witnesses to give false testimony. It also stressed the severity of the anticipated sentence and the complex nature of the case. 8. The applicant’s pretrial detention was later extended by the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 6 December 2007 and on 11 March and 10 June 2008. On 10 September 2008 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) further extended the applicant’s detention. The courts repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention. They also emphasised the need to secure the process of obtaining evidence as the case concerned activities of an organised criminal group. 9. On an unspecified date in 2008 the investigation was taken over by the State Prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy). 10. On 5 December 2008 a bill of indictment against the applicant and seventeen other persons was lodged with the Gdańsk Regional Court. The applicant was charged with numerous counts of drug trafficking and with membership in an organised criminal group. The bill of indictment stated that six accused had pleaded guilty and they agreed to the sentences indicated by the prosecution authorities under Article 335 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (wniosek o skazanie). It was accompanied by 20 volumes of the case file. The prosecutor requested the court to hear 48 witnesses. 11. During the court proceedings the applicant’s detention pending trial was further extended by decisions of the Gdańsk Regional Court delivered on 11 December 2008 and 12 March and 9 June 2009; and by the Gdańsk Court of Appeal’s decisions of 26 August and 25 November 2009, 23 February, 19 May, 25 August and 19 October 2010, 12 January and 23 March 2011. The applicant’s appeals against decisions prolonging his detention and all his subsequent applications for release were unsuccessful. The courts continually justified their decisions by the existence of a reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences. They also referred to the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on the applicant after conviction. They further relied on the need to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, emphasising that the accused and subsequently the key witnesses in the case had to testify before the trial court. They considered that the risk that the applicant might tamper with evidence or otherwise obstruct the proceedings resulted, in particular, from the fact that he had been charged with membership in an organised criminal group. Finally, they found that the trial court conducted the proceedings in a correct and timely manner. They noted in this regard the complex character of the case and the voluminous documentation gathered (on 23 March 2011 the case file comprised 36 volumes). They also referred to multiple procedural motions of the accused and their lawyers. 12. Between 17 March 2010 and 17 March 2011 the applicant served a prison sentence imposed in another set of criminal proceedings against him. On 17 March 2011 he started serving another prison sentence. 13. Meanwhile, on 19 February 2009 the trial court decided to examine the charges against six coaccused in separate proceedings. 14. On 15 April 2009 the court scheduled the first hearing for 13 May 2009. It also scheduled five further hearings. 15. The hearings scheduled for 13 and 28 May 2009 were adjourned due to the absence of one of the accused. 16. The trial was eventually started on 9 July 2009. Subsequently, the trial court held ten further hearings by the end of 2009. 17. In 2010 the court held sixteen hearings altogether. Four of the scheduled hearings were adjourned due to absences or sickleaves of the accused or their lawyers. 18. In 2011 eight hearings were held by 20 May 2011. On that date the Gdańsk Regional Court lifted the applicant’s detention on remand. 19. The proceedings are still pending before the firstinstance court.",[],[],[],['5'],['5-3'],[],0
104,001-150785,ENG,RUS,CHAMBER,2015,CASE OF SERGEY ZUBAREV v. RUSSIA,3,Preliminary objection joined to merits and dismissed (Article 35-1 - Exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court),Dmitry Dedov;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Tula. 6. The applicant is a lawyer. In 2003-05 the applicant, together with the lawyer Ms V., represented Ms D. in civil proceedings before the Proletarskiy District Court of Tula. 7. On 13 April 2005 Judge S. of the District Court sent a complaint to the President of the Tula Bar Association. She alleged that the absence of the applicant and Ms V. without good cause had led to delays in the proceedings. She asked the President to institute disciplinary proceedings against the lawyers and to inform them of the next hearing in Ms D.’s case. In particular, she stated as follows: “I draw your attention to the conduct of the lawyers Mr Zubarev and Ms V., which is not compatible with the Lawyers’ Code of Ethics. It has encroached on the rights of the person they were representing before the court ... and has led to unjustifiable delays in the examination of the merits of the case. At the same time [they] have systematically written complaints in Ms D.’s name to various authorities and newspapers, attempting in that way to shift the responsibility for their own incompetence and lack of professionalism onto the judicial system, and thereby expressing contempt for the court.” 8. The parties did not inform the Court whether there was any follow-up to Judge S.’s complaint on the part of the Bar Association. 9. Being of the opinion that the above-cited paragraph of Judge S.’s complaint tarnished their professional reputation, the applicant and Ms V. brought a defamation action against her in accordance with Article 152 of the Civil Code. They also sought a compensation award in respect of nonpecuniary damage. 10. On 3 May 2005 the District Court refused to accept the applicant’s claims for consideration. The court noted that current laws did not define the grounds or procedure for adjudicating that type of claim. In particular, the court noted as follows: “According to Article 16 of the Law of the Russian Federation on the Status of the Judiciary of the Russian Federation, a judge cannot be held liable for an expression of opinion in the course of the administration of justice or for the judgment handed down [by him or her] unless he or she has been found guilty in criminal proceedings concerning the abuse of power or the adoption of an unlawful verdict, judgment or other judicial act. Pursuant to Article 1070 § 2 of the [Civil Code] of the Russian Federation, ... [d]amage caused within the framework of the administration of justice shall be compensated, provided that the guilt of the judge has been established in a final criminal conviction. The claims lodged by [the applicant] and Ms V. cannot be considered in civil proceedings given that the issue of a judge’s liability for actions taken in the course of the administration of justice must be adjudicated purely in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law. [However], current legislation does not lay down the grounds or the procedure for compensation by the State for damage caused by a judge’s unlawful actions (inaction) (including the rules governing the jurisdiction of this type of case).” 11. Further to an appeal by the applicant, on 16 June 2005 the Tula Regional Court upheld that decision. The court noted, in particular: “Pursuant to Article 134 § 1 (1) of the [Code of Civil Procedure] of the Russian Federation, the judge must dismiss a claim [without consideration on the merits] if it cannot be adjudicated in civil proceedings but should instead be considered and adjudicated by way of another judicial process. Referring to Article 16 of the Law of the Russian Federation on the Status of the Judiciary of the Russian Federation, the [first-instance] court established that the claims lodged by Ms V. and [the applicant] concerned the judge’s liability and the compensation for damage caused by the judge’s actions (failure to act). [It] correctly indicated in its decision that the judge should be immune from liability for the actions taken in the course of the administration of justice unless she or he had been found guilty of criminal abuse of power in a final criminal conviction. Being mindful of the fact that the issue of the judge’s liability for actions taken in the course of the administration of justice can be examined only in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law, the court has rightly dismissed the claims lodged by [the applicant] and Ms V. [without consideration on the merits], noting correctly that current legislation had not yet laid down the grounds or the procedure for compensation by the State for damage caused by a judge’s unlawful actions (inaction) (including the rules governing the jurisdiction of this type of case).”",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

CROATIA,4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Positive obligations) (Substantive aspect),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Julia Laffranque;Paul Lemmens;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1955. 6. On 26 February 2014 the applicant began to serve a three-year prison sentence. He was placed in Zagreb Prison Hospital (“ZPH”). 7. On 28 February 2014 the applicant applied to a Zagreb County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences and the head office of the Prisons Administration requesting the suspension of his prison sentence on account of his state of health. He claimed that from 5 to 12 February 2014 he had been hospitalised in Dubrava Hospital in Zagreb because he had suffered a stroke. He also had two brain arteriovenous malformations, one of which had been removed in February 2013 by means of gamma knife radiosurgery, and the three-year high-risk recovery period had not yet ended. He referred to his medical documents, which had established basal ganglia in the ventricular system with a risk of haemorrhage, increased by the stress of the prison conditions. He also claimed that in combination with the epileptic fits from which he suffered, his health issues could be life-threatening. 8. A medical report drawn up by ZPH on 6 March 2014 confirmed the claims put forward by the applicant in his request and concluded: “[The prisoner] presents a permanent high risk to himself and the institution in which he is placed. The expert opinion is that two or three years are needed for his brain condition to stabilise after the gamma knife surgery. We consider his request for a stay of his prison term medically justified.” 9. On 18 April 2014 a Zagreb County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant’s request. This decision was based entirely on an opinion given by Dr B., an expert in internal medicine and cardiology. Dr B. concluded that the applicant was not suffering from any acute illness and that during his time in ZPH his chronic illness had not worsened. Dr B. also stated that in the event of a sudden deterioration in the applicant’s state of health, he could easily be transferred to an appropriate medical institution. Lastly, he asserted that the applicant’s current medical problems could be appropriately treated at ZPH. 10. On 25 April 2014 the applicant lodged an appeal, in which he argued that since incarceration his medical condition had been deteriorating constantly, that the ZPH doctors had themselves recommended that his prison sentence be suspended on medical grounds, and that Dr B. could not give a proper opinion on his health since he was not an expert in neurology. 11. On 8 July 2014 a three-judge panel of Zagreb County Court quashed the first-instance decision and instructed the first-instance court to order an expert opinion from a neurologist. 12. On 21 August 2014 the same Zagreb County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant’s request. The decision was based mainly on the opinion given by Dr M., an expert in neurology. She concluded that the applicant had not been suffering from any acute illness, that his chronic illness had improved, that he had been receiving good medical care at ZPH, and that it had appropriate staff to meet the needs of the applicant as regards the medical care his condition required. 13. On 27 August and 4 September 2014 the applicant lodged appeals, in which he contested the qualifications of Dr M. and the validity of her opinion. He argued that she had not answered the question whether ZPH had adequate staff and could otherwise properly treat his medical condition. He further argued that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences had not addressed the contradictions between the findings the ZPH doctors had expressed in their opinion of 6 March 2014 and the reports of the medical experts commissioned by Zagreb County Court. He also asserted that his medical condition could only be properly treated in a specialist medical institution. 14. Following a suggestion by ZPH that there was no need for the applicant’s further hospitalisation, on 29 September 2014 the head office of the Prisons Administration ordered his transfer to Zagreb Prison. On 2 October 2014 he lodged an appeal, arguing that neither the staff nor equipment at ZPH was satisfactorily suited to carry out proper diagnostic examinations to accurately assess his medical condition. He asked for an urgent transfer to a suitable medical institution where a proper diagnostic examination could be carried out. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed on 14 October 2014 by the Prisons Administration. 15. On 31 October 2014 a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 21 August 2014, endorsing its reasoning. 16. On 19 November 2014, at his request, the applicant was taken to the Sisters of Mercy Hospital in Zagreb so that neurological tests could be carried out. During his transfer in a police van he suffered an epileptic fit and lost consciousness. This was discovered only on arrival at the front entrance of the hospital when officers opened the back door of the van and found him lying on the floor. He spent ten hours at the hospital and was then returned to Zagreb Prison. 17. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the decisions concerning his request for the suspension of his prison sentence and the decision concerning his transfer to Zagreb Prison. In addition to the complaints put forward in his previous requests and appeals, the applicant also complained that during his eight months at ZPH he had not had proper access to sanitary facilities and had been obliged to ask the guards to let him out of the room each time he needed the toilet, a request which they sometimes had not answered in time. Since there had been no lift at ZPH, in order to have access to fresh air he had had to climb the stairs to his cell on the second floor, which had been a risk to his health. He further reiterated that ZPH had no neurology department or even a neurologist, so his condition could not have been properly treated there. Even though specialists from the two civil hospitals where he had been treated prior to his imprisonment had recommended that check-ups be carried out every month, he had not been given them. 18. The applicant also complained about the conditions in Zagreb Prison. He claimed that he had been placed in a cell with seven other inmates, and that a lack of fresh air in the cell had worsened his condition. There had been a squat toilet in the cell, which had not been completely private and a foul smell had emanated from it. Inmates had had to eat in their cells. There had been no lift, which had prevented him from accessing fresh air. 19. On 31 December 2014 the applicant lodged another application for the suspension of his prison sentence on health grounds, reiterating his previous arguments. He also complained that since 19 October 2014 he had not had any access to daylight and that any access to fresh air had been prevented by construction of a lift in ZPH. 20. On 5, 9, 15 and 17 January 2015 the applicant was taken to Rebro Hospital in Zagreb. A report drawn up there on 15 January indicates that there was no need for any urgent measures. It was also established that the applicant had had a high concentration of tramadol (a painkiller) and its metabolites, benzodiazepine (a class of psychoactive drug) and olanzapine (an atypical antipsychotic drug). 21. The applicant’s constitutional complaint was declared inadmissible by the Constitutional Court on 27 January 2015 on the grounds that the contested judgment had not concerned the merits of his civil rights or obligations or a criminal charge against him, and as such was not amenable to constitutional review. 22. On 18 March 2015 a Zagreb County Court judge responsible for the execution of sentences dismissed the applicant’s request of 31 December 2014. The judge relied on previous expert opinions as well as on a further opinion of Dr S., an expert in neuropsychiatry who confirmed that the applicant had not been suffering from any acute illness, that his medical condition had not worsened, and that ZPH had the appropriate capacity for his treatment in all respects. The County Court further relied on ZPH reports dated 20 and 28 January 2015 stating that the applicant had not been following doctors’ orders, had not been taking measures aimed at his treatment and had been deliberately putting his health at risk. There was no comment on the applicant’s complaints concerning lack of access to daylight and fresh air. 23. On 27 March 2015 the applicant lodged an appeal, reiterating his arguments concerning his health but made no mention of his previous complaints about lack of access to daylight and fresh air. This appeal was dismissed by a three-judge panel of the Zagreb County Court on 21 April 2015.",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0

In July 2011, referring to the above decision of the Constitutional Court, the applicant lodged a civil claim with the Pecherskyy District Court of Kyiv against the State Treasury, complaining that as from 1 January 2008 the amount of his Chornobyl pension was too low contrary to the Constitution and seeking damages caused by a legislative act which had decreased his pension and later had been recognized unconstitutional. He invoked Articles 1173 and 1175 of the Civil Code in this respect. By judgment of 18 July 2011, the District Court rejected the applicant’s claim on the ground that the conditions and mechanisms for implementation of the provisions of Articles 1173 and 1175 of the Civil Code had not been established by the legislation. Furthermore, the court noted that the applicant did not prove any damage caused to him, given that he alleged damages to have been sustained as from 1 January 2008, whilst the provisions found unconstitutional lost their legal force on 22 May 2008. On 21 September 2011 and 18 October 2011 respectively the Kyiv City Court of Appeal and the Higher Specialised Court for Civil and Criminal Matters upheld the decision of the first-instance court confirming: that the applicant failed to meet the conditions laid down by Articles 1173 and 1175; and that compensation for material damage as guaranteed by Articles 1173 and 1175 would only have been possible if a special law establishing the conditions and procedure for such compensation had been enacted. The court of appeal noted in particular that, in the circumstances referred to by the claimant, the possibility of obtaining compensation in respect of pecuniary damage is linked to the existence of legislation establishing the specific conditions and the relevant procedure. It concluded that, as such legislation did not exist, the first-instance court had rightly decided that the applicant’s claims were unfounded. The Civil Code, which came into force in 2004, lays down different obligations as to compensation in respect of damage. Among others, two articles, namely Articles 1173 and 1175, relied on by the applicant in the domestic proceedings, provide for the State to compensate the victims of unlawful decisions of State authorities. The articles in question provide as follows: “1. Pecuniary damage caused to a natural person or legal entity by unlawful decisions, actions or omissions of State authorities, authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or local self-governance authorities in the course of the exercise of their powers shall be compensated for by the State, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or local self-governance regardless of the fault of these bodies.” “1. Pecuniary damage caused to a natural person or legal entities as a result of adoption by State authorities, authorities of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or a local self-governance authority of a normative-legal act that was declared illegal and annulled, shall be compensated for by the State, the Autonomous Republic of Crimea or the local self-governance authority regardless of the fault of officers and employees of these bodies.” “5. Provisions of the Law on 2008 State Budget and Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts, found unconstitutional, lose their legal force from the date when this decision has been adopted by the Constitutional Court of Ukraine.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

GERMANY,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 14+P1-3 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 - Right to free elections-{general};Stand for election),André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Mārtiņš Mits;Síofra O’Leary,"5. The applicant party was founded in 2007 and is based in Aurich. It claims to represent the interests of the Frisian minority in Germany but limits its political activities to the Land of Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen) where the East Frisians traditionally settle. The applicant party estimates the number of people of Frisian origin within the territory of Lower Saxony at about 100,000 out of the total population of approximately 7,900,000. The Frisians have their own language and cultural identity which is similar among the West Frisians in the Netherlands and the North Frisians in the Land of Schleswig-Holstein, while the East Frisians in Lower Saxony have mainly stopped speaking their language. 6. Under the Electoral Law of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsisches Landeswahlgesetz, see relevant domestic law, paragraph 16 below), parliamentary seats – apart from those seats attributed to the candidates obtaining the majority of the votes in their constituency – are allocated under the D’Hondt system of proportional representation. Under section 33 § 3 of the Electoral Law, seats are attributed only to parties which obtain a minimum threshold of 5% of the total of votes validly cast. This threshold is also included in Article 8 § 3 of the Lower Saxonian Constitution (see relevant domestic law, paragraph 15 below). 7. By letter of 27 September 2007 to the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony and by letter of 17 December 2007 to the President of the Lower Saxony Parliament, the applicant party asked to be granted an exemption from the minimum threshold for the upcoming elections. The request was refused. 8. In the elections of 27 January 2008, the applicant party attained an overall total of 10,069 votes, amounting to approximately 0.3% of all votes validly cast. Irrespective of the minimum threshold, the number of votes received would not have been sufficient to obtain a parliamentary mandate. 9. On 6 March 2008 the applicant party lodged an objection against the validity of the election result. The applicant party submitted, in particular, that it represented the interests of the Frisian people residing in Lower Saxony. The Frisian people formed a national minority within the meaning of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (“the Framework Convention”, ETS No. 157, see Council of Europe documents, paragraphs 20-23 below). The applicant party complained, in particular, that the minimum threshold resulted in their factual exclusion from participating in the parliamentary elections and amounted to discriminatory treatment visàvis other small political parties which were, at least theoretically, capable of reaching that threshold. The applicant party further relied on Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. 10. On 9 May 2008, the Election Supervisor of Lower Saxony (Landeswahlleiter), jointly with the Ministry of the Interior, submitted written comments on the objection. They considered, firstly, that it was doubtful whether the group of Frisians qualified as a national minority. Under the declaration submitted by the German Government when signing the Framework Convention, only the Danes of German citizenship and members of the Sorbian people with German citizenship were recognised as national minorities in the Federal Republic of Germany. Conversely, the declaration merely stated that the Framework Convention also applied to the ethnic group of Frisians with German citizenship. It was thus clear from the wording of the declaration that the Frisians did not qualify as a national minority. Even assuming that the ethnic group of Frisians had the status of a national minority, this did not necessarily entail the obligation to exempt the applicant party from obtaining the minimum threshold of 5% of the votes. There was no such obligation under the Basic Law or under the constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony or under the Framework Convention. Neither could such an obligation be derived from section 6 § 6 of the Federal Electoral Law (Bundeswahlgesetz), as the Länder were competent to pass their own electoral laws without being bound by the Federal Law. The privileges enjoyed by the Danish Minority Party in the Land of Schleswig-Holstein did not allow any further conclusions, as the protection and promotion of the Danish minority was prescribed by the constitution of the respective Land. Finally, and again assuming the minority status of the ethnic group of Frisians, it was questionable whether the applicant party would qualify as the party of the Frisian national minority. The assessment of this question did not only depend on the party’s vision of itself, but on an overall assessment of all factual and legal circumstances. 11. On 2 February 2009 the Parliamentary Committee on the Scrutiny of Elections (Wahlprüfungsausschuss) held a public hearing on the applicant party’s objection. 12. On 19 February 2009 the Lower Saxony Parliament rejected the applicant party’s objection as being unfounded. Relying on the submissions made by the Election Supervisor jointly with the Ministry of the Interior, the Parliament considered that an obligation to exempt the applicant party from the minimum threshold could neither be derived from the Constitution of Lower Saxony, nor from Federal or International Law. It followed that the applicant’s objection was unfounded. 13. On 6 April 2009 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court of Lower Saxony (Niedersächsischer Staatsgerichtshof). The applicant party requested the Constitutional Court to quash the parliamentary decision of 19 February 2009 and to declare the result of the elections held on 27 January 2008 invalid; or, alternatively, to declare section 33 § 3 of the Electoral Law unconstitutional. 14. On 30 April 2010 the Constitutional Court of Lower Saxony rejected the applicant party’s complaint as being unfounded. The Constitutional Court observed, at the outset, that the relevant provisions did not allow for an exemption from the minimum threshold for national minorities. The Constitutional Court further considered that the minimum threshold interfered with the principle of equality of the vote. This interference was justified because it pursued the legitimate aim of safeguarding the functioning of the elected parliament. Parliamentary work within a democracy necessitated that the parliaments remain able to take decisions and that they were not inhibited in their work by the participation of splinter parties. The Constitutional Court further referred to the case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court regarding the 5% minimum threshold. There was no obligation under the Basic Law to exempt parties of national minorities from the 5% threshold. It was true that certain electoral laws provided for such exemptions. This was, in particular, the case with the Federal Electoral Law, which provided an exemption for parties of national minorities, and with the Electoral Laws of the Länder of Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein, providing for exemptions for the parties of the Sorbian and the Danish minorities, respectively. However, both Länder provided special rights for national minorities in their respective constitutions. No such provisions could be found in the Constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony. The Federal Constitutional Court had declared the respective provision in the Federal Electoral Law constitutional, even though the Basic Law did not contain special rights for national minorities. However, the Federal Constitutional Court had also emphasised that the legislator enjoyed a margin of appreciation in this respect. The Lower Saxony Constitutional Court finally considered that the alleged right could be derived neither from the European Convention on Human Rights nor from the Framework Convention. The European Convention on Human Rights did not contain any special rights for national minorities. Relying on the wording of Article 15 of the Framework Convention, the court considered that this provision did not contain any obligation to exempt national minorities from the minimum threshold, but left the question undecided as to how to create the conditions necessary for the effective participation of persons belonging to national minorities in public affairs. It followed that the contracting parties enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this respect. In Germany, participation of national minorities in public life was already guaranteed by the constitutional system. By including the 5% threshold in the Constitution of the Land of Lower Saxony without providing for an exemption, the Constitutional Assembly had given precedence to the functioning of the parliament over granting privileges to national minorities. Accordingly, the Lower Saxony Constitutional Court did not find it necessary to determine whether the Frisians qualified as a national minority and whether the applicant party qualified as the political party of this national minority.",[],[],[],"['14', 'P1']",['P1-3'],[],0
108,001-173607,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2017,KOMŠO v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Julia Laffranque;Nebojša Vučinić;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant, Ms Dragica Komšo, is a Croatian national who was born in 1969 and lives in Benkovac. Her application was lodged on 13 May 2014. 2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š.Stažnik. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant moved with her husband and two children from Drvar in Bosnia and Herzegovina to Benkovac, Croatia. 5. On 24 March 2005 the applicant applied to the Benkovac Social Welfare Centre (Centar za socijalnu skrb Benkovac; “the welfare centre”) for welfare benefits (pravo na pomoć za uzdržavanje). She stated that she was unemployed with no income and had two children who were still minors. 6. On 29 April 2005 a social worker warned the applicant about the need to provide accurate information about her assets and the obligation to report any changes to the welfare centre. 7. On 4 May 2005 the welfare centre granted benefits to the applicant and her family on account of their poor financial situation. 8. On 8 September 2005 the welfare centre received information from an anonymous source that the applicant’s husband had a shop in Drvar. 9. On 16 September 2005 the applicant informed the welfare centre about her husband’s shop. She admitted it existed but argued that she had considered it to be irrelevant because it had been robbed in February 2005 and its earnings had been very low. The applicant was warned about the possibility of criminal and financial liability for providing false statements. 10. On 27 September 2005 the welfare centre decided to stop her benefits. It established that the applicant and her family could provide for themselves through their own work, which in their case was the revenue from their shop. The decision was served on the applicant on 28 September 2005 and she did not lodge an appeal. 11. On the same day, 28 September 2005, the applicant visited the welfare centre and gave a statement about repayment of the social welfare benefits received between 24 March 2005 and 27 September 2005. She was warned that civil proceedings for reimbursement would be instituted against her. The applicant replied that she could not repay the due amount because the earnings from the shop were very low and that she and her husband planned to close it soon. 12. On 13 March 2007 the Benkovac Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Benkovcu; “the State Attorney’s Office”), lodged a civil action against the applicant in the Benkovac Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Benkovcu), relying on the fact that the applicant had failed to disclose that her husband owned a shop in Drvar when she had been granted welfare benefits. The State Attorney’s Office sought repayment of the 8,612 Croatian kunas (HRK) (about 1,170 euros (EUR)) she had received, together with statutory default interest. 13. The applicant argued during the proceedings that the shop had in fact not been in operation since the robbery on 24 January 2005 but that her husband had not been able to close it because of unsettled tax liabilities. She stated that they had not had the means to support themselves and their children. 14. At a hearing on 2 February 2010 the applicant’s lawyer asked for financial information on the husband’s shop to be obtained from the Drvar Tax Authority in order to assess whether the applicant had satisfied the statutory requirements for welfare benefits. The applicant’s lawyer did not provide any reasons why he or the applicant had not been able to obtain the document from the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, nor did he claim that. The first-instance court dismissed the proposal, considering it to be aimed at delaying the proceedings because the data would have had to be requested from Bosnia and Herzegovina via the diplomatic service. The first-instance court pointed out that the applicant had had more than enough time since the institution of the proceedings to obtain the data in question if she deemed it relevant. At the same hearing the court also heard evidence, at the request of the applicant, from the director of the welfare centre, M.B. 15. On 15 February 2010 the Benkovac Municipal Court dismissed the State Attorney’s claim because the applicant had not been given an opportunity to repay the money within a specified time-limit. 16. On 28 April 2011, upon an appeal by the State Attorney’s Office, the Zadar County Court (Županijski sud u Zadru) quashed the first-instance decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. 17. The court held two hearings in the new proceedings. At a hearing on 25 August 2011 the applicant’s lawyer submitted a certificate from the regional tax office in Drvar dated 4 September 2008 on the applicant’s husband’s unpaid tax liabilities. The State Attorney’s Office argued that the document was irrelevant because a certificate on unpaid tax liabilities could not be proof of earnings. 18. At a hearing held on 8 September 2011 the first-instance court heard evidence from the applicant’s husband at the request of the applicant. He stated that his wife had not disclosed information about their shop because she had been afraid it would prevent them from receiving welfare benefits. At the same hearing the first-instance court dismissed an application from the applicant to be heard in person because it held that she had submitted all her observations in her reply to the claim and that her request to give evidence was aimed at delaying the proceedings. The applicant’s lawyer had no further evidence and the first-instance court concluded the hearing. 19. On 19 September 2011 the Benkovac Municipal Court granted the claim and ordered the applicant to reimburse to the State HRK 8,612, together with statutory default interest, and to pay HRK 5,875 in costs and expenses for the proceedings. It held that while the applicant’s statements about her husband’s shop might in fact have been true, the fact remained that she had not disclosed that information voluntarily and had therefore fraudulently, and undoubtedly unlawfully, obtained social welfare benefits which the court could not make lawful. 20. On 17 October 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Zadar County Court, reiterating her previous arguments. She stated that her husband had owned the shop at issue, not her, and that she had only been employed in her husband’s business, which had been ruined by the robbery. 21. On 19 June 2013 the Zadar County Court, relying on section 196 of the Social Welfare Act, dismissed the applicant’s appeal on the grounds that she had not disclosed the fact that her husband had owned a shop, and that her arguments concerning the actual state of the business and her poor financial situation were of no relevance. 22. The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), alleging that her right to a fair hearing had been violated because the first-instance court had disregarded her request to obtain the data on her husband’s shop from the Drvar Tax Authority, thus failing to correctly establish all the circumstances of her case. She also alleged that she had been discriminated against. 23. On 17 December 2013 the Constitutional Court declared her complaint inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded. 24. The relevant part of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parničnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 112/1999, 81/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 84/2008, 96/2008, 23/2008, 57/2011, 148/2011 consolidated text), as in force at the material time, provided as follows: “Each party is obliged to provide facts and present evidence on which his or her claim is based or to refute the statements and evidence of his or her opponent. ...” “Parties referring to a document as proof of a statement are obliged to submit that document themselves. ... If the document is in the possession of a state authority or a legal or physical person vested with public authority, and the party is not able to arrange for the document to be handed over or shown, the court shall itself obtain the document upon a motion by the party.” 25.

The applicant, Mr Tahir Canan, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1953 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Bandırma. He is represented before the Court by Ms Y. İmrek, a lawyer practising in Istanbul. 2. 3. The applicant was serving a prison sentence at the Adana F-Type High Security Closed Penitentiary Institution for the offences of “homicide and purchase or possession of unlicensed firearms and bullets”. 4. On 12 August 2009, the applicant was transferred from Adana Prison, where he had been held until that date, to Bandırma M-Type Closed Penitentiary Institution, approximately 1,000 km away from the former. It was planned that the bus carrying a total of twelve detainees and convicts who were being transferred from Adana province to various other provinces would stop off at the Ankara Sincan Closed Penitentiary Institution. 5. Roughly halfway through the trip, the bus carrying the prisoners stopped off at the Gendarmerie Command in Ankara to break the journey and the applicant asked to be taken to the toilet. 6. The detainees and the convicts started to go to the toilets in groups of three after the necessary security measures were taken under the supervision of the deputy patrol commander. The applicant asked the gendarmerie officers who were ensuring security to remove his handcuffs which were positioned in front of his body (see paragraph 29 below), while he was relieving himself. However, the gendarmerie lieutenant Ü.G., in charge of the group, refused that request. 7. On 17 August 2009 the applicant filed a complaint with the Bandırma public prosecutor’s office, submitting that he had been subjected to degrading treatment by Ü.G. because he had had to use the toilet wearing handcuffs, despite his repeated requests to have them unlocked. He claimed that such treatment could not have been justified by security concerns, as he had been using the Gendarmerie Command’s toilet facilities, which had been guarded by gendarmerie officers. 8. On 5 February 2010 the Bandırma public prosecutor took a statement from the applicant. Repeating his initial submissions, the applicant maintained that the other inmates on the bus had witnessed the degrading treatment, as they had also been required to use the toilets under the same conditions. 9. On 6 September 2010 a colonel from the Adana Gendarmerie Command informed the applicant that lieutenant Ü.G. had made a statement before the Adana public prosecutor and that no other disciplinary or administrative measure had been taken against him, as he had acted in compliance with the relevant orders. 10. Subsequently, on 27 October 2010 the Adana Gendarmerie Command sent a second letter to the applicant, indicating that security measures during the transfer of prisoners were taken having regard to the security requirements at a given time. The letter added that the lieutenant in charge of the transferred group was the sole person authorised to determine whether the situation required the application of a security measure, namely the use of handcuffs in the applicant’s case. 11. On 8 December 2010, after having examined the case file and an investigation report from the Gendarmerie Command, the Governor of Adana decided not to permit the instigation of a criminal investigation against Ü.G., pursuant to Law no. 4483 (Law on the Prosecution of Civil Servants and Public Officials). The Governor referred to section 456 of the Directive on the Transfer of Prisoners (Ceza İnfaz Kurumu ve Tututkevlerinin Dış Koruması ile Sevk ve Nakil Hizmetleri Yönergesi), which stated that the gendarmerie had the authority to handcuff prisoners in order to prevent their escape. He further relied on section 27 of the Gendarmerie Guidelines (Jandarma Talimnamesi), which stated that prisoners would be allowed to go to the toilet if in the company of gendarmerie officers and that their handcuffs must not be removed during that time. The Governor found accordingly that lieutenant Ü.G. had acted in compliance with the relevant legislation in not permitting the applicant to go to the toilet without handcuffs. 12. Following the Governor’s decision, on 4 April 2011 the Ankara public prosecutor decided to discontinue the case. 13. The applicant objected to the public prosecutor’s decision. On 30 September 2011 the Sincan Assize Court rejected that objection. 14. Regulations in the domestic law authorising the use of handcuffs and devices restraining bodily movements during the transfer of detainees are as follows. 15. Article 50 of Law no. 5275 on the Execution of Penalties and Security Measures, which is entitled “Use of Constraining Devices”, provides as follows: “Handcuffs and other body restraints can be used with a view to preventing escape during referral or transfer, on the condition that they are removed when the convict is brought before the competent authority.” 16. Article 155 of the Regulation (2006/10218) on the Administration of Penitentiary Institutions and the Execution of Penalties and Security Measures, which is entitled “Use of Constraining Devices”, provides as follows: “All the necessary measures that would not cause any harm to health shall be taken to prevent escape during referral or transfer, on the condition that they are removed when the convict, except for child convicts, is brought before the competent authority.” 17. The relevant part of Article 76 of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie, which is entitled “Measures to Be Taken During Referral and Transfer”, provides that “All the necessary measures that would not cause any harm to health shall be taken to prevent escape of the detainees and the convicts during referral and transfer...”. 18. The relevant provisions under the heading of “General Rules to be respected by the Referring Penitentiary Institution Unit, City Centre or District Gendarmerie Commands During Referral and Transfer” of paragraph 4/B of the Directive on the Transfer of Prisoners read as follows: “All the necessary measures that would not cause any harm to health, such as using handcuffs, linking arms with those who are transferred and encircling them with a sufficient number of personnel, shall be taken to prevent escape of detainees and convicts during referral and transfer. The security needs shall be the only decisive factor in designation of the level of the security measures to be taken. The commander in charge of the transfer shall be the sole person authorised to make a decision for the use of handcuffs by assessing the security need.” “The patrol commander shall have the keys to the handcuffs of detainees and convicts. The handcuffs shall not be unlocked on any account, except for cases such as deaths, injuries, heart attacks and serious diseases. In cases where the handcuffs are unlocked, the security measures shall be improved and more attention shall be paid. During the transfer, the convict will be provided with food and her/his biological needs shall be met.” 19. The relevant provisions under the heading of “Use of Handcuffs” of the Regulation on the Duties and Powers of the Gendarmerie: Directive no. 27-3 on Patrols, pages 8-5, insofar as relevant, read: “Handcuffs shall be used with a view to preventing escape of the detainees and the convicts during referral or transfer, or outside the penitentiary institutions, and to prevent them from posing a danger to the lives and physical integrity of themselves or others”. 20. The relevant provisions of the Gendarmerie Guidelines provide as follows. Paragraph (b) of the Article entitled “Measures to be taken during referrals and transfers”: “The prisoners and their belongings shall be searched thoroughly before they get on the bus; they are dispossessed of all instruments that could be used for attacking or escaping. The patrol commander shall have the keys to the handcuffs of the prisoners. The handcuffs shall not be unlocked under any circumstances except for the mandatory conditions.” 21. In the same Gendarmerie Guidelines, the Article entitled “Code of conduct to be followed for contingencies during the transfer” reads: “All the necessary measures that would not cause any harm to health shall be taken to prevent escape of the detainees and the convicts during referral or transfer.” “The prisoners shall be searched before going on a journey. They shall be allowed to use the toilets and their similar needs shall be taken care of. When they go into the toilet, the door shall be kept open and the handcuffs shall remain locked.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
110,001-147319,ENG,SVN,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,JAKOB'S CENTER D.O.O. v. SLOVENIA,4,Inadmissible,André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena Jäderblom;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"1. The applicant, JAKOB’S CENTER d.o.o., is a private company with a registered office in Zgornji Brnik. It was represented before the Court by Mr I. Trebec, a lawyer practising in Sežana. 2. The Slovenian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs T. Mihelič Žitko, State Attorney. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. At the time of the events at issue, the applicant company was acting as a forwarding agent and customs broker for import-export transit operations. In that capacity, it was liable for the payment of customs debts if they were incurred. In 1997, the company carried out a transit procedure for the importation of goods supposedly destined for Bosnia and Herzegovina; however, in reality the goods never reached their destination, but were placed on the Slovenian market. The operation formed part of a wider fraud involving at least one customs official, P.K., and a number of other persons. Once the fraud had been detected, the customs debt incurred as a result of the fact that the goods had not left the national territory was imposed on the applicant company as the principal actor in the transit procedure. 5. On 7 April 1998, the applicant company paid 2,265,033.00 Slovenian tolars (SIT) (approximately 9,452 euros (EUR)) and on 17 November 1998 it paid SIT 1,810,855.00 (approximately EUR 7,557). Although it was not disputed by the authorities that the applicant company was the victim of fraudulent activities by third parties, it could not relieve itself of that liability. 6. The applicant company challenged its liability for the payment of the debt. The Customs Administration of the Republic of Slovenia dismissed its challenge, finding that although it was not the applicant company’s fault that the goods in question had been unlawfully removed from customs supervision, as the principal actor it was nevertheless liable for the payment of the customs debt. Moreover, the Customs Administration noted that any unlawful activity on the part of customs officials bore no relation to the applicant company’s duty to pay the debt. The Administrative Court subsequently dismissed an administrative action lodged by the applicant company. The Supreme Court dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company, upholding the position of the lower instances that, by acting as the principal company in the transit procedure, the applicant company had assumed the risk of having to pay customs debt. The Constitutional Court refused to accept the applicant company’s constitutional complaint for consideration. 7. In their submissions the Government noted that in November 2001 the applicant company had instituted commercial proceedings before the Koper District Court against the Republic of Slovenia and P.K. seeking compensation for the customs payment (SIT 4,075,888.00, approximately EUR 17,008), together with statutory default interest and costs of the proceedings. 8. The Government further explained that on 9 May 2006 the Koper District Court had found in favour of the applicant company. 9. The Republic of Slovenia and P.K. lodged an appeal. Thus, when the application was lodged before the Court on 10 April 2007, the proceedings were pending before the Koper Higher Court. 10. On 21 June 2007 the Koper Higher Court upheld the judgment of 9 May 2006, which then became final. 11. On 5 September 2007 the Republic of Slovenia lodged a motion for the protection of legality against the judgment of 21 June 2007 with the Office of the State Prosecutor General of the Republic of Slovenia, which did not accept to file a request for the protection of legality. 12. On 7 September 2007 the Republic of Slovenia enforced the judgment of 9 May 2006 and paid the applicant company EUR 36,908.40 (SIT 8,844,728.97). 13. In its application to the Court the applicant company did not mention the commercial proceedings or the judgment of 9 May 2006, which had been enforced.

The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in Cieza. He is married and the father of five children. 13. He was ordained as a priest in 1961. In 1984 he applied to the Vatican for dispensation from the obligation of celibacy. At that time he did not receive any answer. The following year he was married in a civil ceremony. He has had five children with his wife, to whom he is still married. The parties have not submitted any details concerning his status as a priest not having received a dispensation. 14. From October 1991 onwards, the applicant was employed as a teacher of Catholic religion and ethics in a State-run secondary school of the region of Murcia under a renewable one-year contract. In accordance with the provisions of a 1979 Agreement between Spain and the Holy See, “religious education shall be taught by the persons who, every school year, are appointed by the administrative authority from among those proposed by the Ordinary of the diocese” (see paragraph 50, below). In accordance with a Ministerial Order of 1982, “the appointment is to be made annually and renewed automatically, unless an opinion to the contrary is given by the Ordinary before the start of the school year, or unless the public authority, for serious academic or disciplinary reasons, considers it necessary to annul the appointment, in which case the Church authority shall be heard ...” (see paragraph 51, below). Furthermore, Article VII of the Agreement provides that “at all levels of education, the remuneration of teachers of Catholic religion who do not belong to the State teaching staff shall be decided jointly by the central administration and the Spanish Episcopal Conference, such that it will be applicable from the entry into force of the present agreement” (see paragraph 50, below). 15. In November 1996 the Murcian newspaper La Verdad printed an article about the Movement for Optional Celibacy of priests (MOCEOP), which read as follows: A representative of the diocese explained that the protest-oriented nature of the gathering might disturb the peace of the monastery. m. de la vieja – murcia Father Francisco Tomás, head of the community of the Brothers of La Luz, in Murcia, has refused to allow access to the monastery to about a hundred married priests who wished to celebrate mass and spend the day there with their wives and children. Francisco Tomás stated that the monastery was a place of private worship and that the priests had not applied for the necessary authorisation. He added that, because of the advanced age of Brother Manuel (80 years old), the only monk residing at La Luz, he did not feel it was appropriate to hold a meeting that might disturb the peace of the monastery as a result of the publicity given to the event and the protest-oriented intentions of the Movement for Optional Celibacy. Yesterday, the diocesan delegate for cultural heritage, Francisco Tomás, refused to allow the members of the Movement for Optional Celibacy (MOCEOP) to celebrate mass inside the monastery of La Luz, in El Valle. Father Tomás explained that the married priests had not sought permission to use the monastery’s church. In addition, the movement had intended to make the most of the day to hold an information meeting about the IVth International Congress of married priests held in Brasilia last July on the theme ‘Ministries of the third millennium’. Francisco Tomás also explained that only one 80-year-old monk lived in the monastery and that it was not desirable to disturb the peace of this brother with protests that would attract media attention to this place of private worship. For his part, the regional coordinator of MOCEOP, Pedro Sánchez González, stated that the requisite authorisation had certainly been applied for but the Movement had not received a reply and he did not think that such a permit would be indispensable for the celebration of mass in a hermitage. The publicity given to the event in the press had dissuaded a large number of the Movement’s members from attending the gathering in La Luz. Others, seeing the monastery’s doors closed, merely waved to their colleagues without getting out of their cars and turned round. Only about ten secularised priests stayed there with their families to explain their situation to the media and those present. Some of their children even held up a banner. They eventually went away to have lunch together, intending to celebrate mass amongst themselves. Lorenzo Vicente, Pedro Hernández Cano, Crisanto Hernández and José Antonio Fernández – a former seminary director – are among the married priests who gathered at La Luz yesterday to advocate optional celibacy and a democratic rather than a theocratic Church in which laymen would take part in electing their parish priest and their bishop. The rule of celibacy is Church-made and not divinely inspired. They also expressed their disagreement about certain economic issues: ‘Those of us who paid contributions to the clergy’s mutual insurance fund, which was subsequently incorporated into the social security system, lost all our rights when we became secularised. Moreover, nuns are in an even worse situation than priests because they donate their property to the community and lose everything’, they declared.” The article also contained a separate part, under a different heading: On issues such as abortion, birth control, divorce or sex, Pedro Hernández Cano and his friends from the MOCEOP said that they were in favour of responsible paternity. They added that abortion was ‘a personal problem which should not be prohibited by law, but [that] a social structure is needed to support women facing maternity. To castigate a woman as a sinner if she gets pregnant out of wedlock just encourages abortion’. The married priests emphasised that birth control was clearly necessary ‘and that, consequently, everyone should be free to choose the means that they find most appropriate’. ‘Sex is a gift from God and not a scourge, and even the Pope does not believe that it leads to damnation. If that were the case, he would not have put on hold the current 6,000 requests for secularisation’, they concluded.” 16. By a “rescript” of 20 August 1997, the Pope granted the request for dispensation from celibacy that the applicant had submitted thirteen years earlier, stipulating that the applicant was dispensed from celibacy and lost his clerical “state”. He forfeited the rights related to that “state”, as well as the ecclesiastical honours and functions (dignitates et officia ecclesiastica in Latin). He no longer had the obligations associated with the clerical “state”. The rescript further noted that the applicant was barred from teaching the Catholic religion in public institutions, unless the local bishop decided otherwise, for lower-level schools (in institutis autem studiorum gradus inferioris), “according to his own prudent judgment [prudenti iudicio] and provided that there [was] no scandal [remoto scandalo]”. The applicant was notified of the rescript on 15 September 1997. 17. On 29 September 1997 the Diocese of Cartagena informed the Ministry of Education in a written memorandum about the applicant’s termination of service as a teacher in the school where he was working. 18. The Ministry informed the applicant on 9 October 1997 that his employment had been terminated with effect from 29 September 1997. 19. In an official memorandum of 11 November 1997 the Diocese observed as follows: “[The applicant], a secularised priest, taught classes in Catholic religion and ethics ... by virtue of the powers conferred on bishops by the rescripts ... Those powers ... may be exercised for the teaching of subjects related to Catholic religion, provided there is no ‘risk of scandal’. When the [applicant’s] situation became a matter of public and common knowledge, it was no longer possible for the bishop of the diocese to make use of the powers conferred upon him by the rescript; accordingly, the document authorising [the applicant] to teach Catholic religion and ethics was not signed, with effect from the current academic year. [The applicant]’s personal and employment situation has also been taken into account, since [he] is entitled to receive unemployment benefit for at least a year and a half. The Diocese of Cartagena regrets this situation, while pointing out that the decision was taken also out of respect for the sensitivity of many parents who might be upset to learn of the situation of [the applicant], who was teaching Catholic religion and ethics in an education centre. Lastly, the Diocese trusts that Christian people and society in general will understand that the circumstances surrounding these facts cannot be assessed solely from an employment or professional standpoint. For the Catholic Church, the sacrament of the priesthood is of a nature that surpasses the strictly employment or professional context.” 20. The director of the secondary-education centre where the applicant had been teaching sent a note to the Bishop of Murcia in which the centre’s board of teachers expressed its support for the applicant and stated that he had given his classes during the school year 1996/97 to the full satisfaction of the teachers, the pupils and their parents, and the centre’s management. 21. Initially, the applicant lived on unemployment benefit. In 1999 he found a job in a museum, where he worked until his retirement in 2003. 22. Having been unsuccessful in his administrative complaint against the decision of the Ministry to terminate his employment, the applicant filed an appeal against that decision with an administrative court. The appeal was dismissed on 30 June 2000 on the ground that the decision to formalise the termination of the applicant’s employment was “the only course of action open to the administrative authorities” once the Diocese had decided not to propose the applicant for appointment. 23. The applicant then brought proceedings for unfair dismissal before Murcia Employment Tribunal no. 3. The Employment Tribunal gave its judgment on 28 September 2000. 24. The tribunal began by examining the facts as established and noted that the applicant had held various posts within the Catholic Church, such as director of the seminary of Murcia or that of episcopal vicar of the region of Cieza and Yecla. It further observed that the applicant was a member of MOCEOP. 25. The tribunal then referred to the arguments used by the Diocese to justify the non-renewal of the applicant’s contract, namely the fact that he had made public his situation as a “married priest” (he had not received a dispensation from the Vatican until 1997) and father, together with the need to avoid scandal and to respect the sensitivity of the parents of the school’s pupils, as they might be offended if the applicant continued to teach Catholic religion and ethics. In this connection the tribunal took the following view: “[I]n the light of the facts thus presented, Mr Fernández Martínez was discriminated against because of his marital status and his membership of the Movement for Optional Celibacy, his appearance in the press having been the cause of his dismissal.” 26. The tribunal further pointed out: “The principle of non-discrimination at work encompasses the prohibition of discrimination on account of belonging to a trade union and union activity, and this applies to membership of any other association.” 27. Lastly, the tribunal noted that the applicant’s situation as a “married priest” and father had been known to the pupils and their parents and to the directors of the two schools where he had worked. 28. Consequently, the tribunal upheld the applicant’s appeal, declared his dismissal (as it was described in the judgment) null and void, ordered the Region of Murcia to reinstate him to his former position, and ordered the State to pay him the outstanding salary. It dismissed the applicant’s claim in so far as it was directed against the Diocese of Cartagena. 29. The Ministry of Education, the Education Authority for the Region of Murcia and the Diocese of Cartagena lodged an appeal (suplicación). In a judgment of 26 February 2001, the Murcia High Court of Justice allowed the appeal, finding as follows: “... The teaching [of Catholic religion and ethics] is associated with the doctrine of the Catholic religion ... Accordingly, the bond created [between the teacher and the bishop] is based on trust. [As a result,] it is not a neutral legal relationship, such as that which exists between citizens in general and public authorities. It falls on the borderline between the purely ecclesiastical dimension and a nascent employment relationship.” 30. Moreover, the court referred to the bishop’s prerogatives in such matters and took the view that in the present case there had not been a violation of Articles 14 (prohibition of discrimination), 16 (freedom of thought and religion), 18 (right to respect for private and family life) or 20 (freedom of expression) of the Spanish Constitution, since the applicant had taught religion since 1991, the Bishop of Murcia having extended his employment from year to year even though his personal situation had been identical. The court concluded that, when the applicant had decided to reveal that situation publicly, the Bishop of Murcia had merely used his prerogative in accordance with the Code of Canon Law, that is to say, ensuring that the applicant, like any other person in that situation, carried out his duties with discretion and without his personal circumstances causing any scandal. In the court’s view, if such a situation became public knowledge, it was the bishop’s duty to cease proposing the person concerned for a post of that nature, in accordance with the requirements of the rescript granting dispensation from celibacy. 31. In addition, as regards Article 20 of the Constitution in particular, the court noted that for the purposes of Article 10 § 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, the restrictions imposed on the applicant’s rights had to be considered legitimate and proportionate to the aim pursued, namely the avoidance of scandal. 32. Furthermore, the court analysed the question of the bond of trust and concluded as follows: “... Where such a bond of trust is broken (and in the present case there are circumstances that reasonably allow such a conclusion to be reached), the bishop is no longer obliged to propose the person in question for the post of teacher of Catholic religion.” 33. Lastly, as to the nature of the contract, the court took the view that, since its renewal was subject to annual approval by the bishop for the following school year, it was a temporary contract, which in the present case had simply expired. It was thus not possible to consider that the applicant had been dismissed. 34. Relying on Articles 14 (prohibition of discrimination), 18 (right to respect for private and family life) and 20 (freedom of expression) of the Constitution, the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. He alleged in particular that the decision not to renew his contract on the ground that he had made public his membership of MOCEOP and his dissenting opinions on the celibacy of Catholic priests constituted an unjustified interference with his private life and was incompatible with his right to freedom of religion. 35. By a decision of 30 January 2003, the chamber to which the case had been allocated declared the amparo appeal admissible and, in accordance with sections 50 to 52 of the Organic Law on the Constitutional Court, notified the decision to the parties and requested a copy of the case file from the courts below. 36. In its mandatory intervention before the Constitutional Court, the public prosecutor’s office (Ministerio Fiscal) argued in favour of granting the applicant’s amparo appeal. In this connection, it criticised the reasons given by the High Court of Justice, which had considered the non-renewal of the contract justified in so far as the applicant had acted in a manner that was contrary to the rescript of dispensation when he had agreed to make his family situation public. The public prosecutor’s office noted that the applicant’s public appearance had taken place well before the dispensation from celibacy was granted to him, and therefore before the existence of that rescript. It further pointed out that the applicant’s membership of the movement in question had been known to the Church authorities. It took the view that since the applicant’s conduct which had served as the justification for the non-renewal of his employment – namely, his attendance at an event organised by the movement – came within the scope of his freedom of thought, the dismissal amounted to a violation of his right to equality (Article 14 of the Constitution), read in conjunction with his right to freedom of thought (Article 16 of the Constitution). 37. In a judgment of 4 June 2007, served on 18 June 2007, the Constitutional Court dismissed the amparo appeal. 38. The Constitutional Court first examined the alleged violations of Articles 14 (right to equality) and 18 (right to respect for private and family life) of the Constitution and dismissed those complaints, the first because the decision not to propose the applicant for appointment as a teacher was not based on any intention to discriminate against him on account of his marital status, and the second on the ground that he himself, of his own free will, had made public both his personal and family situation and the fact that he was a member of MOCEOP. 39. The Constitutional Court then addressed what it regarded as the main question in the amparo appeal, namely, the alleged violation of Articles 16 and 20 of the Constitution. It thus sought to ascertain whether the facts in issue could be justified by the religious freedom of the Catholic Church (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) in conjunction with the State’s duty of religious neutrality (Article 16 § 3 of the Constitution), or whether, by contrast, they constituted a breach of the applicant’s right to freedom of thought and religion (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) in conjunction with his right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution). For that purpose, the court relied on the criteria laid down in its judgment no. 38/2007 of 15 February 2007 concerning the constitutionality of the system of selection and recruitment of Catholic religion teachers in State schools. In this connection it emphasised the special status of teachers of religious education in Spain and took the view that this status justified the fact that the religious beliefs of such teachers would be taken into account in the selection process. 40. At this point, the Constitutional Court explained as follows: “... the task of the Constitutional Court in the present case, as in other cases where there is a conflict between fundamental rights of a substantive nature, is to ascertain whether the courts [below] weighed up the competing rights at stake in a manner that reflected their constitutional definition ... In doing so, it is not bound by the assessment already made by those courts. In other words, the assessment of this Court is not confined to an external review of the adequacy and consistency of the reasons given for the decision or decisions ...; rather, in its capacity as the ultimate guarantor of fundamental rights, it must resolve any conflict that exists between the affected rights and determine whether those rights have indeed been infringed in terms of their individual constitutional content. However, for this purpose it is necessary to apply different criteria from those applied by the courts [below], as the reasons given by the latter are not binding on this Court nor do they limit its jurisdiction to merely reviewing the grounds of their decisions. ...” 41. As regards the facts of the case, the Constitutional Court began by noting that the reason for the non-renewal had been the article in a regional newspaper, which had caused a scandal according to the arguments put forward by the Diocese of Cartagena in its official memorandum of 11 November 1997. That article had made public two personal characteristics of the applicant already known to the Diocese, namely his family situation as a married priest and father, and the fact that he was a member of a movement that challenged certain precepts of the Catholic Church. That publicity had formed the factual basis of what the Diocese had referred to in its memorandum as constituting a scandal. 42. Noting that the High Court of Justice had effectively reviewed the Bishop’s decision, in particular concerning the latter’s inability to propose candidates who did not have the requisite professional qualifications for the post and the obligation to respect fundamental rights and civil liberties, the Constitutional Court found as follows: “The extensive passages cited from the judgment appealed against demonstrate that it neither rejects the possibility of judicial review of the ecclesiastical authority’s decision nor does it shy away from weighing up the fundamental rights competing in this particular case with the right to religious freedom (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution), which it does in an unequivocal manner.” 43. The Constitutional Court then engaged in its own balancing of the competing fundamental rights: “Having dealt with the balancing of the rights at stake in the impugned judgment, this Court must now assess, above and beyond the reasoning of that judgment, the conclusions reached by it after weighing up the conflicting fundamental rights. In doing so the Court must consider not just the rights contemplated in that judgment, but also the right to freedom of thought and religion, an issue which it submitted, of its own motion, for the consideration of the parties... The actions and opinions which resulted in the appellant in the present case not being proposed by the Diocese as a teacher of Catholic religion and ethics were his public disclosure, firstly, of his situation as a priest who was married and the father of five children and, secondly, of his membership of the Movement for Optional Celibacy (as made clear by the judgments of the courts below and expressly conceded by the amparo appellant himself). It is clear that, from the State’s (secular) perspective, these actions and opinions must be considered in terms of a possible infringement of the right to freedom of thought and religion (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) in conjunction with the right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution), relied on in the application for amparo relief. In order to resolve this issue it must be borne in mind that no rights, not even fundamental rights, are absolute or unlimited. In some instances the provision of the Constitution recognising a right expressly limits that right; in other cases, the limitation stems from the need to preserve other constitutional rights or values which warrant protection. In that connection this Court has repeatedly held that the fundamental rights recognised by the Constitution can yield only to the limitations expressly laid down by the Constitution itself or those which can be indirectly inferred from the Constitution as being justified in order to preserve other rights or values protected by the law. In any case, the limitations imposed may not impede the exercise of the fundamental right in question to an unreasonable degree (see Constitutional Court judgments no. 11/1981 of 8 April 1981, legal ground 7; no. 2/1982 of 29 January 1982, legal ground 5; no. 53/1986 of 5 May 1986, legal ground 3; no. 49/1995 of 19 June 1995, legal ground 4; no. 154/2002 of 18 July 2002, legal ground 8; no. 14/2003 of 28 January 2003, legal ground 5; and no. 336/2005 of 20 December 2005, legal ground 7). In the present case the interference with the appellant’s right to freedom of religion, in its individual dimension, and his right to freedom of thought (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) taken in conjunction with the right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution), as a result of his not being proposed by the Diocese for appointment as a teacher of Catholic religion and education for the 1997/98 school year – in the context, therefore, of his claim to continue teaching the creed of a particular religious faith in a public educational establishment – was neither disproportionate nor unconstitutional, since it was justified by respect for the lawful exercise of the Catholic Church’s fundamental right to religious freedom in its collective or community dimension (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution), in conjunction with the right of parents to choose their children’s religious education (Article 27 § 3 of the Constitution). The reasons determining the decision not to propose the appellant as a teacher of Catholic religion and ethics were of an exclusively religious nature, related to the rules of the faith to which he freely adheres and whose beliefs he sought to teach in a public educational establishment.” 44. The Constitutional Court referred to its judgment no. 38/2007 of 15 February 2007, observing as follows: “As this Court held in judgment no. 38/2007 of 15 February 2007, and reiterated in point 5 of the legal grounds of the present judgment, ‘it would be quite simply unreasonable, as regards the teaching of religion in schools, if the religious beliefs of those who decide of their own free will to apply for such teaching posts were not taken into account in the selection process, on the basis of guaranteeing the right to religious freedom in its external and collective dimension’ ... It should certainly be reiterated, as regards the justification and constitutionality of the impact on or modification of the appellant’s fundamental right to freedom of religion and thought (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) taken in conjunction with the right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution) that, as this Court held in the aforementioned judgment no. 38/2007 of 15 February 2007, ‘the relationship between religious-education teachers and the Church is not entirely the same as that found in organisations which pursue ideological aims, as examined on a number of occasions by this Court, but represents a specific and distinctive category which, while it presents certain similarities, is also different in some respects’. In that connection the Court stated in the same judgment, referring to one of the factors which distinguished the relationship between religious-education teachers and the Church from the relationship within an organisation pursuing ideological aims, and allowed teachers’ rights to be modified in line with the educational ethos of private educational establishments, that the requirement imposed by the ecclesiastical declaration of suitability ‘does not merely consist in a duty to refrain from actions contrary to the religious ethos but extends in a more profound manner to a determination of the individual’s capacity to impart Catholic doctrine, understood as a set of faith-based religious convictions. Since the object of religious instruction is the transmission not only of specific knowledge but of the religious faith of the person who teaches it, this will in all probability imply a series of requirements that transcend the limits of an organisation pursuing ideological aims, beginning with the implicit requirement that persons who seek to transmit a religious faith must likewise profess that faith’ ...” 45. Finally, the Constitutional Court turned to an argument made by the appellant, based on the fact that he advocated changing the rules of the Catholic faith itself, and concluded as follows: “The conclusion reached in the present case as a result of the balancing of the conflicting fundamental rights – on the one hand the Catholic Church’s fundamental right to freedom of religion in its collective or community dimension (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) read in conjunction with the State’s duty of religious neutrality (Article 16 § 3 of the Constitution), and on the other hand the appellant’s fundamental right to freedom of thought and religion (Article 16 § 1 of the Constitution) read in conjunction with the right to freedom of expression (Article 20 § 1 (a) of the Constitution) – is in no way altered by the appellant’s claim that through his reforming views on celibacy for Catholic priests he sought to defend evolutionary change to rules of the Catholic faith which he considered to have become outdated with the passage of time. As pointed out in the Government law officer’s submissions, the State is debarred by its duty of religious neutrality (Article 16 § 3 of the Constitution) from entering into or determining possible disputes within the Church, in this specific case between proponents and opponents of celibacy for priests. Nor is it for the Court, in more general terms, to pass judgment on the suitability or compatibility of the actions, opinions and conduct of persons appointed to teach a particular religion vis-à-vis the orthodoxy of the religious faith in question. As a State body exercising public authority, the Court must confine itself in the present amparo appeal, in accordance with its duty of neutrality, to finding established the strictly religious nature of the reasons given by the religious authority for its decision not to propose the appellant as a teacher of Catholic religion and ethics. It further finds that the appellant’s fundamental rights to freedom of thought and religion and freedom of expression, within the ambit of which his actions, opinions and choices in this regard might in principle fall, were affected and modified only to the extent strictly necessary in order to ensure their compatibility with the freedom of religion of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, the present amparo appeal must be dismissed.” 46. Two judges appended a dissenting opinion to the majority judgment. They criticised the fact that the balancing of the rights by the Constitutional Court had been confined to a reference to the religious grounds given in the decision to discontinue the applicant’s employment. In their view, the publicity given to a form of conduct that was already known beforehand could not justify the non-renewal of the contract. 47. The applicant subsequently submitted an application requesting that the Constitutional Court’s judgment be declared null and void, on the ground that two of the judges of the Chamber which had given the judgment were known for their affinities with the Catholic Church, one of them being a member of the International Secretariat of Catholic Jurists. 48. In a decision of 23 July 2007, the Constitutional Court rejected the application on the ground that, under section 93(1) of the Organic Law on the Constitutional Court, the only possible remedy against a judgment of that court was a request for clarification.",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0

The applicant was born in 1934 and lives in Sarajevo. 6. He was an employee of Unioninvest Holdings d.d., a company based in Sarajevo (“the company”). In 1991 the applicant was appointed head of its Frankfurt office. 7. On 3 December 1993 the applicant was dismissed because of an alleged breach of duty. The notice of dismissal was sent by facsimile from the company’s headquarters in Sarajevo. An appeal against that decision to the competent court in Sarajevo was possible within fifteen days of the date of its delivery. It should be noted, however, that the relevant legislation at the time provided that before submitting a claim to a court an employee had to complain to his or her employer within fifteen days of the date he or she received the impugned decision (see paragraph 28 below). 8. The applicant attempted to send an appeal through the company’s Frankfurt office by a facsimile, requesting that the appeal be transferred to the competent court in Sarajevo, but it was refused. It would appear that he did not make any further attempts at that time. 9. After his dismissal the applicant was granted refugee status in Germany. 10. On 18 December 1993 he initiated proceedings against the company before the Frankfurt Labour Court (Arbeitsgerichts Frankfurt am Main), in accordance with the Agreement on Secondments between the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Germany, seeking reinstatement and payment of salary arrears. By a court offered settlement concluded on 24 August 1994 the company agreed to pay the applicant his outstanding salary for October, November and December 1993. 11. In the meantime, on 10 August 1994 criminal proceedings were initiated against the applicant before the Sarajevo Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) for the alleged breach of duty. It was alleged that the applicant acted in contravention of the Agreement on Secondments by enabling certain persons, who were neither the employees of the company nor the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, to obtain residence and work permits in Germany. 12. On 16 October 1995 the Frankfurt Labour Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction to deal with the applicant’s request for reinstatement. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Hesse District Court (Hessisches Landesarbeitsgericht und Arbeitsgericht). 13. On 8 March 1996 the applicant returned to Sarajevo. 14. After his unsuccessful attempt to obtain the original notice of dismissal of 3 December 1993 (see paragraph 7 above), on 13 June 1996 the applicant initiated proceedings against the company before the Municipal Court seeking reinstatement and payment of outstanding salary from December 1993 onwards. As regards the timeliness of his claim, the applicant submitted that he had been unable to approach the Municipal Court earlier because of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and he informed the court about the pending proceedings before the courts in Germany. 15. On 31 July 1996 the company asked the Hesse District Court to discontinue the proceedings on the applicant’s appeal (see paragraph 12 above), in view of the new proceedings before the Municipal Court. It would appear that those proceedings were discontinued. 16. On 29 April 1998 the applicant complained to the Human Rights Chamber (a domestic human-rights body set up under Annex 6 to the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina) about the length of the proceedings before the Municipal Court. On 9 March 2001 the Human Rights Chamber found that the applicant’s right to a hearing within a reasonable time had been violated, awarded him approximately 500 euros (EUR) as just satisfaction, and ordered the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (one of the constitutent Entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina) to secure a prompt resolution of his case before the Municipal Court by 31 July 2001 at the latest. 17. On 14 December 1999 the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 11 above) were terminated pursuant to the Amnesty Act 1999. 18. On 13 November 2001 the Municipal Court allowed the applicantʼs claim and held that he had been unlawfully dismissed. It did not, however, examine the timelines of the applicantʼs claim although the company had raised this issue in their submissions to the court. 19. On 7 March 2002 the Sarajevo Cantonal Court (“the Cantonal Court”) quashed that judgment and remitted the case for a retrial. 20. On 7 April 2003 the Municipal Court rejected the applicant’s claim finding that his dismissal had been lawful. In view of such ruling, the court did not find it relevant to separately examine the issue of the timelines of the applicant’s claim. That judgment was upheld by the Cantonal Court on 25 October 2004. 21. On 9 March 2006 the Supreme Court of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Supreme Court”) dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law. It held that the lower courts had misapplied domestic law in rejecting the applicant’s claim, as it should have been dismissed as out of time: it was submitted outside the statutory time-limit prescribed by the labour legislation in force at the time of his dismissal (fifteen days of the date of delivery of the decision). It was also submitted outside the statutory time-limit prescribed by the new labour legislation (one year of the date of delivery of the decision). As regards the applicant’s argument that he was unable to reach the courts in Sarajevo because of the war, the Supreme Court held that the applicant could have submitted his claim to any other court in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the relevant legislation at the time (see paragraphs 25 and 27 below). In that connection, the court noted that other cities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with a few exceptions, had not been under a total blockade throughout the war as was Sarajevo. However, since the legal consquences for the applicant were the same, the Supreme Court did not amend the lower courtsʼ judgments („nije mijenajo nižestepene presude“). 22. On 8 November 2007 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina upheld that decision. In so doing, it essentially endorsed the reasons given by the Supreme Court and noted further that the applicant could have sent his claim by post or could have authorised someone in Bosnia and Herzegovina to lodge a claim on his behalf.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

The applicant, Mr Stanisław Zabor, is a Polish national, who was born in 1954 and lives in Wrocław. He was represented before the Court by Mr B. Latos, a lawyer practising in Wrocław. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, first Mr J. Wołąsiewicz and, subsequently, Ms J. Chrzanowska, both of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. On an unspecified date the applicant’s mother was granted, by way of an administrative decision, the right to a protected lease of an apartment located in a building owned by the Wrocław municipality. The applicant had lived in this apartment since 1955. It appears that he moved out in 1980 following his marriage (see paragraph 34 below). 4. In 1995 the applicant’s father signed a tenancy agreement with the municipality, which replaced the earlier administrative decision. The agreement stipulated that other tenants would be the applicant, his mother and his brother. 5. In 1999 the applicant’s brother and father, who apparently had both been in conflict with the applicant, instituted proceedings to strike out the registration of the applicant’s permanent residence in the apartment on the ground that he did not live there. According to the applicant, in those proceedings his mother confirmed that he has been living in the apartment. On 22 October 1999 the Mayor of Wrocław refused the request. 6. The applicant’s father died on an unspecified date. 7. On 13 January 2001 the applicant’s mother died. The applicant’s brother was recognised as a successor to the tenancy agreement. 8. The applicant requested that the municipality recognise him also as a successor to the tenancy agreement. This was refused by a letter of 10 July 2001 on the ground that the applicant did not comply with the requirement for such a succession set out in section 8 of the Lease of Dwellings and Housing Allowances Act of 2 July 1994 (“the 1994 Act”) since he had not lived in the apartment. At the same time the municipal housing administration instituted proceedings to strike out the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment. 9. On 27 February 2002 the municipal administration reiterated their refusal to sign a tenancy agreement with the applicant. 10. On an unspecified date in 2002 the applicant was allegedly forced to leave the apartment due to the aggressive behaviour of his brother. 11. The Government submitted that according to the Mayor of Wrocław’s internal inquiry the applicant had not been living in the flat for many years. They contended that this fact had been confirmed by the applicant during his interview before the Wrocław Municipal Office on 21 January 2002. 12. In consequence of the above-mentioned internal inquiry, on 17 April 2002 the Mayor of Wrocław gave a decision striking out the registration of the applicant’s permanent residence in the apartment. The Mayor, having regard to the evidence of two residents of the building and the applicant’s brother, established that the applicant had not been living in the apartment for many years. The applicant confirmed this fact, but stated that he had been prevented from occupying the flat by his brother. On 10 June 2002 the Governor of Dolny Śląsk Region upheld the Mayor’s decision. He noted that the applicant had not attempted to use legal remedies to recover the occupation of the apartment. The applicant appealed. On 22 June 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed his appeal. It emphasised that the act of registration was solely a technical act confirming the fact of residence in the flat and did not concern the right to a given dwelling. 13. On 24 July 2002 the applicant brought an action against the municipality, claiming that he should be recognised as a successor to the tenancy agreement after his mother’s death. On 6 November 2002 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court gave a judgment in default, allowing his claim. The municipality lodged an objection against that judgment. 14. On 7 March 2003 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court upheld the judgment in default and confirmed that the applicant was the successor in respect of the tenancy agreement. Neither party filed an appeal against that judgment. 15. On 5 May 2003 the applicant requested the Wrocław municipality to take steps to make the judgment operational by concluding a tenancy agreement with him. 16. In a letter of 18 July 2003 the municipality stated the following: “In reply to your letter and with reference to the attached judgment of 7 March 2003, I should inform you that under that judgment you became your mother’s successor in respect of the tenancy agreement, but that it is impossible to sign such an agreement with you. This is so because an internal enquiry showed that you had not been living in that apartment on a permanent basis. This has already resulted in the decision of the Mayor striking out the registration of your permanent residence in the apartment. Consequently, pursuant to Article 11 (3) 1 of the Act of 21 June 2001 on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and amendments to the Civil Code, the municipal office hereby gives six-month notice in respect of the agreement which you obtained under the judgment referred to above, the agreement expiring on 29 February 2004. The factual basis for the termination of the agreement is the fact that you have not been living in this apartment for a period longer than twelve months.” 17. On 9 December 2003 the applicant lodged an action with the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court in which he sought a declaration under Article 189 of the Code of Civil Procedure that a tenancy agreement existed between him and the municipality. 18. On 25 February 2005 the court gave a judgment in default and allowed the applicant’s claim. The municipality filed an objection to that judgment. On 23 September 2005 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court upheld the judgment in default. It appears that subsequently the judgment became final and enforceable. 19. On 19 December 2005 the applicant requested the Wrocław municipality to sign a tenancy agreement with him, having regard to the final judgment of 25 February 2005. He also requested the municipality to evict his brother from the apartment. 20. On 28 March 2006 the municipality informed the applicant that it recognised him as a tenant in accordance with the judgment of 25 February 2005. It further informed the applicant about the significant rent arrears in respect of the apartment and set a time-limit to pay them. The applicant’s brother was also requested to clear the rent arrears as a joint tenant. 21. The applicant replied that on 10 July 2001 the municipality had refused to recognise him a successor to the tenancy and that subsequently the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment had been struck out. In those circumstances the applicant could not occupy the apartment. He requested the municipality to seek payment of rent arrears from his brother who had been the sole occupant of the apartment. 22. On 21 June 2006 the municipality informed the applicant that it had initiated the procedure with a view to terminating the tenancy agreement since the rent arrears had not been paid. On 23 May 2007 it informed the applicant that it did not have legal means to reinstate his possession of the apartment. On 6 June 2007 the municipality terminated the tenancy agreement with the applicant and his brother with effect from 31 July 2007. 23. On 12 June and 24 July 2007 the municipality again confirmed that the applicant and his brother were the lawful tenants. It underlined that there were no obstacles to the applicant’s use of the apartment occupied by his brother in the absence of a written tenancy agreement. The signing of the written agreement had been postponed until the time when the applicant and his brother cleared the rent arrears. 24. On 9 April 2008 the applicant requested the Mayor of Wrocław to authorise the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment. On 22 August 2008 the request was dismissed on the grounds that the applicant had not lived in the apartment for many years. That decision was upheld on appeal. 25. On 21 May 2008 the municipality filed an action against the applicant and his brother with the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court, seeking payment of rent arrears. On 27 May 2008 the court issued an order for payment against the applicant and his brother. The applicant filed an objection to the order. The municipality submitted in the proceedings that it was the applicant’s brother who had refused to allow the applicant’s access to the apartment. The municipality had no legal means to resolve the family conflict and it was up to the applicant to institute proceedings for repossession. 26. On 10 February 2009 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court dismissed the municipality’s action against the applicant. It found that the municipality had consistently obstructed the applicant in taking possession of the apartment. The court noted firstly that the municipality had struck out the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment which had had adverse effects on the applicant’s ability to occupy the apartment. The applicant’s brother had used the lack of the applicant’s registration as a pretext not to let the applicant into the apartment. Secondly, the municipality had not recognised the applicant as the successor to the lease and thus had forced him to assert his rights in court proceedings. Thirdly, the municipality had refused to confirm in writing the conditions of the tenancy agreement. Consequently, the applicant had not known his obligations as a tenant, in particular as regards the amount of his rent. The court found that since the municipality had not respected its obligations under the tenancy agreement towards the applicant it was not entitled to claim rent from him. 27. The municipality appealed. On 23 June 2009 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed the appeal. 28. On 2 July 2009 the municipality filed an action with the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court against the applicant and his brother, seeking their eviction. On 10 September 2009 the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court gave judgment. It ordered the applicant’s brother to vacate the flat and ruled that the municipality was under an obligation to provide him with social housing. 29. The court dismissed the action against the applicant. It noted that the applicant’s right to the lease of the flat had been confirmed in its final judgment of 25 February 2005. The court further noted that in accordance with the final judgment of the Wrocław Regional Court of 23 June 2009 the applicant had not been obliged to pay the rent arrears. The court found invalid the municipality’s notice of termination of the tenancy agreement issued on the grounds of the failure to pay the rent arrears and confirmed the applicant’s right to use the flat. The municipality did not appeal. 30. On 5 May 2010 the municipality summoned the applicant to sign an appendix to the tenancy agreement to the apartment, specifying him as a tenant. 31. On an unspecified date the applicant complained to the municipality about its failure to provide social housing to his brother in accordance with the Wrocław Śródmieście District Court’s judgment of 10 September 2009. In its reply of 23 June 2010 the municipality informed the applicant that it did not question his right to the lease of the apartment and did not refrain from confirming the lease in writing. In any event, the applicant was informed that his right to the apartment did not depend on the written confirmation thereof. With regard to the eviction of his brother, the municipality informed the applicant that due to a significant number of eviction judgments and the limited stock of municipal social housing it could not immediately satisfy his request to have his brother evicted. 32. In his reply of 21 July 2010, the applicant informed the municipality that he decided to refrain from signing the agreement for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. 33. On 14 November 2011 the applicant brought an action against the municipality in the Wrocław Regional Court. He sought compensation for rendering him long-term homeless in connection with the municipality’s failure to enforce four final judgments. The applicant submitted that he had succeeded to the tenancy agreement after his mother’s death on 13 January 2001. He had been expelled from the flat by his brother who was an alcoholic. Subsequently, the municipality had struck out the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment and refused to sign a tenancy agreement with him. The applicant claimed that as a result he could not find employment for a period exceeding ten years. 34. On 13 February 2013 the Wrocław Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It found that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had suffered the alleged damage, namely the long-term homelessness and the lack of employment as a result of the municipality’s actions. With regard to the alleged homelessness, the court noted that the applicant had succeeded to the tenancy agreement after his mother’s death. The municipality had initially refused to confirm the content of the tenancy agreement and had struck out the registration of his permanent residence in the disputed apartment. However, it did not result from these circumstances that the applicant had become homeless. The court noted that the applicant had not demonstrated that he had been homeless in the period of ten years preceding the lodging of his action. The court established that the applicant had moved out of the flat in 1980 after his marriage. Initially, he had lived with his wife at his parents-in-law and subsequently in an apartment located at Starościńska Street. After about twelve years he had moved out following a conflict with his wife. Subsequently, he had rented flats, lived at his sister and at an allotment. The applicant had not attempted to move into the apartment at issue for more than ten years on account of the conflict with his brother. Currently, he was living in a garden hut owned by his son-in-law. The court concluded then that the applicant had not been a homeless person at the relevant time. 35. With regard to his alleged unemployment, the court established that up until 2007 the applicant had run a transportation firm. Subsequently, he had worked as a security guard and helped his son-in-law with the latter’s business. He had registered as an unemployed only on 22 February 2010 and had lost the right to an unemployment benefit on 2 March 2011. Having regard to the above, the court found that the applicant had been able to rent a flat or a room in order to avoid the alleged homelessness. In addition, besides his brother, the applicant had other close family, including his wife, two adult children and three sisters. 36. The court also found that regardless of the issue of damage, the applicant had not proved that the municipality had acted unlawfully in his case. It noted that the applicant had been deprived of the possibility of living in the apartment at issue after his parents’ death because of the conflict with his brother. The applicant admitted this in the proceedings. The applicant had reproached the municipality for having struck out the registration of his permanent residence in the apartment; however, the court observed that this decision had been upheld on appeal as having been made in accordance with the law. In addition, the court noted that the applicant had not been living in the apartment for more than thirty years. The allegation that the municipality had not signed a tenancy agreement with the applicant had been also unjustified. The court noted that the applicant had succeeded to the tenancy agreement after the death of his mother by operation of the law. The lack of written confirmation of the applicant’s tenancy agreement had had no effect on the existence of the applicant’s right to the apartment. In any event, the municipality had invited the applicant to sign the relevant agreement but the applicant had so far not responded to the invitation. 37. Lastly, the court found that the applicant had not established a causal link between the actions of the municipality and his situation in the last ten years. In particular, the municipality could not be held responsible for the applicant’s situation, such as the conflict with his brother as well as the applicant’s marital problems and the moving out of the flat which he had shared for long years with his wife. 38. The applicant appealed. 39. On 19 June 2013 the Wrocław Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It accepted the facts as established by the Regional Court. 40. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the applicant had not demonstrated that the municipality had acted unlawfully. It noted that the applicant had blamed the municipality for its inactivity in making the apartment available to the applicant. However, the tenancy agreement in respect of the disputed apartment had been in the name of the applicant and his brother, while it was only the latter who had been the sole occupant of the apartment. The Court of Appeal noted that the municipality had had no powers to compel the applicant’s brother to allow the applicant’s access to and use of the apartment. It further noted that if the applicant’s brother had prevented him from occupying the apartment to which he had been entitled under the tenancy agreement, the applicant should have directed his claims against the brother and not against the municipality. 41. From 1945 to 1994 housing matters were subject to a high degree of state control under successive provisions of housing legislation. The most important characteristic of this system, a so-called “special lease scheme”, was that a lease was created by means of an administrative decision and not by a civil law contract between the landlord and the tenant. Under these protected tenancies, the tenants paid a controlled rent and the owners could not terminate the lease by giving notice to the tenant. The special lease scheme was also applicable to houses owned, until 1990, by the State Treasury, and after the reform of the local administration, by the municipalities. 42. The “special lease scheme” was abolished under the Lease of Dwellings and Housing Allowances Act of 2 July 1994 (Ustawa o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych), (“the 1994 Act”) which entered into force on 12 November 1994. However, the special lease scheme (protected lease) was still applicable to tenants who were allocated their apartments on the basis of administrative decisions. 43. Under transitional provisions of the 1994 Law, lease agreements which had originated in administrative decisions given in the past under the special lease scheme were to be regarded as contractual leases concluded for an indefinite period and governed by the provisions of the 1994 Law. The 1994 Act maintained, albeit with slight modifications of wording, the rules concerning the protection of tenants against termination of leases continued on the basis of previous administrative decisions and the right of succession to a lease. 44. Section 8(1) of the 1994 Act read: “1. In the event of a tenant’s death, his or her descendants, ascendants, adult siblings, adoptive parents or adopted children or a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation, shall, on condition that they lived in the tenant’s household until his or her death, succeed to the tenancy agreement and acquire the tenant’s rights and obligations connected with [the lease of] the flat, unless they relinquish that right to the landlord. This provision shall not apply to persons who, when the [original] tenant died, had title to another residential dwelling. 2. In cases where there is no successor to the tenancy agreement, or where the successors have relinquished their right, the lease shall expire.” 45. In 2001 parliament adopted a new law governing housing matters and relations between landlords and tenants. The Act of 21 June 2001 on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and on amendments to the Civil Code (Ustawa o ochronie praw lokatorów, mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie Kodeksu cywilnego) (“the 2001 Act”) entered into force on 10 July 2001. It repealed the 1994 Act. 46. Under Article 11 (3) 1 of that Act, the owner of apartment may give sixmonths notice on the lease agreement if the tenant has not been living in that apartment for more than twelve months.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano,"8. The applicant is a journalist by profession. On 15 October 2003 he published an article in the weekly magazine L’Illustré entitled “Tragedy on the Lausanne Bridge – the reckless driver’s version – Questioning of the mad driver” (“Drame du Grand-Pont à Lausanne – la version du chauffard – l’interrogatoire du conducteur fou”). The article in question concerned a set of criminal proceedings against M.B., a motorist who had been remanded in custody after an incident on 8 July 2003 in which he had rammed his car into pedestrians, before throwing himself off the Lausanne Bridge (Grand-Pont). The incident, in which three people had died and eight others had been injured, had caused much emotion and controversy in Switzerland. The article began as follows: “Surname: B. First name: M. Born on 1 January 1966 in Tamanrasset (Algeria), son of B.B. and F.I., resident in Lausanne, holder of a category C licence, spouse of M.B. Profession: nursing assistant ... It is 8.15 p.m. on Tuesday 8 July 2003, in the austere premises of the Lausanne criminal investigation department. Six hours after his tragic headlong race along the Lausanne Bridge, resulting in three deaths and eight casualties, this reckless driver is alone for the first time, facing three investigators. Will he own up? In fact he doesn’t actually seem to realise what is happening, as if oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him. The man who upset the whole of Lausanne this fine summer day is not very talkative. This Algerian citizen is withdrawn, introverted, inscrutable, indeed completely impenetrable. And yet the questions are flying from all sides. What were the reasons for this ‘accident’, one of the policemen rather clumsily writes, as if he had already formed his opinion. Four words in reply: ‘I do not know’.” 9. The article continued with a summary of the questions put by the police officers and the investigating judge and M.B.’s replies. It also mentioned that M.B. had been “charged with premeditated murder (assassinat) and, in the alternative, with murder (meurtre), grievous bodily harm, endangering life and serious traffic offences”, and that he “appear[ed] to show no remorse”. The article was accompanied by several photographs of letters which M.B. had sent to the investigating judge. It ended with the following paragraph: “From his prison cell, M.B. now spends his time sending letters to the investigating judge ...: on being taken into custody he asked for his watch to be returned and requested a cup for his coffee, some dried fruit and chocolate. On 11 July, three days after the events, he even asked to be temporarily released for ‘a few days’. ‘I would like to phone my big brother in Algeria’, he subsequently begged. He finally announced on 11 August that he had come to a ‘final decision’: he dismissed his lawyer, Mr M.B., on grounds of ‘lack of trust’. Two days later, another letter: could the judge send him ‘the directory of the Bar Association of the Canton of Vaud’ to help him find a different defence lawyer? However, with all the recurrent lies and omissions, the mixture of naivety and arrogance, amnesia and sheer madness characterising all these statements, surely M.B. is doing everything in his power to make himself impossible to defend?” 10. The article also included a brief summary entitled “He lost his marbles...” (“Il a perdu la boule...”), and statements from M.B.’s wife and from his doctor. 11. It appears from the file that the applicant’s article was not the only piece to have been published on the Lausanne Bridge tragedy. The authorities responsible for the criminal investigation had themselves decided to inform the press about certain aspects of the investigation, which had led to the publication of an article in the Tribune de Genève on 14 August 2003. 12. M.B. did not lodge a complaint against the applicant. However, criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant on the initiative of the public prosecutor for having published secret documents. It emerged from the investigation that one of the parties claiming damages in the proceedings against M.B. had photocopied the case file and lost one of the copies in a shopping centre. An unknown person had then brought the copy to the offices of the magazine which had published the impugned article. 13. By an order of 23 June 2004 the Lausanne investigating judge sentenced the applicant to one month’s imprisonment, suspended for one year. 14. Following an application by the applicant to have the decision set aside, the Lausanne Police Court, by a judgment of 22 September 2005, replaced the prison sentence with a fine of 4,000 Swiss francs (CHF) (approximately 2,667 euros (EUR)). At the hearing on 13 May 2015, in reply to a question from the Court, the applicant’s representative stated that the sum of CHF 4,000 had been advanced by his client’s employer and that his client was intending to refund it after the proceedings before the Court. He also confirmed that the amount set by the criminal court had taken account of the applicant’s previous record. 15. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. His appeal was dismissed on 30 January 2006 by the Criminal Court of Cassation of the Canton of Vaud. 16. The applicant lodged a public-law appeal and an appeal on grounds of nullity with the Federal Court, which on 29 April 2008 dismissed the appeals. Its decision was served on the applicant on 9 May 2008. The relevant passages from the decision are as follows: “7. In short, the appellant submits that his conviction for a breach of Article 293 of the Criminal Code is contrary to federal law. He does not challenge the fact that the information which he published falls within the ambit of Article 293 of the Criminal Code. He does, on the other hand, submit, under an interpretation of Articles 293 and 32 of the Criminal Code in the light of the principles inferred from Article 10 ECHR by the European Court of Human Rights, that having received that information in good faith without obtaining it unlawfully, he had the duty as a professional journalist, under Article 32 of the Criminal Code, to publish it owing to what he sees as the obvious interest of the so-called ‘Lausanne Bridge’ case to the general public in French-speaking Switzerland. 7.1. In accordance with Article 293 of the Criminal Code (Publication of secret official deliberations), anyone who, without being entitled to do so, makes public all or part of the documents, investigations or deliberations of an authority which are secret by law or by virtue of a decision taken by that authority, acting within its powers, will be punished by a fine (paragraph 1). Complicity in such acts is also punishable (see paragraph 2). The court may decide not to impose any penalties if the secret thus made public is of minor importance (see paragraph 3). According to case-law, this provision proceeds from a formal conception of secrecy. It is sufficient that the documents, deliberations or investigations in question have been declared secret by law or by virtue of a decision taken by the authority, or in other words that there has been an intention to keep them from becoming public, regardless of the type of classification selected (for example, top secret or confidential). On the other hand, strict secrecy presupposes that the holder of the specific information wishes to keep it secret, that there is a legitimate interest at stake, and that the information is known or accessible only to a select group of persons (see ATF [Judgments of the Swiss Federal Court] 126 IV 236, point 2a, p. 242, and 2c/aa, p. 244). This state of affairs was not altered by the entry into force of paragraph 3 of this Article on 1 April 1998 (RO [Recueil officiel – Official Collection of Federal Statutes] 1998 852 856; FF [Feuille fédérale] 1996 IV 533). That rule concerns not secrets in the substantive sense but rather instances of futile, petty or excessive concealment (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2c/bb, p. 246). In order to exclude the application of paragraph 3, the court must therefore first of all examine the reasons for classifying the information as secret. It must, however, do so with restraint, without interfering with the discretionary power wielded by the authority which declared the information secret. It is sufficient that this declaration should nonetheless appear tenable vis-à-vis the content of the documents, investigations or deliberations in issue. Moreover, the journalists’ viewpoint on the interest in publishing the information is irrelevant (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2d, p. 246). In its Stoll v. Switzerland judgment of 10 December 2007, the European Court of Human Rights confirmed that this formal conception of secrecy was not contrary to Article 10 ECHR inasmuch as it did not prevent the Federal Court from determining whether the interference in issue was compatible with Article 10 ECHR, by assessing, in the context of its examination of Article 293, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code, the justification for classifying a given piece of information as secret, on the one hand, and weighing up the interests at stake, on the other (see Stoll v. Switzerland, cited above, §§ 138 and 139). 7.2. In the present case the offence with which the appellant is charged concerned the publication of records of interviews and correspondence contained in the case file of a live criminal investigation. In pursuance of Article 184 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Canton of Vaud (CPP/VD), all investigations must remain secret until their final conclusion (see paragraph 1). The secrecy requirement relates to all the evidence uncovered by the investigation itself as well as all non-public decisions and investigative measures (see paragraph 2). The law also specifies that the following are bound by secrecy vis-à-vis anyone who does not have access to the case file: the judges and judicial staff (save in cases where disclosure would facilitate the investigation or is justified on public-order, administrative or judicial grounds; see Article 185 CPP/VD), and also the parties, their friends and relatives, their lawyers, the latter’s associates, consultants and staff, and any experts and witnesses. However, disclosure to friends or relatives by the parties or their lawyer is not punishable (see Article 185a CPP/VD). Lastly, the law provides for a range of exceptions. As an exception to Article 185, the cantonal investigating judge and, with the latter’s agreement, the judge responsible for the preliminary inquiry or senior police officers specially appointed by the cantonal government [Conseil d’Etat] (see Article 168, paragraph 3) may inform the press, radio or television about a pending investigation if so required by the public interest or considerations of fairness, particularly where public cooperation is required to shed light on an offence, in cases which are particularly serious or are already known to the general public, or where erroneous information must be corrected or the general public reassured (see Article 185b, paragraph 1, CPP/VD). The present case therefore concerns secrecy imposed by the law rather than by an official decision. 7.3. As a general rule, the reason for the confidentiality of judicial investigations, which applies to most sets of cantonal criminal proceedings, is the need to protect the interests of the criminal proceedings by anticipating risks of collusion and the danger of evidence being tampered with or destroyed. Nevertheless, the interests of the accused must not be disregarded either, particularly vis-à-vis the presumption of innocence and, more broadly, the accused’s personal relations and interests (see Hauser, Schweri and Hartmann, Schweizerisches Strafprozessrecht, 6th ed., 2005, § 52, no. 6, p. 235; Gérard Piquerez, op. cit., § 134, no. 1066, p. 678; Gérard Piquerez, Procédure pénale suisse: manuel, 2nd ed., 2007, no. 849, pp. 559 et seq.), as well as the need to protect the opinion-forming process and the decision-making process within a State authority, as protected, precisely, by Article 293 of the Criminal Code (see ATF 126 IV 236, point 2c/aa, p. 245). The European Court of Human Rights has already had occasion to deem such a purpose legitimate in itself. The aim is to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary in accordance with the wording of Article 10 (2) ECHR, which also mentions the protection of the reputation or rights of others (see Weber v. Switzerland, judgment of 22 May 1990, § 45, and Dupuis and Others v. France, judgment of 7 June 2007, § 32). Furthermore, in so far as the impugned publication concerned excerpts from records of interviews of the accused and reproduced certain letters sent by the latter to the investigating judge, this evidence can validly be classified secret, by prohibiting public access to it, as provided by the legislation of the Canton of Vaud. This is the inescapable conclusion as regards the records of interviews of the accused, as it would be inadmissible to allow such documents to be analysed in the public sphere, before the conclusion of the investigation, before the trial and out of context, in a manner liable to influence the decisions taken by the investigating judge and the trial court. It is also the only possible conclusion as regards the letters sent by the accused to the investigating judge, which focused on practical problems and criticisms of his lawyer (see Police Court judgment, point 4, p. 7). We might point out here that it appears from the impugned publication – which the cantonal authorities did not reproduce in full in their decisions, although they did refer to it and its content is not disputed – that the aforementioned practical problems concerned requests for temporary release and for access to personal effects (letters of 11 July 2003), for a change of cell (letter of 7 August 2003) and for authorisation to use the telephone (letter of 6 August 2003). Regardless of the guarantee of the presumption of innocence and the inferences concerning the detainee’s character which might be drawn during the criminal proceedings from such correspondence, the detainee, whose liberty is considerably restricted, even in respect of everyday acts relating to his private life, or indeed intimate sphere, can expect the authority restricting his liberty to protect him from public exposure of the practical details of his life as a remand prisoner and as a person facing charges (see Article 13 of the Constitution). It follows that in the instant case the information published by the appellant, in so far as it concerned the content of the records of his interviews and his correspondence with the investigating judge, cannot be described as a secret of minor importance for the purposes of Article 293, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code. That being so, the impugned publication constituted the factual elements of the offence provided for in Article 293, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. 7.4. Moreover, the information in question may be described as being secret in substantive terms because it was only accessible to a restricted number of persons (the investigating judge and the parties to the proceedings). Furthermore, the investigating authority was desirous to keep them secret, with not only a legitimate interest in doing so but an obligation under the Cantonal Code of Criminal Procedure, the justification for which was mentioned above (see point 7.3 above). 7.5. Therefore, the only remaining point at issue is the existence of justification. 8. In short, the appellant submits that he had the professional duty (under former Article 32 of the Criminal Code) as a journalist to publish the information in question because of what he describes as the obvious interest in the ‘Lausanne Bridge’ case for the population of French-speaking Switzerland. He considers that in the light of European case-law, the basic assumption should be that publication is justified in principle unless there is a pressing social need to maintain secrecy. From the standpoint of good faith, he submits that Article 32 should apply to journalists who are not responsible for the indiscretion committed by a third party and who receive information without committing any offence themselves other than the breach of secrecy stemming from the publication. Lastly, he contends that the mode of publication is not a relevant criterion. 8.1. As regards the former point, the cantonal court found that while the accident of 8 July 2003, the circumstances of which were undoubtedly unusual, had triggered a great deal of public emotion, it had nevertheless, in legal terms, been simply a road accident with fatal consequences, and did not in itself entail any obvious public interest. It was not a case of collective trauma on the part of the Lausanne population, which would have justified reassuring the citizens and keeping them informed of the progress of the investigation (see judgment appealed against, point 2, p. 9). It is true that the ‘Lausanne Bridge case’ attracted extensive media coverage (see Police Court judgment, point 4, p. 8, to which the cantonal judgment refers (judgment appealed against, point B, p. 2)). However, this circumstance alone, alongside the unusual nature of the accident, is insufficient to substantiate a major public interest in publishing the confidential information in question. Unless it can be justified per se, the interest aroused among the public by media coverage of events cannot constitute a public interest in the disclosure of classified information, because that would mean that it would be sufficient to spark the public’s interest in a certain event in order to justify the subsequent publication of confidential information likely to maintain that interest. Furthermore, such a public interest is manifestly lacking as regards the letters that were published. As we have seen above (see point 7.3 above), these letters virtually exclusively concerned criticisms levelled by the accused against his lawyer and such practical problems as requests for temporary release, for access to personal effects, to change cells and to use the telephone. This type of information provides no relevant insights into the accident or the circumstances surrounding it. It relates to the private life, or indeed intimate sphere, of the person in custody, and it is difficult to see any interest which its publication could satisfy other than a certain kind of voyeurism. The same applies to the appellant’s requests to the investigating judge in relation to his choice of defence lawyer. Nor is it clear, as regards the records of his interviews, what political question or matter of public interest would have arisen or been worth debating in the public sphere, and the cantonal authorities explicitly ruled out the existence of any collective trauma which might have justified reassuring or informing the population. This finding of fact, which the appellant has not disputed in his public-law appeal, is binding on this court (see section 277 bis of the Federal Criminal Procedure Act). That being the case, the appellant fails to demonstrate the ‘obvious’ interest to the general public of the information published, and the cantonal court cannot be criticised for having concluded that at the very most, such an interest involved satisfying an unhealthy curiosity. 8.2. The other two factors relied upon by the appellant concern his behaviour (good faith in access to information and mode of publication). 8.2.1. It should first of all be noted that Article 293 of the Criminal Code punishes only the disclosure of information, irrespective of how the perpetrator obtained it. Moreover, even under Article 10 ECHR, the European Court does not attach decisive importance to this fact when considering whether applicants have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities. The determining fact is rather that they could not claim in good faith to be unaware that disclosure of the information was punishable by law (see Stoll v. Switzerland, cited above, § 144, and Fressoz and Roire v. France [GC], no. 29183/95, ECHR 1999I). This point is well-established in the present case (see section B above). 8.2.2. On the other hand, the mode of publication can play a more important role in the context of safeguarding freedom of expression. While the European Court of Human Rights reiterates that neither it, nor the domestic courts for that matter, should substitute their own views for those of the press as to what technique of reporting should be adopted by journalists, in weighing up the interests at stake it nevertheless takes account of the content, vocabulary and format of the publication, and of the headings and sub-headings (whether chosen by the journalist or the editors), and the accuracy of the information (see Stoll v. Switzerland, cited above, §§ 146 et seq., especially 146, 147 and 149). In the instant case the cantonal court ruled that the tone adopted by the appellant in his article showed that his main concern was not, as he claims, to inform the general public about the State’s conduct of the criminal investigation. The headline of the article (‘Questioning of the mad driver’, ‘the reckless driver’s version’) already lacked objectivity. It suggested that the case had already been tried in the author’s view, in the sense that the fatalities on the Lausanne Bridge had been caused not by an ordinary motorist but by a ‘mad driver’, a man ‘oblivious to the events and all the hubbub around him’; The journalist concluded by wondering whether the driver was in fact doing his best to ‘make himself impossible to defend’. The manner in which he quoted the excerpts from the records of interviews and reproduced the letters sent by the defendant to the judge pointed to the motives of the author of the impugned article: he confined himself to sensationalism, his modus operandi being exclusively geared to satisfying the relatively unhealthy curiosity which anyone is liable to feel about this type of case. Readers of this highly biased publication would have formed an opinion and subjectively prejudged the future action to be taken by the courts regarding this case, without the least respect for the principle of presumption of innocence (see judgment appealed against, point 2, pp. 9 et seq.). The cantonal court concluded that this factor did not indicate that the public interest in receiving information prevailed. That court cannot be criticised on that account. 8.3. The appellant also submitted that the records of interviews and the letters would in any case be mentioned in subsequent public hearings. He inferred from this that preserving the confidentiality of this information could therefore not be justified by any ‘pressing social need’. However, the mere possibility that the secrecy of criminal investigations might be lifted during a subsequent phase of proceedings, particularly during the trial, which is generally subject to the publicity principle, does not undermine the justification for keeping judicial investigations confidential, because the primary aim is to protect the opinion-forming and decision-making processes on the part not only of the trial court but also of the investigating authority, until the completion of this secret phase of proceedings. Moreover, far from being neutral and comprehensive, the publication in issue included comments and assessments which presented the information in issue in a particular light, without providing the opportunities for adversarial argument which are the very essence of proceedings in trial courts. 8.4. Lastly, the appellant did not explicitly criticise the amount of the fine imposed on him. Nor did he challenge the refusal to grant him a probationary period after which the fine would be struck out (former Article 49, point 4, in conjunction with former Article 106, paragraph 3, of the Criminal Code) under Swiss law. From the angle of weighing up the interest in the interference, we might simply note that the fine imposed, the amount of which took into account a previous conviction dating back to 1998 (imposition of a CHF 2,000 fine, which could be struck out after a two-year probationary period, for coercion and defamation), does not exceed half the amount of the appellant’s monthly income at the material time (see Police Court judgment, point 1, p. 5), and there is nothing to suggest that his freelance status at the time of the first-instance judgment led to any significant drop in his earnings. It should also be pointed out that at CHF 4,000 the amount of the fine is below the statutory maximum set out in former Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code (as in force until 31 December 2006), and that this maximum amount, set by the legislature more than thirty years ago, was not revised until the entry into force of the new general section of the Criminal Code, which now sets a figure of CHF 10,000 (see Article 106, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code as in force since 1 January 2007). Furthermore, the sanction for the offence with which the appellant is charged did not prevent him from expressing his views, since it was imposed after the article had been published (see Stoll v. Switzerland, cited above, § 156). That being the case, it is unclear, in view of the nature of the offence charged (the least serious in the classification set out in the Swiss Criminal Code), the amount of the fine and the time of its imposition, how the sanction imposed on the applicant could be regarded as a form of censorship. 8.5. It follows from the foregoing that the appellant disclosed a secret within the meaning of Article 293, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code and that he cannot rely on any justifying factor in his favour. The decision appealed against does not violate federal law as interpreted in the light of the Convention provisions relied upon by the appellant.”",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0

DENMARK,4,No violation of Article 10 - Freedom of expression-{general} (Article 10-1 - Freedom of expression),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Robert Spano;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström,"6. The applicants are journalists. At the relevant time they were employed by one of the two national television stations in Denmark, Danmarks Radio, hereafter “DR”. The first applicant produced a television programme, described as a documentary, called “When the doctor knows best”, which was broadcast at 8 p.m. on 24 September 2008, and seen by 534,000 viewers. The second applicant was the first applicant’s superior and responsible for the content of the programme. 7. The television programme concerned the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer, notably at Copenhagen University Hospital (Rigshospitalet), where Consultant S was in charge of treatment. It focused on two types of chemotherapy medication, Alimta, produced by L, and Vinorelbine, produced by F. Copenhagen University Hospital and S used Vinorelbine as first-line treatment in combination with Cisplatin or Carboplatin, depending on whether the treatment was related to an operation (operable patients) or to prolonging life and relieving pain and symptoms (inoperable patients). 8. Three experts participated in the programme: a medical doctor from Karolinska Hospital in Sweden, a professor from Switzerland and a medical doctor from Grosshandorf Hospital in Germany. They all used Alimta as first-line treatment, most often in combination with Cisplatin or Carboplatin. The programme followed four patients and their relatives, who told their stories, and a narrator spoke as a voice-over throughout the programme. 9. In preparation for the programme, the first applicant had carried out research on the subject which included, inter alia, the following. 10. On 20 September 2004 the European Union had approved the marketing of Alimta in combination with Cisplatin for treatment of patients with inoperable pleural mesothelioma cancer. The background for the approval was, among others, research which had been carried out examining the effect of treatment with Alimta in combination with Cisplatin as compared to treatment with Cisplatin alone (a phase III trial, see paragraph 14 below) as first-line therapy. 11. In July 2007 the Minister for Internal Affairs and Health replied to various questions posed by Members of Parliament as to the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer in Denmark. The Minister replied, inter alia, that there was no proof that an Alimta-based treatment was more efficient than other chemotherapy-based treatments, including that offered in Denmark; that the combination of Vinorelbine and Cisplatin, which was used at Copenhagen University Hospital, resulted in a one-year survival rate of 50% and a median lifetime of 12 months, which was exactly the survival rate from using the combination of Alimta and Cisplatin, but that there had been no direct comparison of the two treatments; and that there was no internationally accepted standard chemotherapy for the treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer, but that several single and combined treatments were used. 12. On 11 June 2008 Copenhagen University Hospital produced a memorandum about pleural mesothelioma cancer and its treatment, which was sent to DR. It stressed that international studies, including of Vinorelbine and Alimta, had not shown that any two-combination regime was superior to other twocombination regimes. That information was confirmed by the professor from Switzerland in an email of 25 June 2008 and by the medical doctor from Grosshandorf Hospital in Germany in an email of 27 June 2008. The memorandum also referred to a fund aimed at developing research on pleural mesothelioma cancer, in the amount of 90,000 Danish kroner (DKK), equal to approximately 12,000 Euros (EUR), received by S from company F, which produces Vinorelbine. The money had been used to pay nurses and students and for data collection. It emerged that there had been no financial profit for the doctors involved. 13. Having received the above-mentioned memorandum, the first applicant again contacted the professor from Switzerland and the medical doctor at Grosshandorf Hospital in Germany. In essence, they confirmed in subsequent emails of 2 and 21 July 2008 that since there had been no direct comparative clinical studies, there was no scientific evidence that one twocombination regime was superior to another two-combination regime. 14. Medical research studies involving human subjects are called clinical trials. They are divided into different stages, called phases. Generally, it can be said that the earliest phase trials may look at whether a drug is safe or at its side-effects. A later phase II trial aims to find out whether the treatment works well enough, for which types of cancer the treatment works, more about side effects and how to manage them and more about the best dose to use. A later phase III trial aims to test whether a new treatment is better than existing treatments (standard treatment). These trials may compare a completely new treatment with the standard treatment or with different doses or ways of giving a standard treatment. 15. Subsequent to the broadcast on 24 September 2008 of the television programme, on 27 October 2008 Copenhagen University Hospital and S instituted defamation proceedings before the Copenhagen City Court (Københavns Byret) against the Director of DR and the two applicants, maintaining that the latter, in the programme in question, had made direct and indirect accusations, covered by Article 267 of the Penal Code (Straffeloven), against Copenhagen University Hospital and S, of malpractice regarding certain patients suffering from pleural mesothelioma cancer, allegedly resulting in the patients’ unnecessary death and shortening of life, in the interest of S’s professional prestige and private finances. 16. Before the City Court, the applicants, S, and Medical Director H for Copenhagen University Hospital gave evidence. 17. The first applicant stated, inter alia: “... that she had not criticised Copenhagen University Hospital for improper treatment causing death. Her message was only to point out that the substance of Alimta had been better documented than the substance of Vinorelbine. She had collected statements from patients and experts, but could not state herself whether Alimta was a better product than Vinorelbine ... The experts had not stated whether Alimta in combination with another product was better than Vinorelbine in combination with another product. However, all experts had emphasised that Alimta had been evaluated in a phase III trial, for which reason it was a more thoroughly tested product. ... her questions had been answered during her conversations with professor M on 19 October 2007 and S on 22 October 2007. Subsequently no one had been willing to answer her questions. That was the only real conversation she had had with S. The next time she had called him, he had put down the receiver. When it had not been possible for her to get any response to her many points of criticism, she had contacted H ... she had wanted statements from both H and S as the programme would be unbalanced if they were not heard ... Some found that Alimta had been better documented than Vinorelbine. She was not aware of any trial demonstrating that a combination with Alimta was better than a combination with another medicinal product ...”. S stated, inter alia, the following: “Alimta has been used for second-line therapy in Denmark since 2004, and since 2007 as first-line therapy. Patients had been given the impression in the media that Alimta was a miracle cure. Therefore Copenhagen University Hospital had introduced it as an option. Today, Alimta is used in combination with Carboplatin as the standard therapy for inoperable patients ... Sometimes in autumn 2008, the standard therapy for operable patients had been changed to Cisplatin in combination with Alimta. If some patients were offered Alimta everybody had to be offered Alimta ... After the programme had been broadcast ... patients started mistrusting the Vinorelbine therapy. Afterwards it was not possible to perform the trial [phase II] on this drug. Nor would it be possible to obtain funding for the trial. Therefore no trial had been performed of Vinorelbine ... he had provided the information included in professor M’s memorandum of 23 September 2008 ...he had talked to [the first applicant] several times and had spent a lot of time and energy on explaining cancer therapy... he had also lost confidence in [the first applicant]...” H stated, among other things: “ ...The approval of Alimta by the Danish Medicines Agency for the treatment of mesothelioma only means that a marketing authorisation has been granted for the drug, which means that advertisement of the product is permitted. Vinorelbine has also been approved by the Danish Medicines Agency, but for a wide range of oncological therapies ... in 2003 when Alimta was tested [phase III] the bar had been set quite low. The study compared Alimta with a clearly inferior treatment that would not actually be offered to anybody. It would have been more relevant to study Alimta in combination with Cisplatin versus Vinorelbine with Cisplatin .... S has made a phase II trial of the standard therapy [Vinorelbine] ... Subsequently the standard therapy regimen has been expanded to include Alimta, which is not a better product than Vinorelbine, but eight times more expensive ... if two drugs are equally effective, but one of them is eight times more expensive than the other, patients will be offered therapy using the cheaper drug. ... The standard therapies now offered by Copenhagen University Hospital are Vinorelbine in combination with Cisplatin for inoperable patients and Alimta in combination with Cisplatin for operable patients ... the shift to Alimta as the standard therapy at Copenhagen University Hospital did not reflect that Alimta was medically better. The [applicants’] programme had had a large impact as patients were asking not to be treated with Vinorelbine. Copenhagen University Hospital had therefore had to change medical products because patients had the clear impression that Vinorelbine was not as good as Alimta ... It is quite usual for Copenhagen University Hospital to surrender material to the press and to answer questions, but the questions of [the first applicant] were never-ending. Copenhagen University Hospital has spent about a man-year, or about DKK 400,000, responding to inquiries from [the first applicant], and huge efforts had been made to accommodate her requests ... the programme had created distrust towards both Copenhagen University Hospital and S and had created uncertainty in both patients and relatives. He had received 50 to 100 “hate mails” himself ...” 18. By a judgment of 9 April 2010, the Copenhagen City Court found against the applicants (and the Director of DR) and sentenced them each to 10 day-fines of 1,000 Danish Kroner (DKK). The allegations were declared null and void. The reasoning was as follows: “... Based on the evidence, the City Court accepts as a fact that in 2004, following a phase III trial, EMEA approved Alimta in combination with Cisplatin for treating patients suffering from inoperable malignant pleural mesothelioma and that subsequently the same was approved by the Danish Medicines Agency. The court also accept as a fact that Vinorelbine is a drug dating back more than 20 years whose effect had been documented by clinical experience and approved by the Danish Medicines Agency for a wide range of oncological therapies. Finally, the court also accepts as a fact that it has not been documented that Alimta therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product is more effective than Vinorelbine therapy in combination with a platin medicinal product. As regards the term “experimental drug” the court accepts as a fact that a drug administered to patients in a trial is referred to as an experimental drug, no matter whether the same drug is the standard therapy offered outside the trial setting. No matter that [the applicants] are deemed to have been aware of the above circumstances following their comprehensive research of the matter, it was said in the programme that, for dying patients, [S and Copenhagen University Hospital] had prescribed a “non-approved chemotherapy regimen” not approved for the diagnosis or which was not “the correct chemotherapy”, and that [S and Copenhagen University Hospital] used an “experimental drug”, the “worst-case scenario being that patients would die earlier than if they had been treated with an approved substance”, or that it would have “fatal consequences”. Moreover, the phrase “the only drug with a known effect” was used. Since no account was given in the programme of the above-mentioned trials and approval process and the terminology applied for that process, the court finds that it would seem to a non-professional viewer that Alimta was the only effective drug for mesothelioma, particularly because the programme linked the treatment of two patients with Vinorelbine to their death, whereas the prospect of several more years to live was held out to the one patient who had been given Alimta therapy in Germany. Moreover, the programme also linked S’s use of Vinorelbine to his personal esteem and his “personal research account”, although [the applicants] had been made aware of the research grant management procedure though Professor M’s memorandum of 23 September 2008 before the broadcast. Since no account was given either of the procedure for managing research grants, the court also finds in this respect that it would seem to a non-professional viewer that S had a personal financial interest in starting Vinorelbine treatment rather than Alimta. The [applicants] are therefore considered to have violated Article 267 of the Penal Code. According to the information on [the applicants’] knowledge after their comprehensive research of the matter, the court finds no basis for exempting them from punishment or remitting the penalty under Article 269 of the Penal Code, compare also Article 10 of the Convention. ... [The applicants] are furthermore jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of DKK 62,250.” 19. On appeal, on 10 June 2011 the judgment was upheld by the High Court of Eastern Denmark (Østre Landsret) with the following reasoning: “In the introduction to the programme ‘When the doctor knows best’ a narrator states, among other things: ‘A Danish doctor is entering a medical congress to show his research results. For years he has gone his own way, he has treated dying patients with chemotherapy that is not approved.’ Later during the programme, it is stated at which hospitals one can receive treatment for pleural mesothelioma cancer, that these hospitals co-operate with Copenhagen University Hospital, and a reference is made to a named Consultant, S, head of the Scandinavian Centre for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer. During the various interviews, a narrator states, inter alia: - ‘The doctor does not give his patients the only approved medication. Instead, he uses a test medication. In the worst scenario, that may result in the patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved substance.’ - ‘There is only one approved chemotherapy against pleural mesothelioma cancer, but that is not offered to SP [one of the patients followed in the programme]. The doctors chose to treat her with a substance that is not approved for the diagnosis, and whose effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer is not substantiated.’ - ‘However, that chemotherapy turned out to have huge consequences for her [SP].’ - ‘S can freely choose the medication that he thinks is best. There is only one treatment which, in comparative studies, has proved to have an effect on pleural mesothelioma cancer. Accordingly, that is the only medication which is approved as treatment. That medication is called Alimta. However, S chose not to use that medication on his patients.’ - ‘Thus, it has not been proved whether Vinorelbine works. According to the calculations made by DR, close to 300 patients in Denmark have been given test medication. In the worst scenario, that may result in patients dying earlier than if they had been given the approved medication.’ -’For her [SP] the lack of effect of treatment by Vinorelbine turns out to have had fatal consequences.’ - ‘The family K ask themselves why S goes his own way. They suspect that he has other interests than those of the patients. That suspicion grows, when they talk to SK’s personal doctor.’ - ‘It turns out, however, that S may also have had other reasons for choosing Vinorelbine. Because he has used this medication in medical tests on the patients. In a phase when they are fighting for their lives.’ -’The question remains: why does S carry out tests with Vinorelbine? Could it have something to do with the prestige which is implicit in having research articles published?’ - ‘We do not know whether it is prestige that impels S.’ - ‘Thus, S will not acknowledge what leading experts agree on; [namely] that Alimta is the only medication whose effect is substantiated.’ - ‘Here it turns out that S has received more than DKK 800,000 over the last five and a half years from the company F. That is the company behind the test medication Vinorelbine. The money has been paid into S’s personal research account. DKK 90,000 is earmarked for the tests. S withheld that information.’ The programme ends by informing us, among other things, that two of the patients who were interviewed have passed away. The narrator says, inter alia: ‘TJ, who was part of S’s tests with Vinorelbine, died on 4 January 2008.’ With these statements, [the applicants] not only passed on assertions by patients, relatives and experts, but also took a stand, so that the programme undisputedly gave the viewers the impression that malpractice has occurred at Copenhagen University Hospital, in that S has deliberately used medication (Vinorelbine), which is not approved for treatment of pleural mesothelioma cancer, and whose effect has not been substantiated, that the medication in question was part of a test, and that the test medication has resulted in patients dying or having their lives shortened. The way that the programme is built up with its beginning and ending, the viewers get the clear impression that the reasons behind this choice of medication [Vinorelbine] were S’s professional prestige and personal finances. Against this background, in the programme, the applicants, as producer of the programme and as chief sub-editor, have made an allegation against Copenhagen University Hospital and S of malpractice and of nourishing irrelevant considerations to the detriment of the lives and health of patients. Such an accusation is likely to disparage [Copenhagen University Hospital and S] in the eyes of their fellow citizens as set out in Article 267 of the Penal Code. It must have been clear to them [the applicants] that they were making such an allegation by way of their presentation of the programme. The applicants have not attempted to establish the truth of the allegation, but have submitted that the allegation shall be unpunishable by virtue of Article 269 (1) of the Penal Code as they acted in lawful protection of an obvious public interest or the interest of others or, in the alternative, that punishment should be remitted under Article 269 (2) of the Penal Code because they were justified in regarding the allegations as true. These provisions must, in connection with Article 267 of the Penal Code, be understood in the light of Article 10 of the Convention on the protection of freedom of expression. A very considerable public interest is related to journalistic discussion about risk to life and health, or suspicion thereof, as regards public hospital treatment. When balancing considerations of freedom of expression with considerations of the protection of the name and reputation of persons and companies, the former is accorded tremendous weight on the scale. That entails acknowledgement of a very far-reaching freedom of expression for the press, and accordingly the press must be permitted, as the public control- and information organ (‘public watchdog’), a certain amount of exaggeration and provocation in connection with their discussion of these questions, when factually there are reasons for expressing criticism. On the basis of the information in the case, including the research material that the applicants possessed before the broadcast of the programme, in particular the emails from [the medical doctor from Grosshandorf Hospital in Germany and the professor from Switzerland], the replies by the Minister for Internal Affairs and Health to various questions [posed by Members of Parliament], and the memorandum of 11 June 2008 produced by Copenhagen University Hospital [about pleural mesothelioma cancer], it can be established that Vinorelbine in combination with Cisplatin or Carboplatin was standard treatment at Copenhagen University Hospital, that the European Union on 20 September 2004 approved the marketing of Alimta in connection with Cisplatin for treatment of inoperable patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer, that there was no substantiation or basis for believing that an Alimta-based treatment was more efficient than the treatment offered by Copenhagen University Hospital, that some patients at Copenhagen University Hospital, who were already about to receive Vinorelbine as standard treatment, were chosen and offered the same medicine as part of a test [it is not known for what], and that S did not make any private financial profit from these tests. Against this background, including the fact that the word ‘approved’ was not explained during the programme, namely the difference between medication approved for treatment and [medication] approved for marketing, and by consistently using the word “test medication”, even though only one patient in the programme participated in tests, [the applicants] made allegations which were based on an incorrect factual basis, of which they must have been aware via the research material. The aim of the programme – to make a critical assessment of the treatment of patients with pleural mesothelioma cancer offered by Copenhagen University Hospital and the responsible consultant – is a legitimate part of the press’s role as ‘public watchdog’, but it cannot justify an allegation, which is built on a factually incorrect basis, and thus a wrong premise. [The applicants], who did not limit themselves to referring to or disseminating statements by experts, patients and relatives, did not have any basis for making such serious allegations against Copenhagen University Hospital and S. The allegations cannot be justified on the grounds that Copenhagen University Hospital and S refused to participate in the programme. Against this background, and since in relation to Article 10 there is no interest to protect when there is no factual basis for the accusations, the allegations are not unpunishable under Article 269 (1), nor is there any basis for remitting the punishment under Article 269 (2) [of the Penal Code]. It is an aggravating factor that the wrongful accusations were disseminated on national television during primetime and on DR’s homepage, by means of which the accusations had a significant spread. Accordingly, [the High Court] agrees [with the Copenhagen City Court’s judgment] that [the applicants] be fined under Article 267, and that the allegations be declared null and void by virtue of Article 273 (1). The High Court thus dismisses the appeal and upholds the judgment of the Copenhagen City Court. The applicants shall be jointly and severally liable for paying legal costs of the High Court appeal to Copenhagen University Hospital and S, in the amount of DKK 90,000, which constitutes the legal fee inclusive of VAT. In fixing the amount, the High Court took into account the scope and duration of the case.” 20. On 27 October 2011 the Appeals Permission Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) refused the applicants’ request for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Højesteret). 21. Subsequent to the broadcast on 24 September 2008 of the television programme, four complaints were lodged with the Patient Insurance Association (Patientforsikringen) relating to the issues raised by the programme. A press release published on the Associations’ website on 9 March read as follows: “As of today, the Patient Insurance Association has received four complaints relating to the treatment of mesothelioma patients with combinatorial drugs other than Carboplatin and Alimta. That treatment was questioned by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) in a documentary programme in September 2008. The Patient Insurance Association has received four complaints relating to the criticism raised. This means that the persons claiming compensation are either patients or their dependants, one of the reasons being their belief that the combinatorial drugs administered to treat the disease were incorrect ones. All four complaints have been refused, one of the reasons being that the independent medical oncologists who assessed the cases found that it was in compliance with optimum medical standards to treat patients with the selected combination therapy. Two of the cases have been appealed against to the National Agency for Patients’ Rights and Complaints (Patientskadeankenævnet). The National Agency for Patients’ Rights and Complaints upheld the decision of the Patient Insurance Association, finding, inter alia:’... [patients] were offered Carboplatin and Vinorelbine, which must be considered to be as active as other combinations with a favourable profile of adverse reactions’. The other appeal does not concern the issue of combination therapy.”",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0

The applicant was born on 30 August 1949 and lives in Nicosia. 6. The applicant was employed at the Department of Lands and Surveys on 1 December 1971. On 1 January 1996 he was promoted to the position of assistant officer and on 2 February 1998 he was authorised by the director of the department to sign payment orders as authorising officer. On 13 May 2002 a complaint was made by the director following an irregularity in a compulsory acquisition case. It emerged from the investigation that a series of cheques had been issued as alleged compensation to owners of land that had been compulsorily acquired, but that the cheques had never reached the payees named on them. 7. A number of criminal proceedings were brought against the applicant and an accomplice. It also appears that a third person was charged but those proceedings were terminated following the filing of a nolle prosequi by the AttorneyGeneral. The proceedings against the applicant involved a total of 223 criminal charges. 8. On 18 January 2005 the applicant received concurrent sentences ranging from two to five years’ imprisonment from the Nicosia Assize Court (no. 18115/02) on a plea of guilty, following a plea bargain to twenty- four charges concerning a number of offences. These included, inter alia, obtaining the amount of 225,643.67 Cyprus pounds (CYP) (approximately 390,000 euros) by false pretences, issuing false documents, forging cheques, abuse of office, and concealment. Part of the agreement reached between the parties was that the applicant would repay the sum of CYP 150,000 (approximately 255,000 euros), and a confiscation order for that sum was issued in respect of his property. In imposing the sentences the Assize Court also took into consideration another eight cases pending against the applicant before it as well as the District Court of Nicosia. 9. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court against his sentence (criminal appeal no. 22/05). 10. Following the applicant’s conviction, and having received the Attorney-General’s advisory opinion that the offences committed involved dishonesty or moral turpitude, the PSC instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant. Similar proceedings were also instituted against his accomplice, on whom the PSC imposed compulsory retirement pursuant to section 79(1)(i) of the Public Service Law of 1990 (Law 1/1990; hereinafter “the Public Service Law”; see paragraph 43 below). 11. By a letter dated 13 April 2005 the PSC informed the applicant of the Attorney-General’s opinion and invited him to appear before it on 17 May 2005 and to make representations before proceeding with the imposition of a disciplinary penalty. 12. The PSC convened on 17 May 2005. The applicant’s lawyer requested a month to prepare his pleadings, as he had only recently been appointed and in view of the special nature of the case. The PSC granted the request. 13. On 13 June 2005, the applicant, who was represented by a lawyer, was heard by the PSC. He put forward a number of mitigating factors, which included his dire financial situation following suspension from his duties, the fact that he had paid off most of the sum agreed upon with the authorities, the conviction and sentence he had received from the Assize Court, his significant years of service, and the less severe punishment imposed on his accomplice. He also submitted a socio-economic report by the Department of Social Welfare Services. 14. On 13 June 2005 the PSC decided to dismiss the applicant. In its decision the PSC observed that this case had been one of the most serious cases it had been faced with. The conception and planning of the crimes committed showed a well-set-up fraud which had dealt a blow to the prestige and credibility of the procedures of the Department of Lands and Surveys and also to the image of the Public Service in general. The PSC noted that the offences of which the applicant had been convicted included some of the most serious offences against property, as well as abuse of office and concealment. The gravity of the offences was evident from the severity of the sentences applicable under the law, the substantial sum the applicant had secured through his unlawful actions, and the fact that eight more cases pending against him concerning similar offences had been taken into account by the Nicosia Assize Court when imposing sentence. The PSC also pointed out that the applicant had faced 223 charges in total, which was unprecedented for Cyprus and which disclosed the seriousness and the magnitude of the case. 15. In reaching its decision the PSC observed that it had taken into account the circumstances and conditions under which the applicant had committed the offences. He had been authorised to sign payment orders and had been entrusted by the Republic with the important post of promoting cases concerning compulsory acquisition and serving citizens involved in these cases. The applicant, however, did not live up to his responsibilities, exploited his position, and developed his criminal activities with unprecedented effrontery and recklessness. He had been the mastermind, instigator and main executor of the criminal activities. 16. The PSC also noted that it had taken into consideration what had been said by the applicant’s counsel in mitigation, in particular, the applicant’s personal and family circumstances, as well as the fact that he had undertaken to compensate for the damage and/or part of the damage suffered by the Republic as a consequence of his criminal acts. Further, the PSC pointed out that he had been the main protagonist and this had been stressed by the Assize Court when distinguishing the sentence passed on him from that passed on his co-accused. 17. Pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law (see paragraph 43 below), the disciplinary penalty of dismissal resulted in the forfeiture of the entire applicant’s public service retirement benefits (hereinafter “retirement benefits”). This entailed the loss of a retirement lump sum and a monthly pension. 18. Lastly, the PSC decided that the part of the applicant’s salary that had been withheld during the period of his suspension from service would not be returned to him. 19. Up to the date of his dismissal the applicant had worked for thirty-three years in the public service. 20. On 23 March 2006 the applicant withdrew his appeal. 21. Pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law (see paragraph 43 below), his wife received a widow’s pension. This amounted to 15,600 euros (EUR) per year. 22. On 26 August 2005 the applicant brought a recourse before the Supreme Court (revisional jurisdiction) under Article 146 of the Constitution, seeking the annulment of the PSC’s decision to dismiss him from the Public Service and of the consequent forfeiture of his pension rights (recourse no. 994/2005). 23. The applicant claimed that the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been in breach of Article 23 of the Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. In this respect the applicant argued that his pension rights constituted a “possession”, and that their automatic forfeiture consequent to his dismissal was disproportionate. 24. On 2 April 2007 the Supreme Court, in an ex tempore decision, held that the recourse was admissible. The court observed that the case concerned the discretion of the PSC in deciding on the dismissal, taking into account all relevant parameters and, in particular, the consequences dismissal would have for the applicant. Therefore, the decision on the penalty and the consequences were very closely linked, bringing to the forefront the principle of proportionality as the main aspect of the PSC’s discretion. It was obvious from the PSC’s decision that in exercising its discretion when choosing the penalty to be imposed it had taken into account the automatic, as it considered, by law, loss of retirement benefits. As a result the court concluded that the extreme severity of the case justified, despite its grave repercussions on the applicant’s retirement rights, the penalty of dismissal. If in the end the court were to accept the applicant’s claims, the setting aside of the penalty of dismissal could not be excluded. The Supreme Court therefore concluded that it could continue to examine the merits of the recourse. 25. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court dismissed the recourse, but did not award costs against the applicant in view of the nature of the legal issues raised. 26. The Supreme Court, after having ruled that the retirement benefits of a public servant in Cyprus constituted a possession under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, went on to examine whether or not there had been a violation of the applicant’s rights under this provision. Drawing guidance from the Court’s case-law, and in particular the judgments in the case of Azinas v. Cyprus (no. 56679/00, 20 June 2002, and [GC], no. 56679/00, ECHR 2004III), and the decision in the case of Banfield v. the United Kingdom ((dec.), no. 6223/04, ECHR 2005XI), the Supreme Court first pointed to those factors which justified the deprivation of the right to property in this case. One such main factor in the court’s view was the gravity of the offences committed. It considered in this respect that the characterisation of the case by the PSC as one of the most serious in its history did not appear to be an exaggeration. The impression given by the offences was such that not only did they entail a well-organised fraud but they also, most importantly, as the PSC asserted, dealt a blow to the prestige and trustworthiness of the administration. The court considered that sentencing the applicant to five years’ imprisonment, as well as dismissing him, did not necessarily exhaust the limits of the discretion of the State to put things right. Besides, as in Azinas, the non-deprivation of pension benefits in the case of a pension plan to which the employee did not make contributions would amount to rewarding the applicant. 27. At the same time, the serious consequences of the applicant’s punishment - a sentence of five years’ imprisonment and dismissal - had also to be considered, particularly the financial difficulties arising from the deprivation of the said rights as an additional “punishment” for the applicant and his family. The court observed that this was an important factor to be taken into account, according to the circumstances of each case. If the deprivation had not been automatic but discretionary within the framework of enacted procedures, as in England, it would have been possible to examine whether there should be a deprivation and to what extent. The court noted in this respect that it would indeed be good for the State to consider seriously the prospect of an amendment to the law so as to make the system more flexible and fairer in each case. Moreover, there was also the fact that the applicant had to a great extent returned the money he had embezzled, a fact which, although the PSC had said that it had taken it into account, did not appear to have affected its decision, since the punishment imposed on the applicant was, of the ten forms provided for, the extreme one of dismissal instead of choosing the second most serious form of punishment, that of compulsory retirement, which would not have entailed the loss of retirement rights. 28. In the end, however, the Supreme Court considered that the fact that the case in question arose and was heard on the basis of a different statutory regime from that in Azinas as regards the consequences of dismissal entailing the loss of pension rights, tilted the scales, albeit slightly, in favour of the Republic. The proviso in section 79(7) that the applicant’s pension from the day of his dismissal would be paid to his wife and dependent children as if he had died on that date reduced for the family the hardship resulting from the dismissal. Despite this, the court observed that it was likely that there would be cases with even more dire consequences for the dismissed employee, such as when there was no wife or dependent children, or their relationship was such that the dismissed employee could not reasonably expect to benefit through them. Nothing, however, had been said to include the present case among those cases, except for the theoretical possibility that his wife could die before the applicant. The court stated that, if matters were otherwise, it was likely that it would have ruled differently. 29. Finally, the Supreme Court stressed that the competent bodies should seriously study the possibility of amending the statutory framework on the basis of the law in force in England, so that deprivation of retirement rights was not automatic but could be looked at with the help of enacted procedures and with the exercise of discretion in order that the PSC might determine, by means of a reasoned decision, the extent to which it was just to forfeit, if at all, in any particular case, according to the individual’s special circumstances and needs. The Supreme Court considered that both the rule of law and the modern conception of individual justice demanded this. 30. On 5 June 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court (appellate revisional jurisdiction; appeal no. 78/2007). He first challenged the first-instance finding concerning section 79(7) of the Public Service Law. He submitted that this section was contrary to Article 23 of the Cyprus Constitution and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, as the forfeiture of his retirement benefits had been automatic, without the exercise of any discretionary power. In this respect he argued that the first-instance court had applied the proportionality principle incorrectly during the examination of the penalty imposed by the PSC, and therefore had been wrong when it decided that the measure was proportionate and in line with the Convention. Secondly, the applicant claimed that the finding of the first-instance court that the consequences of this decision were reduced because he was married and thus his wife and dependent children would receive a pension, was discriminatory on the ground of marital status and thus in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution. 31. On 12 June 2007 the respondent Government also appealed (appeal no. 81/2007) challenging the first-instance findings (a) that in the present case the retirement benefits could be considered a “possession”; (b) that in the disciplinary dismissal of a public servant there was no enacted framework providing for the exercise of discretion as to whether the retirement benefits would be granted; and (c) that the payment of the pension to the applicant’s wife was the only essential factor which tilted the scales in favour of the Republic. 32. On 18 May 2010 the Supreme Court dismissed both appeals without awarding costs, in view of the importance of the matter raised. It agreed with the first-instance court’s finding that the right to a pension and its conditions constituted a possession of the employee. This right was created by the appointment of the employee. The fact that a pension was given to the wife and dependent children suggested that pension benefits were considered as “property” which could be transferred. In this respect the court referred to its judgment in the case of Pavlou v. the Republic (revisional appeal no. 161/2006, (2009) 3 CLR 1402; see paragraph 46 below) and the Court’s judgment in the case of Apostolakis v. Greece (no. 39574/07, 22 October 2009). 33. The court went on to find, however, that the deprivation of the applicant’s retirement benefits had been justified. In this respect, the court noted that the PSC had chosen the penalty of dismissal under section 79(7) of the Public Service Law, after exercising its discretion and after considering the consequences and the fact that such a penalty was in the public interest. The first-instance court had examined whether the imposition of the penalty of dismissal, which brought about the automatic forfeiture of retirement benefits, was disproportionate. It had examined whether the PSC, when exercising its discretion, had applied the principle of proportionality in deciding on the penalty of dismissal, which itself resulted in the automatic deprivation of retirement rights. In this respect it held that the PSC had exercised its discretion when deciding to impose the penalty of dismissal. The PSC had had a variety of available penalties at its disposal, such as compulsory retirement, which did not bring about the forfeiture of the pension. It decided, however, in view of the offences committed by the applicant, that such deprivation was justified. 34. The Supreme Court pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had acknowledged that the administration had wide discretion in deciding on such matters. 35. It went on to agree with the first-instance court that the deprivation of the applicant’s retirement benefits had been justified in view of the seriousness of the offences, which had dealt a blow to the trustworthiness and credibility of the administration. The relevant domestic law provision was aimed at discouraging public servants from committing serious offences and at protecting the smooth running of the administration. Section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was not contrary to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, since the deprivation of retirement benefits was not a punishment on its own, but a consequence of the imposition of the penalty of dismissal. 36. The court went on to distinguish the applicant’s case from that of Apostolakis, in which the forfeiture had been automatic following a criminal conviction and had entailed deprivation of both pension and social security rights and therefore of all means of subsistence. In the present case, although the applicant had been deprived of his retirement benefits as a public servant, he had been entitled to receive benefits from the Social Insurance Fund, which were calculated on the basis of contributions made by the employer and the employee. Referring to the Court’s judgment in the case of Wieczorek v. Poland (no. 18176/05, 8 December 2009), it found that the applicant had not been deprived of all means of subsistence. 37. As to the question of discrimination due to marital status, raised by the applicant, the Supreme Court held that the first-instance court’s comments on the matter did not support the applicant’s claim of discrimination. The comments in question had been made on a hypothetical basis and did not apply to the present case. 38. Lastly, the Supreme Court dealt with the remaining grounds of appeal put forward by the Government. It observed that the first-instance decision was to the effect that in the event of dismissal the law did not provide for a procedure concerning the exercise of discretion for forfeiting retirement rights, but it did not say that it was not possible to exercise discretion on the matter, since it recognised that there was a choice between dismissal entailing forfeiture of rights and compulsory retirement, which did not. Finally, it pointed out that the first-instance court had set out in its decision all the facts which it had taken into account in deciding on the proportionality of the forfeiture, and had rightly concluded that the payment of the pension to the wife meant that the deprivation was not disproportionate. The court did not award costs in view of the important issues raised. 39. The applicant has been receiving a social security pension from the Social Insurance Fund since 31 August 2012, when he reached the age of sixty-three. The pension therefore received by his wife pursuant to section 79(7) of the Public Service Law was then reduced by the complementary sum received by him from the Social Insurance Fund. According to a letter dated 28 November 2012 sent to her by State’s Treasury, her pension was reduced by EUR 854,94 per month.",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0

The applicant, Mr Altin Arapi, is an Albanian national, who was born in 1971 and is currently living in Belgium. He is represented before the Court by Mr G.-H. Beauthier, a lawyer practising in Brussels. […] 2. summarised as follows. 3. At some time in 1996 the prosecutor opened an investigation against the applicant and nine other people, including O., into numerous criminal offences committed between 1993 and 1996 in the cities of Tirana and Vlora. Almost all offences had been committed by way of a criminal organisation, named ‘Revenge for Justice – Hakmarrja për Drejtësi’, which the ten co-accused had allegedly established. 4. On 22 November 1996 the applicant’s arrest was ordered. By that time, the applicant had gone into hiding. 5. On 12 February 2003 the Tirana District Court decided to discontinue the proceedings for lack of evidence. 6. On 19 February 2003, in a press conference, the then leader of the Democratic Party accused the judges who had given the decision of 12 February 2003 of being members of the said criminal organisation. The applicant has submitted an article of 20 February 2003 which had appeared in the daily “Koha Jonë”. Another article of the daily “55” of 14 February 2003 reported the spokesperson of the office of the Prosecutor General stating that “the court’s decision was given by scared judges who were under pressure and threat.” 7. The applicant alleges that the judges who gave the judgment of 12 February 2003 left the country on an unspecified date. 8. On 30 April 2003 the Tirana Court of Appeal quashed the decision of 12 February 2003 and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It held that the Tirana District Court was not empowered to discontinue the proceedings. Instead, it should have returned the investigation file to the prosecutor for further completion with documents. 9. On 1 July 2008 the Tirana Serious Crimes District Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment. This decision was upheld on appeal by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court (decisions nos. 40 of 7 July 2009 and 731 of 2 July 2010). 10. On 7 November 2011 the Constitutional Court accepted O.’s constitutional complaint and found a breach of the length of proceedings and the Supreme Court’s lack of impartiality. It remitted the case for re-examination to the Supreme Court. It would appear that the proceedings are pending before the Supreme Court. 11. None of these sets of proceedings are the subject of this application. 12. On the evening of 29 September 2003, around 9 p.m., a certain G. was murdered in a car on a main boulevard in Tirana, while waiting at the traffic lights. The victim was the driver of the escort group of the Prosecutor General and he was shot dead by a male passenger in a taxi which was in the line of traffic. The perpetrator left the crime scene together with a girl who was in the taxi with him. The Prosecutor General’s spouse, Z., and minor daughter, S., were in the car when the murder was committed. 13. The crime scene investigation reports indicated that three fingerprints, which were taken for an examination, were found on the door of the victim’s car. Another fingerprint, which was taken for examination, was found on the interior side of the taxi’s back seat window. 14. On the same evening, at 10 p.m., Z. made a statement to a prosecutor. The relevant parts of the statement, which was not initially disclosed to the defence, read as follows. “While we were waiting at the traffic lights, I heard G. speaking to someone on the left of the car. Initially, I did not pay attention. When the conversation was not being made on normal tones, I told G. to stop talking and to pull up the window ... The other person started raising his voice and even shouted swear words. I told G. not to respond. Suddenly I saw that the other person came closer to the car. Again, I told G. to pull up the window and not to snap back. Initially, I could not discern who that person was. At the moment he neared the car, I saw that he was a young man. G. attempted to open the door of the car to clarify things away from our presence. He opened the door ajar but could not get out because the person pushed the door back, without closing it, and shot G. with a pistol he took out of the inside of his jacket.” 15. Z. also gave a description of the perpetrator. Whereas she had not been able to see anyone else who was with the perpetrator, after getting out of the car, she heard people saying that a girl, who was with him on the taxi, left together with the perpetrator after the murder. 16. On the same evening the taxi driver, T., made a statement to the police officers. He declared that he had collected a man and a woman from a restaurant in Tirana. He was asked to take them to a certain address in the city, without having been given instructions as to the route to follow. According to the statement, while they were waiting at the traffic lights, the male passenger, who was sitting in the front seat, pulled down the window and started arguing with the victim whose car stopped beside the taxi. The relevant parts of the statement, read as follows. “My passenger nervously hit the door with his fist. I saw that he and the SUV driver were exchanging looks. My passenger pulled down the window and asked the SUV driver ‘what are you looking at?’ I do not recall whether the window of the SUV door had been pulled down and I did not hear the SUV driver’s answer. I then saw that my passenger got out of the taxi, went over to the SUV driver and started arguing. I did not hear their arguments. I then saw my passenger taking out a pistol from his belt and directing it to the SUV driver. I did not see whether the SUV door was opened or not. I heard one single shot and the SUV driver fell on the side of the passenger’s seat. At that moment the driver fell on the other side, the door of the SUV was opened. I did not see whether the door was opened by the passengers or the driver. I saw that the passenger took the SUV driver’s pistol away with him and left from the back of the SUV.” 17. The statement also included a description of each passenger. 18. The applicant alleges that T. left the country immediately after giving the above statement. 19. On 4 October 2003 the applicant fled Albania on a false passport and later sought asylum in Belgium. On 30 October 2003 the applicant was arrested in Belgium (see the section “Extradition proceedings and the applicant’s detention in Belgium” below). 20. On 22 and 28 October 2003 two extradition requests (“letër porosi – letters rogatory”) were sent by the Prosecutor General to the Belgian authorities requesting the arrest of O. with a view to his extradition to Albania. At the material time it was believed that O. was the author of the murder of 29 September 2003. However, O. obtained asylum in Switzerland on 13 September 2004 and the Swiss authorities refused an extradition request by the Albanian authorities in respect of O. on 14 December 2005. 21. On 29 October 2003 an arrest warrant was issued against the applicant in connection with the above murder. No copy of the warrant has been submitted to the Court. 22. On 30 October 2003 the applicant’s fiancée, Im. (allegedly the girl in the taxi) was arrested. Her fingerprints were taken the following day. During the questioning, Im. identified the person who had been arrested in Belgium as the applicant, on the basis of some photographs. On the same day the Prosecutor General sent another extradition request to the Belgian authorities requesting that the applicant, instead of O., be arrested with a view to extradition. The relevant excerpts of the applicant’s copy of the extradition request, as submitted in French (text not edited), read as follows: « D’après les actions immédiates d’investigation de cette affaire, on a identifié les numéros utilisés par le suspect principal, Altin Arapi et par ses collaborateurs. Arapi est un criminel connu et déjà recherché pour plusieurs crimes dont meurtre, vol de banques, enlèvement et actes terroristes. Arapi est le dirigeant d’un groupe criminel appelé “Hakmarrja per Drejtesi” (Vengeance pour la Justice). On pense que le groupe est très dangereux et presque tous d’entre eux ont été poursuivis pénalement par défault pour quelques crimes graves. ... Après l’interrogatoire de la citoyenne Albanaise [Im.], (laquelle déclare être la fiancée d’Altin Arapi) et après lui avoir montre pour effet de reconnaissance des photos du sujet arrêté en Belgique, elle a admis que la personne sur la photo est Altin Arapi. C’est pourquoi nous avons des raisons fondées pour croire que le tueur n’est pas O., mais Altin Arapi, qui est la personne arrêtée en Belgique. ... Les articles appartenants au Code Pénal Albanais, traduits en Français, qui concernent les crimes pour lesquels Arapi a été condamné auparavant, aussi que le dernier meurtre du chauffeur du Procureur General. » 23. In the meantime, the Albanian Government, pursuant to a request for factual information by the Judge Rapporteur in accordance with Rule 49 § 3 (a) of the Rules of Court, submitted a copy of the extradition letter. The cover letter reads as follows: “This document [the extradition request] was provided by the General Prosecution Office who stated that at the file of extradition regarding Altin Arapi, this document was created only in the English version. Please find attached an Albanian translation of the extradition request dated 30 October 2003.” 24. The relevant excerpts of the copy of the extradition request, as submitted in English (text not edited), read as follows: “From the very urgent investigative steps that we have taken following the vent, we have identified some telephone numbers used by the chief suspect, Altin Arapi, and his criminal associates. Arapi is a known criminal already wanted for several crimes including murder, bank robbery, kidnapping and terrorist acts. Arapi is the leader of a criminal group called ‘Revenge for Justice’. The group is presumed to be very dangerous and nearly all of them have previously been prosecuted in absentia for other severe crimes. ... From the interrogation of the Albanian citizen [Im.] (who is actually declaring to be the finance of Altin Arapi) and after the introduction of the photographs of the subject arrested in Belgium, she has admitted that the person in photograph is Altin Arapi. So we have reasonable ground to believe that the murderer is not O. but Altin Arapi, who is the person that is arrested by you in Belgium. ... Attached to this request are: The relevant articles of the Albanian Criminal Code, translated into French, covering both the crimes for which Arapi has previously been indicted and the recent murder of the General Prosecutor’s driver. ...” The English copy bore stamps reading “General Prosecutor’s office, copy certified against the original”. 25. On 31 October 2003 the first fingerprint examination concluded that the fingerprint found on the taxi’s back seat window corresponded to Im.’s. On 6 November 2003 the second fingerprint examination concluded that two of the fingerprints found on the victim’s car’s door corresponded to the applicant’s right palm and his right hand little finger, of which digital prints had been provided by the Belgian authorities following his arrest in Belgium. 26. On 29 January 2004 the prosecutor charged the applicant with six offences, namely the murder of G., theft, the illegal possession of firearms, the forging of documents, the forging of identity cards or visas and the forging of civil status acts. On 6 February 2004 the applicant’s lawyer was notified of the charges. 27. On 9 February 2004 the Tirana Serious Crimes District Court (“the District Court”) granted the prosecutor’s request for the applicant’s arrest in absentia. There is no indication that the applicant’s lawyer attended the hearing. 28. On 28 October 2004 the prosecutor filed a bill of indictment with the Tirana Serious Crimes District Court (“the trial court”) accusing the applicant of six criminal offences. 29. On 16 December 2004 the applicant’s lawyer contended that the prosecutor had breached the presumption of innocence against the applicant by virtue of the extradition request of 30 October 2003. He also submitted seven other requests in order to obtain additional evidence, conduct other experts’ reports and question other witnesses. 30. On 17 December 2004 the applicant’s lawyer requested that the fingerprint examination report of 6 November 2003 be declared invalid for breach of procedural rules. It would appear that on 23 December 2004 the trial court dismissed the request. 31. On 7 February 2005 the trial court heard the testimony of Z. (the Prosecutor General’s spouse). She described the events of 29 September 2003 and the fact that the perpetrator had prevented G. from opening the door of the car after the exchange of heated words. She stated that the person who had murdered G. resembled the photographs of the accused as shown on the press and on the television, during his appearance before the Belgian courts. The witness further declared that she had made a preliminary statement on 29 September 2003 to a prosecutor, whereas S. had not made any statements since she was a minor at the material time. The applicant’s lawyer sought to obtain possession of Z.’s statement of 29 September 2003 which had been withheld by the prosecutor. At least four other witnesses were questioned on the same day. The court issued a summons for the appearance of the taxi driver, T.. However, T. never appeared before the court as he had fled the country to an unspecified address. 32. On 11 February 2005 the prosecutor read out T.’s statement, which had been taken during the criminal investigation. The applicant’s lawyer contested the statement in so far as the characteristics of the perpetrator did not match those given by other witnesses before the trial. The applicant’s lawyer further insisted on being provided with a copy of Z.’s statement of 29 September 2003. On the same day the trial court rejected the applicant’s lawyer request. It decided that, in so far as the evidence was not submitted to the trial court, the latter had no right to obtain acts from the parties, neither oblige them to submit any particular acts. However, the court granted most of the applicant’ 33. Consequently, the trial court heard two criminal investigators K. and E., as well as two criminal experts R. and D. as requested by the defence. They were questioned about the crime scene investigation reports and the experts’ reports they had completed. In addition, witness B. testified before the court as requested by the defence. 34. B. had not made any statements during the criminal investigation for lack of trust in the justice system. He had decided to testify before the court following the airing of views on television about the murder and the suspects. In his testimony, B. declared that he had stopped at the corner of the traffic lights while he was waiting to cross the street. He had seen from distance that the door of G.’s car opened and he heard a choking noise. He thought that a murder had taken place. After that moment, the person who had opened the door of G.’s car, took away a girl who was seated in the back of a taxi next to the car. In B.’s view, the perpetrator did not resemble the applicant. 35. On an unspecified date before 18 February 2005 the prosecutor provided the applicant’s lawyer with Z.’s statement of 29 September 2003. The statement was not submitted to the court to be included in the case file. 36. On 18 February 2005 two other criminal experts, H. and Q., appeared before the court as requested by the defence. They were questioned about the experts’ reports they had conducted. The trial court decided to obtain additional relevant evidence from various bodies in relation to the case as requested by the defence. On the same day, the applicant’s lawyer submitted a memorial objecting to Z.’s statement of 29 September 2003. According to the memorial, the applicant’s lawyer complained of the procedure followed for obtaining the statement and its content. 37. On 18 March 2005 the applicant’s lawyer made his final written submissions. He accepted three charges levelled against the applicant, namely the forging of documents, the forging of identity cards or visas and the forging of civil status acts, but dismissed the remaining three, namely the murder of G., theft and the illegal possession of firearms. The final observations contested the admissibility and assessment of evidence submitted by the prosecutor. 38. On 24 March 2005 the trial court delivered its judgment, finding the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The court relied on the applicant’s telephone metering information, which indicated that he had dialled the land line telephone number of the taxi company whose taxi he had been using at the time the murder was committed. In addition, two of the fingerprints found on the crime scene corresponded to the applicant’s fingerprints. The oral testimony of Z. confirmed that the perpetrator resembled the applicant as shown on television in his appearance before the Belgian court. The statement of T. also confirmed the resemblance between the perpetrator and the applicant. 39. On 30 March 2005 the applicant appealed. He mainly complained of the admissibility and assessment of several pieces of evidence, such as Z.’s oral testimony, the report on the examination of his fingerprints and the report on the examination of the victim’s car. He asked the Tirana Serious Crimes Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”) to obtain additional evidence such as O.’s fingerprints, to summon the restaurant’s waitresses, and to re-examine some of the experts questioned during the trial. He also complained that the prosecutor had not disclosed a fingerprint examination report that had been conducted at the restaurant in which he had been dining on 29 September 2003. On 11 July 2005 the applicant submitted further written observations. He finally argued that the evidence submitted by the prosecutor was contradictory and inconclusive. 40. On 11 July 2005 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the trial court’s judgment. It concluded that the applicant’s guilt was proved on the strength of the telephone metering information, the fingerprint report, Z.’s oral testimony and T.’s statement. 41. In the same judgment, the court addressed each of applicant’s requests. As regards the applicant’s requests to declare invalid several pieces of evidence, the court dismissed them as being unsubstantiated and found that they had been obtained lawfully. In so far as the applicant’s request for the administration of O.’s fingerprints was concerned, the court decided that such fingerprints would not serve any purpose. The applicant’s request for summoning waitresses from the restaurant in which he had been dining on the evening of 29 September 2003 was dismissed on grounds of their incorrect identification and the unclear description of facts the defence intended to prove. The applicant’s allegation that the prosecutor had not submitted an expert report on the fingerprints taken at the restaurant was rejected as being unsubstantiated. There was no proof that such report existed. The court also dismissed the applicant’s request to re-examine some experts given that their testimonies would not disclose any new facts other than the ones that had been testified before the trial court. The court considered that the testimony of B. presented information which was difficult to prove given the location and distance of the witness. It found that the credibility of his testimony was questionable and decided to reject it. 42. On 29 July 2005 the applicant appealed. He contended that the domestic courts lacked impartiality as they had dismissed the accused’s requests to obtain further evidence, question witnesses and disregard the evidence already procured as being invalid. He also argued that the courts had erred in the qualification of the criminal offence. 43. On 30 June 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal, finding that it contained no lawful grounds of appeal in accordance with Article 432 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 44. On 10 October 2006 the applicant filed a constitutional appeal. He submitted that the applicant’s right to legal assistance had been breached as a result of non-notification of the decision of 9 February 2004. He further argued that there had been a breach of the presumption of innocence owing to the content of the extradition request of 30 October 2003. The principle of equality of arms had also been violated, following the dismissal of his requests to re-examine witnesses, obtain additional evidence, conduct further experts’ reports and reconsider the evidence submitted by the defence. 45. On 14 December 2006 the Constitutional Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It held that the applicant’s complaint did not raise any fair trial issues, but mainly concerned the assessment of evidence and interpretation of statutes, which was the function of the lower courts. 46. Following the Albanian authorities’ extradition request of 30 October 2003 requesting the applicant’s extradition, he was arrested and detained on remand by the Belgian authorities. It would appear that the extradition request was supplemented by documents on 17 February and 13 April 2004. 47. On 17 September 2004 the Belgian Ministry of Justice refused the extradition request. The relevant parts of the decision, as submitted by the applicant in Dutch, read as follows: “3. Considering that in a report of the Federal Police, dated 1 December 2003, information is mentioned – which the Federal Police received from two different sources – that places the arrest of the person whose extradition is requested in a political light whereas the Belgian police and justice authorities are being used in a tangle of political complications and a process of settling scores in Tirana; that, according to this report, it had already been established in this case that the working methods and the documents provided by the Albanian authorities contained anomalies; that the report sets out the intelligence obtained from which it, inter alia, appears that, as regards the arrest warrant of 22 November 1996, a judgment was given on 12 February 2003, which, inter alia, states that documents were forged, that several witnesses testified that they had not identified the accused as perpetrators, that in the course of the investigation witnesses were blackmailed and tortured and, that the accused – including the person whose extradition is being sought – were acquitted; that the judges who issued this judgment were subsequently accused of participating in the “Hakmarrja” terrorist organisation; that the basis for the arrest warrant of 29 October 2003 has to be found in a web of political competition; that in this case various inconsistencies can be established whereby the data have been manipulated; that evidence of such manipulation can be found in the great differences between the actual statements of the taxi driver who transported the perpetrator and his female companion on the one hand and the official version of these statements on the other; 4. Considering that on 17 October 2003 an international arrest warrant was originally issued against [O.] concerning the murder of [G.] and that on the same day a picture and fingerprints of this person were submitted; that only on the day that [the applicant] was interviewed in Belgium, namely on 30 October 2003, and after there had been contact between Belgium and Albania, the Albanian Government let it be known that the perpetrator of the assault on [G.] had not been [O.] but [the applicant]; that it is true that the case file contains information relating to fingerprints submitted by the Albanian authorities, supposedly demonstrating that [the applicant] was present at the crime scene when [G.] was shot, these elements were however only submitted after the Belgian authorities had sent [the applicant’s] fingerprints to the Albanian authorities; 5. Considering that it is furthermore the case that the request for extradition speaks of criminal proceedings against the [applicant] which were instituted on 29 September 2003 and of the criminal proceedings 1589/96, without however making any mention of the course of the aforementioned proceedings (see para. 1 above), i.e. the judgments of 12 February 2003, 30 April 2003 and 4 September 2003; that the course of the proceedings was kept concealed until the Belgian authorities, based on the documents submitted by the defence, requested the Albanian authorities to provide additional information; Upon considering that it has thus been adequately demonstrated that in the present case there are serious grounds for believing that the request for extradition was made with the intention to prosecute the person concerned for political motives, or that the position of the person concerned would be adversely affected on the basis of these motives; 6. Upon considering that pursuant to Article 3 of the [European] Convention on Extradition and Article 2bis of the Belgian Law on Extradition of 15 March 1874 the extradition shall not be allowed if the requested Party has serious reasons for believing that the request for extradition concerning a non-political offence was made with the intention to prosecute or punish a person on the ground of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or if the position of the person involved threatens to be adversely affected on the basis of one of these reasons; Decides: The extradition of ARAPI Altin is not granted to the Government of Albania.” 48. In a letter of 30 September 2004 to the Albanian Embassy in Brussels, the Belgian authorities stated that the refusal of the extradition request was based on Article 3 of the European Convention on Extradition and Article 2bis of the Belgian Law on Extradition of 15 March 1874, according to which extradition shall be refused if there exist “substantial grounds for believing that a request for extradition for an ordinary criminal offence has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinion, or that that person’s position may be prejudiced for any of these reasons.” 49. The applicant submits that he was held for eleven months in detention in Belgium, at the end of which he was released. 50. A certificate of 12 June 2013 by the Belgian Office of the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons stated that the applicant was a refugee within the meaning of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951. 51. The applicant submitted that on 16 April 2006 the then spokesperson of the parliamentary group of the Democratic Party, B.N, declared before the Albanian media the following: “before making a summary of achievements, the Prosecutor General should explain to Albanians his links with the terrorist organisation ‘Revenge for Justice’ and the reasons that the case file in respect of Altin Arapi, [the applicant], did not follow the formal procedure”. 52. On 17 April 2006, in an interview in a private television channel, the then Prosecutor General was reported to have stated the following: “the fact that Belgium, Switzerland ... did not grant the extradition of the persons concerned for political reasons indicates that these countries assessed the political statements made in Albania and are afraid of an unjust [legal] process.” 53. According to a press article published in the “Panorama” daily newspaper, it would appear that on 24 July 2006 the Albanian Prime Minister, speaking before the Albanian parliamentarians prior to their voting on the dismissal of the Prosecutor General, stated, amongst others, the following: “those who voted for you do not have anything in common with the murder of the Prosecutor General’s driver by Altin Arapi in the middle of the boulevard.” 54. The relevant part of the Constitution reads as follows: “Article 131 The Constitutional Court shall determine: ... (f) complaints by individuals alleging a violation of their constitutional rights to a fair hearing, provided all legal remedies for the protection of those rights have been exhausted.” 55. Article 141 provides that any document addressed to an accused who cannot be found, has been declared fugitive or gone into hiding, is notified to his representative. 56. Article 238 states that one of the security measures (masë sigurimi) that the court assigns is imprisonment. Article 249 § 1 allows for the opportunity to appeal to a higher court within ten days against measures of restraint. Under Article 249 § 2, the time-limit to appeal in respect of the accused who has been declared fugitive or gone into hiding starts to run from the date of notification to his representative in accordance with Article 141. 57. Article 425 establishes the scope of the examination of the appeal by the Court of Appeal. It provides that the examination of the case by the Court of Appeal is not limited to the grounds of appeal but extends to the whole case. 58. Under Article 427, at the party’s request, the Court of Appeal shall be empowered to directly re-examine previous evidence and additional new materials, if it considers necessary. 59. Article 428 establishes which decisions may be taken by the Court of Appeal. It provides that the Court of Appeal may decide to dismiss the appeal and uphold the judgment, to amend the judgment, to quash the judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings, or to quash the judgment and remit the case for a fresh trial. 60. The Court of Appeal’s judgments may be appealed to the Supreme Court in compliance with one of the following requirements of Article 432: a) the criminal law has not been respected or has been misapplied; b) there have been breaches which result in the court’s judgment being declared invalid in accordance with Article 128 of this Code; c) there have been breaches of procedural rules that have affected the adoption of the judgment. 61. Article 434 provides that the Supreme Court examines the appeal in so far as points of law have been raised therein. 62. This Act set up the Serious Crimes District Courts (Gjykatat për Krime te Rënda) and the Serious Crimes Courts of Appeal (Gjykatat e Apelit për Krime të Rënda). Both courts sit in chambers composed of five judges. They try cases that concern criminal offences committed under Article 75 (a) of the Criminal Code. 63. Article 75 (a), as introduced by Law no. 8813 of 13 June 2002, provides that the serious crimes courts try cases that concern the criminal offence of establishing an armed group or a criminal organisation, any criminal offence committed by such group or organisation and any other crime which is punishable by no less than 15 years.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
118,001-148480,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,CICHOŃ v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Ms Justyna Cichoń, is a Polish national, who was born in 1972 and lives in Plewiska. She was represented before the Court by Mr A. Zielonacki, a lawyer practising in Poznań. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. In 2007 the applicant’s mother, who was born in 1943, bought an apartment from I.K. Shortly afterwards serious technical flaws in the apartment came to light. The applicant’s mother intended to institute civil proceedings against the seller for compensation. 4. She became depressed as a result of the substantial pecuniary loss she had suffered because of the transaction, which she considered fraudulent. In June 2007 she attempted to commit suicide. She was admitted to hospital on 28 June and discharged on 3 July 2007. The hospital records indicate that she was diagnosed with “a depressive reaction”. 5. On 9 August 2007 I.K. informed the prosecuting authorities that the applicant’s mother had phoned her and uttered threats against her. She had allegedly told I.K. that she would kill her as she had ruined her life by selling her a worthless apartment which she had paid for with her life savings. On the same day I.K.’s father was questioned. He confirmed that the applicant’s mother had uttered threats against I.K. 6. The case file contains a note drawn up by the police and dated 9 September 2007 to the effect that a police officer tried to serve a summons for questioning on the applicant’s mother at G. Street, but to no avail. He was informed by persons living at that address that she had sold that apartment. 7. By a bill of indictment dated 25 September 2007 the Gostyń District Prosecutor charged the applicant’s mother with the offence of uttering threats. The bill was subsequently lodged with the Gostyń District Court. 8. On 1 October 2007 the Gostyń District Court ordered, having regard to the applicant’s mother’s attempt to commit suicide, that a psychiatric expert opinion be prepared on the question of whether she could be held criminally responsible. 9. On 11 October 2007 the Gostyń District Court appointed a legal-aid lawyer to represent the applicant’s mother in the proceedings. On the same day the entire criminal case file was forwarded to the psychiatric clinic that was to carry out the psychiatric examination of the defendant. 10. Subsequently, by letters dated 15 and 20 October one of the experts at the clinic sent summonses to the applicant’s mother at the address at G. Street where she no longer lived (see paragraph 9 above) for examinations to be carried out at the clinic on 24 October and 7 November 2007. The summonses were not served either on her or on any member of her family. The service confirmation slips (potwierdzenie odbioru) were not returned either to the court or to the experts. 11. On 19 November 2007 one of the experts informed the Gostyń District Court by phone that the applicant’s mother had twice failed to attend the psychiatric examination on the dates fixed. On 22 November 2007 the experts informed the court in writing of the applicant’s mother’s failure to attend the examination. They requested the court to arrange for her to be taken to the clinic under police escort for the examination on 30 November 2007. 12. On 22 November 2007 the court, having regard to the applicant’s mother’s failure to comply with the summonses and being unaware of the fact that they had not been served on her, ordered the police to arrest her and escort her to the clinic for the purposes of the examination. 13. At 6.30 a.m. on 30 November 2007 the applicant’s mother was arrested by two police officers at her correct address at O. Street. She was subsequently escorted to the clinic. She was examined by two psychiatrists several hours later and discharged on the same day. 14. On 2 December 2007 the applicant’s mother was found dead in a basement of her house. She had committed suicide by hanging herself. 15. In a psychiatric opinion dated 3 December and served on the court on 6 December 2007, psychologist M.K.S. and psychiatrist T.J. summarised the interview held with the applicant’s mother on 30 November 2007. They noted that she had not had psychotic symptoms and had not reported suicidal thoughts or tendencies. They diagnosed her as suffering from an adjustment disorder (zaburzenia adaptacyjne). The experts further declared that at the material time she had been able to understand the significance of her actions and that, regard being had to her general mental health, she was fit to stand trial. 16. On 6 December 2007 the Gostyń police discontinued an investigation concerning a suspicion that third parties might have assisted the applicant’s mother in committing suicide, having regard to the opinion of the doctor who had declared her dead that there was no indication that any third parties had been involved. The decision concluded that the most likely cause of the suicide was nervous breakdown (załamanie nerwowe). 17. On 18 March 2008 the applicant requested the Poznań Appellate Prosecutor to verify whether the investigation and proceedings in respect of her mother had been conducted properly. She submitted that the attempted suicide in June 2007 and her fragile mental state should have prompted the authorities to conduct the proceedings with particular diligence. Instead, summonses had twice been sent by psychiatrists to the wrong address and they had never been served on her. The court had ordered that she be arrested and taken to the psychiatric clinic. She had been seriously traumatised by the arrest, as indicated by the fact that she had committed suicide on the day after the examination. 18. That complaint was forwarded to the President of the Poznań Regional Court, who replied on 21 April 2008. The relevant part of his letter reads: “It is true that the experts, apparently by mistake, sent the summonses to the wrong address, but the court was not aware of this and that is why it ordered that she should be escorted to the examination [by the police]. There are no grounds on which to conclude that the court’s decision was wrong, but there can be no doubt that it was based on a wrong premise [nie ma zatem podstaw do przyjęcia, że postępowanie sądu było błędne, natomiast niewątpliwie opierało się na błędnych przesłankach].” 19. On 22 September 2008 the applicant requested the Poznań Regional Prosecutor to institute a criminal investigation in order to identify the persons responsible for her mother’s arrest which, in her opinion, had led to her suicide. She submitted that her mother had already tried to commit suicide in June 2007; that at the material time her mental condition had been precarious; and that the psychiatrists had sent the summonses to the wrong address despite the fact that the correct address had been available in the file. The judge had also failed to check whether the summonses had been sent to the correct address and whether they had been duly served on her. As a result, she had been arrested by the police in the early hours of 30 November. Her neighbours had told the applicant that during the arrest her mother had been crying. The applicant submitted that her mother had been an elderly, fragile person on the brink of a nervous breakdown and that the manner in which the case had been handled had driven her to commit suicide. 20. On 13 October 2008 the request was forwarded to the Gostyń District Prosecutor. 21. On 18 November 2008 the Gostyń District Prosecutor refused to institute an investigation, having examined the case under Articles 231 and 151 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 31-33 below). It was confirmed that the summonses to attend the psychiatric examination had twice been sent to the wrong address and had never been served on the applicant’s mother. The prosecutor was of the view that the court could not be held responsible for that error. It had not known the defendant’s correct address as the entire case file had already been forwarded to the experts at that time. The applicant’s submission that there was a causal link between the defendant’s arrest on 30 November 2007 and her suicide two days later was too categorical. There were no grounds on which to accept that the prosecuting authorities, the police or the court had failed to perform their duties properly or that the applicant’s mother had been driven to suicide as a result of such failure. 22. The written grounds of that decision did not refer to any evidence other than the file of the criminal case against the applicant’s mother. 23. The applicant appealed. She argued that her mother had suffered from depression caused by the transaction she considered fraudulent and that the authorities had been well aware of this. The court had relied on her earlier attempt to commit suicide when ordering the psychiatric examination. Appropriate regard had not been had to the fact that she was psychologically fragile. The authorities had failed to conduct the criminal case against her properly. No steps had been taken by the court to establish her correct address, although it had been available in the case file, in order to serve the summonses correctly. As a result of that failure, her mother had been arrested on 30 November 2007. The arrest had been tremendously traumatic for her. In the applicant’s opinion, the fact that her mother had committed suicide just after the examination was proof that the opinion prepared by the experts after her death to the effect that she was fit to stand trial was worthless. 24. On 13 March 2009 the Leszno District Court examined the appeal. The applicant did not attend the hearing. In a decision rendered on the same day the District Court dismissed the appeal. The relevant parts of the written grounds of this decision, numbering one-and a half page read as follows: “The appellant’s submission that there was a well-founded suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed could not be shared [by the court] in respect of: - the prosecutor, because ... he had a right to draw up a bill of indictment within fourteen days of the investigation being closed and he did so in the present case; - the judge conducting the proceedings, as he was entitled to appoint psychiatrists to the case with a view to checking whether the defendant could stand trial and to order that the defendant be taken to the psychiatric examination under police escort; he did so as he had been informed in writing that the defendant had twice failed to comply with summonses; - the experts in so far as they failed to foresee that [the applicant’s mother] would make another suicide attempt, this time a successful one, as they gave their opinion in accordance with their best knowledge and conscience; ... It is true that the police escort order given by the court failed to take into consideration that the experts had sent the summonses to the wrong address, but the court could not know that, given that at the time the case file had already been forwarded to the experts. This, however, cannot change the assessment of the events from the point of view of criminal responsibility, in particular as to the presence of a causal link between the [applicant’s mother] being taken to the examination by police escort and her subsequent attempt to commit suicide.” 25. Subsequently the applicant requested the Regional Agent for Disciplinary Matters (Okręgowy Rzecznik Odpowiedzialności Zawodowej) of the Wielkopolska Chamber of Physicians (Izba Lekarska) to institute disciplinary proceedings against the psychiatrists. By a decision of 18 December 2009 the Agent discontinued the investigation, having questioned the psychiatrists. He referred to the fact that the service confirmation slips sent to the applicant’s mother had not been served on the psychiatrists. This suggested that the summonses had been properly served on her. As she had failed to comply with the summonses, they had no choice but to inform the court accordingly. The defendant had subsequently been arrested by the police for the purposes of the examination. The psychiatrists had explained that the defendant’s conduct during the examination was not such as to justify her immediate psychiatric internment. Their opinion had therefore been well-founded and they had no case to answer. 26. The applicant appealed. She reiterated that information about her mother’s accurate address had been in the case-file which the psychiatrists had had at their disposal. They had failed to act diligently by establishing her address correctly. They were aware of her earlier attempt to commit suicide but still they had found her able to stand trial. She reiterated that the arrest and taking her to the clinic under the police escort were traumatising and dishonourable for her mother who felt belittled thereby in the eyes of her friends and neighbours. 27. By a decision of 6 February 2010 the Regional Court for Disciplinary Matters of the Wielkopolska Region (Okręgowy Sąd Lekarski), sitting in camera, upheld the contested decision. It was of the view that the fact that the psychiatrists had sent the summonses to the wrong address amounted to a formal shortcoming, but it did not have an impact on or had not caused the later tragic events. Similarly, in so far as the applicant had complained about her mother’s arrest by the police, this could not be held against the doctors. The arrest had been ordered by the court in the context of the criminal proceedings, not by the doctors. It was further stated that the psychiatric opinion drawn up by the two psychiatrists was correct, and the diagnosis they had made not open to criticism. 28. Article 151 of the Criminal Code reads: “Whoever by persuasion or by rendering assistance induces a human being to take his or her life shall be subject to the penalty of the deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 months and 5 years.” 29. Article 231 of that Code provides: “§ 1. A public official who, exceeding his authority or failing to perform his or her duty, acts to the detriment of a public or individual interest, shall be subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for up to 3 years. § 2. If the perpetrator commits the act specified in § 1 with the purpose of obtaining financial or personal gain, he or she shall be subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for a term of between 1 and 10 years. § 3. If the perpetrator of the act specified in § 1 above acts unintentionally and causes substantial damage, he or she shall be subject to a fine or restriction of personal liberty or deprivation of liberty for a period not exceeding 2 years.“ 30. The Supreme Court, in a decision of 25 February 2003 (WK 3003), held that only a public official acting intentionally and with intent to act to the detriment of the victim could be charged with the offence stipulated in Article 231 § 1 of the Criminal Code.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
119,001-158207,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,SHUMEYEV AND OTHERS v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska,"1. The applicants are Russian nationals living in various regions of the Russian Federation. The numbers and dates of lodging of their applications, and their full names, dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the Appendix. 2. , may be summarised as follows. 3. On various dates between 2005 and 2011 the police received information, in each of the applicants’ cases, implicating the applicants in drug-dealing. On the basis of that information, the police decided to carry out an undercover operation in the form of a test purchase of drugs from the applicants by undercover agents. 4. In all four cases, the police invited two randomly chosen attesting witnesses to observe the progress of the undercover operation. The attesting witnesses confirmed in their pre-trial depositions that the undercover agents had been searched prior to the test purchase and that they had bought controlled substances from the applicants with the banknotes marked and supplied by the police. They also attested that after the test purchase the police had searched the applicants or their premises, and seized and sealed controlled substances found on the applicants and other evidence that had been gathered. 5. The police also documented each step of the undercover operations. In particular, they drew up records of personal inspections of undercover agents, examinations of banknotes, test purchases, personal search and crime scene inspections. 6. The applicants were criminally prosecuted for drug-related offences under the Russian legislation in force. The undercover agents and police officers who had participated in test purchases of drugs testified during the trial, and as participants in the criminal proceedings, the applicants were able to question them. They were also able to submit various motions, present arguments in their defence and lodge objections. The attesting witnesses summoned by the prosecution were sought for but they failed to appear for various reasons, and the national courts read out their pre-trial statements regarding the investigative measures and admitted them as evidence despite the applicants’ objections. The procedural records drawn up by the police were also admitted as evidence by the courts. The contents of the pre-trial depositions of the attesting witnesses were identical to the relevant police records. 7. The applicants appealed against the judgments convicting them, submitting, inter alia, that their convictions had been unfair due to their inability to examine the attesting witnesses. The judgments were, however, upheld on appeal and became final. 8. Article 7 § 1 of the CCP (as in force at the material time) provided that the court, prosecution and investigators could not apply laws in breach of the provisions of the CCP. 9. Article 7 § 3 further provided that if the court, prosecution or investigators breached the provisions of the CCP in the course of criminal proceedings, evidence obtained as a result of such breach would be rendered inadmissible. 10. Chapter II of the CCP contained two different provisions governing the participation of witnesses and attesting witnesses in the criminal proceedings. 11. Article 56 provided that, “1. A witness (свидетель) is a person who may have knowledge of facts relevant to the investigation and resolution of a criminal case and who is subpoenaed to testify.” ... 7. If a witness fails to appear for no valid reason, his or her appearance may be enforced.” 12. Article 60 provided that, “An attesting witness (“понятой”) is a person disinterested in the outcome of the criminal case who is invited by an investigator to attest to an investigative measure being carried out and also to its substance, progress and results. Minors who are involved in a criminal case and their close relatives and relatives, and also investigators, cannot act as attesting witnesses.” 13. Article 164 of the CCP stipulated that body searches, searches of premises, seizure of evidence and other investigative measures had to be carried out by order of the investigators. It further required the recording of all investigative measures carried out. 14. Article 166 of the CCP established that all participants in investigative measures should receive a record thereof. They had to be informed of their right to make amendments and clarifications to the record and have them noted in it. Their remarks should be acknowledged and signed by the persons making them. 15. Article 170 of the CCP required at least two attesting witnesses to be present during, inter alia, the inspection of objects relevant to the criminal case, body searches, searches of premises and seizure of evidence. 16. Article 38 provided for admitting into evidence the records of investigative measures and trial records if they complied with the requirements of the CCP. 17. Article 75 provided that evidence obtained in breach of the provisions of the CCP would be deemed inadmissible. It further provided that inadmissible evidence would have no legal force and could not be relied on as grounds for criminal charges or for proving any of the circumstances for which evidence is required in criminal proceedings. 18. Article 89 prohibited the use of the results of a criminal investigation if they failed to satisfy the rules of evidence laid down in the CCP. 19. Article 217 and Article 219 stipulated the investigator’s obligation to examine and rule on motions submitted by the defendant after the review of materials of the criminal case, and to inform the defendant of his right to appeal against an adverse decision on his motion. 20. Article 235 provided that parties to a criminal case could request a trial court to exclude certain evidence. As a general rule, the burden of proof would be on the party which submitted a motion to exclude evidence, except where a defendant sought to exclude evidence obtained in violation of the provisions of the CCP, in which case the prosecution would have to provide evidence to the contrary. 21. Article 303 made it a crime for investigators, prosecutors and defence attorneys to forge evidence.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicants, Mr S.N. (“the first applicant”) and Mr T.D. (“the second applicant”), are two Russian nationals, who were born in 1977 and 1972 respectively and live in Moscow. The President of the Section decided that their names should not be disclosed (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of the Court). The Chamber also decided not to notify the Government of the Russian Federation of the present application on the grounds that Article 36 § 1 of the Convention did not apply in the circumstances of the present case (see I v. Sweden, no. 61204/09, §§ 40-46, 5 September 2013). 2. The applicants were represented before the Court by Ms C. Kruger and Mr O. Rode, lawyers practising in Strasbourg and Riga respectively. The Latvian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs K. Līce. 3. The applicants complained, in particular, that their expulsion to the Russian Federation had put them at risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention, and that they did not have effective remedies in that regard. They also complained under Article 8 of the Convention about interference with their family life and absence of procedural safeguards in that regard. 4. On 6 February 2014 the above-mentioned complaints were communicated to the Government. 5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6. The applicants were born in what is now the Chechen Republic in the Russian Federation. The first applicant moved to Latvia in 1997 and has lived there ever since, on the basis of regularly renewed residence permits. In 2002 he was granted a permanent residence permit, which was renewed in 2007 and 2012. The second applicant moved to Latvia in 2002 and has lived there subsequently, on the basis of regularly renewed residence permits. 7. On 26 July 2012 the Latvian Minister of Interior adopted decisions to include the applicants in the list of aliens prohibited from entering and remaining in Latvia and the Schengen Area (hereinafter “the blacklist”) for an indeterminate period of time. These decisions were taken on the basis of a report by the Constitution Protection Bureau, one of the Latvian intelligence services (Satversmes aizsardzības birojs – hereinafter “the SAB”), submitted on 9 July and amended on 20 July 2012. The SAB had informed the Minister of Interior that both applicants had been engaging in criminal activity and planning to commit a serious crime, and hence posed a threat to national security and public order and safety. The part relating to national security grounds was identical in both decisions and stated: “The SAB indicated that the information obtained attests to [the applicant’s] criminal activity in a leading role within an organised criminal group. Similarly, it is apparent from the information provided by the SAB that [the applicant] is planning to commit a serious or especially serious crime which may have irreversible consequences on national security. As a consequence [the applicant] in his activity [is] a threat to public order and national security.” 8. The applicants were not made aware of the SAB’s report. 9. The decision concerning the first applicant pointed to the fact that he was married to a Russian national. It was therefore concluded that he would not encounter any obstacles in meeting his spouse outside Latvia. 10. In the decision concerning the second applicant it was noted that he was married to a Latvian national. His former wife (a Russian national) and their minor child were also residing in Latvia. The decision went on to state that an interference with the second applicant’s right to respect for his private and family life was justified, taking into account, among other things, that during the nine years he had resided in Latvia “he had not learned the [State language], which [had] clearly obstructed his integration into society”. It was also pointed out that he had moved to Latvia when he was over eighteen, which meant that his ties to his native country had not disappeared. With regard to him having an opportunity to meet his young son, the decision stated that he had already agreed in 2002, while still residing in Russia, that the child would reside with his mother in Latvia. It was therefore concluded that he “would not be entirely deprived of opportunities to meet [his] son” in Russia. The interference with his family life with his spouse, a Latvian national, was held to be “commensurate with the interests of the society”. 11. Both decisions mentioned that under section 61(8) of the Immigration Law, an appeal could be lodged with the Prosecutor General’s Office. The decisions became effective on the day they were signed, 26 July 2012, and were sent to the applicants’ declared addresses in Riga. On 3 August 2012 they were expelled from Latvia (see paragraph 23 below). 12. On 3 August 2012 the applicants, through their legal representative, applied to the Administrative Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court to challenge the Minister of Interior’s decision to put their names on the blacklist. On 7 and 9 August 2012 the Senate refused to accept the applicants’ complaints for lack of jurisdiction, indicating that such reviews fell within the competence of the Prosecutor General if the decision had been adopted “on the basis of information obtained as a result of intelligence or counterintelligence”. The decisions also referred to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 6 December 2004 (see paragraph 53 below) which said that the prosecutor’s review as such did not infringe the right of access to court. The Senate’s decision was final. 13. On 20 August 2012 the applicants’ legal representative appealed to the Prosecutor General asking, inter alia, that the decision to put them on the blacklist be revoked and that he be given access to the SAB’s report of 9 and 20 July 2012, which had formed the basis of the Minister of Interior’s decision. On five occasions the appeals were amended to include, inter alia, the allegations that in 1998 the applicants had collaborated with the Latvian State security services in a hostage liberation operation in the Chechen Republic. Later the appeal was amended to include the second applicant’s allegation that subsequently he had refused to cooperate with a SAB officer in relation to certain activities of the leaders of the Chechen community in Latvia, and therefore the expulsion had been instigated in revenge for that. 14. In a reply of 24 September 2012 the Prosecutor General dismissed the request for access to the requested documents. He noted that the possibility to familiarise oneself with information containing State secrets, if necessary with the assistance of specially authorised representatives, as provided in section 65³ of the Immigration Law (see paragraph 51 below), applied only to administrative court proceedings. The Prosecutor General in his reply also stated: “... By envisaging in section 61(8) of the Immigration Law that an appeal against a decision the Minister of Interior adopted on the basis of information obtained in the course of intelligence or counterintelligence activities carried out by a State security institution could be lodged with the Prosecutor General [but] not a court, the legislator wished especially to protect information obtained in the course of intelligence or counterintelligence activities; [granting] access to such information to persons not possessing special permission ... could seriously infringe the work of the State security institutions ... thus seriously impairing national security.” 15. In a final decision of 23 November 2012 the Prosecutor General reformulated the Minister of Interior’s decision of 26 July 2012 (see paragraph 7 above). The part relating to national security grounds was identical in his decisions relating to both applicants and stated: “Having familiarised myself with the results of the review carried out by the Prosecutor [General’s Office] and the information provided in the conclusions and supporting documents, [I] find that the SAB, as a competent State institution, had grounds to consider that [the applicant] had a role in an organised criminal group and [was] one of its leaders, [had] committed or [was] planning to commit a serious or especially serious crime, and [that his] presence in Latvia was a threat to public order and national security as confirmed by the information [obtained by the SAB in the course of counterintelligence activities], which I have verified and examined. Nevertheless, when adopting a decision to include [someone] in the list of aliens prohibited from entering the Republic of Latvia, the Minister must assess whether the behaviour of the foreigner and the nature and scope of information held by the competent institution is sufficient to establish any of the ... conditions set out in section 61(1) of the Immigration law. Having examined the information held by the SAB, [I] consider that [the information] is not sufficient to establish the conditions set out in section 61(1)(1) and (3), [namely] that [the applicant is] acting in an anti-governmental or criminal organisation or [has] a role in such an organisation, and has carried out or is planning to commit a serious or particularly serious crime. At the same time, the nature and scope of the SAB information obtained in the course of counterintelligence activities clearly attest to [the fact] that [the applicant’s] activity is a threat to Latvian national security and public order and safety, as well as a threat to the national security of the States in the Schengen [Area]. The condition set out in section 61(1)(2) has therefore been established, which serves as a basis for the adopted decision to include [the applicant] in the list of aliens prohibited from entering the Republic of Latvia.” 16. The Prosecutor General also dismissed the applicants’ fear that they could be exposed to ill-treatment in Russia due to their alleged involvement in the hostage liberation in 1998, as that involvement remained unconfirmed. In particular, the witnesses questioned had provided controversial submissions, which did not correspond to the testimony of other witnesses, including the statements obtained from the hostages liberated during the operation. In examining the allegations about the risk of ill-treatment after expulsion, the information the Prosecutor General’s Office had obtained from the Border Guard Service and the applicants’ relatives confirmed that on numerous occasions between January 2010 and July 2012 the applicants had entered the Russian Federation, including the Chechen Republic. 17. In relation to the complaint of unlawful activity by a SAB officer, the Prosecutor General noted that the meeting between the SAB officer and the second applicant had been recorded in accordance with the law, and that the second applicant’s allegations were ill-founded. 18. Subsequently, in the light of the Prosecutor General’s decision to reformulate the basis on which the applicants’ names had been put on the blacklist, on 22 August 2013 their legal representative wrote to the Minister of Interior and director of the SAB asking for a review of the decisions to include them in the list. 19. On 25 September 2013 the applicants’ representative received a response from the director of the SAB, stating that his request of 22 August 2013 did not refer to any new circumstances which could serve as a basis for amending or revoking their report to the Minister of Interior in July 2012 (see paragraph 7 above). On 10 October 2013 the Minister of Interior gave a similar reply to the applicants’ representative. 20. In a letter sent to the Court on 21 October 2013 the applicants’ representative brought to the Court’s attention the following: “... [I]n April 2013 the applicants were informed that in an unofficial conversation with a certain high-ranking police officer, [a staff member of the SAB] had stipulated that he would “take care” of any potential complaints the applicants might submit to the Court, and certain politicians would make sure the complaints were not successful. ... The applicants considered this information irrelevant before the above mentioned official information [the Government’s letter] was received.” They further drew the Court’s attention to two questions, the first being how the SAB became aware of their application to the Court, and the second how the application influenced the decisions of the SAB and Minister of Interior. 21. The authorities apprehended the first and second applicants on 31 July and 2 August 2012 respectively. They were both placed in a State Police temporary detention facility. The first applicant met one of his lawyers on the day of his detention, and the other one the following day. The second applicant met his lawyer on the day of his detention. 22. On 2 August 2012 the acting chief of the Riga branch of the State Border Guard Service adopted decisions to expel the applicants from Latvia and to deport them to the Russian Federation. The reason was that the applicants constituted a threat to national security, public order or safety under section 51 paragraph 2 part 4 of the Immigration Law (see paragraph 47 below). The decisions indicated that it was possible to lodge an appeal without suspensive effect to the chief of the Border Guard Service. On the same day both applicants were made aware of the respective decisions. They both appealed (see paragraph 26 below). 23. On the morning of 3 August 2012 the applicants were taken to the Russian border and expelled from Latvia. 24. That afternoon one of the legal representatives sent a fax to, inter alia, the Border Guard Service, asking the applicants not to be expelled to the Russian Federation “because they are possibly agents of the Security Police and their expulsion to the receiving State puts them under threat and they could be subjected to torture”. 25. According to the applicants’ initial submissions to the Court, “five days after their expulsion to the Russian Federation” they were summoned by Chechen police and were questioned about their role in the hostage liberation operation in 1998 before being beaten up. The case file contains an identical certificate for each applicant issued by a Chechen hospital, confirming that on 10 August 2012 both applicants had been found to have concussion, a brain injury and multiple bruises and scratches. The applicants alleged that as a result of what had happened they had had to flee the Chechen Republic and were now hiding in the Russian Federation. 26. The applicants’ representative submitted appeals against the expulsion orders of 2 August 2012 (see paragraph 22 above), complaining, inter alia, of the authorities’ failure to strike a fair balance between the right to respect for their family life and the alleged threat to national security, as required under Article 8 of the Convention. The chief of the Border Guard Service dismissed the first and second applicant’s complaints on 23 and 27 August 2012 respectively. 27. In their appeal to the Administrative District Court of 7 September 2012 the applicants also said that before adopting the impugned decision the Border Guard Service had not heard them, meaning they had not been able to provide information on the possible threat they would face at the hands of the security services after their expulsion to the Russian Federation. 28. On 7 May 2014 the Administrative District Court, in two judgments, upheld the impugned decisions in relation to both applicants. The Administrative District Court established that prior to expulsion the applicants had not approached the Latvian authorities with allegations concerning the risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if expelled to the Russian Federation. It also noted that on 2 August 2012 both applicants were informed that the expulsion would be carried out the following day, on 3 August 2012. On the same day one of the applicants submitted a request to the chief of the Border Guard Service asking to be given several impounded goods in custody, but no other requests were made. Both applicants met their lawyers after being detained. 29. The court referred to its well-established case-law and noted that the decisions to put the applicants’ names on the blacklist on national security grounds had been reviewed and upheld by the Prosecutor General, so neither the Border Guard Service nor the administrative court were competent to review the Minister of Interior’s decision. 30. By addressing the complaint that in adopting the impugned expulsion decision of 2 August 2012 the applicants were not heard, the court noted that even if it constituted a minor procedural shortcoming, the lack of hearing of the applicants and witnesses could not have an effect on the outcome of the case. In particular, the court noted that the review of the Minister of Interior’s decision fell outside the scope of the present administrative proceedings. Any information the applicants might have submitted in relation to the adoption of the above decision could not have any effect on the content of the contested decision of 2 August 2012 to expel the applicants. Moreover, the applicants were not prevented, with the assistance of their legal representatives, from communicating to the Border Guard Service any information regarding the alleged interference the impugned decision would have on their family life. 31. The judgments also stated that there were no obstacles for the applicants to enjoy their family life in the Russian Federation. Nor were there any special circumstances to the effect that the family members could not join them outside Latvia. The wife of the first applicant was a Russian national and she would not have any restrictions to travel to the Russian Federation, whereas the second applicant would not encounter any obstacles in meeting outside Latvia his child whose mother was a Russian national. 32. On 3 September 2015 (in relation to the first applicant) and on 5 February 2015 (in relation to the second applicant) the Administrative Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court refused to initiate cassation proceedings. The Senate stated, in particular, that the contested expulsion orders were a final stage in the proceedings initiated by the decisions of the Minister of Interior. The Senate further noted that it had been made aware of the decisions of the Minister of Interior and the letters of SAB on which the decision was based, and of the decisions of the Prosecutor General. Review of the above decisions fell outside the scope of the present proceedings, but these decisions attested to the lawful basis and legitimate aim of the applicants’ expulsion. 33. On the question of the proportionality of the interference with the applicants’ family lives, the Senate upheld the lower court’s findings and noted that the applicants had not advanced any arguments indicating any restrictions to enjoy their family life outside Latvia. In relation to the second applicant, the Senate noted that in 2002, while still residing in Russia, he had agreed that the child would reside with the applicant’s former wife, a Russian national, in Latvia. The Senate also stated that both applicants had entered the Republic of Latvia as adults and throughout their stay in Latvia they had not learned Latvian, which showed that their ties with the expelling State were not strong. 34. On 1 August 2012 the acting director of the Office of Citizenship and Migration Affairs decided to withdraw the first applicant’s residence permit and refused to grant the second applicant a temporary residence permit because of their inclusion in the blacklist. 35. The applicants’ legal representative lodged appeals against the above-mentioned decisions on 22 and 28 August 2012 respectively. Two levels of administrative courts dismissed the complaints. 36. On 14 August 2015, the Administrative Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court refused to initiate cassation proceedings in relation to the second applicant. The Senate noted, in particular, that the authorities had concluded that the applicant posed a threat to national security, and that depriving him of residence permit served a legitimate aim. The Senate also did not see any reasons why the applicant could not meet his minor child outside the territory of Latvia, especially in the circumstances where already in 2002, while still residing in Russia, the applicant had agreed that the child would reside with his mother in Latvia. 37. The cassation complaint submitted by the first applicant is pending examination before the Senate. 38. On 15 September 2014 the Ombudsman of the Republic of Latvia issued an opinion following the applicants’ complaint concerning their expulsion proceedings. The Ombudsman did not find any violation of Articles 3 or 8 of the Convention. In relation to the review procedure, the opinion stated: “A decision to include someone in the list of foreigners prohibited from entering the Republic of Latvia is adopted by the Senate of the Supreme Court in the form of oral proceedings by a special panel of judges to whom special access to [State] secrets is granted, as well as interpreters, recordkeepers and other court officials to whom such access is also granted. No prima facie legitimate purpose can currently be established for dividing the appellate procedure into the competence of two other institutions, the Supreme Court and Prosecutor General; no further analysis shall follow, however, as the assessment of this issue is not the subject of this case.” 39. The final conclusions, as far as relevant, stated: “Firstly, a breach of Article 13 of the [Convention] and [Article 1 § 1 (a)] of Protocol No. 7 to the [Convention] has been committed in respect of the expelled S.N. and T.D. Once a State holds that not only the Supreme Court but also the Prosecutor General has the right to review a decision to include someone in the list of foreigners prohibited from entering the State, observation of the adversarial principle has to be ensured in the latter process, similar to the process guaranteed in Supreme Court [review cases]. If an alien seeks to contest the decision, defence counsel must be provided who has access to classified information, [State] secrets, and the right to familiarise [himself] with the evidence on which the expulsion of foreigners is based, so that a complaint may be filed for the protection of the interests of the expelled foreigner.” 40. The relevant Articles of the Latvian Constitution (Satversme) provide: “Everyone has the right to defend his or her rights and lawful interests in a fair court. Everyone shall be presumed innocent until his or her guilt has been established in accordance with the law. Everyone whose rights are violated without justification has the right to commensurate compensation. Everyone has the right to the assistance of counsel.” “Everyone has the right to inviolability of his or her private life, home and correspondence.” “The rights of persons set out [in Article 96] ... of the Constitution may be subject to restrictions in the circumstances provided for by law in order to protect the rights of other people, the democratic structure of the State and public safety, welfare and morals. On the basis of the conditions set forth in this Article, restrictions may also be imposed on the expression of religious beliefs.” 41. Section 18 paragraph 1 part 4 of the Constitutional Court Law provides that an application to the Constitutional Court regarding the initiation of constitutional proceedings must, among other criteria, contain legal reasoning (juridiskais pamatojums). Pursuant to section 19², in addition to the above-mentioned requirements, an individual constitutional complaint must include justification as to how the applicant’s fundamental rights as defined in the Constitution have been infringed upon, and show that all available remedies have been used. 42. Section 20 sets out the grounds on which the panel examining the constitutional complaint may refuse to initiate a case. When examining a constitutional complaint (application) the panel may also refuse to initiate a case where the legal reasoning included in the complaint is evidently insufficient to satisfy the claim (section 20(6)). 43. In a decision of 14 March 2014 (application no. 29/2014) on the question of institution of constitutional proceedings, the panel of the Constitutional Court stated that the legal reasoning of a complaint is an analysis of the content of a legal provision, an explanation as to how the impugned provision interferes with the applicant’s fundamental rights, an assessment of the lawfulness of the procedure according to which the impugned provision has been adopted, and an assessment of the legal aim and proportionality of the interference. 44. On 7 May 2014 (application no. 61/2014) on the question of institution of constitutional proceedings, the panel of the Constitutional Court stated that in support of an allegation that the impugned provision does not comply with the provisions of the Constitution, the applicant must indicate in the legal reasoning (1) whether the contested provision contains any restriction of rights, (2) whether this restriction is prescribed by law and has a legitimate aim and (3) whether the restriction is proportionate to the aim pursued. 45. Under section 46(5) of the Immigration Law, once a decision to include an alien in a blacklist has been adopted by the Minister of Interior and if the person is on Latvian territory, the chief of the Border Guard Service or someone authorised by him must adopt a decision to expel (lēmums par piespiedu izraidīšanu) the person concerned within eight days, to be counted from the date it was established that he or she was on Latvian territory. 46. Section 50(1) provides that an alien has the right to appeal against an expulsion decision within seven days. Under section 50(3), an appeal against a decision taken pursuant to section 46 does not have suspensive effect. 47. Section 51 of the Immigration Law lists the circumstances in which the State Border Guard Service may detain an alien. Paragraph 2 part 4 at the material time, provided that an alien could be detained on grounds of information that a person poses threats to national security, public order or safety. 48. Under section 61(1)(1) the Minister of Interior may decide to include someone who is not a Latvian citizen or a “non-citizen” in a blacklist if, among other things, “competent State institutions have reason to believe” (“kompetentām valsts iestādēm ir pamats uzskatīt”) that he or she (i) is a member of an anti-governmental or criminal organisation or has a role in such an organisation, (ii) is a threat to national security or public order and safety, or (iii) may hinder the pre-trial investigation or work of the law enforcement authorities in investigating the crimes upon arriving in Latvia (section 61(1)(2)), or (iv) has carried out or is planning to carry out a serious or particularly serious crime (section 61(1)(3)). 49. In relation to the review, section 61 at the material time provided as follows: (6) A alien in respect of whom a decision has been taken in accordance with [61(1)] has the right, within one month of becoming acquainted with the decision, to appeal to the Administrative Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Latvia. Submission of an application to the court may not suspend implementation of the decision referred to [in section 61(1)]. The applicant does not have the right to request the court to suspend the operation of such a decision. ... (8) If the decision referred to in section 61(1) has been taken on the basis of information acquired by State security institutions as a result of intelligence or counterintelligence operations, it may be appealed to the Prosecutor General’s Office, whose decision shall be final.” 50. Section 61(6) came into effect on 1 July 2005 and it was introduced after the Constitutional Court had declared unconstitutional a provision providing that decisions adopted by the Minister of Interior were not amenable to review (see paragraph 53 below). Section 61(8) about the Prosecutor General’s Office review came into effect on 10 February 2006. 51. In May 2006 section 653(3) came into force, which provides that if the applicant’s representative does not have a special permit for access to State secrets, the court must appoint as the applicant’s representative for that part of the proceedings an advocate practising in Latvia who has been issued such a permit. If the applicant does not consent to such representation, the court must examine the information associated with official secrets without involving the applicant or his or her representative. 52. Section 63(7) provides that in cases where the period of an entry ban exceeds three years, the institution which has adopted the decision to include an alien in the blacklist shall review it every three years from the date it was taken. 53. The relevant parts of the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 6 December 2004 (case no. 2004-14-01) on the compliance of section 61(6) of the Immigration Law with Article 92 of the Constitution read: “10. In conformity with section 61 of the Immigration Law, the opinion of the competent State authorities (in this particular case, the opinion of the State security institution) lies at the basis of the Minister’s [of the Interior] decision. Someone who challenges his or her inclusion in the [blacklist] does not agree, as a matter of course, with the facts expressed in the decision, which are often connected with issues of State security. When reviewing such claims, the use of confidential material may be unavoidable. Even though in cases connected with national security the possibility of legal examination is limited, this does not mean that the national authorities can be free from effective judicial control in all cases, whenever they choose to assert that national security and terrorism are involved (see ECHR Judgment in case “Chahal v. the United Kingdom” § 131). ... If the violation of a person’s rights is the result of the decision of a competent institution (State security institution), on the basis of which the Minister of Interior has adopted the decision, one can agree with the opinion voiced in the letter by the Ministry of the Interior that the person has the possibility of protecting his rights by lodging a complaint to the prosecutor under the procedure set out in Article 6 of the State Security Institutions Law. As regards an assessment of the activity of the State security institution in this case, the State has secured a protection remedy for the individual, which is as effective as possible in circumstances where the issue is connected with State security and, possibly, the use of confidential information. The Constitutional Court in its judgments has already pointed out that “in Latvia the Prosecutor [General’s Office] may be regarded as an effective and available means of protection, because the status and role of the prosecutor in supervising the law secures an independent and impartial review of cases in compliance with Article 13 of the Convention” (see the Constitutional Court October 11, 2004 Judgment in case no. 2004-06-01; April 23, 2003 Judgment in case no.2002-20-0103) Thus, as regards the assessment of the competent (State security) institution, the State has secured effective protection under Article 13 of the Convention. ... 15. ... The fact that the Minister of Interior’s decision might be connected with interests of State security does not prevent the State from establishing a procedure under which the judicial institutions in certain cases, and under a definite procedure, may acquaint themselves with the material connected with State security. The institution concerned may even decide to present the required amount of documents separately if [they] do not include State secrets. Article 6 of the Convention, if read together with Article 5, also provides such a solution by, among other things, a special positive duty upon States, in accordance with which they have to create institutional infrastructures necessary for the implementation of a fair court, and enact legal norms which guarantee that the procedure is fair and impartial. ... The impugned provision thus does not ensure realisation of a person’s right to a fair court as guaranteed by Article 92 of the Satversme”. 54. On 7 October 2010 the Constitutional Court (case no. 2010-01-01) noted that international human rights norms and the practice of their application serve as a means of interpretation at constitutional law level to determine the contents and scope of fundamental rights and the principle of the law-governed State, as far as it does not lead to a decrease or limitation of the fundamental rights included in the Constitution. 55. On 6 November 2014 the Constitutional Court (case no. 2013-20-03) held that the contested provision of the domestic law did not comply with the Constitution and was repealed with effect from 1 May 2015. As regards the individual applicant, in order for him to have the possibility to require repeated assessment of the proportionality of the measure adopted against him, the contested legal provision was repealed with effect as of the date of its adoption.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
121,001-180084,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2017,ANCHEV v. BULGARIA,3,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Erik Møse;Mārtiņš Mits;Nona Tsotsoria;Rousseva;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"1. The applicant in both applications, Mr Haralambi Borisov Anchev, is a Bulgarian national who was born in 1953 and lives in Sofia. He was represented by Ms A. Gavrilova-Ancheva, a lawyer practising in Sofia. 2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms V. Hristova of the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and established by the Court of its own motion on the basis of publicly available documents, may be summarised as follows. 4. Like other former communist countries in Eastern Europe, at the time of the communist regime (1944-89) Bulgaria had a security service, called State Security, one of whose main tasks was to supress dissent against the regime. It chiefly operated by keeping people seen as dangerous to the regime under surveillance, which it carried out through a network of secret collaborators. At first, State Security was part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In 1965 it was brought under the direct supervision of the Council of Ministers, but in the period 1968-69 was again placed under the umbrella of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. It was also directly accountable to the Bulgarian Communist Party’s Central Committee, Politburo and Secretary General. 5. Between 1969 and 1990, when it closed (see paragraph 9 below), State Security had six directorates. The first dealt with intelligence; the second with counterintelligence; the third with military counterintelligence; the fourth with technical and economic espionage; the fifth with security and protection; and the sixth with “the fight against ideological diversion and anti-State acts”. In addition to those directorates, there were five standalone departments: investigation; external surveillance and research; records and archiving; encryption and communications; and military and combat readiness. 6. After 1975 State Security’s sixth directorate was composed of seven departments. The first was tasked with “the fight against ideological diversion and other subversive activities of the enemy through the intelligentsia”; the second with “the fight against ideological diversion and other subversive activities” among graduate and postgraduate students; the third with countering “subversive activities of the enemy” in religious organisations; the fourth with supressing nationalist activities by various ethnic minorities; and the fifth with countering the activities of Bulgarian emigrant organisations. The sixth department’s task was thwarting “antiState activities”. The seventh department dealt with information and analysis. In 1981 a new department was added, the new seventh department, which made the former seventh department the eighth department. It was tasked with “combatting terrorism, anonymous enemy activities and escapes” and with tracking down “State criminals”. In 1985 a new “T” (terror) unit was spun off from that department. 7. By section 7(1) of a secret 1978 Instruction by the Minister of Internal Affairs, which remained in effect until the closing of the organisation in early 1990 (see paragraph 9 below), State Security kept nine types of files. They fell into two broad categories. The first consisted of seven types of files relating to targets: “operative inquiry files”, “operative development files”, “operative tracing files”, “operative surveillance files”, “operative files”, “object development files” and “literal files”. The second category comprised two types of files relating to resources used by State Security: “secret collaborator files” and “secret meeting premises files”. 8. Reference data about the files were recorded in several card indexes and registration journals (sections 50 to 59 of the 1978 Instruction). Index no. 4 contained cards relating to active and retired collaborators, people groomed for recruitment, and people whose recruitment had been aborted. Index no. 5 contained similar cards to those in Index no. 4, but was ordered according to operative pseudonym, and Index no. 6 contained cards relating to active collaborators arranged according to department, as well as secret premises (section 50(2)). The other indexes contained cards relating to surveillance targets: dissidents, emigrants, “anti-State” groups, and so on (section 15(2)). 9. In January 1990, shortly after the fall of the communist regime in late 1989, the Government decided to close State Security. 10. At about the same time, noting the “complicated political and operative situation”, on 25 January 1990 the Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs in charge of the Ministry’s archive secretly proposed that a number of the files kept by State Security be destroyed. The Minister approved the proposal the same day. A few days later, on 5 February 1990, the Deputy Minister secretly proposed that steps be taken to speed up the files’ destruction. The Minister approved the proposal the same day. 11. According to an inventory drawn up by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 1994, that covert operation resulted in the destruction of 134,102 of the total 331,995 files kept by State Security. 12. The applicant is a lawyer. He has been a member of the Sofia Bar Association since 1980. From 1992 to 1995 he was the Secretary General of the Supreme Bar Council, and from 1994 to 1996 he was the Secretary General of the Central Electoral Commission. From 1996 to 1997 he was the liquidator of an insolvent bank. For a few months in 1997 he was the Minister of Justice and Deputy Prime Minister in a caretaker government. 13. Government ministers must be checked for affiliation with the security services of the communist regime under section 3(1) of the statute that lies at the heart of this case, the Access to and Disclosure of Documents and Exposure of the Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to State Security and the Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian People’s Army Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act” – see paragraphs 44, 45 and 47 below). Following an investigation into government ministers, on 12 February 2008 the Commission administering the Act (see paragraphs 53-56 below) issued a decision exposing the applicant as having been affiliated with the seventh department of the sixth directorate of State Security (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above) between 1982 and 1990. It also put the decision on its website. The Commission relied on a registration form, an entry in the registration journal, an index card, a report on the applicant’s recruitment, and a proposal to discharge him, the latter two documents having been drawn up by the officer who, according to the records, had been the applicant’s handler. 14. Two days later, on 14 February 2008 the applicant was able to consult these documents. Shortly after that he published them on his website. 15. He did not seek judicial review of the Commission’s decision. According to him, this would have been pointless, as this was not an effective remedy. 16. Two days later, on 16 February 2008 a weekly newspaper published information about the applicant’s exposure. A couple of days after that, on 18 February 2008 the applicant wrote an article in a daily newspaper in which, among other things, he denied having been a collaborator, said that he had been unaware of the existence of a file relating to him, and contested the truthfulness of the documents in that file, pointing out that all of them emanated from officers of State Security and that those officers might have put false information in them out of a wish to fill their recruitment quotas or for other ulterior motives. He also stated that he had not been particularly impressed or upset by the publication of the information about him. 17. Following an investigation into members of the Supreme Bar Council – who must be checked for affiliation with the former security services under section 3(2) of the 2006 Act (see paragraph 49 below) – on 24 February 2014 the Commission issued another decision exposing the applicant as having been affiliated with the seventh department of the sixth directorate of State Security (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above). It relied on the same documents as those serving as a basis for the 2008 decision (see paragraph 13 above), plus two index cards. 18. This time, the applicant sought judicial review. He argued that the Commission should only have exposed him if, having carefully examined the former security services’ records, it had been satisfied that they were sufficiently reliable and attested to actual collaboration on his part, which was not the case. The Sofia City Administrative Court allowed the claim and quashed the Commission’s decision. It agreed with the applicant’s argument, and noted that the only records showing that he had been affiliated with the former security services were documents drawn up by the officer who had allegedly been his handler, entries in the registration journals, and index cards. Since those did not clearly prove that the applicant had actually collaborated with those services, the decision to expose him had been unlawful (реш. № 541 от 02.02.2015 г. по адм. д. № 2971/2014 г., АС-София-град). 19. The Commission appealed on points of law. In a judgment of 17 June 2016 (реш. № 7361 от 17.06.2016 г. по адм. д. № 4068/2015 г., ВАС, III о.), the Supreme Administrative Court reversed the lower court’s judgment. It noted that the Commission’s first decision to expose the applicant in 2008 had not been challenged by him and had become final, and that the applicant’s claim for judicial review of the third decision to expose him in June 2014 had already been dismissed in a final judgment (see paragraphs 13 above and 22 below). Those facts were crucial for the determination of the case, and in the light of those facts it had to be concluded that the exposure at issue was lawful. 20. Following an investigation into the board members of private companies which had bought parts of State-owned companies – who must be checked for affiliation with the former security services under section 3(2) of the 2006 Act, as amended in 2012 (see paragraph 50 below) – on 4 June 2014 the Commission issued a third decision exposing the applicant as having been affiliated with the seventh department of the sixth directorate of State Security (see paragraphs 5 and 6 above). It relied on the same documents as those serving as a basis for the February 2014 decision (see paragraph 17 above). 21. The applicant again sought judicial review. He raised the same arguments as those that he had made with respect to the Commission’s second decision in relation to him (see paragraph 18 above). This time, however, the Sofia City Administrative Court upheld the Commission’s decision. Relying on the Supreme Administrative Court’s prevailing caselaw under section 25(3) of the 2006 Act and the Constitutional Court’s decision to uphold the constitutionality of that provision (see paragraphs 71 and 76 below), the Sofia City Administrative Court held that the Commission did not have to check whether the applicant had in fact collaborated or consented to be recruited as a collaborator, but had been bound to expose him, as it had found records relating to him. It was immaterial whether or not there was enough evidence to show that he had actually collaborated (реш. № 1947 от 24.03.2015 г. по адм. д. № 6086/2014 г., АС-София-град). 22. The applicant appealed on points of law, reiterating his arguments. In a judgment of 11 May 2016 (реш. № 5566 от 11.05.2016 г. по адм. д. № 5343/2015 г., ВАС, III о.), the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment, fully agreeing with its reasoning. It likewise held that since the 2006 Act did not provide for the exposure of the actual activities of those concerned, but simply the exposure of their affiliation with the former security services, the Commission did not have to assess the nature or extent of their collaboration or establish their actual activities. 23. Since 1998 the applicant has been a member of the supervisory board of Bulgarian Holding Company AD, an investment company listed on the alternative-market segment of the Bulgarian Stock Exchange. He is still a member of the Sofia Bar Association. 24. In November 2009 the applicant published an article in a daily newspaper in which he commented on the rules governing the use of firearms by the police. 25. In January 2014 he was appointed a member of the civil society council assisting a parliamentary committee tasked with drafting a new Electoral Code. In February 2014 he gave a radio interview on his work there. 26. Between 2014 and 2015 he took part in several television and radio programmes where he was invited, in his capacity as former Minister of Justice, to comment on problems in the judicial system and possible ways of reforming it. In May 2015 he co-signed an open letter in which a number of lawyers and public figures expressed their indignation at the work of the Supreme Judicial Council. 27. Article 5 § 4 of the 1991 Constitution provides that international treaties which have been ratified and promulgated and have come into force with respect to Bulgaria are part of domestic law and take precedence over any conflicting provisions of domestic legislation. 28. Article 32 of the Constitution enshrines the right to protection of one’s private life and some related rights in the following terms: “1. Citizens’ private life shall be inviolable. All shall be entitled to protection against unlawful interferences with their private or family life and against infringements of their honour, dignity or good name. 2. No one may be placed under surveillance, photographed, filmed, recorded, or subjected to any similar action without his or her knowledge or in spite of his or her express disagreement, save in the cases provided for by law.” 29. In defamation cases, the courts have held that infringement of the rights set out in Article 32 of the Constitution is a tort (see реш. № 358 от 23.02.2015 г. по в. гр. д. № 3719/2014 г., САС, and реш. № 1376 от 07.01.2016 г. по в. гр. д. № 1173/2016 г., САС). The Supreme Court of Cassation has done the same in a case concerning unauthorised filming (see реш. № 878 от 16.06.2006 г. по гр. д. № 721/2005 г., ВКС, IV-Б г. о.). 30. Article 41 of the Constitution enshrines the right to information in the following terms: “1. Everyone shall have the right to seek, receive and impart information. The exercise of that right may not be directed against the rights and the good name of other citizens or against national security, public order, public health or morals. 2. Citizens shall have the right to information from State bodies or agencies on any matter of legitimate interest to them, unless the information is a State secret or a secret protected by law or affects the rights of others.” 31. Article 56 of the Constitution enshrines the right to a remedy in the following terms: “Every citizen shall have the right to a remedy if his or her rights or legitimate interests have been infringed or threatened. ...” 32. Article 120 of the Constitution provides for judicial review of administrative action in the following terms: “1. The courts shall review the lawfulness of the administrative authorities’ decisions and actions. 2. Citizens and legal persons may seek judicial review of any administrative decision which affects them, save as expressly specified by statute.” 33. In 1992 members of parliament put forward several bills providing for the lustration of ex-communist cadres and collaborators of the former security services. Four bills seeking to bar ex-communist cadres from holding any public office did not reach a plenary vote. Three more limited ones were enacted: paragraph 9 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Banks and Credit Act 1992, which barred such persons from holding executive positions in commercial banks for five years; a new section 10a of the Pensions Act 1957, which provided that time served in an executive position in the former Bulgarian Communist Party and its related outfits would not count for retirement pension purposes; and an Act Provisionally Laying Down Certain Additional Requirements for the Management of Scientific Organisations 1992, which barred ex-communist cadres and collaborators of the former security services from holding posts in academia. All three provisions were immediately challenged before the Constitutional Court. The court struck down the first and the second on the basis that they were discriminatory and interfered disproportionately with the fundamental rights to choose one’s profession and receive a pension (see реш. № 8 от 27.07.1992 г. по к. д. № 7/1992 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 62/1992 г., and реш. № 11 от 29.07.1992 г. по к. д. № 18/1992 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 64/1992 г.). The third Act survived the constitutional challenge (see реш. № 1 от 11.02.1993 г. по к. д. № 32/1992 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 14/1993 г.), but was repealed approximately two years later in March 1995. 34. Lustration initiatives were resumed in 1998, with the enactment of paragraph 1(1) of the additional provisions of the Administration Act 1998, which barred ex-communist cadres and staff members or collaborators of the former security services from holding executive posts in State administration for five years, and sections 26(3) and 59(2)(3) of the Radio and Television Act 1998, which barred such persons from working in the media regulatory authority and in management at Bulgarian National Radio and Bulgarian National Television. The first provision was declared unconstitutional, chiefly on the basis that it was discriminatory and interfered disproportionately with the fundamental right to work (see реш. № 2 от 21.01.1999 г. по к. д. № 33/1998 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 8/1999 г.). The two others survived an initial constitutional challenge (see реш. № 10 от 25.06.1999 г. по к. д. № 36/1998 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 60/1999 г.), but were struck down by the Constitutional Court fourteen years later in 2013, again chiefly on the basis that they were discriminatory and interfered disproportionately with the right to work (see реш. № 8 от 11.10.2013 г. по к. д. № 6/2013 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 91/2013 г.). 35. A third wave of lustration laws were passed between 2009 and 2011. The first lustration law, Rule 3 of the Standing Rules of Parliament, barred members of parliament who had been collaborators of the former security services from serving in Parliament’s presidency, from acting as presidents or deputy presidents of parliamentary committees or members of certain key committees, and from becoming members of international parliamentary delegations. The second law, sections 27(4), 31(3) and 33(3) of the Diplomatic Service Act 2007, as amended in 2011, barred such collaborators from serving as ambassadors, deputy ambassadors or general consuls, or from holding certain executive posts in State administration. The third law, section 11(1)(8) of the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency Act 2011, barred collaborators from holding the posts of general director, deputy general director or secretary general of that agency. Between 2009 and 2012 all those provisions were declared unconstitutional, on the same basis as that declared previously: that they were discriminatory and interfered disproportionately with the fundamental right to work (see реш. № 11 от 03.12.2009 г. по к. д. № 13/2009 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 98/2009 г.; реш. № 11 от 22.11.2011 г. по к. д. № 8/2011 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 95/2011 г.; and реш. № 11 от 02.10.2012 г. по к. д. № 1/2012 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 78/2012 г.). 36. On 23 August 1990 the Seventh Grand National Assembly (“the Assembly”) – the first democratically elected legislature after the fall of the communist regime in 1989 – resolved to set up an ad hoc committee to inquire whether any Assembly members had been collaborators of the regime’s security services. The committee, called the Tambuev Committee after its chairman, submitted its report to the Bureau of the Assembly on 17 April 1991. However, following a leak in the press of the names of about thirty Assembly members who had allegedly been such collaborators, a scandal erupted in the Assembly on 23 April 1991, and the committee was disbanded without completing its work. 37. In a decision of 13 October 1994 (обн., ДВ, бр. 86/1994 г.), Parliament decreed that information about agents of the former security services relating to the period before 13 October 1991 was not a State secret. However, in the absence of legal provisions specifying the manner in which this information could be made public, the decision did not lead to any specific steps. 38. In August 1997 Parliament passed an Act – the Access to Documents of the Former State Security and the Former Intelligence Department of the General Staff Act – providing that some State officials (the President and Vice-President, ministers and deputy ministers, members of parliament, Constitutional Court judges, members of the Supreme Judicial Council, judges of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court, prosecutors in the Chief Prosecutor’s Office, regional governors, heads of some executive and regulatory agencies, and the directors general of Bulgarian National Television, Bulgarian National Radio and the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency) and the executives of State-owned banks and insurance companies were to be checked for affiliation with the former security services. By section 4, the check was to be carried out by a commission chaired by the Minister of Internal Affairs and comprising the heads of the various intelligence services. 39. Fifty-two members of parliament almost immediately challenged the constitutionality of the entire Act. In September 1997 the Constitutional Court dismissed the bulk of the application, but, despite the dissent of four judges, struck down the provisions concerning the investigations into the President, the Vice-President and Constitutional Court judges. It held that it would be unconstitutional for them to be checked for affiliation by a commission controlled by the executive. Despite the dissent of four judges, the court also struck down the provision concerning people who only featured in the former security services’ secondary records – the card indexes and registration journals (see paragraph 8 above). It held that these records were not sufficient proof that those people had collaborated, and that this could only be proved with documents emanating from the alleged collaborators themselves. Although the files’ partial destruction had restricted the efforts to uncover such documents, the difficulty was not insurmountable, and the burden to do so fell on the State (see реш. № 10 от 22.09.1997 г. по к. д. № 14/1997 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 89/1997 г.). It later transpired that three judges from the majority had themselves been collaborators (see paragraph 68 below); they had not declared that when dealing with the case. 40. In February 2001 the Act was amended, with Parliament taking on board the criticisms levelled by the Constitutional Court: the amendment made the commission administering the Act independent from the executive, and specifically stated that the card indexes and registration journals (see paragraph 8 above) were not categorical proof of affiliation. The amended Act survived a further constitutional challenge (see реш. № 14 от 30.05.2001 г. по к. д. № 7/2001 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 52/2001 г.), but was repealed just over a year later in April 2002. A constitutional challenge to the repealing Act, chiefly based on its alleged discrepancy with the constitutional right to information, was dismissed (see реш. № 3 от 25.09.2002 г. по к. д. № 11/2002 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 94/2002 г.). 41. In 1999 Parliament added a new subsection 4 to section 42 of the Local Elections Act 1995. It provided that all mayoral and municipal councillor candidates were to be checked for affiliation to the former security services in the manner provided for by the 1997 Act (see paragraph 38 above), and that the results of the investigation were to be given to the political parties or coalitions which had nominated them, so that they could decide whether to withdraw the nominations. The Constitutional Court unanimously dismissed a challenge to that provision, holding that it did not strip candidates of the right to run for office, but simply enabled the parties or coalitions which had put the candidates forward to see whether to keep them on the ballot (see реш. № 12 от 24.08.1999 г. по к. д. № 12/1999 г., обн. ДВ, бр. 77/1999 г.). The Central Electoral Commission for Local Elections instructed local electoral commissions to make the results of such investigations public, but the Supreme Administrative Court quashed that decision, holding that it impermissibly extended the purview of section 42(4) (see реш. № 4830 от 21.09.1999 г. по адм. д. № 5749/ 1999 г., ВАС, III о.). The provision was repealed in April 2002, alongside the 1997 Act (see paragraph 40 above). 42. Paragraph 6 of the transitional and concluding provisions of the Election of Members of Parliament Act 2001 provided for a similar investigation into parliamentary candidates, but only at the request of the political parties or coalitions which had nominated them. By section 48(5) of the Act, a party or a coalition could withdraw a candidate revealed by such an investigation to have been a collaborator of the former security services. The Central Electoral Commission directed that the results of the investigation could be provided by the Commission under the 1997 Act (see paragraph 40 above) by means of a full report or a simple certificate. The Supreme Administrative Court quashed that decision in part, holding that the only lawful means of establishing that someone had been a collaborator was via a full report, not a certificate (see реш. № 4270 от 13.06.2001 г. по адм. д. № 4623/2001 г., ВАС, III о.). Both provisions were repealed in April 2002, alongside the 1997 Act (see paragraph 40 above). 43. A new section 3(3) of the 2001 Act, added in 2005, provided that the Security of Information Commission – the body overseeing the storage and use of classified information – had to check whether parliamentary candidates were affiliated to the former security services, and give the results of the investigation to the leadership of the political party or coalition which had nominated the candidates. The provision was repealed in 2009. 44. In 2006, shortly before Bulgaria’s accession to the European Union, there was fresh impetus to reveal the identities of staff members and collaborators of the former security services. In May, June and August members of parliament introduced three separate bills to this effect. In August Parliament’s Standing Committee on Internal Security and Public Order and its Standing Committee on Defence reviewed the bills and, by large majorities, proposed that they be examined jointly and approved at first reading. Later that same month Parliament debated the bills, which were supported during the discussion by all major parliamentary parties, and approved them at first reading. The first bill was approved by 114 votes to 53, with 28 abstentions, the second by 167 votes to 11, with 18 abstentions, and the third by 186 votes to 10, with 5 abstentions. The second reading, at which stage the bills had been consolidated into one, took place several months later in late November and early December. Nearly all provisions of the consolidated bill were adopted almost unanimously. In particular, the provisions which laid down the sources of information that could be used to establish affiliation with the former security services (see paragraphs 60 and 62 below) were adopted by 124 votes to nil, with 3 abstentions, following a lengthy debate and the rejection of two alternative proposals. 45. The Act, whose full name was the Access to and Disclosure of Documents and Exposure of the Affiliation of Bulgarian Citizens to State Security and the Intelligence Services of the Bulgarian People’s Army Act, was published in the State Gazette on 19 December 2006 and came into effect on 23 December 2006. 46. By sections 1(2) and 26(1)(2) of the Act (the latter provision’s wording was amended in 2012), all those who have held specified “public office” or engaged in a specified “public activity” at any point since 10 November 1989 – the date on which the communist regime in Bulgaria is deemed to have fallen – must be checked for affiliation with the former security services, and exposed if found to have been so affiliated. By section 26(1)(3), everyone who accedes to “public office” or engages in a “public activity” in the future must also be checked for affiliation. 47. The list of the types of “public office” – similar to that in the 1997 Act (see paragraph 38 above), but more extensive – was set out in section 3(1). At first, it comprised: (a) the President and Vice-President; (b) members of parliament and of the European Parliament; (c) the Prime Minister, his or her deputies, ministers, and deputy ministers; (d) judges of the Constitutional Court; (e) the Ombudsperson, the Deputy Ombudsperson and the secretary general of the Ombudsperson’s administration; (f) chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of State agencies, and members of State commissions; (g) judges, prosecutors and investigators; (h) members of the Supreme Judicial Council; (i) members of the Commission for the Protection of Competition; (j) members of the Commission for the Regulation of Communications; (k) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons, members of the management and supervisory boards, directors, deputy directors, and heads of unit and sector of the Bulgarian National Bank, the Court of Auditors, the National Social Security Institute, and the National Health Insurance Fund; (l) executive directors of executive agencies and heads of State institutions created by statute or by decision of the Council of Ministers, as well as their deputies; (m) members of the management and supervisory boards of the Privatisation Agency and the Agency for PostPrivatisation Control; (n) secretaries general, general directors, deputy general directors, main directors, deputy main directors, directors, deputy directors, heads of local police departments, heads of unit, and heads of sector of the Ministry of Internal Affairs; (o) heads and deputy heads of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, and heads and deputy heads of staff of the different types of troops; (p) directors, deputy directors, directorate directors, heads of unit and heads of sector of military intelligence, the military police and the military counterintelligence services of the Ministry of Defence, the National Intelligence Service, and the National Protection Service; (q) regional governors and their deputies; (r) mayors and their deputies, as well as secretaries of municipalities and municipal councillors; (s) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons, general directors, members of the management and supervisory boards, members, and heads of directorates, units or sectors of the Electronic Media Council, Bulgarian National Television, Bulgarian National Radio, and the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency; (t) members of the central electoral commissions; (u) the head of the National Centre for Sociological Surveys attached to Parliament; (w) members of the political cabinets of the Prime Minister, his or her deputies, or ministers; (x) ambassadors, consuls general and deputy heads of diplomatic missions; (y) secretaries general, directors, heads of unit and sector of Parliament administration, as well as staff members attached to Parliament’s standing committees; (z) secretaries general, head of cabinet, secretaries, and heads of unit and sector of the President’s administration; (aa) secretaries general, directors general, deputy directors general, main directors, deputy main directors, directors, deputy directors, and heads of unit and sector in the central and territorial administration of the executive power; (ab) members of the Supreme Attestation Commission; (ac) people employed by the European Union, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, or any other international organisation of which Bulgaria is member or in whose activities it takes part; and (ad) people holding office to which they were appointed by the President, Parliament, the Council of Ministers, or the Prime Minister. 48. In 2009, 2010 and 2011 the list underwent modifications related to the changes in structure of the authorities concerned. In 2012 Parliament expanded it to include (a) investigating police, military police and customs officers, and (b) members of the scientific councils of scientific organisations, such as universities. In early 2017 Parliament expanded the list further, to include (a) municipal ombudspersons and their deputies; (b) lay judges; (c) secretaries general and directorate directors of the Commission for the Protection of Competition and the Commission for the Regulation of Communications; (d) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons, members, secretaries general and directorate directors of the Commission for Financial Control and the Commission for Energy and Water Regulation; (e) chief architects of municipalities and local mayoral deputies; and (f) members of the regional and municipal electoral commissions. 49. The list of “public activities” was set out in section 3(2). At first, it comprised (a) owners, directors, deputy directors, editors-in-chief, deputy editors-in-chief, members of editorial boards, political commentators, presenters and newspaper or electronic media columnists, as well as owners and managers of sociological agencies, advertising firms or public-relations firms; (b) the chairperson, deputy chairpersons, main scientific secretary, members of the management boards, directors, deputy directors, and scientific secretaries of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and its scientific institutes and other independent units; (c) rectors and deans, their deputies, heads of branches and departments, and heads of cathedrae (faculty subdivisions) of State-owned and private colleges and universities, as well as heads and deputy heads of schools; (d) managers, executive directors, and members of the management and supervisory boards of health-care institutions, as well as chairpersons, deputy chairpersons, secretaries general and members of the management boards of the Bulgarian Doctors’ Union and the Bulgarian Dentists’ Union, as well as the chairperson, the director general and the deputy directors general of the Bulgarian Red Cross; (e) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons and registered members of the management and supervisory bodies of political parties and coalitions, trade unions, employers’ unions, and other not-for-profit legal entities; (f) heads and members of the management bodies of religious communities; (g) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons and members of the Supreme Bar Council, the Bar’s Supreme Supervisory Council, and the Bar’s Supreme Disciplinary Court; (h) chairpersons and members of the management and supervisory bodies of national sport organisations and the Bulgarian Olympic Committee; (i) members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies and representatives of banks, insurance and reinsurance companies, stock exchanges, companies organising unofficial securities markets, investment brokers, and investment companies; (j) sole traders, as well as members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies and representatives of companies engaging in gambling; (k) sole traders, as well as members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies and representatives of companies providing long-distance communication services; (l) sole traders, as well as the members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies and representatives of companies which are radio or television operators; and (m) persons authorised to act as the liquidators of insolvent companies or banks. 50. In 2012 Parliament expanded this list to include (a) media company managers; (b) founders of not-for-profit legal entities; (c) members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies of privatised State and municipal companies, members of the managing or supervisory bodies of private companies or sole traders which have acquired shares in, or parts of, such privatised companies, and members of privatisation funds; and (d) some categories of defaulting debtors of banks which had become insolvent in the 1990s. In early 2017 Parliament expanded the list further, to include (a) chairpersons and deputy chairpersons of the general meetings of universities and faculties; (b) chairpersons, deputy chairpersons and members of Bar councils, Bar budget councils and Bar disciplinary courts; (c) chairpersons and members of the management and supervisory bodies of licensed sport organisations; (d) individuals who have acquired shares in, or parts of, privatised companies; (e) special administrators of banks appointed by the Bulgarian National Bank; (f) members of the management, controlling and supervisory bodies of State and municipal companies, companies in which the State or a municipality holds half or more of the shares, and subsidiary companies in which such companies hold half or more of the shares; and (g) various categories of suspected insider debtors of insolvent banks. 51. By section 26(1)(1), anyone who has been registered as a candidate for the office of President, Vice-President, member of parliament, member of the European Parliament, mayor or municipal councillor must likewise be checked for affiliation with the former security services. By section 26(1)(5), added in early 2017, anyone who becomes a candidate for any type of “public office” must likewise be checked. 52. By section 27(4), added in 2011, anyone recommended for an order or a medal must be checked as well, and by section 11(6) of the Orders and Medals Act 2003, also added in 2011, any recommendation that the President confer an order or a medal must be accompanied by the results of that check. The 2010 private member’s bill which led to the enactment of those provisions initially proposed to bar anyone found to have been affiliated with the former security services from receiving an order or a medal. It was, however, modified by Parliament between the first and second reading to provide for a mere check for such affiliation. 53. By section 4(1) and section 29(1) and (2), the check is carried out by a special Commission. 54. This Commission has nine members elected by Parliament for five years (section 5(1)). Before being voted on, candidates must undergo a security check and be heard by Parliament’s Standing Committee on Internal Security and Public Order (section 6(2) to (6)). Parliament then votes on each candidature, and elects the Commission’s chairperson, deputy chairperson and secretary (section 6(7)). 55. No political party may have a majority in the Commission (section 5(2)). Only people enjoying public trust and authority are eligible to serve on it (section 5(3)). During their term, the Commission’s members may not hold elected office or be in a management position in a political party or professional organisation (section 5(4) and (6)). They may only be removed from office before the end of their term if they cease to fulfil the eligibility requirements (section 5(7)). 56. The first Commission members were elected by Parliament in April 2007. After the expiry of their initial five-year term of office, in May 2012 four of the original nine members were re-elected by Parliament for another five-year term, and five new members were elected. 57. By sections 1(3) and 11, the Commission was given custody of the archives of the former security services, which were to be centralised under its control. By sections 16-20 and paragraph 8 of the Act’s transitional and concluding provisions, all public authorities which had records of those services in their custody had to turn them over to the Commission within eight months of the Act’s entry into force. The Commission’s task was then to go through those records and check whether the people who had held any of the types of “public office” set out in section 3(1) of the Act, or engaged in any of the “public activities” set out in section 3(2) (see paragraphs 47-50 above), featured in them (section 9(2)). 58. The question of whether someone was to be exposed as having been affiliated with the former security services was governed by sections 24 and 25. By section 24, as originally enacted, those who had been staff members or collaborators of those services were to be considered as affiliated to them. Section 25, as originally enacted, provided that this was to be established on the basis of documents contained in the services’ records. It then set out, in subsections 1, 2 and 3, the types of documents capable of proving service as, respectively, a regular staff member, a supernumerary staff member, or a collaborator. By paragraph 1(1) of the Act’s additional provisions, a “document” is any recorded information, regardless of the medium used to record the information, and includes information in automated and complex information systems and databases. 59. In December 2012, in the wake of an unsuccessful constitutional challenge to section 25(3), the subsection concerning collaborators (see paragraphs 74-76 below), Parliament deleted section 24 and moved part of it, in a slightly amended form, to section 25. The explanatory notes to the bill proposing this amendment said that it would clarify a point made by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 76 below) – that the Commission’s task was not to examine the real activities of those whom it checked for affiliation with the former security services, but simply to see whether a record of them being affiliated with those services existed. The amendment came into force on 1 January 2013. 60. By section 25(1) and (2), as worded since the December 2012 amendment, someone’s affiliation to the former security services as a regular or supernumerary staff member can be established on the basis of organisational charts, payrolls, or data in his or her personal file. 61. Paragraph 1(2) and (3) of the additional provisions define “regular staff members” as Bulgarian nationals formally employed by the former security services as operatives or investigators, and “supernumerary staff members” as Bulgarian nationals drafted in by those services to carry out tasks and assignments relating to their mandate. 62. By section 25(3), as worded since the December 2012 amendment, someone’s affiliation to the former security services as a collaborator can be established on the basis of: (a) handwritten or signed collaboration declarations; (b) handwritten surveillance reports; (c) remuneration documents; (d) documents handwritten or signed by the collaborator and contained in a surveillance file; (e) documents drawn up by the officer who was the collaborator’s handler; and (f) data about the collaborator in the registration journals, card indexes, records relating to the destruction of files, or other sources. 63. Paragraph 1(4) of the additional provisions defines “secret collaborators” as Bulgarian nationals who have covertly assisted the former security services as residents, agents, keepers of secret meeting premises, keepers of covert operative premises, trusted persons, or informers. All these categories were taken from the internal instructions of the former security services. 64. A Commission decision exposing staff members must set out their names, dates and places of birth, all documents pertaining to their career, the departments where they have worked, and the “public office” or “public activity” which they held or engaged in at the time of the investigation (section 29(2)(1)). 65. A Commission decision exposing collaborators must set out their names, dates and places of birth, the names of the officers who recruited them and acted as their handlers, the exact capacity in which they collaborated, their operative pseudonyms, the documents showing their affiliation, the time of their discharge, and the “public office” or “public activity” which they held or engaged in at the time of the investigation (section 29(2)(2)). By section 29(3), if information about someone is only found in the card indexes and registration journals (see paragraph 8 above), the lack of other data must specifically be mentioned in the Commission’s decision. 66. The Commission must notify those concerned of its findings and then, within seven days of completing the investigation, publish the findings on its website, and later in its bulletin (sections 26(3) and 29(4)). The individuals concerned must also be given, upon request, access to the documents in their personal and professional files (section 31(8)). Section 29(5), added in 2012, provides that the documents which have served as a basis for the Commission’s decision must likewise be published on its website. 67. Those born after 16 July 1973 are exempt from being checked (section 26(4)). Those who only collaborated before turning eighteen or who are dead at the time of the investigation are not to be exposed (section 30(1)(1) and (1)(2)). The same goes for those who, when notified of the discovery of information showing that they collaborated, withdraw their candidacy for office (section 30(1)(3)), unless they have already been formally registered as election candidates (section 30(2)). 68. The Commission gave its first decision on 24 April 2007. It has thus far checked more than 290,000 people and exposed more than 12,000 of them, including a President of the Republic, three judges in the Constitutional Court, more than 150 members of parliament, more than 100 government ministers, and a number of prominent politicians, journalists, lawyers, businessmen, academics and religious figures. Though some of those exposed have retreated from public life following their exposure, many continue to be active in politics, government, the media, academia and business. 69. By section 23, documents showing affiliation with the former security services may not be published or disclosed in any other way. Article 273 of the Criminal Code, added in 2006, makes such disclosure a criminal offence. 70. The Commission’s decision to expose someone is amenable to review by the Sofia City Administrative Court, whose judgment is, in turn, amenable to an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Administrative Court (sections 8(4), 29(6) (formerly 29(5)), and 31(8)). Although the Act is silent as to whether a claim for judicial review has suspensive effect, in practice it has no such effect, as the lodging of such a claim does not delay publication of the Commission’s decision, which is published on its website the day it is issued. 71. There are many cases in which those exposed have sought judicial review. The chief point of contention in most of them was whether the records on which the Commission had relied under section 25 of the Act (see paragraphs 60 and 62 above) to establish affiliation with the former security services were sufficiently probative. The usual argument of those exposed was that the available evidence did not show that they had really collaborated, but only that their names featured in the records. The Supreme Administrative Court has thus far decided more than a hundred such cases. With two isolated exceptions in January 2014 (реш. № 274 от 10.01.2014 г. по адм. д. № 14740/2012 г., ВАС, III о., and реш. № 725 от 21.01.2014 г. по адм. д. № 223/2013 г., ВАС, III о.), since 2008, when it started hearing applications for judicial review under the Act, it has consistently held that the Commission does not have to check whether the records show that someone has in fact collaborated, or whether the information in those records is rebutted by other evidence. Rather, the Commission must simply note the information, even if it features in only one record, and make it public, having no discretion in the matter. Its task is limited to documentary fact-finding and its decisions are purely declaratory. This is because the Act does not purport to sanction or lustrate staff members and collaborators of the former security services, but simply to reveal the available information about all publicly active people featuring in the records of those services as staff members or collaborators, with a view to restoring public confidence and preventing those people from being blackmailed (see, among many others, реш. № 13432 от 08.12.2008 г. по адм. д. № 9456/2008 г., ВАС, VII о.; реш. № 577 от 14.01.2009 г. по адм. д. № 13924/2008 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 460 от 13.01.2010 г. по адм. д. № 2155/2009 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 9838 от 01.07.2011 г. по адм. д. № 2878/2011 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 9426 от 29.06.2012 г. по адм. д. № 1131/2012 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 10489 от 10.07.2013 г. по адм. д. № 11654/2012 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 14636 от 07.11.2013 г. по адм. д. № 14799/2012 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 3656 от 17.03.2014 г. по адм. д. № 9785/2013 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 7537 от 23.06.2015 г. по адм. д. № 14875/2013 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 3071 от 17.03.2016 г. по адм. д. № 7208/2013 г., ВАС, III о.; and реш. № 6231 от 18.05.2017 г. по адм. д. № 3786/2016 г., ВАС, III о.). Even the second case in which the Supreme Administrative Court departed from this case-law in January 2014 was ultimately decided in line with the prevailing approach (see реш. № 3424 от 18.05.2015 г. по адм. д. № 838/2014 г., АС-София-град). 72. Attempts to mount indirect challenges to the Commission’s decisions by way of claims for declaratory judgment in the administrative and the civil courts have failed, on the basis that judicial review is the only possible remedy (see опр. № 13037 от 01.12.2008 г. по адм. д. № 7366/2008 г., ВАС, III о.; реш. № 9161 от 01.07.2010 г. по адм. д. № 16603/2009 г., ВАС, III о.; and опр. № 610 от 11.12.2013 г. по ч. гр. д. № 5127/2013 г., ВКС, I г. о.). 73. Nor is it possible to seek damages under section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act 1988, which provides for State liability for damage suffered as a result of unlawful administrative action, unless the Commission’s decision has been quashed (see опр. № 7760 от 02.06.2011 г. по адм. д. № 6323/2011 г., ВАС, III о.) or is void (see реш. № 9068 от 30.06.2010 г. по адм. д. № 7095/2009 г., ВАС, III о.). One case in which damages were awarded under that provision concerned an exposed person who had successfully challenged the Commission’s decision by way of judicial review, chiefly on the basis that he did not fall within the categories of people who were subject to exposure under the 2006 Act (see реш. № 3787 от 28.07.2011 г. по адм. д. № 5962/2010 г., АС-София-град, and реш. № 2715 от 25.02.2014 г. по адм. д. № 9786/2013 г., ВАС, III о.). In a case in which the Commission had wrongly exposed someone as affiliated with the former security services and then retracted its decision but not published the retraction on its website swiftly enough, that person was likewise able to obtain damages under section 1(1) of the 1988 Act (see реш. № 15591 от 25.11.2011 г. по адм. д. № 9902/2011 г., ВАС, III о.). 74. In December 2011 a panel of the Supreme Administrative Court acceded to an application by a claimant to refer section 25(3) of the Act (see paragraph 62 above) to the Constitutional Court (see опр. № 16199 от 09.12.2011 г. по адм. д. № 8189/2011 г., ВАС, III о.). 75. In early 2012 the Constitutional Court admitted the referral for examination, and invited several State authorities and non-governmental organisations to comment on the case (see опр. от 02.02.2012 г. по к. д. № 14/2011 г., КС). The Council of Ministers, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Commission, the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee, and the Access to Information Foundation availed themselves of this opportunity. All of them argued that section 25(3) was constitutional. 76. In a decision of 26 March 2012 (реш. № 4 от 26.03.2012 г. по к. д. № 14/2011 г., КС, обн., ДВ, бр. 28/2012 г.) the Constitutional Court unanimously found section 25(3) constitutional. It held: “... The [2006 Act] is a manifestation of the common will of all political parties in ... Parliament to ensure, as far as possible, the disclosure of all documents [of the former security services] and the exposure of all persons affiliated [to those services] who held or now hold public office, or who carried out or now carry out public activities within the meaning of this Act (section 3(1) and (2)). The Act was passed in response to the recommendations set out in the Declaration of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) of 8 July 1997, in Resolution 1096 (1996) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, on the measures to dismantle the heritage of former communist totalitarian systems, and in Recommendation No. R (2000) 13 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on a European Policy on Access to Archives, adopted by the Committee of Ministers on 31 October 2000. The Act seeks to regulate the manner in which the documents of the [former security services] from between 9 September 1944 and 16 July 1991 are to be accessed, disclosed, used and kept, and to expose the affiliation to [those services] of Bulgarian citizens holding public office or carrying out a public activity. By section 24 of the Act, such affiliation is to be exposed if the person concerned has acted as a regular staff member, a supernumerary staff member, or a secret collaborator of [those services]. Under section 24 of the Act, the fact is established on the basis of documents from the information sources, which are different for regular staff members, supernumerary staff members and secret collaborators, and have been set out respectively in subsections 1, 2 and 3 of section 25 of the Act. In accordance with the impugned section 25(3) of the Act, the fact under section 24 that someone has acted as a secret collaborator is to be established not only on the basis of documents which have been handwritten or signed by him or her, but also on the basis of the following documents contained in the information sources: ‘documents drawn up by the regular or supernumerary staff member who was the handler of [the person concerned], as well as information about the person in the reference records (registration journals and card indexes [see paragraph 8 above]), records relating to the destruction of information, or other information carriers’. According to a decision of the National Assembly [see paragraph 37 above], information about the organisation, methods and means used by State Security in its work, and information about its agents, as it relates to the period before 13 October 1991, is not a State secret ... Unlike the repealed [1997 Act, see paragraphs 38-40 above], the philosophy of the 2006 Act – which can be gleaned from its structure, the explanatory notes to the bills, and the parliamentary speeches made at the time of its enactment – was to lay open the documents of the [former security services], and expose all people under section 3 of the Act, except for those mentioned in sections 30(1) and 32(1). An important point that is not always fully appreciated is that the Act relates to public documents, access to which is free for [the people kept on file and researchers]. It follows that there are other ways to expose those affiliated to the [former security services] as collaborators, which means that it is fitting that their affiliation be ascertained by an independent State authority. The Act only provides for the exposure of the affiliation to the [former security services] of those mentioned in section 3, not the exposure of their real and specific activities for the benefit of those services. This is clear from the Act’s title, its subject matter (section 1(1) and (2)), the powers of the Commission (section 9(2)), the facts subject to proof (section 24), the mandatory establishment of affiliation to those services or the establishment in the framework of a preliminary investigation (sections 26(1) and 27(1)), and the contents of the Commission’s decision (section 29(1)). The legislature has used the term ‘affiliation’, which denotes someone’s position as part of the composition of something. The legislature has not empowered the Commission to make a judgment on those found to have been so affiliated on the basis of the available documents. The Commission does not assess who has acted in favour of national security, against terrorism, and so on, and who has supplied other types of information. The [referring court] does not challenge the Act’s philosophy or main tenets, but simply part of section 25(3), arguing that it is contrary to Articles 56 and 57 of the Constitution, without pointing to the specific paragraphs alleged to be infringed. Article 56 § 1 of the Constitution [see paragraph 31 above] enshrines the right to a remedy in cases in which someone’s rights or legitimate interests have been infringed or threatened. This right ... is personal, fundamental and universal (see ...). It is an independent constitutional right which is by its nature chiefly procedural, because it serves as a guarantee of the substantive fundamental rights and legitimate interests set out in the preceding constitutional provisions. Although the right to a remedy is fundamental and belongs to everyone, Article 56 of the Constitution usually operates in tandem with other constitutional provisions. [It] is infringed when another fundamental constitutional right or legitimate interest has been infringed or threatened. The [referring court] does not point to another constitutional right alleged to be infringed by the impugned statutory provision. So, the Constitutional Court, which cannot stray ... beyond the terms of the referral, but at the same time is not bound by the alleged grounds of incompatibility with the Constitution, must identify that other constitutional right on the basis of the reasons adduced in support of the referral. The referral does not spell out the part of Article 57 of the Constitution that the impugned statutory provision is alleged to offend against: paragraph 1, which proclaims the inalienability of fundamental rights; paragraph 2, which prohibits the abuse of rights, as well as their exercise to the detriment of the rights or legitimate interests of others; or paragraph 3, which governs the temporary restriction of rights. Based on the reasons for the referral, the Constitutional Court finds that the allegation is of an infringement of Article 57 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution, which set out rights supplementing certain other fundamental rights. The specific rights which can be infringed or threatened by section 25(3) of the Act in its impugned part are those under Article 32 of the Constitution – the right of defence against attacks on one’s dignity and good name, and the right to the inviolability of one’s personal data [see paragraph 28 above]. The Constitutional Court finds that the exposure of the objective fact that someone was affiliated to a State authority does not infringe the right to be free from interferences with one’s personal life or attacks against one’s dignity and good name. The activities of those who have collaborated with the [former security services] do not harm their good name, honour or dignity, as [this] court has already had occasion to point out ... The communication right to receive information under Article 41 § 1 of the Constitution [see paragraph 30 above] is a fundamental constitutional right. As [this] court has already held, the right to seek, receive and impart information under Article 41 § 1 of the Constitution belongs to all individuals and legal entities, and protects their interest in being informed. It applies to the press and all other media. On the other hand, Article 41 § 2 of the Constitution guarantees citizens access to information from State authorities or bodies on questions in which they have a legitimate interest (see ...). This right is not absolute, but nor is the right under Article 32 of the Constitution to the protection of one’s personal data [see paragraph 28 above]. Here, these two fundamental rights clash, but since they are not absolute, each of them can be limited in line with the principle of proportionality. To be constitutionally permissible, a statutory limitation of personality rights must not exceed what is required to ensure the exercise of the constitutional right under Article 41 § 1 to obtain information. The individual right to obtain information is extremely important to enable citizens to make an informed choice. At the same time, this right is not absolute either, and can be restricted in the circumstances set out in Article 41 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution: it cannot be directed against the rights or good name of other citizens, or against national security, public order, health or morals, and the information under paragraph 2 must not be a State secret or another secret protected by law, or infringe another’s rights. This court finds that the impugned part of section 25(3) of the Act is not unconstitutional, because it does not run against constitutional principles or specific constitutional provisions. It is not unconstitutional to establish someone’s affiliation to a community, authority, State body, organisation, and so on, except in cases in which there is a threat to national security. Nor is it unconstitutional for such affiliation to be established by a specific authority, in a manner provided for by law, on the basis of various types of documents which contain information. The legislature has decided to provide for an investigation into whether those who hold certain offices or carry out certain activities were affiliated to the [former security services]. The need for such an investigation is a question of expedience, and is to be decided by the legislature (see ...). The legislature enjoys a discretion not only to grant access to the documents of the [former security services], but also to choose the permissible modes of proof. Within its discretion, and in view of the destruction of a large number of the personal and work files of secret collaborators, Parliament has determined that affiliation to those services can be established on the basis of all kinds of documents from [the services’] archives, and at the same time it has laid down guarantees for the rights of persons affected by that. By paragraph 1(1) of the Act’s additional provisions, a ‘document’ is any written information, regardless of the medium used to record the information, including information in automated and complex information systems and databases. The impugned provision governs in part the manner in which affiliation is to be established on the basis of documents in the information sources. It sets out, by way of example and alternatively, the documents which, within the meaning of the Act, may be used to establish that someone has acted as a secret collaborator, and, in fine, permits this to be done on the basis of unspecified documents within the meaning of the Act. As a result of this legislative solution, affiliation to the [former security services] can be established not only on the basis of documents which emanate from the collaborator himself or herself (handwritten or signed collaboration declarations, handwritten reports, remuneration receipts, documents handwritten or signed by the collaborator and contained in the operative target surveillance files), but also on the basis of documents which do not emanate from the collaborator and do not contain his or her signature. The legislature provided for resort to those latter documents when the personal and work files of the collaborator had been destroyed, because it is generally known that the files of some of the secret collaborators were destroyed. By including these documents among the modes of proof of affiliation, the legislature sought to treat those who had collaborated with the [former security services] in the same way, and not to place those who had, for various reasons, had their files destroyed in a privileged position. It must also be borne in mind that those recruited as collaborators were not always required to make a written pledge (declaration) of collaboration, or a declaration of non-disclosure of their links and work with [the former security services] at the time of their discharge. By paragraphs 18 and 34 of Order No. 3900 of 11 November 1974 of the Minister of Internal Affairs, adduced in the course of these proceedings, agents were only required to make such declarations when this was deemed necessary in specific cases. The Act does not require the cumulative availability of a certain number or type of documents in order for someone to be established and exposed as affiliated to the [former security services]. On the contrary, the Act ascribes to all documents within the meaning of paragraph 1(1) of its additional provisions the quality of documents which can be used as proof of affiliation, and gives equal probative value to all of them. The Constitutional Court finds that the boundary between the two fundamental rights in collision – the right under Article 32 and that under Article 41 § 1 of the Constitution [see paragraphs 28 and 30 above] – has been set in a proportionate manner, because the Act lays down enough guarantees to protect the right to honour and dignity and the right to protection of personal data of those affected. Firstly, affiliation is established and exposed by a Commission, which is an independent State authority. It is independent, not only because section 4(1) of the Act proclaims it to be, but also owing to the way in which its members are elected under section 5(1) and (2) of the Act – by the National Assembly, at the proposal of the different parliamentary factions, and in a way ensuring that none of the parliamentary political parties has a majority. The Commission establishes affiliation on the basis of a centralised archive of the documents set out in section 1 of the Act. To this end, under section 16 of the Act, the authorities must package and turn over to the Commission their archive files and card indexes (section 17 of the Act). This prevents the documents from being hidden from view or forged, and ensures that the Commission will be able to comprehensively study, compare and analyse the information. The documents kept in the Commission’s centralised archive and used to establish affiliation to the [former security services] are public. The Act devotes considerable attention to the manner in which affiliation is established and exposed. The procedure before the Commission is set out in detail in the Act itself, not in statutory instruments. Not all of those who have collaborated with the [former security services] are to be exposed. The Act only provides for this for those who hold or have held specified public office, or engage or have engaged in a specified public activity. Only those holding public office or carrying out a public activity within the meaning of section 3 of the Act are affected by the interference with the right to protection of personal data, because ‘the State as a whole, as well as political figures and public officials, may be subjected to a higher level of public scrutiny than private persons’ (see ...). As a rule, the level of protection of the personal data of the persons under section 3 of the Act is much lower than in the case of other citizens. This is illustrated by the annual publication, in a special register, of data about their income, assets, bank accounts, receivables, and the declaration of other protected data, with a view to preventing conflicts of interest. The Act provides for a special guarantee for those whose affiliation is exposed [solely] because their names and pseudonyms feature in the card indexes or registration journals of the respective services. By section 29(3), although the Commission must expose them, it must also specifically mention that there is no data about them [in the other types of records] under section 25(3). The Act does not provide for any legal consequences for those whose affiliation to the [former security services] is exposed. Those whose affiliation is established are entitled to consult the documents contained in their personal and work files (section 31(8) of the Act). Lastly, those whose affiliation is established are entitled to judicial protection, which is why the Constitutional Court rejects the arguments in the referral that there is no right to a remedy. Unlike the repealed [1997 Act, see paragraphs 38-40 above], which did not provide for any judicial review of the decisions of the Commission under its section 4(1), but only objections before the Commission itself (section 4(3)), the [2006 Act] now in force expressly states in three places that the Commission’s decisions may be challenged by those affected, in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Administrative Procedure. The constitutional right to a remedy of those whose affiliation to the [former security services] is made public is governed by sections 8(4), 29(5) and 31(8) of the Act. They can challenge the Commission’s decisions before the relevant administrative court and then appeal on points of law against that court’s judgment to a three-member panel of the Supreme Administrative Court. Under section 4 of the Act, the Commission is a collective administrative body, and its decisions bear the hallmarks of individual administrative decisions. These decisions are acts which authenticate pre-existing rights and obligations, which means that they are declaratory administrative decisions (Article 21 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure). The administrative authorities issue declaratory and authenticating administrative decisions under many other statutes, and have no discretion in this, because there is only one lawful way for them to act. The manner in which an administrative authority takes a decision does not affect the right to a remedy of those concerned by that decision. [This] court does not agree with the ... argument that the Act is in effect being applied by the Commission, and that judicial review of the Commission’s decisions has been trimmed down to verification of whether it has arrived at those decisions by following the correct procedure. Laws are not applied by the administrative authorities alone. By Article 119 § 1 of the Constitution, justice is administered by the Supreme Administrative Court, and by Article 120 § 1 of the Constitution the courts review the lawfulness of the administrative authorities’ decisions and actions [see paragraph 32 above]. If, as argued [here], the courts only scrutinise the procedure whereby the Commission arrives at its decisions, then they are falling short of the paramount requirement of administrative procedure, set out in Article 146 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, that all ... aspects of the lawfulness of administrative decisions be examined by a court of its own motion, without any prompting by the parties (Article 168 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure). In judicial review proceedings, claimants may support their allegations by all types of evidence available under the Code of Civil Procedure (Article 171 §§ 1 and 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure). The possibilities for abuse in the creation of documents of the [former security services] were limited by the rules governing [their] activities, as evident from Order No. 3900 of 11 November 1974 of the Minister of Internal Affairs, and Instruction No. I-20 of 20 January 1978 [see paragraph 7 above]. Under those instruments, secret collaborators had operative target surveillance files and personal and work files – recorded in a common register, where entries were regulated – and unique personal registration numbers. All secret collaborators were entered into a central database, consisting of card indexes nos. 4 and 5 and statistical card index no. 6, all of which were kept in line with the relevant rules [see paragraph 8 above]. In many cases, when the information supplied had no operative value, or when the secret collaborator had not drawn up a written account, the results of a meeting were noted down by the [handling officer] in a report (paragraph 26 of the Order). The use of the records provided for by the Act in cases in which personal and work files have been destroyed does not affect the right to a remedy of those exposed as affiliated to the [former security services], or infringe the Constitution, as the matter boils down to conducting one’s defence before the courts correctly. As required under Article 7 of the Constitution, those wrongly exposed as affiliated to the [former security services] can also assert their rights by way of claims [for damages] under section 1(1) of the State and Municipalities Liability for Damage Act [1988]. They can also protect their rights under [the defamation provisions] of the Criminal Code. This court therefore finds that the right to a remedy of those found to be affiliated to the [former security services] has not been breached, which means that the impugned part of section 25(3) of the Act does not run counter to Articles 56 or 57 of the Constitution. The third argument in the referral is that claimants in cases in which the Supreme Administrative Court is asked to review decisions of the Commission keep relying on [the Constitutional Court’s decision which struck down parts of the 1997 Act – see paragraph 39 above]. The Constitutional Court must note that the bodies which bring proceedings before it under Article 150 § 2 of the Constitution are not parties to the cases [before the ordinary courts], as stated in the referral, but the judicial formations of the Supreme Court of Cassation or the Supreme Administrative Court. In such circumstances, a referral to the Constitutional Court is only required when the judicial panel dealing with a case is itself satisfied that the applicable statute or part of it is unconstitutional. As is evident from two of the statements by third parties, the Supreme Administrative Court’s case-law in all cases under the [2006 Act] is settled, with the court dismissing the claims of all those whose affiliation has been established. In its decision [relating to the 1997 Act], the Constitutional Court found [the provision] which defined the notion of ‘card-indexed collaborators’ – Bulgarian citizens whose names and pseudonyms feature in the card indexes and registration journals of the [former security services] – unconstitutional. The decision has been complied with: the provision that it declared unconstitutional was not applied until the [1997] Act’s repeal [in 2002]. In these proceedings, the [referring court] challenges some of the records which can be used to establish affiliation under section 25(3) of the [2006 Act]. These include the ... databases (registration journals and card indexes [see paragraph 8 above]) used to establish the affiliation of Bulgarian citizens who have covertly assisted the [former security services] as residents, agents, holders of secret meeting premises, holders of secret (conspirative) premises, informers, and trusted persons (paragraph 1(4) of the Act’s additional provisions). Having carried out a comparative analysis, the court finds that the subject matter of this case is the constitutionality of part of section 25(3) of the [2006 Act], now in force, which has fresh content and a new rationale, and is not identical to [the corresponding provision] of the [1997 Act]. The two are not identical, because they are two different provisions from two separate statutes (see ...). Although [those provisions] of the [1997 Act] and section 25(3) of the [2006 Act] are not identical, the Constitutional Court accepts that their effect partly coincides, in as much as the result of both of them is that affiliation to the [former security services] can be established on the basis of data from [the] registration journals and card indexes. This case does not call for the application of section 21(5) of the Constitutional Court Act 1991, which precludes a fresh referral on a point which the Constitutional Court has decided by means of a decision on the merits or an inadmissibility decision, because the Constitutional Court has not previously ruled or been asked to rule on the constitutionality of section 25(3) of the [2006 Act]. But there remains the question of whether the rulings in the [decision relating to the 1997 Act, see paragraph 39 above] bind the court in this case. By section 14(6) of the Constitutional Court Act 1991, the Constitutional Court’s decisions are binding on all State authorities, legal entities and individuals. But the legal force of a decision has temporal limits, and ends when the facts relevant to it change after it has been handed down. Having given its decision, the Constitutional Court cannot revoke it, or regard statutory provisions that it has declared unconstitutional as still in force. But the [court] is not forever bound by its legal views. The law’s development is an objective fact, which permits construing legal provisions in a manner open to alternative views, and taking into account significant social developments which have occurred in the meantime. Arguments based on the need to keep the case-law stable and approach similar cases in the same way cannot outweigh those about the need to develop the law, as long as any straying from the settled case-law is well-founded and justified. When socially necessary, the Constitutional Court may thus change its views and lay down new legal categories, influenced by the doctrine of evolutive interpretation and the need to take into account changes in circumstances which give new arguments greater force. There are previous examples of such reasoned changes of view in [this court]’s case-law. The Constitutional Court notes that this case concerns the application of a new statute, not the repealed one, which it has already examined. The application of this new statute has given rise to a considerable number of precedents, both at the level of the administrative authorities which apply it and at judicial level. All those who hold public office or engage in public activities within the meaning of section 3 of that Act and have been affiliated to the [former security services] must be treated equally. This means that the affiliation of those whose files are still available and those whose files have been destroyed must equally be exposed. All those whose affiliation has been established and those whose affiliation is to be exposed – both those whose affiliation has already been exposed and those whose affiliation is yet to be exposed – must [likewise] be treated without distinction. Another fresh development is that judicial review has been available for more than five years, and the Supreme Administrative Court has settled case-law [in such cases].” 77. In February 2014, in the light of what he considered to be an emerging divergence in the Supreme Administrative Court’s case-law (see paragraph 71 above), the Ombudsman of the Republic asked the plenary session of that court to give an interpretative decision on (a) whether, in carrying out an investigation, the Commission should attempt to assess the probative value of the records of the former security services, with a view to determining the actual activities of those featuring in them, and (b) whether the Commission was bound to expose everyone whose name it found in those records, or could refrain from doing so in some cases. On 3 February 2015 the court’s plenary session turned down the request, because fewer than the requisite number of judges voted in favour of admitting it for examination (see тълк. реш. № 1 от 03.02.2015 г. по тълк. д. № 2/2014 г., ВАС, ОСС от I и II к.). 78. In two criminal defamation cases, the Sofia City Court held that since affiliation with State Security was not objectively damaging, allegations in that respect were not defamatory (see реш. от 24.11.2004 г. по в. н. ч. х. д. № 1562/2004 г., СГС, and реш. № 1111 от 25.09.2013 г. по в. н. ч. х. д. № 2832/2013 г., СГС). In a civil case, the Supreme Court of Cassation held that such an allegation, if false, made in the presence of the person concerned specifically with a view to affecting his or her dignity, and subjectively perceived by him or her as vilifying, was a tortious insult (see реш. № 809 от 26.04.2011 г. по гр. д. № 1573/2009 г., ВКС, IV г. о.).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Riga. At the material time he was the chairman of the supervisory board of a Latvian bank – Latvijas Krājbanka (“Krājbanka” or “the Bank”). The State held 32.12% of its shares. 6. A.L. was one of the shareholders of Krājbanka. He was also the President of the Bank until January 2002, when he voluntarily stepped down from this position. In November 2002 he was elected as a member of the Latvian Parliament (Saeima), representing a newly established political party, Latvijas Pirmā Partija (the Latvia’s First Party – also referred to below as the “Pastors’ Party”), which had been established in the same year. 7. At the material time an advertising agency, Z., was contracted by both Krājbanka and the Latvia’s First Party to provide certain advertising services. 8. Neatkarīgā Rīta Avīze (“NRA”) was one of the main daily newspapers in Latvia at the material time. It was published by a joint-stock company, Preses Nams (until 2 January 2003) and, subsequently, by the limited liability company Mediju Nams. 9. On 30 September 2002 the applicant prepared a report on the advertising and marketing expenses incurred by Krājbanka in 2001 and the first seven months of 2002, which he then presented to the Bank’s supervisory board. His report was based on information which he had requested from the heads of the marketing and economics departments. According to the applicant’s report, the Bank had transferred substantial sums for advertising and marketing services to, inter alia, Z., for which no supporting documents could be found. This raised suspicions that the Bank’s funds had been misappropriated. The parties did not provide the Court with a copy of the applicant’s report, nor any further details of that report. 10. On 2 October 2002 the Bank’s supervisory board held an extraordinary meeting and ordered an internal audit to verify the applicant’s findings. At a meeting of 16 October 2002 the head of the internal audit department informed the supervisory board that no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred. In response to press reports (see paragraphs 13 et seq. below), the internal audit had verified all deals concluded with Z. in 2002; the internal audit in relation to 2001 was ongoing. The information published in the press had not been confirmed. The conclusions of the final report, dated 30 October 2002, indicated that in 2001 no undocumented advertising and marketing expenses had been incurred. All contracted services had been received, but on some occasions no supporting documents have been kept (for example, copies of certain advertisements in the press and some printed material – such as concert posters and tickets – were no longer available). 11. On 16 October 2002 the supervisory board ordered an additional external audit. In May 2003 the audit agency in its report concluded that while the advertising and marketing expenses incurred in 2001 (755,000 Latvian lati (LVL), approximately 1,074,268 euros (EUR)) and 2002 (LVL 555,000, approximately EUR 789,694) had been greater than in previous years (in 1998 the figure had been LVL 374,000, approximately EUR 532,154; in 1999, LVL 324,000, approximately EUR 461,010; and in 2000, LVL 640,000, approximately EUR 910,638), this could be explained by the fact that the Bank had been in the process of changing its corporate identity during the period under consideration. This process had continued while the external audit was being carried out and the Bank had incurred more expenses in this regard. All contracts with Z. had been approved and signed by the Bank’s highest management. The external audit concluded that there was no evidence that payments had been made for services or goods that had not been received or that the payments had exceeded the value of the services received. No personal links had been found between A.L. or the Bank’s staff members and the advertising companies. There was no evidence that the staff members had been forced to work with the particular service provider or to prepare documents for services which the Bank had not received. 12. Meanwhile, A.L. applied to have criminal proceedings instituted in respect of the alleged intentional dissemination of false information about him. By a final decision of 13 August 2003 the prosecution refused to institute criminal proceedings. The information and conclusions, which the applicant had provided to the journalists, had been based on erroneous findings contained in the applicant’s initial report on the advertising and marketing expenses. However, there was no evidence that the applicant had intentionally disseminated false information about A.L. The latter was informed of his right to lodge a civil claim in that regard. 13. Between August 2002 and May 2003 NRA published numerous articles on various topics of public interest concerning the 2002 parliamentary elections. It appears that NRA journalists contacted the applicant for a comment shortly after the meeting of 2 October 2012 of the Bank’s supervisory board had taken place. 14. In their submissions to the Court, the parties disagreed on the manner and form in which the applicant had provided the respective information to the NRA journalists. The Government stated that the applicant had provided this information to the journalists on several occasions, and that his comments, which had contained concrete descriptions of A.L.’s actions, had been provided in the form of facts susceptible of proof. The applicant, however, stated that he had only on one occasion provided a short comment to the journalists via telephone about the issues discussed at the meeting of the Bank’s supervisory board. Furthermore, the comments had constituted merely his own opinion about Krājbanka’s management; they had still needed to be verified by the Bank’s internal audit. 15. The following excerpts are from nine articles, which were published between 3 and 23 October 2002, and which were based on the information provided by the applicant in this regard: 1. “ ‘Krājbanka’s former management accused of fraud’ ... [Since] the beginning of 2001, [LVL] 522,000 has been transferred [to finance] [Krājbanka’s] advertising and marketing activities, in respect of which no documentation – the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds etc. – has been provided ... [T]he transfer of this sum in an unknown direction (nezināmā virzienā) actually amounts to the destruction of the Bank’s [available] assets. ... As [the applicant] suggested to [NRA], either ‘somebody is receiving this paid money back’ or Krājbanka’s money is being used to create advertising of a completely different kind than that indicated in the available documents. ‘This is money that has been stolen from the shareholders’, [the applicant] stated. ... Moreover, significant advance payments were made [for services to be provided within a year] shortly before [a] change in Krājbanka’s management at the beginning of [2002]. The supervisory board has ordered an internal audit to discover where these funds have disappeared to ... Documents in the possession of [NRA] show that the role of A.L. in the affair of the strange advertising [funds] transfers could be quite significant ... The [Bank’s] public relations unit has dispatched [LVL] 168,000 to who knows whom and who knows where. The Bank’s marketing department stands out even more blatantly. Of a total of [LVL] 743,000 spent, no documentary evidence exists regarding the expenditure of [LVL] 356,000.” (Information published in NRA, 3 October 2002 edition, article written by R.P. and E.L.: “Krājbanka’s former management accused of fraud”.) 2. “This week, Krājbanka’s current officials discovered massive excess expenditure on advertising that was allowed during the period of management of A.L. and V.K. –evidently these persons had been advertising themselves at the expense of Krājbanka.” (Information published in NRA, 5 October 2002 edition, article written by R.R. and U.D.: “The Pastors’ Party – a Šlesers’ family enterprise”.) 3. “ ‘Advertising for the Pastors’ Party – with Krājbanka’s money’ ... The advertising agency, Z., responsible for creating the Latvia’s First Party’s preelection campaign, is one of the companies to which Krājbanka’s former management transferred several hundred thousand [Latvian] lati at the beginning of [2002]. The transfer was carried out without documentary certification as an advance payment for advertising services ... [NRA] has already announced that since the beginning of 2001, Krājbanka has transferred [LVL] 522,000 [to finance] its advertising and marketing activities, in respect of which no documentation is available. ... As [the applicant] admitted to NRA, Z. was the very agency to which more than [LVL] 200,000 of Krājbanka’s funds was transferred at the beginning of [2002] as an advance payment; [details of the] subsequent expenditure [of those funds] are unknown. ‘It is possible that this is the money that provided the foundation for the Latvia’s First Party’s sizable advertising campaign’, admitted [the applicant]. ... Documents in the possession of NRA show that the role of A.L. in the affair of the strange advertising [funds] transfers could have been rather significant.” (Information published in NRA, 12 October 2002 edition, article written by K.P. and E.L.: “Advertising for the Pastors’ Party – with Krājbanka’s money”.) 4. “[The applicant] confirmed to [NRA] that the advertising agency, Z., the creator of Latvia’s First Party’s advertising campaign, is one of the companies to which the former management of Krājbanka transferred more than [LVL] 200,000 at the beginning of [2002] without documentary certification as an advance payment for advertising services. It has already been reported that since the beginning of 2001, Krājbanka has transferred [LVL] 522,000 [to finance] its advertising and marketing activities, in respect of which no documentation – the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds, etc. – has been provided.” (Information published in NRA, 15 October 2002 edition, article written by R.P.: “Krājbanka’s President concerned about his reputation”.) 5. “ ‘Crisis within Krājbanka’s Management’ ... The scandal revolving around the potentially unlawful activities of A.L., the former President of Krājbanka, has reached its culmination. ... A.L. has a negative opinion of [NRA’s] publications to date regarding the action of Krājbanka’s former management in transferring hundreds of thousands of [Latvian] lati to advertising firms without documentary certification in respect of the expenditure of that money ... [NRA] has already repeatedly written about the long-standing battle among Krājbanka’s shareholders, during which A.L. was accused several times of potentially unlawful actions ... This, however, has not prevented the friends of A.L. from resorting to extreme methods. [NRA] was informed by [the applicant] that ... at the last meeting of the supervisory board, a member of ‘A.L.’s group’, V.D., asked him in a forthright manner: ‘Have the folks from Ventspils insured your property?’ ‘This is an unprecedented event – the chairman of the Bank’s supervisory board being blatantly threatened!’ admitted [the applicant]. He believes that A.L. is now speculating that he will soon be afforded immunity as a member of [parliament], preventing him from being criminally prosecuted without a majority vote of [the Parliament] ... Commenting on the value of marketing, advertising and public relations contracts, [the applicant] admitted that even though it is necessary to carry out in-depth market research, during A.L.’s era various procedures were breached and payments were made whose sums currently cannot be precisely determined ... NRA has already written that [LVL] 522,000 has been transferred [to finance Krājbanka’s] advertising and marketing activities since the beginning of the year 2001, in respect of which no documentation – the relevant contracts, delivery/acceptance deeds, etc. – has been provided ... Additionally, doubts lie in respect of A.L. that certain actions regarding the administration of certificate accounts were also contrary to the interests of both the Bank and the State.” (Information published in NRA, 18 October 2002 edition, article written by R.P.: “Crisis within Krājbanka’s management”.) 6. “[NRA] has already reported that the actions of A.L. as the President of Krājbanka are being questioned in relation to advertising contracts concluded in the amount of several hundreds of thousands of [Latvian] lati. These contracts have no documentary corroboration regarding the specific measures [financed by] the money in question.” (Information published in NRA, 19 October 2002 edition, article written by R.P., E.L. and L.T.: “Repše: the Minister must be morally clean”.) 7. “NRA has already reported that in 2001, when A.L. was still the President of Krājbanka, [LVL] 522,000 was transferred without documentation, apparently for Krājbanka’s advertising and marketing activities, of which [LVL] 200,000 went to the advertising agency, Z., which also happened to be responsible for creating Latvia’s First Party’s pre-election campaign.” (Information published in NRA, 22 October 2002 edition, article written by B.L.: “Parties divide money portfolios!”) 8. “It is possible that during A.L.’s term of office [LVL] 522,000 was transferred [to finance] Krājbanka’s advertising and marketing activities, in respect of which the relevant documentation has not been provided.” (Information published in NRA, 22 October 2002 edition, article written by R.P.: “Krājbanka goes against A.L. at the prosecutor’s office”.) 9. “[NRA] has already written that [LVL] 522,000 was transferred in 2001, without any accompanying documentation, apparently for [Krājbanka’s] advertising and marketing activities, of which [LVL] 200,000 [went] to the advertising agency, Z., which was responsible for creating Latvia’s First Party’s pre-election campaign.” (Information published in NRA, 23 October 2002 edition, article written by B.L.: “Millionaires compete for power”.) 16. On 28 July 2003 A.L. lodged a claim against the applicant and the publishers of NRA seeking compensation and the retraction of a total of thirtyone allegedly defamatory articles. He also indicated that the applicant had provided false information to NRA, which had formed the basis of the above-mentioned nine articles (see paragraph 15 above). 17. During a hearing of 16 January 2004 the applicant admitted before the first-instance court that the information concerning the possible misappropriation of Krājbanka’s funds, which he had provided to NRA, had proved to be incorrect. He made the following statements: “The information [was] wrong, unfounded. [As part of my duties] I was carrying out my task of managing [the Bank’s] activities. I was not interested in A.L.’s private life. I have always respected him. I tried to organise [my] work correctly. As to the mistake regarding numbers, there was one, and I apologise to A.L. and to the journalists. A.L. worked at the Bank and worked in accordance with [its] budget. A.L. made decisions. There were others responsible for [the Bank’s] budget. [The Bank] did not overpay for [its] advertisements. The mistake regarding numbers could not have offended A.L.’s honour and dignity. There were no public statements; maybe there were other [people] who [provided more information to the press].” 18. On 3 October 2005 the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa) delivered its judgment, dismissing the claims against the applicant. The court concluded that the nine articles in question (see paragraph 15 above), which had been based on the information provided by the applicant, had reported his personal opinion about the functioning of Krājbanka and its management, which could not be considered defamatory. Moreover, no claim for defamatory information to be retracted was lodged against the applicant. The claims against both publishers of NRA (Preses Nams and Mediju nams) were partly upheld in so far as they concerned six out of the nine articles which had been based on information provided by the applicant and six other articles reporting on other matters. 19. On 28 May 2007 the Civil Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Civillietu tiesu palāta) – after appeals by A.L., Preses Nams, and Mediju nams – re-examined the case and delivered a new judgment. The judgment took immediate effect. 20. The appellate court noted that at the material time the press and other mass media had been widely reporting on the 2002 parliamentary elections – that is to say the political parties and their leaders, including the newly-established political party, of which A.L. was one of the leaders. He had stood for election, his candidacy had been widely advertised and it had been, accordingly, examined by the press and other mass media. NRA had published a series of articles about the money spent on the pre-election advertising of the Latvia’s First Party, linking the source of these funds to Krājbanka and its former President, A.L. It had been reported that during his time in office, LVL 522,000 had been transferred for advertising and marketing purposes without any documentary proof thereof having been preserved and that this had been considered to constitute a misappropriation of the bank’s funds. These funds had been spent on the party’s large-scale advertising; as the applicant had put it: “[T]his money has been stolen from the shareholders”. The nine articles had also contained other information provided by the applicant – that during A.L.’s time in office, there had been breaches not only in relation to the advertising expenses, but also other breaches in respect of banking operations, payments without approval, the administration of certificate accounts against the interests of the Bank and the State. 21. The appellate court stated that the information contained in those articles about the use of Krājbanka’s funds and transactions had been provided by the applicant (who had mentioned specific sums), and that the articles had contained references to his statements. 22. The appellate court found that since the applicant had provided this information to NRA journalists, he had to bear responsibility for giving and disseminating false information. The court held that this information had not corresponded to the facts and that this had been acknowledged by the applicant himself during the hearing before the first-instance court (see paragraph 17 above). This had also been confirmed by the results of the external audit and by the prosecution (see paragraphs 11 and 12). 23. The court also held that the journalists had not had a responsibility to verify the accuracy of the provided information, since the applicant’s status as the chairman of the supervisory board of Krājbanka had created a legitimate expectation that the provided information was correct. 24. Lastly, the court found that, even if the margin of permissible criticism in respect of A.L. as a member of parliament was necessarily a wider one than would normally be the case, the false information had nevertheless offended his honour and dignity, as it had contained serious allegations of unlawful activities and had given the impression that A.L. was a dishonest person. 25. Given the above, and in view of the seriousness of the interference and the applicant’s position in the Bank, the court ordered the applicant to pay compensation to A.L. in connection with the nine articles in the amount of LVL 10,000 (approximately EUR 14,229), together with statutory interest (6% per annum). 26. In addition, the court upheld the claim against Preses Nams alone in respect of one other article, and ordered it to pay compensation in the amount of LVL 5,000 (approximately EUR 7,114), together with statutory interest (6% per annum). 27. The applicant and Preses Nams were also ordered to pay A.L.’s legal costs in the amount of LVL 495 (approximately EUR 704) and LVL 375 (approximately EUR 534) respectively. 28. The appellate court dismissed A.L.’s claims against Preses Nams and Mediju Nams as regards all the other articles that had not been based on any information provided by the applicant. 29. On 28 June 2007 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Senāts). He did not contest that the information he had provided to the journalists had turned out not to be supported by evidence. However, this information had constituted his evaluation of the actions taken by Krājbanka’s management as a whole. He had not directly mentioned A.L. by name, surname or his position when giving the information to the journalists. His allegations regarding the misappropriation of Krājbanka’s funds could only have infringed the interests of the Bank as a legal entity; it could not have offended the honour and dignity of certain executives, who had been under an obligation to inform the supervisory board and the mass media of the truth. Furthermore, the applicant had provided the information in the form of a supposition by indicating that it still needed to be verified by the Bank’s internal audit. It was the NRA journalists who had linked the applicant’s report with the allegations of wrongdoing by A.L. Thus, the applicant could not be held responsible for the manner in which the journalists had decided to present this information, since he had had no means of influencing this. 30. On 30 January 2008 the Senate of the Supreme Court delivered a new judgment, which in essence upheld the appellate court’s judgment. The relevant parts of the judgement read as follows: “[The appellate court’s] conclusion that the applicant had disseminated defamatory and false information was supported by the applicant’s own submissions before the first-instance court, in which he admitted that he had provided incorrect information to [the journalists] ... . The fact that this information was not truthful was confirmed by [the audit agency and the prosecution]. The applicant in his appeal on points of law did not contest these findings. ... He merely noted that he was a source and could not influence the evaluation given by the journalists. Having examined the testimony of [the NRA journalists], the appellate court found that the false information provided by the applicant had related not to Krājbanka’s management, as the applicant indicated, but specifically to A.L., as the then President of the Bank, thus infringing his honour and dignity. ... [The appellate court] found that the journalists had had no reason to doubt the credibility of the information, as it had been provided by the applicant [in his capacity as] chairman of the supervisory board of Krājbanka, and his position had undoubtedly created a legitimate expectation that this information was true ... Accordingly, the appellate court rightly held that the journalists had had no obligation to verify the accuracy of the information provided by the applicant. ... A.L. had requested compensation in the amount of LVL 10,000 from [the applicant]. By granting his claim, the [appellate] court, taking into account the scope of the distributed information and its audience, rightly considered it justified.” The Senate of the Supreme Court also upheld the claim against Preses Nams alone in respect of one other article; they held that A.L.’s honour and dignity had not been offended in other articles. The appellate court had referred to the Court’s case-law and had taken into account A.L.’s status and the fact that he had refused to offer comment. The appellate court had correctly applied the relevant principle that the journalistic freedom also covered possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation; the Senate referred to a/s Diena and Ozoliņš v. Latvia (no. 16657/03, § 84, 12 July 2007) in this regard. Referring to section 2352a of the Civil Law and section 29(3) of the Law on the Mass Media, the Senate of the Supreme Court ordered the applicant (who had disseminated that defamatory information), and not Preses Nams, to retract the relevant parts of the articles in question (see paragraph 15 above). The latter, however, still remained obliged to publish the retracted information.",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0
123,001-167813,ENG,DNK,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,NAZARI v. DENMARK,4,Inadmissible,Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström;Georges Ravarani,"1. The applicant, Mr Khalil Nazari, is an Afghan national who was born in 1986 and lives in Copenhagen. He is represented before the Court by Mr Niels-Erik Hansen, from the “Documentation and Advisory Centre on Racial Discrimination” (DACoRD), an NGO in Copenhagen, 2. The Danish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Tobias Elling Rehfeld, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and their Co-agent, Mrs Nina Holst-Christensen, from the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant was born in Afghanistan. In 2001, when he was 15 years old, he was granted asylum in Denmark as an unaccompanied minor. In that connection he was provided with a travel document in accordance with Article 28 of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. 5. He acquired proficiency in the Danish language and eventually graduated from High School. Currently he is studying at university to become a civil engineer. 6. The applicant maintained that on leaving Afghanistan, he lost contact with his family. Ten years later, in 2011, he regained contact with his parents and siblings, who had been granted residence permits in Canada. 7. In the meantime, on 12 January 2007, the applicant applied for naturalisation. His request was refused on 27 May 2008 because he did not fulfil all the criteria for being granted Danish nationality. 8. Based on a renewed application, on 6 October 2010 the then Ministry for Refugees, Immigrants and Integration (Ministeriet for flygtninge, indvandrere og integration) informed the applicant that his name would be on the next bill of naturalisation, which was expected to be presented in Parliament by the end of April 2011 and to be passed by the Parliament in July 2011. It was stated that, before the passing of the law, the Ministry would reassess whether he still satisfied the criteria for obtaining Danish citizenship (on 3 October 2011 the tasks pertaining to nationality were transferred to the Ministry of Justice. Henceforth, both ministries will be referred to as “the Ministry”). 9. On 15 April 2011 the Ministry informed the applicant that he was not eligible to have his name on the said bill and that he could not at that time become a Danish national. His name was therefore not listed on the bill introduced to Parliament on the same day. The applicant was informed that he could not expect to have a re-application examined within the next five years. Referring to the principles set out in section 24, subsection 3, and section 15 of the Public Administration Act (Forvaltningsloven), it was stated that no grounds could be given for the decision. No appeal lay against the decision by the Parliamentary Committee on Naturalisation. 10. The applicant noted that section 21 of Circular Letter No. 61 of 22 September 2008 on Naturalisation contained a possibility of excluding an applicant from being listed in a naturalisation bill for a specific period if the National Security Service (Politiets Efterretningstjeneste, PET) considered that he or she was a danger to national security. Accordingly, since he was excluded from re-applying for five years, he was convinced that the Minister of Justice had received information from the National Security Service that the applicant was considered to be a danger to national security, and that therefore a security assessment had been submitted to the Parliamentary Committee on Naturalisation with a recommendation that the applicant be excluded from being listed in a naturalisation bill for five years. In his view, though, there was no reason to consider him a danger to national security. 11. Before the Court, the Government have submitted that they can neither confirm nor deny that the decision to exclude the applicant from being listed in the naturalisation bill was taken on the basis of section 21 of the said Circular Letter. 12. On 31 May 2011 the applicant requested that the National Security Service grant him access to the documents concerning him, which was refused on 1 July 2011 with the information that the National Security Service would neither confirm nor deny whether it had any information about him. 13. The applicant complained about that decision to the Ministry of Justice, which upheld it on 16 February 2012. 14. In the meantime, the applicant’s request of 22 August 2011 that the Ministry grant him access to the documents concerning him was granted on 12 December 2011 for the major part. A few documents were withheld with reference to the “excepted information” set out under section 15, subsection 1, of the Public Administration Act (Forvaltningsloven), which includes considerations for national security or defence. 15. The applicant did not bring the refusal to grant him Danish nationality, or the refusals to grant him access to information, before the Danish courts. 16. Article 44 of the Constitution of 1849 set out that “no alien shall be naturalised except by an Act of Parliament”. 17. Article 63, section 1, of the Constitution reads as follows: “The courts of justice shall be empowered to decide any question relating to the scope of the executive’s authority; though any person wishing to question such authority shall not, by taking the case to the courts of justice, avoid temporary compliance with orders given by the executive authority.” 18. Under section 6 (1) of Act No. 422 of 7 June 2004 on Danish nationality, Danish nationality may be acquired through naturalisation granted by virtue of the Danish Constitution. 19. The procedure for applying for nationality involves an interview with the police, preparation of the bill by a Ministry (currently the Ministry of Justice), a debate and a decision by the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee, which is made up of seventeen members of Parliament, and finally the passing of the bill by Parliament. 20. The debates and votes of the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee are confidential and only Committee members can participate in the meetings. The decision to grant or refuse nationality is discretionary and not subject to any form of judicial review (however, see below). 21. Two bills are usually passed per year, in April and October. The passing of naturalisation bills in Parliament follows the same procedure as other bills, which means three readings of the bill before it is passed by Parliament. The Act is then promulgated in the Danish Law Gazette (Statstidende). 22. The initial examination of applications for naturalisation by Act of Parliament is carried out by the Ministry of Justice. When preparing naturalisation bills and assessing whether applicants can be listed in a naturalisation bill, the Ministry is obliged to adhere to the Guidelines on Naturalisation contained in a circular (Cirkulære om dansk indfødsret ved naturalisation), in force at the relevant time, as agreed by the majority in Parliament (Circular Letter No. 61 of 22 September 2008 at the relevant time). The guidelines stipulate the requirements that must be satisfied in order for applicants to be listed in a naturalisation bill without prior submission of their application to the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee. Applicants listed in a naturalisation bill therefore have either satisfied the requirements of the Guidelines or have been exempted from certain requirements following the submission of their application to the Committee. On this basis, the parties in Government who agreed on the Guidelines will vote in favour of the Government’s naturalisation bill at the readings of the bill in Parliament. If an applicant fails to meet one or more of the requirements set out in the Guidelines on Naturalisation, the Ministry will refuse the application in accordance with the authorisation given to the Ministry by Parliament. The decisions by the Ministry of Justice to submit or refuse to submit cases to the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee, as well as the decisions of the Committee, are not made pursuant to a statute, but are classified as preparation of a statute. Hence the procedure cannot be characterised as an administrative process. Nevertheless, in resolution no. 36 of 15 January 1998, Parliament instructed the Ministry of Justice to comply with international conventions, and the rules of the Public Administration Act and other principles of public administration to the extent possible, when preparing naturalisation bills. 23. By virtue of Article 63, section 1, of the Constitution, review by the courts of the administration’s general and specific decisions is a common legal remedy. The courts cannot review the exercise of administrative discretion (see, for example, Weekly Law Report (Ugeskrift for Retsvæsen) for 1973, p. 897 (U.1973.897H)), but they can conduct a judicial review of the competence of the authority, the observance of formal rules, and the legal basis of an administrative decision, including whether it is in accordance with Denmark’s obligations under the Convention. 24. Thus, in various cases the Danish courts have reviewed whether the administrative authorities’ decision was in accordance with Article 8 of the Convention, alone or taken in conjunction with Article 14 (see, for example, Biao v. Denmark [GC], no. 38590/10, §§ 25-30, 24 May 2016; Osman v. Denmark, no. 38058/09, §§ 19-21, 14 June 2011 and Priya v. Denmark (dec.), 13594/03, 6 July 2006, referring to the Weekly Law Review 2004, p. 1765, concerning respectively family reunification, the lapse of a residence permit and a deportation order; moreover, although a decision by the Refugee Appeals Board (Flygtningenævnet) is final pursuant to section 56, subsection 8, of the Aliens Act (Udlændingeloven), an alien may, by virtue of Article 63 of the Danish Constitution, bring the case before the courts for a review of the legality of the administrative decision, including the compliance with the Convention: see, inter alia, Panjeheighalehei v. Denmark (dec.), 11230/07, 13 October 2009, referring to numerous Supreme Court judgments from 1997 to 2007). 25. On 13 September 2013, the Danish Supreme Court (Højesteret) passed a judgment (U.2013.3328H) concerning the right to judicial review under Article 63 of the Constitution relating to the process of granting nationality. The Supreme Court stated, among other things: “The Supreme Court agrees with the view that the Minister’s decisions to refrain from listing an applicant in a naturalisation bill or to refrain from submitting an application to the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee are elements of the legislative process. Article 63 of the Constitution, according to which the courts are empowered to decide any questions relating to the scope of the executive authority, does not apply to such decisions as no authority is exercised by the executive, see in this respect the Supreme Court’s judgment, reproduced on page 903 of the Danish Weekly Law report (UfR) 1972. Denmark has acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights and several other international conventions that may be significant to the processing of applications for or to the grant of nationality. Accordingly, Denmark has assumed a number of obligations under international law, compliance with which is assumed, also in the preparatory works of the Danish Nationality Act (Indfødsretsloven), when Parliament and the Parliamentary Naturalisation Committee exercise their discretion as to whether Danish nationality should be granted to an applicant, see in this respect Bill L 69, Official Report on Parliamentary Proceedings (Folketingstidende) 1998-99, supplement A, column 1794. An applicant who has not been included in a naturalisation Act can therefore request the courts to review whether obligations under international law have been breached, and whether the applicant has a claim for damages or compensation in that connection. Such judicial review will not be contrary to the authority of the Government or Parliament under Articles 21 and 41(1) of the Danish Constitution, regarding the introduction of bills, or under Article 44(1) on naturalisation by law. By contrast, these provisions precluded any judicial review of claims to the effect that the applicant must be listed in a naturalisation bill or must be granted nationality by an Act.” ... In the case in question, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the appellant and remitted the case to the High Court for retrial on the merits (whether the appellant, on the ground of his diagnosis (PTSD), had suffered discrimination in violation of Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Article 8).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
124,001-142376,ENG,HUN,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,HÁLÓZATI GYÓGYSZERTÁRAK SZÖVETSÉGE AND OTHERS v. HUNGARY,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Guido Raimondi;Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano,"1. The first applicant, Hálózati Gyógyszertárak Szövetsége (“HGYSZ”) (“Association of Pharmacy Networks”), is an association registered under Hungarian law, with its seat in Budapest. The other applicants (listed in the Annex) are members of the first applicant. They are companies registered under Hungarian law. The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr J-F. Bellis, a lawyer practising in Brussels. s, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicants listed in the Annex are companies which operate pharmacy networks in Hungary and are as such members of the first applicant, HGYSZ. Each member of HGYSZ holds shares (usually majority shares) in a number of different pharmacies or directly operates (usually more than four) pharmacies. As a result of their respective shareholdings, HGYSZ members own part of the equity, take part in the management and share the profits of a number of pharmacies in Hungary. 4. Between 1990 and 1994, the operation of pharmacies in Hungary was governed by Ministerial Decree No. 9/1990. (III.28.) SZEM, under which the opening of new pharmacies was allowed without any geographic or demographic limitation. During this period, the number of pharmacies in Hungary increased by about 30% to approximately 2,000 pharmacies. 5. From the adoption of Act no. LIV of 1994 onwards, and until 2006, the operation of pharmacies was governed by different rules, according to which the opening of new pharmacies was still without obstacles and the takeover/operation of existing pharmacies by companies was possible. However, geographic and demographic barriers to the opening of new pharmacies were introduced, requirements concerning inter alia the qualification of pharmacists and their influence on the management of the pharmacies were applied, and the legal form of companies that may operate pharmacies was prescribed. At the same time, there was no limitation on the number of pharmacies that could be operated by one entity, provided the relevant sector-specific conditions were met. 6. In 2006, new rules contained in Act no. XCVIII of 2006 (“the Gyftv.”) abolished most limitations on the establishment of pharmacies and the legal form of companies that could operate pharmacies. 7. Between 1994 and 2010, a number of foreign investors entered the Hungarian pharmaceutical retail market by acquiring shares in pharmacies. The majority of HGYSZ members’ shareholdings date back to the period between 1994 and 2006. Despite the limitations in place between 1994 and 2006, there was no indication that shareholdings in pharmacies would be limited or that any future limitation on shareholdings would affect already existing shareholdings in pharmacies. 8. At the end of 2010, Hungarian legislation introduced limitations on the shareholdings in pharmacies. These limitations, which Act no. CLXXIII of 2010 (“the Act”) incorporated into the Gyftv. – as of 1 January 2011 – require that the shareholdings of pharmacists in the pharmacies where they work must exceed 25% by 1 January 2014 and 50% by 1 January 2017 and moreover that no one may have shares in more than four pharmacies. The restrictions do not only apply to pharmacies which are established after the amendments entered into force, but ownership in already existing pharmacies must also be brought into line with the limitations by the respective deadlines of 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2017. Moreover, any change in the ownership of the non-pharmacist shareholders entails an immediate obligation to meet the above thresholds, even before the deadlines of 1 January 2014 and 1 January 2017. The amendments do not contain any guarantee for an appropriate compensation for those shareholders who are obliged to give up part of their shareholdings. 9. The 2010 amendments introduced by the Act entail in particular the limitations outlined below. Previously, in cases where pharmacies were operated by enterprises, it was sufficient for the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy concerned to have a 1% share in the enterprise operating that pharmacy. Pursuant to the amendment to section 74 (1) of the Gyftv., introduced by section 84 (1) of the Act, enterprises are now only allowed to operate pharmacies if the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy concerned and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy exceed 50%. According to section 83/A (1) of the Gyftv., introduced by section 87 of the Act, these ownership rules enter into force between 1 January 2011 and 1 January 2017 according to the following schedule. 10. Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2013, with some exceptions (such as the death of the pharmacist), changes in the ownership structure of the enterprise operating a pharmacy entail an immediate obligation under which the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy must exceed 25%. 11. Between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016, the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy must exceed 25% and, again with some exceptions, changes in the ownership structure of the enterprise operating a pharmacy entail an immediate obligation under which the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy must exceed 50%. 12. As of 1 January 2017, the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy must exceed 50%. 13. According to section 83/A (4) of the Gyftv., introduced by section 87 of the Act, once the combined shares of the pharmacist exercising the professional leadership of the pharmacy and the pharmacist(s) employed in the pharmacy have exceeded 50%, it is prohibited, even before the time-limit of 1 January 2017, to reduce those combined shares to 50% or below. 14. The applicants submitted that it was difficult to estimate the exact value that they would obtain in exchange for the shares they were required to transfer to pharmacists by 1 January 2017. However, they argued that, in the absence of any provision concerning compensation for the required transfer of shares and in light of the limited financial means of pharmacists in Hungary, the price offered for the shareholdings in question would inevitably be substantially below pharmacies’ normal market value. Indeed, the limited number of cases where HGYSZ members had sold shares since the beginning of 2011 showed that, subsequent to the amendments made to the Gyftv. in 2010, purchase prices were far below the market value. 15. Moreover, before the amendments introduced by the Act, there was no restriction on how many pharmacies a single shareholder could have shares in. Pursuant to the amendment to section 74 (3) of the Gyftv., introduced by section 84 (2) of the Act, companies that have shares in enterprises operating four or more pharmacies cannot acquire or hold shares in an(other) enterprise operating pharmacies. 16. Furthermore, section 73 (1) of the Gyftv., as amended by section 83 of the Act, as well as section 74 (5) of the Gyftv., as amended by section 84 (4) of the Act, give pharmacists increased powers in the decision-making of the enterprise that operates the pharmacy, regardless of their shareholding and their position in the enterprise, in derogation from Hungarian company law. 17. Given the shareholdings of HGYSZ members, the applicants would need to give up substantial shareholdings in order to bring their shares below the 75% threshold by 1 January 2014 and below the 50% threshold by 1 January 2017. Additionally, with the exception of one applicant that holds shares in only three pharmacies, all others would need to give up completely their shareholdings in a number of pharmacies in order to reduce the number of pharmacies in their respective networks to four. For instance, Pharmanova Zrt., the largest member of HGYSZ, which holds shares in 140 pharmacies, would need to surrender its shares in 136 pharmacies and reduce its shares in the remaining four pharmacies below 75% by 1 January 2014 and below 50% by 1 January 2017. 18. The value of the shareholdings that the applicants would need to give away – because of the restriction on the size of shareholdings – by 1 January 2014 is estimated at 5.8 billion Hungarian forints (HUF), and the value of the shareholdings that they would need to surrender by 1 January 2017 is estimated at an additional HUF 9.9 billion. These figures exclude the further shareholdings to be alienated on account of the restriction on the number of pharmacies owned by one shareholder, whose value will be dependent on the choice of pharmacies to be surrendered. 19. In the face of the forced sales of these shares representing a very substantial amount of money, the legislation does not guarantee any particular form of compensation. 20. On 5 June 2012 the Constitutional Court rejected, without an examination on the merits, HGYSZ’s complaint alleging that the amendments brought about by the Act amounted to a breach of constitutional rights. According to the decision, the complaint was inadmissible, partly because HGYSZ was not directly affected by the impugned provisions in that it could not possibly sustain a direct violation of any constitutional right in this context, and partly because the subject matter of the complaint was essentially the same as that of cases previously adjudicated by the Constitutional Court. 21. Subsequently, a number of new laws were enacted, which amended several health- and health-insurance-related Acts, amongst others, the Gyftv. The latter was amended in particular as of 1 January, 6 July 2013 and 1 January 2014. 22. Due to these amendments, pharmacists were given privileged rights to purchase those pharmacy shares which the current legal person owners, such as the applicants, would have to sell. 23. From 1 January 2013 on, the operation of a pharmacy by a company is only allowed if the pharmacist exercising the pharmaceutical management of the pharmacy concerned holds more than 50% of the business shares of the owner company, or if the combined volume of shares of the principal pharmacist and of the ones employed in the pharmacy exceed 50% of the shares. The shares and the combined shares can be taken into consideration in respect of a maximum of four pharmacies. 24. The requirements for a pharmacist to be entitled to run a pharmacy are regulated by the Gyftv. As of 6 July 2013, a new element was included in the Act, namely that such principal pharmacists must figure in a dedicated register and that, once registered, he or she exercises his or her operational rights independently. 25. The latest amendment of the Gyftv. which entered into force on 1 January 2014 prohibits companies running pharmacies from instructing the principal pharmacist (and other employed professionals) on commercial-pharmaceutical practices. Moreover, in the management of companies running pharmacies, the exercise of pharmacists’ shareholder rights must be guaranteed in a manner which reflects the volume of their shares and which is outlined in the articles of associations. This is a strict rule, from which any departure is null and void. 26. As of 1 July 2013, Government Decree no. 212/2013. (VI.19.) on Facilitating the Increase of Pharmacists’ Share Holding in Pharmacies stipulated the possibility of a preferential loan for those pharmacists who are intended to purchase shares in companies running pharmacies.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1959 and lives in Liepāja. 6. On 1 November 2007, when the applicant was in the courtyard of her apartment building, two officers from the municipal police force (J.M. and J.L.) pulled up in a car. After having a conversation with the applicant they twisted her arms behind her back and forced her to approach their car. She was eventually let go, but later she started feeling ill and had to call an ambulance. The applicant submits that she still felt ill effects on her health more than a year after the events of 1 November 2007. 7. On 2 November 2007 the applicant wrote to the Liepāja City Public Prosecutor’s Office and requested that criminal proceedings be instituted against the officers responsible. The applicant stated that she had told the officers that they could go and talk in her apartment, after which one of them had grabbed her right upper arm and twisted her arm behind her back, she avoided the grip owing to pain, while the police officer shouted that he would teach her a lesson about resisting the police. At that moment the second policeman had grabbed and twisted the applicant’s left arm. The policemen had then tried to push the applicant into the back of their car. They eventually let her go after her neighbours intervened. Immediately after the policemen had left, the applicant had started experiencing health problems, namely, sharp pain in her chest, high blood pressure, pain in her back, neck and head, and a loss of feeling in her hands. She had called an ambulance and had been given an injection. The following day a general practitioner had issued the applicant with a sick leave certificate until 12 November 2007 and had prescribed painkillers and sedatives. The applicant asked the prosecutor to order an appointment with a forensic medical expert, pointing out that there were haematomas on her upper arms. 8. It appears that the prosecutor instituted criminal proceedings the same day. The case was forwarded to the State police for investigation. 9. On 4 November 2007 the applicant submitted a complaint to the head of the Liepāja City Municipal Police. In substance she repeated her account of the events of 1 November. In the concluding part of her complaint, the applicant requested that the actions of the two officers of the municipal police be investigated. She also pointed out that as a result of their actions she had suffered mental anguish and material and psychological harm. 10. On 21 January 2008 an inspector from the Liepāja City and District Police Department adopted a decision to terminate the criminal proceedings which had been initiated by the prosecutor. The decision was adopted on the basis of statements made by the applicant (see paragraph 11 below), by J.M. and J.L. (see paragraph 12 below) and by three other witnesses (see paragraph 14 below) as well as the forensic medical expert’s report (see paragraph 13 below) and a decision of the Liepāja City Municipal Police to take disciplinary measures in respect of J.M. and J.L. for having failed to properly document the administrative infraction committed by the applicant (see paragraph 15 below). 11. The applicant had testified that she had been washing her car in the courtyard of her neighbour’s house and that, after she had parked the car near her house, two policemen had pulled up. They had asked the applicant to approach their car, which she had not done because she had needed to return to her apartment urgently. The policemen had then warned her that she was disobeying police orders and had subsequently twisted her arms behind her back; she had tried to free herself from the grip. 12. The policemen J.M. and J.L. stated that they had been called out about an administrative violation – a car being washed in a public courtyard. Upon arrival at the scene they had noticed the applicant standing next to a car holding a bucket. J.L. had then invited the applicant to approach the police car so that a record of an administrative violation could be drawn up, which the applicant had refused to do and had started to walk away. The policemen had then taken her by the arms and started directing her towards the police car. Since the applicant had not demonstrated resistance, J.L. and J.M. had released their hold and subsequently taken statements from the applicant’s neighbours for the purpose of initiating administrative proceedings against her. 13. The forensic medical expert who had examined the applicant noted that each of her upper arms bore two haematomas. It was concluded that the haematomas could have appeared in the circumstances described by the applicant. The haematomas were described as minor injuries which would not have adverse medical effects for more than six days (“kas neizraisa īslaicīgus veselības traucējumus uz laiku virs 6 dienām”). The fact that the applicant had actually sought medical treatment for longer than six days was considered irrelevant, since the expert considered that the nature of her injuries did not warrant such extended treatment. 14. The three eyewitnesses to the events of 1 November all agreed that the applicant had ignored the requests of the police and that the policemen had therefore tried to detain her. The applicant had resisted and the officers had twisted her arms behind her back. After the applicant had stopped resisting, she had been released. 15. The findings of the internal investigation of the Liepāja City Municipal Police of 16 November 2007 disclosed that the policemen J.L. and J.M. had been penalised for their lack of diligence in drawing up a record of the administrative violation allegedly committed by the applicant (failure to obey the lawful order of a police officer). No mention appears to have been made of the alleged use of force against the applicant. 16. Taking into account the information set out above, the inspector concluded that the applicant had intentionally disobeyed the lawful order of a police officer (thus committing an administrative offence under Latvian legislation). As a result, J.L. and J.M. had used special restraint techniques (“pielietoja speciālos cīņas paņēmienus”), namely holding the applicant’s arms behind her back in order to detain her. The applicant had shown resistance while she was being directed towards the police car. Once she had stopped resisting, she had been released and J.L. had informed his supervisor of the events. In consultation with J.L.’s supervisor it had been decided not to bring the applicant to the police station but instead to initiate administrative proceedings against her. Administrative proceedings were initiated on 13 November 2007 and discontinued on 18 February 2008 because procedural time-limits had not been observed by the police. 17. The decision stated that, since the applicant had refused to cooperate with the police and had started to walk away, the policemen had had legitimate grounds for detaining her, as long as they observed the requirements set out in the Law on Police (see paragraphs 24 and 25 below). Nevertheless, J.L. and J.M. had failed to fulfil the requirements of section 13 in fine of the Law, which prohibits the use of special restraint techniques against women, other than in exceptional circumstances. As a result, the applicant had sustained minor injuries. Infliction of minor injuries is an offence proscribed by section 130 of the Criminal Law. Under section 7(3) of the Criminal Law, infliction of minor injuries is one of the crimes that are prosecuted privately by the victim. 18. The inspector further noted that J.L. and J.M. had not exceeded their official authority in contravention of section 317 of the Criminal Law. It was established that even though the policemen had violated the requirements of section 13 in fine of the Law on Police, it had to be taken into account that the applicant herself had disobeyed and resisted the police. Thus, taking into account the “nature, circumstances and consequences of the officers’ actions”, the inspector concluded that, pursuant to the explanations contained in section 23(1) of the Law on the Coming into Force and Application of the Criminal Law, there had been no substantial harm done to state authority, administrative order or the rights and interests of any person. Accordingly the inspector held that the municipal police had to decide whether J.L. and J.M. should be held disciplinarily liable for the violation of section 13 in fine of the Law on Police. In conclusion, it was decided to terminate the criminal proceedings for absence of corpus delicti. 19. The decision was conveyed to the applicant in a letter of 24 January 2008. The letter stated: “... You may appeal against the adopted decision to the Liepāja City Public Prosecutor’s Office within 10 days of receiving the decision. Please also note that section 7(3) of the Criminal Procedure Law provides that the offence mentioned in section 130 of the Criminal Law (intentional infliction of a minor injury) is prosecuted privately. In the course of private prosecution criminal proceedings, the prosecutorial functions are carried out by the victim, who must lodge an application with a court. ...” 20. The applicant did not appeal against the decision of 21 January 2008. She did, however, submit a complaint to the Liepāja Court stating her intention to initiate a private prosecution under sections 130 and 156 of the Criminal Law. The complaint was dated 29 April 2008 and was marked as having been received at the court on 30 April. The applicant indicated that J.M. and J.L. had used special restraint techniques against her in contravention of the Law on Police, as a result of which she had been injured, which had been confirmed by a forensic medical expert. She further pointed out that she had incurred pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses. Accordingly, she claimed damages. 21. On 7 May 2008 a single judge of the Liepāja Court issued a decision concerning the applicant’s complaint. The judge held that the limitation period of six months had expired and criminal proceedings could therefore not be instituted. He noted that he had received the applicant’s complaint on 6 May 2008, that is to say after the expiry of the statutory time-limit. Furthermore, the decision noted that the applicant had failed to specify which paragraph of section 130 formed the legal basis of her complaint, and had not substantiated in any way her claim under section 156. 22. The applicant appealed. On 2 June 2008 a single judge of the Kurzeme Regional Court dismissed her appeal. The decision noted that the last day on which J.L. and J.M. could have been charged by the way of private prosecution had been 1 May 2008. Since the applicant had lodged her complaint on 30 April 2008, it would have been physically impossible to initiate proceedings on 1 May 2008 because of the large number of procedural steps that would have had to be taken (for example, a copy of the complaint would have had to be sent to the accused, the accused would have had to be informed about their rights, the applicant would have had to be informed about the time and the place of the hearing, and the accused and other persons would have had to be called to the hearing). The judge further noted that the police’s decision not to initiate criminal proceedings was made on 21 January 2008, yet the applicant had waited for almost three months before lodging a request to initiate private prosecution proceedings. The decision had also explained that a refusal to initiate criminal proceedings did not preclude the applicant from lodging a civil claim in order to obtain compensation for the harm allegedly done. Finally it was remarked that the judge of the first-instance court had correctly held that the applicant had failed to specify which of the three paragraphs of section 130 of the Criminal Law formed the legal basis of her complaint. Under the Criminal Procedure Law, the judge of the first-instance court had a duty to establish whether the legal categorisation of the alleged crime was correct, since the accused had a right to know the exact content of the accusations against them. The decision of the Kurzeme Regional Court was final and not subject to further appeal.",[],[],[],"['13', '3']",[],[],0
126,001-179793,ENG,FRA,CHAMBER,2017,CASE OF RAMDA v. FRANCE,3,No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing);No violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 - Right not to be tried or punished twice-{general} (Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 - Right not to be tried or punished twice),,"5. The applicant was born in 1969 and is currently detained in Lannemezan Prison. 6. The applicant was a member of the Islamic Salvation Front (Front Islamique du Salut – “the FIS”) and left Algeria prior to the dissolution of that political group by a judgment of the Algiers Administrative Court dated 19 March 1992. After spending some time in Pakistan he entered the United Kingdom in January 1993 using the false name of Elias Serbis. On 26 February 1993 he applied for political asylum in that country, claiming to have been forced to leave Algeria because of his membership of the FIS. His application was refused on 10 August 1994. 7. On 25 July, 17 and 26 August, 3, 4 and 7 September and 6 and 17 October 1995 eight terrorist attacks were carried out in France. 8. Although no organisation explicitly claimed responsibility, certain factors, such as the existence of virulent press statements against France and the mode of operation of the attacks, pointed to the involvement of the Armed Islamic Group (Groupement Islamique Armé – “the GIA”). 9. In the course of the judicial investigation aimed at identifying the perpetrators, telephone tapping operations carried out on public payphones used by a certain B.B. led to a number of persons being arrested and to the search being focused on the United Kingdom and an individual named Elyes (also known as Elyesse or Eliass). The sources of these names or pseudonyms were a telephone conversation of 1 November concerning Elyes and the Western Union bank, a search of B.B.’s home during which a document was found showing that a sum of money had been transferred to B.B. from that bank on 16 October 1995, and the decoding of a list of telephone numbers found on B.B.’s person and at his home and featuring three numbers in England preceded by the name “Elyesse” or “Eliass”. B.B., who was arrested on 1 November 1995, also directly implicated “Ylies”, claiming that he had funded the campaign of attacks from London and had been kept informed of their progress. 10. On 3 November 1995 the French National Surveillance Directorate informed the investigators that the individual known as “Elyes, Ilyes, Lyes, Iliesse, Eliass or Elyasse”, whom B.B. had identified as having funded the attacks, might be the applicant. The latter, who was living in London, was suspected of being one of the leaders of the GIA in the United Kingdom, in particular because of his involvement with the publication Al Ansar (or Al Ansaar) which the GIA used as a mouthpiece abroad. 11. The investigations carried out in London established that the applicant had a home there and had a set of keys to a second London address, which served as the offices of the magazine Al Ansar and as a meeting place for all the persons involved in publishing and distributing it. On the premises the investigators found, among other items, the following: contracts for three mobile phones in the names of three of the applicants’ acquaintances and corresponding to the numbers identified at the home of B.B., who had rung the numbers before and after each attack; a receipt for the rental of a post-office box in the name of Fares ELIASS with the applicant’s fingerprints on it; letters and statements from the FIS; a statement saying that only the GIA was entitled to conduct the jihad; a letter from the GIA to the French President calling on him to convert to Islam; a letter commenting on the attacks carried out in France; copies of press articles on anti-terrorism mentioning the names of judges and members of the intelligence service; a piece of paper on which “Notre Dame 3314354-46-12” was written, corresponding to the telephone number of the Western Union branch at 4 rue du Cloître Notre Dame in Paris; and a receipt dated 21 July 1995 issued by a branch of Thomas Cook in London for a sum of 5,000 pounds sterling (GBP). 12. The applicant was arrested and placed in police custody from 4 to 7 November 1995 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. 13. On 7 November 1995 the applicant was detained pending extradition under the terms of an international arrest warrant issued on the same day in connection with the investigation into the attack carried out on 6 October 1995 close to the Maison Blanche metro station. 14. Three further international arrest warrants were issued concerning the applicant: on 24 November 1995 in relation to the attack of 17 October at the Gare d’Orsay station; on 29 January 1996 in the case concerning a conspiracy to prepare terrorist attacks; and on 16 January 2001 in relation to the attack carried out on 25 July 1995 at the Saint-Michel suburban rail station. 15. The applicant lodged habeas corpus applications which were dismissed in June 1997 and in 2001. On 8 October 2001 the British Home Secretary ordered his removal to France, but that order was quashed by the High Court, Queen’s Bench Division, on 27 June 2002. 16. On 6 April 2005 the Home Secretary signed a fresh order for the applicant’s extradition in the light of the assurances provided by the French authorities concerning the safeguards of a fair and impartial trial in France. On 14 October 2005 the High Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant. 17. On 1 December 2005 the applicant was handed over to the French authorities and was remanded in custody the following day. 18. By an order of 5 February 1999 the applicant was committed for trial in the Paris Criminal Court for involvement – in France and in England, from an unspecified date until 4 November 1995 – in an association or conspiracy formed with a view to the preparation, in the form of one or more material acts, of one of the terrorist acts in question. The investigating judge stated, in particular, as follows: “- [the applicant] was responsible for distributing the journal Al Ansar, a propaganda outlet of the Armed Islamic Group; - ... was involved on this account in disseminating propaganda for that organisation, which is banned in France; - ... was the main contact person in Europe for [D.Z.], alias Abou Abderhamane Amine, in organising and carrying out the GIA’s activities in Europe; - ... was tasked with sending money to GIA members still in France to enable them to fund and carry out attacks; - ... was in contact with numerous persons involved in and convicted of criminal conspiracy with a view to a terrorist enterprise.” 19. In a judgment of 29 March 2006 accompanied by over thirty pages of reasoning, the Criminal Court first of all set out the facts with regard to the “political/religious background”, the emergence of the FIS and then the GIA, the “background to the attacks” in 1995 – which it listed and described as attributable in all likelihood to the GIA – and the “context surrounding Rachid Ramda”. 20. Ruling on the criminal charges, the court began by examining the case against the applicant. It found that it could be established with certainty, on the basis of precise and concurring physical evidence, that the applicant had indeed used various false names and aliases which had come up in the course of the investigations, a fact the court described as “beyond doubt and indisputable”. With regard to the GIA’s funding the court, having noted the prosecution’s claims that the applicant had funded the GIA groups which carried out the attacks in France during the second half of 1995, examined the factual evidence in the case file at length and in detail. It observed in particular that, according to one witness who was a GIA member, the organisation’s groups had different specialisations depending on their location, with the London group being responsible for sending funds. The court further noted that the applicant had transferred GBP 5,000 on 16 October 1995, two days before the attack of 17 October 1995. This was established by the statements of the British police officers tasked with keeping the applicant under surveillance and of the staff of the Western Union branch where the transfer had been made, and also by the discovery of the applicant’s fingerprints on the transfer slip kept by the Western Union branch. The court also observed that one of the perpetrators of the attacks, B.B., had stated that the money used in preparing the various attacks had always been supplied by the applicant from London. The court inferred that the facts as a whole “demonstrate[d] that Rachid Ramda was indeed responsible for funding terrorist groups on French soil”. Furthermore, in response to the public prosecutor’s submissions concerning the applicant’s role in disseminating GIA propaganda, the first-instance court also considered the various items of factual evidence before it, and in particular the wealth of correspondence and propaganda documents relating to the GIA’s views and actions that had been found during the searches of the various premises used by the applicant, as well as the statements by a GIA member confirming the applicant’s role as a member of the team publishing the magazine Al Ansar, which was the GIA outlet used in particular to claim responsibility for attacks. It also noted the presence at the applicant’s home of pamphlets promoting terrorism and killing with specific reference to France. The court concluded that the applicant had played a part in disseminating GIA propaganda and ideas. 21. Turning next to the applicant’s involvement in a criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist enterprise, the court found this offence to have been made out, as the investigation had shown that several groups located in the Lyons area, in Paris and in Lille had been behind the 1995 attacks. All the members had either been directly involved or had played an indirect role by aiding and abetting and providing resources, and all of them were either known activists or claimed to be activists within the GIA. The court found that the applicant’s contacts with the various members of these networks, who had the shared goal of carrying out attacks, were sufficient to establish his conscious and deliberate participation in a conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts on French soil. In its judgment the court set out, among other findings, the facts showing the existence of links to eight members of three groups forming a support network for the GIA. 22. Accordingly, the Criminal Court found the applicant guilty of criminal conspiracy in connection with a terrorist enterprise, on the basis of Articles 450-1 and 421-1 of the Criminal Code. It sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment and ordered his permanent exclusion from French territory. The court cited as reasons for imposing the prison sentence the fact that “by providing funding and issuing propaganda on behalf of the GIA, Rachid RAMDA not only enabled the attacks to be carried out but acted as a propagandist, potentially attracting new members to strengthen the networks spread over several European countries”. It further cited the fact that “his double talk reveal[ed] both his bad faith and his complete lack of regret or remorse”. The court awarded one euro (EUR) in damages to the association SOS Attentats, which had joined the proceedings as a civil party. 23. In a final judgment of 18 December 2006 the Paris Court of Appeal upheld that judgment. While referring expressly to the statement of facts as established in the judgment, it devoted some thirty pages to analysing the charges against the applicant, giving reasons. First of all, the Court of Appeal gave further details concerning the evolution and operation of the GIA. It also specified that the case before it concerned “the series of attacks carried out in France in the summer and autumn of 1995”, and that “the facts of the case at hand concern[ed] the preparation of the attacks and the actions enabling the attacks, which started in France in July 1995, to be carried out”. The Court of Appeal went on to list the eight attacks carried out between 25 July and 17 October 1995. With particular reference to the evidence of the existence of an information hub based in London which the applicant had allegedly managed, it found this to be established on the basis of the telephone calls made on the day after the killing of the imam S. in Paris; two days before the attack on the Saint-Michel suburban rail station; on the day of that attack and the day after the attempted attack on the ParisLyon high-speed railway line at Cailloux-sur-Fontaines; on 12 September 1995, a few days after the attack of 3 September on Boulevard Richard Lenoir in Paris, the attempted attack of 4 September on Place Charles Vallin in Paris and the attack of 7 September in rue Jean-Claude Vivand in Villeurbanne; the day after the shooting at the Col de Maleval and the arrest of three people; five days before the attack of 6 October and two days after it; on 16 October 1995, in other words just before the attack of 17 October; and, finally, on 1 November 1995, immediately after a telephone conversation between B.B. and S.A.B. concerning preparations for an attack on the Wazemmes market in Lille, with B.B. stating that the purpose of the call was to report to the applicant on the “final preparations” for the Lille attack. 24. The Court of Appeal also emphasised the existence of several items of factual evidence pointing to the applicant’s involvement as the supervisor of a structure set up to fund the GIA’s activities. These included the fact that the applicant had sent funds from England on 16 October 1995 under the false name of Philippe Hervier, which had been received by B.B. at the Rivoli branch of the Rivaud bank under the false name of A. Benabbas, and which matched an entry in A.T.’s accounts book marked “36,800 francs, Lyseo” and B.B.’s statements; the payment by the applicant of GBP 5,000 and 50,000 French francs (FRF), as shown by an entry in A.T.’s accounts book which mentioned funds sent by “Walid”, a false name used by the applicant or the first name of one of his acquaintances who could be contacted in order to reach him; statements from several individuals concerning services offered in return for payment, fundraising, the sending of substantial sums of money, a transfer of EUR 4,000 to M. and the existence of a receipt for GBP 100. 25. Lastly, the Court of Appeal noted a series of facts demonstrating, firstly, that the applicant had been “the main contact person ... in organising and carrying out the GIA’s activities in Europe”, as was clear in particular from a telephone conversation of 2 December 1995, from the statements of a witness who was a GIA member, and from the detailed content of several documents seized in London (press statements, authorisations to conduct the jihad, documents on the management of funds, articles and handwritten notes on the activities of Islamist groups in Europe and anti-terrorist activities, notes on military weapons and the handling of explosives, and so on); secondly, that he had been “the GIA’s main propaganda agent outside Algeria”, with “his role on the magazine Al Ansaar” (particularly in the light of documents seized at the applicant’s London address, namely a note on how to make the magazine more dynamic, a letter explaining the means of distributing it, a piece of computer equipment which the applicant would have been unable to afford, letters from readers and GIA sympathisers, a large number of magazines detailing the GIA’s ideas and violent actions, a substantial amount of correspondence relating to Algerian and Islamic issues, some testimonies, and a list of post-office boxes in numerous countries, used by the magazine’s subscribers); thirdly, that he had been at the centre of “the London cell which revolved around [him and which] also served as a rallying point for young recruits passing through”, as demonstrated by the personal histories of four of them; and fourthly, that he had been a leader with “a strategic role in the GIA’s external organisation”, as demonstrated by his links to members and correspondents of other Islamist terrorist groups worldwide. 26. The Court of Appeal echoed the reasons given by the Criminal Court and added that there was sufficient evidence in the case to demonstrate that the applicant had been contacted regularly in order to be kept informed of events, that he had been responsible for funding GIA operations in Europe, that he had acted as a conduit for the GIA’s military command and as a propaganda agent for that organisation, especially through the magazine Al Ansar, that he had given shelter to fugitives passing through London and had sometimes been called upon to coordinate the GIA’s external activities. The Court of Appeal therefore concluded as follows: “The Court of Appeal, like the first-instance court, therefore finds it established that the GIA created ‘an external structure’ in Europe designed to enable it to pursue its goal of overthrowing the Algerian regime, including by attacking institutions and people in countries that supported or were deemed to support that regime, by setting up networks in Belgium and France in particular which provided support to the Algerian guerrillas by supplying weapons, munitions and various items of equipment, supplying jihadists and providing safe havens (accommodation and false identity papers) to fighters who were fleeing the maquis or had arrived to carry out attacks, organised and coordinated by a cell in London in charge of fundraising and using funds acquired lawfully or unlawfully. ... [the applicant] knowingly played a decisive role, by means of the material acts referred to by the Criminal Court and by this court above, in the achievement of the GIA’s goal, participating from London in the implementation of the group’s external structure, and played a vital role within the organisation whose aim was to prepare, assist in and carry out the attacks which took place.” 27. In a judgment of 14 March 2007 the Court of Cassation dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant. 28. In a judgment of 13 February 2001 the Investigation Division of the Paris Court of Appeal indicted B.B., S.A.B. and the applicant for the attack of 17 October 1995 and committed them for trial before the Paris special Assize Court. The applicant was charged with aiding and abetting the crimes of attempted murder, destroying or damaging property belonging to others by the use of an explosive substance causing mutilation or permanent disability and temporary total unfitness for work of over eight days or of a maximum of eight days, in connection principally or incidentally with a terrorist enterprise, and with the related offence of a breach of the explosives legislation in connection with a terrorist enterprise. 29. On 3 August and 27 November 2001 the Investigation Division of the Paris Court of Appeal upheld the orders issued by the Paris investigating judge on 27 April (concerning the attack of 25 July 1995) and 13 July 2001 (concerning the attack of 6 October 1995) for the indictment of the applicant and B.B. and their committal for trial before the special Assize Court. The applicant faced trial for aiding and abetting the crimes of murder, attempted murder, destroying or damaging property belonging to others by the use of an explosive substance causing death, mutilation or permanent disability and temporary total unfitness for work of over eight days or of a maximum of eight days, in connection with a terrorist enterprise, and for the related offence of a breach of the explosives legislation in connection with a terrorist enterprise. 30. These three judgments of the Investigation Division specified that the applicant had aided and abetted by: transmitting instructions from the GIA ordering attacks with explosives and providing B.B. with instructions on manufacturing; relaying to the GIA leadership operational information provided by the perpetrators of the attacks; providing the perpetrators with the funds needed not just to manufacture the explosive devices but also to make all the logistical arrangements for preparing and carrying out the attacks. The judgments of 13 February and 3 August 2001 added the fact that the funds had also been intended, if necessary, to enable the perpetrators based in France to flee. 31. In these judgments the judges noted in particular the following facts in relation to the applicant. The three mobile phones used by the applicant had received calls from B.B. on 16 and 22 October and 1 November 1995; a receipt for an exchange transaction performed on 16 October 1885 at 3.50 p.m. (Paris time) for an amount of FRF 36,800 had been discovered at B.B.’s home, together with a notice of transfer of FRF 38,000 from an English branch of Western Union, and the checks carried out established that the applicant had gone into a Londis shop in Wembley containing a Western Union office at 2.34 p.m. on 16 October 1995 and had re-emerged at 3.26 p.m. (London time); the applicant’s fingerprints had been found on the transfer slip kept by the Western Union office in the Londis shop; the words “LYESO – FF 36,600” had been found in the credit column of B.B.’s accounts and the words “West Union” and “West-Union Bank” had also been entered by B.B. in a document logging the details of the 17 October attack; the applicant had possessed the details of the Western Union branch in rue du Cloître in the Notre-Dame district of Paris; an exchange receipt dated 21 July 1995, for an amount of GBP 5,000 exchanged at a rate of 7.5%, had been found at the applicant’s home, with the number of a public payphone in Corbeil-Essonnes used by A.T. written on the back, and an entry had been made in the credit column of B.B.’s accounts for the sum of “5,000 pounds sterling from [W.], converted at a rate of 7.5%”; a sum of GBP 6,945 had been sent on 20 July 1995; between 20 and 25 July 1995 the sum of FRF 300 had been entered as expenditure for the purchase of a “GB ticket”, demonstrating that the funds, after being exchanged in England, had been transported to Paris in the days leading up to the attack at the SaintMichel suburban rail station; and a letter from British Telecom had been found, addressed to “Walid” at 122 Hamlet Gardens, the applicant’s address. The judges also noted, as evidence against the applicant, the content of a hard disk found in a London flat to which the applicant had keys, containing two financial reports, one relating to the activities of the GIA in Belgium and the other to a set of accounts for the period from September 1994 to 1 November 1995, the date of B.B.’s arrest. 32. In its judgment of 13 February 2001 concerning the attack of 17 October 1995 the Investigation Division observed in particular that the applicant’s three telephone numbers had been called repeatedly from payphones used by B.B., around the time of the different attacks and in particular on the day before the attack of 17 October 1995. It compared these calls with the statements made by B.B. and a further accomplice, who had been planning an attack on Lille city market, according to which they had reported to the applicant on preparations for the operations, and in particular for the attack of 17 October 1995. The Investigation Division also noted that the applicant had made a transfer of FRF 36,800 from London the day before that attack – as shown by the fact that his fingerprints had been found on the transfer slip in the Western Union office in London – which had been received by B.B. in Paris on the same day. The link between that transfer and the attack of 17 October 1995 had also been established by B.B.’s statements and by a call made to the applicant’s mobile phone the same day, after the money had been received. 33. In its judgment of 3 August 2001 relating more specifically to the attack of 25 July 1995, the Investigation Division stressed that the applicant’s English mobile phone had been called two days before that attack from a public payphone in Paris close to B.B.’s home from which other calls had been made, including a call to a mobile phone belonging to a member of the French GIA network, made one minute before the applicant was called. Furthermore, the day before the attack and then on the day itself, the applicant had received calls from France on his various numbers, including from a payphone close to the previous one, concerning his role as an intermediary between the perpetrators of the attacks and the person masterminding them in Algeria. Above all, the Investigation Division noted that the applicant had on 2 and 20 July 1995 sent sums of GBP 5,000 and GBP 6,945 respectively which were directly linked to the attack carried out on 25 July 1995. 34. Lastly, in its judgment of 27 November 2001 the Investigation Division also noted that it was clear from these different elements that the applicant had sent funds to the perpetrators of the attacks, not just in relation to the campaign of attacks as a whole but also for use directly in carrying out the attack of 6 October 1995. With regard to the latter, it noted that the instructions issued by the GIA concerning the campaigns, which had been accompanied by advice on the manufacture of explosives, had been transmitted via the applicant, who had also funded all the operational arrangements put in place in France in order to ensure the success of the attacks, and that the recipients had been required to report to him on how the money had been used. A number of telephone calls had established that the applicant had been kept informed of the progress of the attacks, and in particular of the attack of 6 October 1995, which had been followed by a telephone call on 8 October 1995 telling the applicant that everything had gone well on 6 October. 35. On 26 October 2007 the Paris special Assize Court, composed of seven professional judges, found the applicant guilty as charged in connection with the three attacks. It sentenced him to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twenty-two years. The applicant appealed on 29 October 2007. 36. The appeal proceedings before the Paris special Assize Court, this time composed of nine professional judges, took place from 16 September to 13 October 2009. One hundred and ninety-six individuals joined the proceedings as civil parties, as did the RATP (the Paris public-transport operator), the SNCF (the French national rail company), the Guarantee Fund for victims of terrorist acts and other crimes, the Government Law Officer and the association SOS Attentats. 37. At the hearing of 16 September 2009 counsel for the applicant made submissions requesting the termination of the proceedings and a finding that the prosecution was null and void, on the basis of the ne bis in idem principle. Citing Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 and the judgment in Sergey Zolotukhin v. Russia, delivered by the Grand Chamber of the Court on 10 February 2009, they argued that the material acts which the Assize Court was called on to examine were the same as those of which the applicant had previously been convicted by the Paris Court of Appeal in its final judgment of 18 December 2006. In counsel’s view, the material acts alleged in the Assize Court proceedings, namely the transfer of funds to the perpetrators of the attacks, the transmission of instructions to the same perpetrators, and the monitoring of the preparation and carrying-out of the attacks, had also been alleged in the Criminal Court proceedings. 38. In an interlocutory judgment of 17 September 2009 the special Assize Court dismissed the objection regarding a breach of the ne bis in idem principle, finding as follows: “Although Rachid RAMDA’s defence counsel correctly points out that Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 must be understood as prohibiting the prosecution or trial of a second ‘offence’ in so far as it arises from identical facts or facts which are substantially the same, the following factors need to be taken into consideration in the present case: - The facts on which the criminal courts based their finding that Rachid RAMDA was guilty, while they related to criminal acts dealt with in the current set of proceedings, were by no means confined to them. In finding the offence of criminal conspiracy to be made out – a separate offence that is provided for and punishable under Article 450-1 of the Criminal Code – the courts considered all the elements apt to substantiate the accused’s involvement in the conspiracy, which was aimed at organising, developing and ensuring the continuation of a movement that was bent on imposing its cause, in particular by using clandestine methods and material and intellectual resources (recruitment of and regular contact with activists, dissemination of information on the GIA’s activities and views, fundraising, seeking donations of weapons and various items of equipment, etc.), without necessarily pursuing the sole objective of carrying out the attacks that are the subject of the proceedings. - The facts to be considered by this court differ substantially from the earlier ones in that they relate to criminal conduct aimed at the achievement of one-off objectives which were determined with precision and were not inextricably linked, and which were driven by a specific motivation consisting in particular in providing others, in full knowledge of the situation, with the means of deliberately harming human life or individuals’ physical or mental integrity by the use of explosives. - In these circumstances the finding that Rachid RAMDA was guilty and his conviction by the Paris Court of Appeal cannot lead the Assize Court to find that his prosecution has lapsed and to declare the criminal proceedings against him null and void. - It is thus the task of the Assize Court, on conclusion of the proceedings and in the light thereof, to rule, by answering the questions raised before it, as to whether or not Rachid RAMDA is guilty of aiding and abetting as charged ...” 39. In an interlocutory judgment of 24 September 2009 the special Assize Court of Appeal deferred its decision on a request for further information and eventually rejected the request in a further interlocutory judgment of 8 October 2009. 40. Sixty-three questions concerning the applicant alone were put to the special Assize Court of Appeal. Twenty-six related to the circumstances surrounding the attack of 25 July 1995, eighteen to the events surrounding the attack of 6 October 1995 and nineteen to the attack of 17 October 1995. The questions gave precise details of the various alleged acts and where and when they had been committed, and listed the names of dozens of victims of killings and attempted killings, mutilation or permanent disability, injuries resulting in unfitness for work of up to eight days or more, and victims of damage to their property. The answer to sixty-one of the questions was “yes”, by a majority (some questions, followed by a list of victims and requiring an individual reply in each case, were also found partly “devoid of purpose”), and two questions were found to be “devoid of purpose”. Besides details regarding the places and dates concerned in each instance, as well as the indication of the victims according to the damage suffered (death, mutilation or permanent disability, temporary total unfitness for work of over eight days and of a maximum of eight days, destruction of or damage to property), the questions related in particular to whether or not the applicant’s actions had been premeditated (questions nos. 2, 8, 28 and 46), and to incitement of others to commit certain acts (questions nos. 5, 11, 20, 25, 31, 36, 43, 49, 57 and 62), the assistance lent by the applicant to the perpetrators of the attacks (questions nos. 10, 19, 24, 30, 35, 42, 48, 56 and 61) and whether the applicant had issued instructions to others to commit certain crimes (questions nos. 6, 12, 21, 26, 32, 37, 44, 50, 58 and 63). The parties did not comment on these questions. 41. An affirmative answer was given to the questions whether the applicant had knowingly assisted in the manufacture or possession of explosive devices and in issuing instructions to that effect, in the context of the attacks of 25 July and 6 and 17 October 1995, and whether he had knowingly incited others to manufacture or possess such devices in the context of the attacks of 25 July and 17 October 1995. 42. In a judgment of 13 October 2009 the special Assize Court of Appeal found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twenty-two years, and ordered his permanent exclusion from French territory. It adjourned the civil hearing for a later date. The applicant appealed on points of law. 43. On 15 June 2011 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. Regarding his ground of appeal to the effect that no reasons had been given for the finding of guilt, based in particular on Article 6 of the Convention, it found as follows: “Firstly, the impugned questions, which were put in accordance with the law, established in all aspects the acts of aiding and abetting of which Mr Ramda was found guilty. Secondly, the judgment convicting Mr Ramda included the answers which the judges comprising the special Assize Court of Appeal gave immediately after the oral proceedings, on the basis of their personal conviction and by a majority following a secret vote, to the questions concerning his guilt which were put to them in accordance with the operative provisions of the committal orders and were the subject of adversarial argument. Accordingly, and given that steps were taken to ensure the prior investigation of the charges contained in the indictment, the free exercise of the rights of the defence, and the public and adversarial nature of the proceedings, the requirements laid down by the statutory and Convention provisions relied on were satisfied.” 44. As to the ground of appeal concerning a breach of the ne bis in idem principle on account of the applicant’s final conviction by the Paris Court of Appeal on 18 December 2006 on the basis of identical facts, the Court of Cassation held that criminal conspiracy was a separate offence from the crimes prepared or committed by its members and also from the offences characterised by certain material acts that embodied it. ...",[],[],[],"['6', 'P7']","['6-1', 'P7-4']",[],0

The applicants, Mr Dušan Lončar, Ms Miholjka Lončar and Mr Miloš Lončar, are Croatian nationals, who were born in 1951 and 1972 respectively. They all live in Vojnić and were represented before the Court by Ms S. Čanković, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. 2. The first applicant died on 1 June 2013. 3. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik. 4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5. During 1991 and 1992 Serbian paramilitary forces gained control over about a third of the territory of Croatia and proclaimed the “Serbian Autonomous Region of Krajina” (Srpska autonomna oblast Krajina, hereinafter “Krajina”). At the beginning of August 1995 the Croatian authorities announced their intention to take military action with the aim of regaining control over “Krajina”. The operation was codenamed “Storm” and took place from 4 to 7 August 1995. Before the military action, the vast majority of the population of “Krajina” had fled Croatia. They went firstly to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and later on many of them went to live in Serbia. Some returned to Croatia after the war. The number of people who fled is estimated at between 100,000 and 150,000. 6. In January 2005 the authorities learned that a close relative of the applicants, N.L., had been killed during the operation “Storm” or immediately afterwards, in August 1995, on the territory of “Krajina”. The police opened an inquiry into the circumstances of his death. 7. In January 2006 the police interviewed the first and second applicants, who had no direct knowledge about the circumstances in which N.L. had died. 8. M.L., also interviewed in January 2006, said that in August 1995 she had been in a convoy comprising people, tractors and “military armoured vehicles”. N.L. had also been in that convoy. He had been dressed in a Serbian army uniform and had been wearing an army mask. The convoy had been attacked but she had not seen how N.L. had died. R.T., interviewed at the same time, confirmed M.L.’s statement. 9. On 10 July 2006 the applicants lodged a criminal complaint with the State Attorney’s Office against unknown perpetrators in connection with the killing of N.L. 10. On 11 April 2008 the body of N.L. was exhumed. It was dressed in a military uniform with a military identity card. 11. On 21 May 2008 the Sisak County State Attorney’s Office dismissed the applicants’ criminal complaint on the grounds that N.L. had been killed in combat between a unit of the paramilitary Serbian forces and the Fifth Corpus of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina. This decision was served on the applicants’ representative on 28 May 2008.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
128,001-160441,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,PEACOCK v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Aleš Pejchal;Kristina Pardalos;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano,"1. The applicant, Mr Mark Peacock, is a British national, who was born in 1969 and lives in Preston. He was represented before the Court by Tuckers Solicitors, a law firm based in London. The Government were represented by their Agent, Ms R. Sagoo, of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. On 7 January 1997 the applicant pleaded guilty at the Crown Court to conspiracy to supply drugs. On 8 January 1997 he was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment. On 5 October 1998 the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment. Meanwhile, the prosecution applied for confiscation orders under section 2 of the Drug Trafficking Act 1994 (“the 1994 Act” – see paragraphs 22-25 below). 4. On 10 July 1997 the Crown Court judge found that the applicant had benefited from drug trafficking in the sum of 273,717.50 pounds sterling (“GBP”). He was found to have realisable assets in the sum of GBP 823. A confiscation order was made for the latter sum to be paid within fourteen days. The applicant paid the order. 5. On 9 November 2000 the applicant was released from prison. He entered a business partnership with his father. The business was successful and the applicant acquired substantial assets. 6. The prosecution subsequently became aware of the value of the applicant’s equity in the business. It applied to the High Court for a certificate under section 16(2) of the 1994 Act (see paragraph 23 below) declaring that the amount that might be realised from the applicant’s assets was greater than it had been at the time when the original confiscation order was made. On 18 May 2005 the High Court issued a certificate under section 16(2). 7. The prosecution subsequently applied to the Crown Court under section 16(4) of the 1994 Act (see paragraph 24 below) for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order. 8. A hearing took place over a seven-day period. Evidence was lodged of the further assets identified. The applicant lodged witness statements and gave oral evidence on oath. He accepted that he had acquired further assets since his release from prison but submitted that he had taken a conscious decision to live an entirely honest, law-abiding and hard-working life. 9. On 26 October 2007 the Crown Court judge handed down his judgment. He identified two issues: the first was a factual question as to the existence and value of further recoverable assets; the second concerned the exercise of the court’s discretion to order further payment and impose a term of imprisonment in the event of non-compliance. The judge indicated that his assessment of the applicant’s credibility would be a significant factor in both aspects of the case. He declined the prosecution’s invitation to take account of adverse credibility findings made in the context of the earlier confiscation proceedings, explaining that he began on the basis that convicted criminals were able to rehabilitate themselves and to turn from crime. However, taking into consideration the incomplete details of his assets in his first witness statement made in 2006 and his subsequent evasiveness when giving oral evidence, the judge concluded that the applicant was not a reliable witness. 10. After considering in some detail the applicant’s assets and business activities, the judge found the applicant to hold realisable assets to the value of GBP 348,315.54. However, he added: “40. ... [T]hat is not, necessarily, the end of the matter. I preface this section by specific remarks about [the applicant’s] credibility ... [H]e failed, at the outset, to make proper disclosure of his finances. The discovered torn up paper relating to matters in Spain was revealing, particularly with its reference to a few business interests and to not wishing to declare matters. His explanations were risible. Furthermore, despite his protestations of honesty since his release from prison, there was clear evidence of fraudulent dealing with mortgage lenders in the supply of financial information ... I find [the applicant] to be an intelligent man, fully aware of all aspects of his business dealings. I find, too, that he has over a period dealt to a large extent in cash, with the specific intention of frustrating any enquiries by Authorities into his financial affairs ...” 11. In the light of his findings, the judge then turned to consider how to exercise his discretion as to whether the confiscation order should be increased. He explained that had he found the applicant a credible witness, who had set out to lead a law-abiding and responsible life, he might have felt able to give sympathetic consideration to submissions that the court’s discretion should be exercised in his favour. However, he was satisfied that the applicant had lied to the court and had set out quite deliberately to deceive the court as to the truth as to his financial affairs and assets. In the judge’s view, this was entirely the type of case for which statute had provided the opportunity for society to recoup some of the damage caused to it by criminality. The judge also considered the length of time which had elapsed since the applicant’s release from prison but decided that this did not prevent the modification of the confiscation order. He accordingly exercised his discretion to substitute for the GBP 823 originally recoverable the full amount of the benefit previously assessed, namely GBP 273,717.50. The order was to be paid within six months, with a period of imprisonment of three years in the event of non-compliance. 12. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, contesting the calculation of his assets by the Crown Court judge and seeking a reduction in the recoverable amount. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on 20 February 2009. 13. The applicant subsequently appealed the decision of the High Court to issue a section 16(2) certificate (see paragraph 6 above). He argued that section 16(2) was not intended to allow confiscation of after-acquired assets (i.e. assets acquired after the date of conviction). If that had been the intention of Parliament, the statutory provision should have been unequivocal. He emphasised in particular that other provisions of the 1994 Act set a time-limit of six years to revisit a confiscation decision, but that no time-limit appeared in section 16(2). He contended that the definition of realisable property in section 6(2) of the Act was restricted to property held at the time of the original confiscation proceedings. Finally, he submitted that section 16 no longer had effect after the entry into force of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 in 2003 (see paragraph 22 below). 14. The appeal was dismissed by the Court of Appeal (Civil Division) on 20 December 2010. The court held that section 16 applied to assets lawfully acquired post-conviction, referring to the absence of any time limitation in that section. This conclusion was not undermined by the fact that the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 contained clearer provisions on the matter. Finally, the court held that the savings provisions in the relevant commencement order made under the 2002 Act clarified that section 16 remained in force for the purposes of the present proceedings. 15. The applicant appealed the December 2010 judgment to the Supreme Court. The agreed statement of facts and issues before the Supreme Court identified the issues which had arisen before the Court of Appeal as follows: “i. Whether, having regard to the transitional provisions contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Commencement No. 5, Transitional Provisions, Savings and Amendment) Order 2003 ..., section 16 of the 1994 Act (which was repealed by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002) was in force at the material time (‘the Commencement Order issue’). ii. Whether the High Court had jurisdiction to issue a certificate under section 16 in respect of after-acquired assets (‘the section 16 issue’). iii. whether in the Appellant’s case the delay between the making of the confiscation order and the application under section 16 amounted to a breach of the Appellant’s right to have his case heard within a reasonable time (‘the reasonable time issue’).” 16. It clarified that the issues before the Supreme Court were the following: “1. Whether section 16 of the 1994 Act was in force at the material time. 2. Whether the High Court has jurisdiction to issue a certificate under section 16 in respect of after-acquired assets.” 17. The applicant’s written case included the following argument: “C. The Compatibility Issue The interpretation of the statute by the Court of Appeal ... is in conflict with a defendant’s rights under Article 6(1) of the Convention ... For a defendant to be liable in perpetuity to an increased penal sanction is submitted to amount to a clear breach of his right to determination of any criminal charge within a reasonable time, as well as raising issues under Article 8 ... and the First Protocol (protection of property). The construction of Article 16(2) contended for by the Appellant is compliant with the Human Rights Act whereas the interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal arguably is not.” 18. As regards the section 16 issue, in particular, the written case included the following statements: “The definition of the words ‘the amount that might be realised’ in section 6 and 64 of the Act provide a clear definition of the scope of the legislation.” “If, which is not accepted, there is any ambiguity in the words of the statute, an examination of the debates of the Bill in the House of Lords and the House of Commons and in the Home Affairs Committee Report make it clear that the scope envisaged did not include ‘after acquired assets’.” “The Appellant’s case was not that Section 16(2) was unclear and ambiguous ... To the contrary, it was submitted that the words of the section clearly do not refer to assets acquired after the confiscation order was made.” 19. On 22 February 2012 the Supreme Court delivered its judgment. On the question whether section 16 was still in force at the time of the second confiscation proceedings, the court was satisfied that it was. 20. As to the correct interpretation of section 16(2), the justices were divided by three votes to two, with the majority finding that the section applied to after-acquired assets and dismissing the applicant’s appeal after careful consideration of the legislative framework. Lord Brown, for the majority, explained: “29. As for the main argument, based on fairness and rehabilitation, naturally I recognise that Parliament could have chosen a different policy with regard to after-acquired assets. But it seems to me perfectly understandable that in fact Parliament decided (as indisputably it did when later enacting POCA [the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002]) to leave it open to the courts as a matter of discretion to mulct a defendant of his criminal gains on an ongoing basis irrespective of precisely how and when he came by any increased wealth. 30. That the court does indeed have a discretion in the matter is plain both from the wording of section 16(4) and from a number of authorities ... This is not, however, the occasion to explore the approach to the proper exercise of that discretion – or, indeed, the question whether its exercise could ever be affected by considerations arising under the Human Rights Act 1998. As already noted, there is no challenge here to the exercise of the Crown Court’s section 16(4) discretion, only to whether the section 16(2) certificate was lawfully issued.” 21. Lord Hope, in the minority, referred to the general principle of construction that a statute should not be held to take away property rights without compensation unless the intention to do so was expressed in terms which were clear and unambiguous. He was therefore of the view that where assets were subsequently acquired entirely legitimately, it ought not to be assumed that Parliament intended their confiscation unless it provided for this in clear terms. While the relevant provision in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 satisfied this test, Lord Hope considered that section 16(2) of the 1994 Act did not. 22. The applicable legislation at the time was the Drug Trafficking Act 1994. The 1994 Act has now been replaced by the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. 23. Section 16 of the 1994 Act allowed for the increase in the value of a confiscation order in certain circumstances. It applied where the amount which a person was ordered to pay by a confiscation order was less than the amount assessed to be the value of his proceeds of drug trafficking. Pursuant to section 16(2) and (3), if, on an application by a prosecutor, the High Court was satisfied that the amount that might be realised was greater than the amount taken into account in making the confiscation order, it had to issue a certificate to that effect, with reasons. 24. Section 16(4) allowed a prosecutor who obtained a section 16(2) certificate to apply to the Crown Court for an increase in the amount to be recovered under the confiscation order. Upon such an application, the court had discretion to: “(a) substitute for that amount such amount (not exceeding the amount assessed as the value referred to in subsection (1) above) as appears to the court to be appropriate having regard to the amount now shown to be realisable; and (b) increase the term of imprisonment or detention fixed in respect of the confiscation order ... if the effect of the substitution is to increase the maximum period applicable in relation to the order ...” 25. Section 6(1) of the Act provided that the amount that might be realised at the time a confiscation order was made was the total of the values at that time of all the realisable property held by the defendant, less the total amount of any obligations having priority, together with the total value of all gifts caught by the Act. Pursuant to section 6(2), “realisable property” meant any property held by the defendant and any property held by a person to whom the defendant had made a gift caught by the Act. 26. The Human Rights Act 1998 (“the 1998 Act”) incorporates the Convention into United Kingdom law. Section 3(1) of the Act provides that so far as it is possible to do so, legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. Under section 7(1) of the Act, a person who claims that a public authority has acted in a way which is incompatible with Convention rights may rely on the Convention rights concerned in any legal proceedings. Section 2 of the Act requires a court determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right to take into account the case-law of this Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
129,001-150524,ENG,LVA,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,ĀBOLIŅŠ v. LATVIA,4,Inadmissible,Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Mr Raitis Āboliņš, is a Latvian national, who was born in 1977 and lives in Jēkabpils. 2. 3. On 1 February 2006 the applicant was arrested in connection with criminal proceedings against him. On 16 May 2006 the applicant’s criminal case was transferred to the Vidzeme Regional Court (Vidzemes apgabaltiesa) for adjudication. On 3 May 2007 the Vidzeme Regional Court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment, with subsequent two-year period of police supervision. On 22 February 2008 the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Krimināllietu tiesu palāta) rejected the applicant’s appellate complaint. The Court has no information on whether an appeal on points of law was lodged against the decision of 22 February 2008. 4. The applicant submitted that following his detention he was placed in a short-term detention facility located within the police station in Madona. The applicant had spent most of the pre-trial detention in Valmiera Prison, but whenever he had had to be questioned he had been brought to the short-term detention facility in Madona for between ten and twenty days. Altogether he had spent approximately 100 days in that facility. 5. The applicant made the following submissions on the conditions in the short-term detention facility in Madona. The applicant had not been provided with a mattress, pillow, blanket or bed linen, and had had to sleep on wooden planks. The artificial light had been too weak to permit reading or writing, and in fact had only lit one third of the cell’s total area. The noise from the ventilation machinery had been so loud as to prevent him from sleeping. The toilet had been merely a hole in a platform. Furthermore, the said platform had been fifty centimetres high, which had caused the applicant particular difficulty because he had had a category 3 disability (the least severe disability level) on account of his ankle injury. Furthermore, the applicant had been given food only once a day and had not been allowed outdoor exercise. 6. Following his conviction, the applicant was placed in Daugavpils Prison. The applicant submitted that he had been placed in a cell hosting ten inmates and that he had had to sleep on the top bunk of a bunk bed, despite his disability. Moreover, there had been too little space between the top bunk and the ceiling. Furthermore, the applicant had had no access to radio or television. Finally, half of his cell mates had smoked and there had been no ventilation. 7. On 30 July 2008, on the basis of the applicant’s inquiries, the Ministry of Health informed the applicant that in prisons it was only permitted to smoke in premises specifically set aside for that purpose. 8. Section 7 of the Law on Holding Procedures for Arrested Persons (Aizturēto personu turēšanas kārtības likums), which came into force on 21 October 2005, provides, inter alia, that an arrested person must be provided with food three times a day and drinking water at any time. It lays down the requisite areas of holding cells. It also requires every arrested person to be provided with a separate sleeping place, a mattress and a blanket. It further states that holding cells must be equipped with a toilet that is partitioned off from the cell. Holding cells must also have access to natural light and, during the night-time and dusk, must have artificial lighting. They also must be ventilated. Furthermore, if the detained person is placed in the short-term detention facility for more than 24 hours, she or he is entitled to at least 30 minutes’ outdoor exercise. Section 1 of the same Law states that these provisions are also applicable to detainees and prisoners who have been taken to a short-term detention facility for reasons of procedural acts falling under criminal proceedings. 9. The requisite conditions of detention for detainees are primarily laid down in the Law on Detention Procedure (Apcietinājumā turēšanas kārtības likums), which came into force on 18 July 2006. Section 19 of this Law sets out the minimum areas of cells, which must be ventilated, and requires detainees to be provided with an individual sleeping place. Section 13(1)(10) allows detainees to use a radio and a small television. With regard to convicted persons, similar conditions are provided for in section 471 and section 77 of the Sentence Enforcement Code (Latvijas Sodu izpildes kodekss). 10. Section 11 of the Law on Restrictions regarding the Sale, Advertising and Use of Tobacco Products (Likums “Par tabakas izstrādājumu realizācijas, reklāmas un lietošanas ierobežošanu”), effective since 21 January 1997, sets out the restrictions on smoking. In particular, section 11(1)(2) prohibits smoking in detention facilities, apart from in premises specially set aside for that purpose. Section 11(1)(2) adds that the internal rules of the relevant establishment may provide for the possibility of smoking outside such premises, having due regard to the physical and mental health of the inmates. 11. Regulation no. 827 (2005) of the Cabinet of Ministers, effective since 5 November 2005, provides that the Head of the Prisons Administration decides on legal challenges brought by private individuals against “administrative acts” issued by or “actions of a public authority” taken by its subordinate officers, unless otherwise prescribed by law (paragraph 6 and 13). The decision of the Head of the Prisons Administration can be brought to court (para 13). 12. The Administrative Procedure Law (Administratīvā procesa likums), which came into force on 1 February 2004, provides for the right to challenge administrative acts and actions of public authorities before the administrative courts. The relevant provisions of the Law were summarised in the case of Melnītis v. Latvia (no. 30779/05, §§ 24-26, 28 February 2012). 13. Section 195 of the Administrative Procedure Law, at the time of the latter’s enactment, provided that the court could order an interim measure (pagaidu noregulējums) where there was reason to believe that the execution of the court’s judgment might become difficult or impossible. With the amendments to the Administrative Procedure Law which took effect on 1 December 2006, section 195 was modified, and currently states that the court may order an interim measure where there is reason to believe that if the impugned administrative act remained in force, it could cause significant harm or damage, the prevention or restitution of which could be made very difficult or would require disproportionate resources, and where, upon examination of the information available to the court, the impugned administrative act appears prima facie unlawful. Since the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Law, the available relevant interim measures have been either a court’s ruling that would replace the requested administrative act or action by a public authority, or a court decision ordering the relevant institution to perform or refrain from a certain action, within a set time limit (section 196).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano,"10. The applicants, who are all French nationals, are Mr Pierre Lambert and his wife Mrs Viviane Lambert, who were born in 1929 and 1945 respectively and live in Reims, Mr David Philippon, who was born in 1971 and lives in Mourmelon, and Mrs Anne Tuarze, who was born in 1978 and lives in Milizac. They are the parents, a half-brother and a sister respectively of Vincent Lambert, who was born on 20 September 1976. 11. Vincent Lambert sustained serious head injuries in a road-traffic accident on 29 September 2008, which left him tetraplegic and in a state of complete dependency. According to the expert medical report ordered by the Conseil d’État on 14 February 2014, he is in a chronic vegetative state (see paragraph 40 below). 12. From September 2008 to March 2009 he was hospitalised in the resuscitation wing, and subsequently the neurology ward, of ChâlonsenChampagne Hospital. From March to June 2009 he was cared for in the heliotherapy centre in BercksurMer, before being moved on 23 June 2009 to the unit in Reims University Hospital providing follow-up and rehabilitative care to patients in a vegetative or minimally conscious state, where he remains to date. The unit accommodates eight patients. Vincent Lambert receives artificial nutrition and hydration which is administered enterally, that is, via a gastric tube. 13. In July 2011 Vincent Lambert was assessed by a specialised unit of Liège University Hospital, the Coma Science Group, which concluded that he was in a chronic neuro-vegetative state characterised as “minimally conscious plus”. In line with the recommendations of the Coma Science Group he received daily sessions of physiotherapy from September 2011 to the end of October 2012, which yielded no results. He also received 87 speech and language therapy sessions between March and September 2012, in an unsuccessful attempt to establish a code of communication. Attempts were also made to sit the patient in a wheelchair. 14. As Vincent Lambert’s carers had observed increasing signs in 2012 of what they believed to be resistance on his part to daily care, the medical team initiated in early 2013 the collective procedure provided for by the Act of 22 April 2005 on patients’ rights and end-of-life issues (see paragraph 54 below). Rachel Lambert, the patient’s wife, was involved in the procedure. 15. The procedure resulted in a decision by Dr Kariger, the doctor in charge of Vincent Lambert and head of the department in which he is hospitalised, to withdraw the patient’s nutrition and reduce his hydration. The decision was put into effect on 10 April 2013. 16. On 9 May 2013 the applicants applied to the urgent-applications judge of the ChâlonsenChampagne Administrative Court on the basis of Article L. 521-2 of the Administrative Courts Code (urgent application for protection of a fundamental freedom (référé liberté)), seeking an injunction ordering the hospital, subject to a coercive fine, to resume feeding and hydrating Vincent Lambert normally and to provide him with whatever care his condition required. 17. In an order dated 11 May 2013 the urgent-applications judge granted their requests. The judge held that, since no advance directives had been drawn up by Vincent Lambert, and in the absence of a person of trust within the meaning of the relevant provisions of the Public Health Code, the collective procedure should be continued with his family, despite the fact that the latter was divided as to what should become of the patient. The judge noted that, while Vincent Lambert’s wife had been involved in the procedure, it was clear from examination of the case that his parents had not been informed that it had been applied, and that the decision to withdraw nutrition and limit hydration, the nature of and reasons for which had not been disclosed to them, had not respected their wishes. 18. The judge held accordingly that these procedural shortcomings amounted to a serious and manifestly unlawful breach of a fundamental freedom, namely the right to respect for life, and ordered the hospital to resume feeding and hydrating Vincent Lambert normally and to provide him with whatever care his condition required. 19. In September 2013 a fresh collective procedure was initiated. Dr Kariger consulted six doctors, including three from outside the hospital (a neurologist, a cardiologist and an anaesthetist with experience in palliative medicine) chosen by Vincent Lambert’s parents, his wife and the medical team respectively. He also had regard to a written contribution from a doctor in charge of a specialised extended care facility within a nursing home. 20. Dr Kariger also convened two meetings with the family, on 27 September and 16 November 2013, which were attended by Vincent Lambert’s wife and parents and his eight siblings. Rachel Lambert and six of the eight brothers and sisters spoke in favour of discontinuing artificial nutrition and hydration, while the applicants were in favour of maintaining it. 21. On 9 December 2013 Dr Kariger called a meeting of all the doctors and almost all the members of the care team. Following that meeting Dr Kariger and five of the six doctors consulted stated that they were in favour of withdrawing treatment. 22. On conclusion of the consultation procedure Dr Kariger announced on 11 January 2014 his intention to discontinue artificial nutrition and hydration on 13 January, subject to an application to the administrative court. His decision, comprising a reasoned thirteen-page report, a sevenpage summary of which was read out to the family, observed in particular that Vincent Lambert’s condition was characterised by irreversible brain damage and that the treatment appeared to be futile and disproportionate and to have no other effect than to sustain life artificially. According to the report, the doctor had no doubt that Vincent Lambert had not wished, before his accident, to live under such conditions. Dr Kariger concluded that prolonging the patient’s life by continuing to treat him with artificial nutrition and hydration amounted to unreasonable obstinacy. 23. On 13 January 2014 the applicants made a further urgent application to the ChâlonsenChampagne Administrative Court for protection of a fundamental freedom under Article L. 521-2 of the Administrative Courts Code, seeking an injunction prohibiting the hospital and the doctor concerned from withdrawing Vincent Lambert’s nutrition and hydration and an order for his immediate transfer to a specialised extended care facility in Oberhausbergen run by the association AmrésoBethel (see paragraph 8 above). Rachel Lambert and François Lambert, Vincent Lambert’s nephew, intervened in the proceedings as third parties. 24. The Administrative Court, sitting as a full court of nine judges, held a hearing on 15 January 2014. In a judgment of 16 January 2014 it suspended the implementation of Dr Kariger’s decision of 11 January 2014. 25. The Administrative Court began by observing that Article 2 of the Convention did not prevent States from making provision for individuals to object to potentially life-prolonging treatment. It likewise did not prevent the doctor in charge of a patient who was unable to express his or her wishes and whose treatment the doctor considered, after implementing a series of safeguards, to amount to unreasonable obstinacy, from withdrawing that treatment, subject to supervision by the Medical Council, the hospital’s ethics committee, where applicable, and the administrative and criminal courts. 26. The Administrative Court went on to find that it was clear from the relevant provisions of the Public Health Code, as amended following the Act of 22 April 2005 and as elucidated by the parliamentary proceedings, that artificial enteral nutrition and hydration – which were subject, like medication, to the distribution monopoly held by pharmacies, were designed to supply specific nutrients to patients with impaired functions and required recourse to invasive techniques to administer them – constituted a form of treatment. 27. Observing that Dr Kariger’s decision had been based on the wish apparently expressed by Vincent Lambert not to be kept alive in a highly dependent state, and that the latter had not drawn up any advance directives or designated a person of trust, the Administrative Court found that the views he had confided to his wife and one of his brothers had been those of a healthy individual who had not been faced with the immediate consequences of his wishes, and had not constituted the formal manifestation of an express wish, irrespective of his professional experience with patients in a similar situation. The court further found that the fact that Vincent Lambert had had a conflictual relationship with his parents, since he did not share their moral values and religious commitment, did not mean that he could be considered to have expressed a clear wish to refuse all forms of treatment, and added that no unequivocal conclusion as to his desire or otherwise to be kept alive could be drawn from his apparent resistance to the care provided. The Administrative Court held that Dr Kariger had incorrectly assessed Vincent Lambert’s wishes. 28. The Administrative Court also noted that, according to the report drawn up in 2011 by Liège University Hospital (see paragraph 13 above), Vincent Lambert was in a minimally conscious state, implying the continuing presence of emotional perception and the existence of possible responses to his surroundings. Accordingly, the administering of artificial nutrition and hydration was not aimed at keeping him alive artificially. Lastly, the court considered that, as long as the treatment did not cause any stress or suffering, it could not be characterised as futile or disproportionate. It therefore held that Dr Kariger’s decision had constituted a serious and manifestly unlawful breach of Vincent Lambert’s right to life. It issued an order suspending the implementation of the decision while rejecting the request for the patient to be transferred to the specialised extended care facility in Oberhausbergen. 29. In three applications lodged on 31 January 2014 Rachel Lambert, François Lambert and Reims University Hospital appealed against that judgment to the urgent-applications judge of the Conseil d’État. The applicants lodged a cross-appeal, requesting Vincent Lambert’s immediate transfer to the specialised extended care facility. The National Union of Associations of Head Injury and Brain Damage Victims’ Families (UNAFTC, see paragraph 8 above) sought leave to intervene as a third party. 30. At the hearing on the urgent application held on 6 February 2014 the President of the Judicial Division of the Conseil d’État decided to refer the case to the full court, sitting as a seventeen-member Judicial Assembly. 31. The hearing before the full court took place on 13 February 2014. In his submissions to the Conseil d’État, the public rapporteur cited, inter alia, the remarks made by the Minister of Health to the members of the Senate examining the bill known as the Leonetti bill: “While the act of withdrawing treatment ... results in death, the intention behind the act [is not to kill; it is] to allow death to resume its natural course and to relieve suffering. This is particularly important for care staff, whose role is not to take life.” 32. The Conseil d’État delivered its ruling on 14 February 2014. After joining the applications and granting UNAFTC leave to intervene, the Conseil d’État defined in the following terms the role of the urgentapplications judge called upon to rule on the basis of Article L. 5212 of the Administrative Courts Code: “Under [Article L. 521-2], the urgent-applications judge of the administrative court, when hearing an application of this kind justified by particular urgency, may order any measures necessary to safeguard a fundamental freedom allegedly breached in a serious and manifestly unlawful manner by an administrative authority. These legislative provisions confer on the urgent-applications judge, who normally decides alone and who orders measures of an interim nature in accordance with Article L. 511-1 of the Administrative Courts Code, the power to order, without delay and on the basis of a ‘plain and obvious’ test, the necessary measures to protect fundamental freedoms. However, the urgent-applications judge must exercise his or her powers in a particular way when hearing an application under Article L. 521-2 ... concerning a decision taken by a doctor on the basis of the Public Health Code which would result in treatment being discontinued or withheld on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy and the implementation of which would cause irreversible damage to life. In such circumstances the judge, sitting where applicable as a member of a bench of judges, must take the necessary protective measures to prevent the decision in question from being implemented where it may not be covered by one of the situations provided for by law, while striking a balance between the fundamental freedoms in issue, namely the right to respect for life and the patient’s right to consent to medical treatment and not to undergo treatment that is the result of unreasonable obstinacy. In such a case, the urgentapplications judge or the bench to which he or she has referred the case may, as appropriate, after temporarily suspending the implementation of the measure and before ruling on the application, order an expert medical report and, under Article R. 625-3 of the Administrative Courts Code, seek the opinion of any person whose expertise or knowledge are apt to usefully inform the court’s decision.” 33. The Conseil d’État found that it was clear from the very wording of the relevant provisions of the Public Health Code (Articles L. 11105, L. 11114 and R. 412737) and from the parliamentary proceedings that the provisions in question were general in scope and applied to Vincent Lambert just as they did to all users of the health service. The Conseil d’État stated as follows: “It is clear from these provisions that each individual must receive the care most appropriate to his or her condition and that the preventive or exploratory acts carried out and the care administered must not subject the patient to disproportionate risks in relation to the anticipated benefits. Such acts must not be continued with unreasonable obstinacy and may be discontinued or withheld where they appear to be futile or disproportionate or to have no other effect than to sustain life artificially, whether or not the patient is in an end-of-life situation. Where the patient is unable to express his or her wishes, any decision to limit or withdraw treatment on the ground that continuing it would amount to unreasonable obstinacy may not be taken by the doctor, where such a measure is liable to endanger the life of the patient, without the collective procedure defined in the Code of Medical Ethics and the rules on consultation laid down in the Public Health Code having been followed. If the doctor takes such a decision he or she must at all events preserve the patient’s dignity and dispense palliative care. Furthermore, it is clear from the provisions of Articles L. 1110-5 and L. 1111-4 of the Public Health Code, as elucidated by the parliamentary proceedings prior to the passing of the Act of 22 April 2005, that the legislature intended to include among the forms of treatment that may be limited or withdrawn on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy all acts which seek to maintain the patient’s vital functions artificially. Artificial nutrition and hydration fall into this category of acts and may accordingly be withdrawn where continuing them would amount to unreasonable obstinacy.” 34. The Conseil d’Étatwithdraw treatment whose continuation would amount to unreasonable obstinacy had been met. To that end it needed to have the fullest information possible at its disposal, in particular concerning Vincent Lambert’s state of health. Accordingly, it considered it necessary before ruling on the application to order an expert medical report to be prepared by practitioners with recognised expertise in neuroscience. The experts – acting on an independent and collective basis, after examining the patient, meeting the medical team and the care staff and familiarising themselves with the patient’s entire medical file – were to give their opinion on Vincent Lambert’s current condition and provide the Conseil d’État with all relevant information as to the prospect of any change. 35. The Conseil d’État decided to entrust the expert report to a panel of three doctors appointed by the President of the Judicial Division on proposals from the President of the National Medical Academy, the Chair of the National Ethics Advisory Committee and the President of the National Medical Council respectively. The remit of the panel of experts, which was to report within two months of its formation, read as follows: “(i) to describe Mr. Lambert’s current clinical condition and how it has changed since the review carried out in July 2011 by the Coma Science Group of Liège University Hospital; (ii) to express an opinion as to whether the patient’s brain damage is irreversible and as to the clinical prognosis; (iii) to determine whether the patient is capable of communicating, by whatever means, with those around him; (iv) to assess whether there are any signs to suggest at the present time that Mr Lambert reacts to the care being dispensed to him and, if so, whether those reactions can be interpreted as a rejection of that care, as suffering, as a desire for the life-sustaining treatment to be withdrawn or, on the contrary, as a desire for the treatment to be continued.” 36. The Conseil d’État also considered it necessary, in view of the scale and the difficulty of the scientific, ethical and deontological issues raised by the case and in accordance with Article R. 625-3 of the Administrative Courts Code, to request the National Medical Academy, the National Ethics Advisory Committee and the National Medical Council, together with Mr Jean Leonetti, the rapporteur for the Act of 22 April 2005, to submit general written observations by the end of April 2014 designed to clarify for it the application of the concepts of unreasonable obstinacy and sustaining life artificially for the purposes of Article L. 1110-5, referred to above, with particular regard to individuals who, like Vincent Lambert, were in a minimally conscious state. 37. Lastly, the Conseil d’État rejected the applicants’ request for Vincent Lambert to be transferred to a specialised extended care facility (see paragraph 29 above). 38. The experts examined Vincent Lambert on nine occasions. They familiarised themselves with the entire medical file, and in particular the report of the Coma Science Group in Liège (see paragraph 13 above), the treatment file and the administrative file, and had access to all the imaging tests. They also consulted all the items in the judicial case file of relevance for their expert report. In addition, between 24 March and 23 April 2014 they met all the parties (the family, the medical and care team, the medical consultants and representatives of UNAFTC and the hospital) and carried out a series of tests on Vincent Lambert. 39. On 5 May 2014 the experts sent their preliminary report to the parties for comments. Their final report, submitted on 26 May 2014, provided the following replies to the questions asked by the Conseil d’État. 40. The experts found that Vincent Lambert’s clinical condition corresponded to a vegetative state, without any signs pointing to a minimally conscious state. Furthermore, they stressed that he had difficulty swallowing and had seriously impaired motor functions of all four limbs, with significant retraction of the tendons. They noted that his state of consciousness had deteriorated since the assessment carried out in Liège in 2011. 41. The experts pointed out that the two main factors to be taken into account in assessing whether or not brain damage was irreversible were, firstly, the length of time since the accident which had caused the damage and, secondly, the nature of the damage. In the present case they noted that five and a half years had passed since the initial head injury and that the imaging tests showed severe cerebral atrophy testifying to permanent neuron loss, near-total destruction of strategic regions such as both parts of the thalamus and the upper part of the brain stem, and serious damage to the communication pathways in the brain. They concluded that the brain damage was irreversible. They added that the lengthy period of progression, the patient’s clinical deterioration since July 2011, his current vegetative state, the destructive nature and extent of the brain damage and the results of the functional tests, coupled with the severity of the motor impairment of all four limbs, pointed to a poor clinical prognosis. 42. In the light of the tests carried out, and particularly in view of the fact that the course of speech and language therapy carried out in 2012 had not succeeded in establishing a code of communication, the experts concluded that Vincent Lambert was not capable of establishing functional communication with those around him. 43. The experts observed that Vincent Lambert reacted to the care provided and to painful stimuli, but concluded that these were nonconscious responses. In their view, it was not possible to interpret them as conscious awareness of suffering or as the expression of any intent or wish with regard to the withdrawal or continuation of treatment. 44. On 22 and 29 April and 5 May 2014 the Conseil d’État received the general observations of the National Medical Council, Mr Jean Leonetti, rapporteur for the Act of 22 April 2005, the National Medical Academy and the National Ethics Advisory Committee. The National Medical Council made clear in particular that, in using the expression “no other effect than to sustain life artificially” in Article L. 11105 of the Public Health Code, the legislature had sought to address the situation of patients who not only were being kept alive solely by the use of methods and techniques replacing key vital functions, but also, and above all, whose cognitive and relational functions were profoundly and irreversibly impaired. It emphasised the importance of the notion of temporality, stressing that where a pathological condition had become chronic, resulting in the person’s physiological deterioration and the loss of his or her cognitive and relational faculties, obstinacy in administering treatment could be regarded as unreasonable if no signs of improvement were apparent. Mr Leonetti stressed that the Act was applicable to patients who had brain damage and thus suffered from a serious condition which, in the advanced stages, was incurable, but who were not necessarily “at the end of life”. Accordingly, the legislature, in the title of the Act, had referred to “patients’ rights and endoflife issues” rather than “patients’ rights in endoflife situations”. He outlined the criteria for unreasonable obstinacy and the factors used to assess it and stated that the reference to treatment having “no other effect than to sustain life artificially”, which was stricter than the wording originally envisaged (namely, treatment “which prolongs life artificially”) was more restrictive and referred to artificially sustaining life “in the purely biological sense, in circumstances where, firstly, the patient has major irreversible brain damage and, secondly, his or her condition offers no prospect of a return to awareness of self or relationships with others”. He pointed out that the Act gave the doctor sole responsibility for the decision to withdraw treatment and that it had been decided not to pass that responsibility on to the family, in order to avoid any feelings of guilt and to ensure that the person who took the decision was identified. The National Medical Academy reiterated the fundamental prohibition barring doctors from deliberately taking another’s life, which formed the basis for the relationship of trust between doctor and patient. The Academy reiterated its long-standing position according to which the Act of 22 April 2005 was applicable not only to the various “end-of-life” situations, but also to situations raising the very difficult ethical issue of the “ending of life” in the case of patients in “survival” mode, in a minimally conscious or chronic vegetative state. The National Ethics Advisory Committee conducted an indepth analysis of the difficulties surrounding the notions of unreasonable obstinacy, treatment and sustaining life artificially, summarised the medical data concerning minimally conscious states and addressed the ethical issues arising out of such situations. It recommended in particular a process of reflection aimed at ensuring that the collective discussions led to a genuine collective decision-making process and that, where no consensus could be reached, there was a possibility of mediation. 45. A hearing took place on 20 June 2014 before the Conseil d’État. In his submissions the public rapporteur stressed, in particular, the following: “... [t]he legislature did not wish to impose on those in the caring professions the burden of bridging the gap which exists between allowing death to take its course when it can no longer be prevented and actively causing death by administering a lethal substance. By discontinuing treatment, a doctor is not taking the patient’s life, but is resolving to withdraw when there is nothing more to be done.” The Conseil d’État delivered its judgment on 24 June 2014. After granting leave to MarieGeneviève Lambert, Vincent Lambert’s half-sister, to intervene as a third party, and reiterating the relevant provisions of domestic law as commented on and elucidated in the general observations received, the Conseil d’État examined in turn the applicants’ arguments based on the Convention and on domestic law. 46. On the first point the Conseil d’État reiterated that, where the urgentapplications judge was called on to hear an application under Article L. 521-2 of the Administrative Courts Code (urgent application for protection of a fundamental freedom) concerning a decision taken by a doctor under the Public Health Code which would result in treatment being discontinued or withheld on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy, and implementation of that decision would cause irreversible damage to life, the judge was required to examine any claim that the provisions in question were incompatible with the Convention (see paragraph 32 above). 47. In the case before it the Conseil d’État replied in the following terms to the arguments based on Articles 2 and 8 of the Convention: “Firstly, the disputed provisions of the Public Health Code defined a legal framework reaffirming the right of all persons to receive the most appropriate care, the right to respect for their wish to refuse any treatment and the right not to undergo medical treatment resulting from unreasonable obstinacy. Those provisions do not allow a doctor to take a life-threatening decision to limit or withdraw the treatment of a person incapable of expressing his or her wishes, except on the dual, strict condition that continuation of that treatment would amount to unreasonable obstinacy and that the requisite safeguards are observed, namely that account is taken of any wishes expressed by the patient and that at least one other doctor and the care team are consulted, as well as the person of trust, the family or another person close to the patient. Any such decision by a doctor is open to appeal before the courts in order to review compliance with the conditions laid down by law. Hence the disputed provisions of the Public Health Code, taken together, in view of their purpose and the conditions attaching to their implementation, cannot be said to be incompatible with the requirements of Article 2 of the Convention ..., or with those of Article 8...” The Conseil d’État also rejected the applicants’ arguments based on Articles 6 and 7 of the Convention, finding that the role entrusted to the doctor under the provisions of the Public Health Code was not incompatible with the duty of impartiality flowing from Article 6, and that Article 7, which applied to criminal convictions, was not relevant to the case before it. 48. Regarding the application of the relevant provisions of the Public Health Code, the Conseil d’État held as follows: “Although artificial nutrition and hydration are among the forms of treatment which may be withdrawn in cases where their continuation would amount to unreasonable obstinacy, the sole fact that a person is in an irreversible state of unconsciousness or, a fortiori, has lost his or her autonomy irreversibly and is thus dependent on such a form of nutrition and hydration, does not by itself amount to a situation in which the continuation of treatment would appear unjustified on grounds of unreasonable obstinacy. In assessing whether the conditions for the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration are met in the case of a patient with severe brain damage, however caused, who is in a vegetative or minimally conscious state and is thus unable to express his or her wishes, and who depends on such nutrition and hydration as a means of life support, the doctor in charge of the patient must base his or her decision on a range of medical and non-medical factors whose relative weight cannot be determined in advance but will depend on the circumstances of each patient, so that the doctor must assess each situation on its own merits. In addition to the medical factors, which must cover a sufficiently long period, be assessed collectively and relate in particular to the patient’s current condition, the change in that condition since the accident or illness occurred, his or her degree of suffering and the clinical prognosis, the doctor must attach particular importance to any wishes the patient may have expressed previously, whatever their form or tenor. In that regard, where such wishes remain unknown, they cannot be assumed to consist in a refusal by the patient to be kept alive in the current conditions. The doctor must also take into account the views of the person of trust, where the patient has designated such a person, of the members of the patient’s family or, failing this, of another person close to the patient, while seeking to establish a consensus. In assessing the patient’s particular situation, the doctor must be guided primarily by a concern to act with maximum beneficence towards the patient...” 49. The Conseil d’État 50. In that connection the Conseil d’État ruled as follows: “Firstly, it is clear from the examination of the case that the collective procedure conducted by Dr Kariger ..., prior to the taking of the decision of 11 January 2014, was carried out in accordance with the requirements of Article R. 4127-37 of the Public Health Code and involved the consultation of six doctors, although that Article simply requires that the opinion of one doctor and, where appropriate, of a second be sought. Dr Kariger was not legally bound to allow the meeting of 9 December 2013 to be attended by a second doctor designated by Mr Lambert’s parents in addition to the one they had already designated. Nor does it appear from the examination of the case that some members of the care team were deliberately excluded from that meeting. Furthermore, Dr Kariger was entitled to speak with Mr François Lambert, the patient’s nephew. The fact that Dr Kariger opposed a request for him to withdraw from Mr Lambert’s case and for the patient to be transferred to another establishment, and the fact that he expressed his views publicly, do not amount, having regard to all the circumstances of the present case, to a failure to comply with the obligations implicit in the principle of impartiality, which Dr Kariger respected. Accordingly, contrary to what was argued before the Châlons-en-Champagne Administrative Court, the procedure preceding the adoption of the decision of 11 January 2014 was not tainted with any irregularity. Secondly, the experts’ findings indicate that ‘Mr Lambert’s current clinical condition corresponds to a vegetative state’, with ‘swallowing difficulties, severe motor impairment of all four limbs, some signs of dysfunction of the brainstem’ and ‘continued ability to breathe unaided’. The results of the tests carried out from 7 to 11 April 2014 to assess the patient’s brain structure and function ... were found to be consistent with such a vegetative state. The experts found that the clinical progression, characterised by the disappearance of the fluctuations in Mr Lambert’s state of consciousness recorded during the assessment carried out in July 2011 by the Coma Science Group at Liège University Hospital and by the failure of the active therapies recommended at the time of that assessment, were suggestive of ‘a deterioration in the [patient’s] state of consciousness since that time’. Furthermore, according to the findings set out in the experts’ report, the exploratory tests which were carried out revealed serious and extensive brain damage, as evidenced in particular by ‘severe impairment of the structure and metabolism of the sub-cortical regions of crucial importance for cognitive function’ and ‘major structural dysfunction of the communication pathways between the regions of the brain involved in consciousness’. The severity of the cerebral atrophy and of the damage observed, coupled with the five-and-a-half-year period that had elapsed since the initial accident, led the experts to conclude that the brain damage was irreversible. Furthermore, the experts concluded that ‘the lengthy period of progression, the patient’s clinical deterioration since 2011, his current vegetative state, the destructive nature and the extent of the brain damage, the results of the functional tests and the severity of the motor impairment of all four limbs’ pointed to a ‘poor clinical prognosis’. Lastly, while noting that Mr Lambert was capable of reacting to the care administered and to certain stimuli, the experts indicated that the characteristics of those reactions suggested that they were non-conscious responses. The experts did not consider it possible to interpret these behavioural reactions as evidence of ‘conscious awareness of suffering’ or as the expression of any intent or wish with regard to the withdrawal or continuation of the treatment keeping the patient alive. These findings, which the experts reached unanimously following a collective assessment in the course of which the patient was examined on nine separate occasions, thorough cerebral tests were performed, meetings were held with the medical team and care staff involved and the entire file was examined, confirm the conclusions drawn by Dr Kariger as to the irreversible nature of the damage and Mr Lambert’s clinical prognosis. The exchanges which took place in the adversarial proceedings before the Conseil d’État subsequent to submission of the experts’ report do nothing to invalidate the experts’ conclusions. While it can be seen from the experts’ report, as just indicated, that Mr Lambert’s reactions to care are not capable of interpretation and thus cannot be regarded as expressing a wish as to the withdrawal of treatment, Dr Kariger in fact indicated in the impugned decision that the behaviour concerned was open to various interpretations, all of which needed to be treated with great caution, and did not include this aspect in the reasons for his decision. Thirdly, the provisions of the Public Health Code allow account to be taken of a patient’s wishes expressed in a form other than advance directives. It is apparent from the examination of the case, and in particular from the testimony of Mrs Rachel Lambert, that she and her husband, both nurses, had often discussed their respective professional experiences in dealing with patients under resuscitation and those with multiple disabilities, and that Mr Lambert had on several such occasions clearly voiced the wish not to be kept alive artificially if he were to find himself in a highly dependent state. The tenor of those remarks, reported by Mrs Rachel Lambert in precise detail and with the corresponding dates, was confirmed by one of Mr Lambert’s brothers. While these remarks were not made in the presence of Mr Lambert’s parents, the latter did not claim that their son could not have made them or that he would have expressed wishes to the contrary, and several of Mr Lambert’s siblings stated that the remarks concerned were in keeping with their brother’s personality, past experience and personal opinions. Accordingly, in stating among the reasons for the decision at issue his certainty that Mr Lambert did not wish, before his accident, to live under such conditions, Dr Kariger cannot be regarded as having incorrectly interpreted the wishes expressed by the patient before his accident. Fourthly, the doctor in charge of the patient is required, under the provisions of the Public Health Code, to obtain the views of the patient’s family before taking any decision to withdraw treatment. Dr Kariger complied with this requirement in consulting Mr Lambert’s wife, parents and siblings in the course of the two meetings referred to earlier. While Mr Lambert’s parents and some of his brothers and sisters opposed the discontinuing of treatment, Mr Lambert’s wife and his other siblings stated their support for the proposal to withdraw treatment. Dr Kariger took these differentd that the fact that the members of the family were not unanimous as to what decision should be taken did not constitute an impediment to his decision. It follows from all the above considerations that the various conditions imposed by the law before any decision can be taken by the doctor in charge of the patient to withdraw treatment which has no effect other than to sustain life artificially, and whose continuation would thus amount to unreasonable obstinacy, may be regarded, in the case of Mr Vincent Lambert and in the light of the adversarial proceedings before the Conseil d’État, as having been met. Accordingly, the decision taken by Dr Kariger on 11 January 2014 to withdraw the artificial nutrition and hydration of Mr Vincent Lambert cannot be held to be unlawful.” 51. Accordingly, the Conseil d’État set aside the Administrative Court’s judgment and dismissed the applicants’ claims.",[],[],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],0

Serghides;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra,"1. The applicant, Mr Yasir Cabi Qadir Mucalim, is a Somali national, who was born in 1992 and lives in Almelo. He was represented before the Court initially by Mr P. Bouwman and later by Mr M.P. Ufkes, both of them lawyers practising in Helmond at relevant times. 3. On 24 August 2009 the applicant arrived at Schiphol (Amsterdam) Airport where he requested asylum. 4. On 29 August 2009 he was interviewed about his identity, nationality and travel itinerary (eerste gehoor). It emerged that he had lodged a previous asylum request in Malta. 5. A Dublin Claim interview (gehoor Dublinclaim) was held on 31 August 2009 in which the applicant described the conditions in which he had been detained in Malta. Asylum-seekers lived in tents, the camp was overcrowded and sanitary facilities were filthy. He objected to being sent back to Malta as he did not wish to face the same conditions of detention again. 6. On 29 September 2009 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) rejected the applicant’s asylum request on the ground, in so far as relevant to the case before the Court, that under Article 16 of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national (“the Dublin Regulation”) the State responsible for examining his application for asylum was Malta and Malta had agreed to take him back. 7. The applicant appealed to the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague on 2 October 2009. As relevant to the case before the Court, he alleged that sending him back to Malta would expose him to conditions of detention violating Article 3 of the Convention. He submitted documents in support of this allegation. At the same time he requested a provisional measure in the form of a stay of deportation. 8. On 15 January 2010 the Regional Court of The Hague (sitting in Zwolle) dismissed both the request for a provisional measure and the appeal, finding that the applicant had failed to make out his case that Malta would fail to meet her Conventional obligations towards him. 9. The applicant lodged a further appeal (hoger beroep) with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State) on 22 January 2010, at the same time requesting the President of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division to order a provisional measure in the form of a stay of deportation. 10. On 27 January 2010 the President of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division dismissed the request for a provisional measure on the ground that the applicant’s deportation did not appear imminent. 11. On 29 January 2010 the applicant lodged a new request for a provisional measure, stating that his deportation to Malta had been scheduled for 1 February 2010. 12. On the same day the President of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division gave a decision dismissing the request on the ground that the applicant’s further appeal was unlikely to succeed. 13. On 18 March 2010 the Administrative Jurisdiction Division dismissed the applicant’s further appeal on summary reasoning. 14. The relevant European, Maltese and Netherlands law, instruments, principles and practice in respect of asylum proceedings, reception of asylum-seekers and transfers of asylum-seekers under the Dublin Regulation are set out in Tarakhel v. Switzerland [GC], no. 29217/12, §§ 28-48, ECHR 2014 (extracts); Hussein Diirshi v. the Netherlands and Italy and 3 other applications ((dec.), nos. 2314/10, 18324/10, 47851/10 and 51377/10, §§ 98‑117, 10 September 2013); Mohammed Hussein v. the Netherlands and Italy ((dec.), no. 27725/10, §§ 25-28 and 33-50, 2 April 2013); Suso Musa v. Malta, no. 42337/12, §§ 23-32, 23 July 2013; and Aden Ahmed v. Malta, no. 55352/12, §§ 31-39, 23 July 2013. 15. By letter of 7 March 2012, the Agent of the Maltese Government submitted replies to questions of the Judge Rapporteur (Rule 44 § 3 (a) of the Rules of Court). As relevant to the case now before the Court, these included the following: “Upon return to Malta in terms of the Dublin Regulation if an applicant is still considered to be an asylum seeker, and if he so wishes, the applicant will be housed in an open centre where he will be provided with shelter and medical care pending the determination of his request for protection in Malta.” and “When aliens are returned to Malta, they are not taken into police custody unless it results that an offence (not including their irregular entry into, or exit from, Malta) was committed by them in Malta. Moreover, aliens who are rejected asylum seekers and who are returned to Malta will not be deprived of their liberty but efforts will be made for them to be returned to their country of origin.” 16. By letter of 28 June 2012, the Agent of the Maltese Government supplemented this information. His letter included the following: “The applicant applied for refugee status and a Preliminary Questionnaire was filled [in] by the applicant on the 22nd July 2008 and the interview with the Refugee Commissioner was held on the 5th January 2009; On the 27th January 2009, the applicant was granted Subsidiary Protection and he was released from detention on the 29th January 2009 and was transferred to the open centre. Thus, the applicant was put in detention for six months (from the 12th July 2008 till the 29th January 2009); ...” 17. The applicant did not submit any comments on either letter relevant to the case now before the Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
132,001-148237,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,V.J. v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"1. The applicant, Mr V.J., is an Angolan national who was born in 1989. The President granted the applicant’s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). He was represented before the Court by Mr Pirkka Lappalainen, a lawyer practising in Tampere. 2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant is a 25-year-old single male from Angola. He originates from Kakongo city in Cabinda province. His whole family belonged to the FLEC-FAC party (Frente de Libertação do Estado de Cabinda - Forças Armadas de Cabinda), supporting and fighting for the independence of Cabinda. His parents were killed by the Angolan security forces when he was three years old. The applicant, together with his brother and sister, went to live with his uncle and the uncle’s wife after the incident. The applicant’s uncle had an important role in the FLEC-FAC, being the representative of the party and coordinating its activities in their neighbourhood. The uncle was held for approximately two years in Yabi prison when the applicant was still at school. The applicant was also a member of the party but his activities within the party were minor, mostly limited to distributing leaflets. 5. The applicant described his problems with the authorities as first starting when he was around 14 years old (in 2003). He was selling tinned food at the market when he ended up having a disagreement with a buyer who subsequently reported him to the police, alleging that he was conspiring to kill an important army colonel. The applicant was apparently held for a long time (around 2 years) in detention without a trial, but eventually his uncle managed to buy his release. The conditions in detention were extremely poor and he also claimed to have been beaten and stripped naked. 6. The events that led to his flight from Angola happened in late 2008. When returning home after his working day at the market, the applicant found that his uncle, brother and sister had been killed in the house. His uncle’s wife and his own common-law wife, who was also living in the same house at the time, had disappeared. The applicant has not had any information about them since. He heard that some people from his village had managed to escape to the Democratic Republic of Congo and suspected that perhaps his spouse and his uncle’s wife were among those people. Subsequently, the applicant was taken by FAA (Angolan Armed Forces) soldiers to an unknown location where some 15 other persons were held. The applicant was questioned about the whereabouts of his uncle’s documents concerning FLEC-FAC and ill-treated by the soldiers. He was beaten on the head with the butt of a rifle, his feet were beaten and burned, he was shot in the leg and the surface of his chest was cut with a knife. Approximately five or six days later he managed to escape, together with another FLEC-FAC activist who had also been held captive. The applicant walked back to his village and went to see the local priest, who helped him to flee Angola. He stayed for a while with a friend of the priest and in a church in Luanda. Eventually the priest organised his escape through a smuggler. The applicant flew to Moscow and travelled by car to Finland, where he arrived on 17 April 2009. 7. On 10 July 2009 a general physician examined the applicant. The applicant had already been hospitalised in May and June 2009 for epileptic fits which were at first diagnosed as psychogenic or caused by injuries to the head. The general physician reported scarring in several places on the applicant’s body and diagnosed him as suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder. He referred the applicant to the Centre for Torture Survivors in Finland (Kidutettujen kuntoutuskeskus, Centret för rehabilitering av tortyroffer) for further examination and treatment. The applicant was examined on two occasions, on 3 December 2009 and 13 January 2010 respectively, by the physiotherapist of the Centre for Torture Survivors who reported that the applicant had altogether six visible scars on his body. Two 1 to 3 cm long scars were found on his forehead and half of his front teeth were missing. Other scars were detected on his chest, leg and feet, all matching his description of the torture he had suffered. The applicant complained also of chest pain and difficulties in breathing from time to time, which he claimed had been caused by being kicked in the chest. He was also very sensitive to touch in general, which the physician concluded to be most likely a psychological symptom of ill-treatment. The applicant had therapy sessions with both the psychiatrist and the psychologist of the Centre for Torture Survivors from 27 November 2009 until at least December 2012. In their various medical reports the psychiatrist and the psychologist concluded that the applicant’s psychological condition was consistent with him having experienced severe and multiple trauma, compatible with his claim of having been tortured and having experienced the killing of his family. The psychiatrist diagnosed the applicant with severe depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and reported him as suffering also from slight memory problems. His symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder and his memory problems eased during treatment and the applicant managed to begin studies in Finland. From 27 to 29 August 2011 the applicant was again hospitalised due to severe epileptic fits occurring despite medication. He was referred to a neurologist for follow-up. 8. As from the end of October 2012 the applicant was reported to be suicidal and was shortly admitted to intensive mental care. 9. On 17 April 2009 the applicant sought asylum immediately on arrival in Finland. 10. On 27 May 2010 the Finnish Immigration Service (Maahanmuuttovirasto, Migrationsverket) rejected his application and decided to send him back to Angola. In its decision the Immigration Service referred extensively and in detail to the applicant’s asylum interview and found several discrepancies in his story. It noted that on some occasions the applicant gave exact dates and on other occasions he could not place the events at a specific moment in time. The Immigration Service found the applicant’s story of his escape, in a wounded state, from the FAA soldiers to be unlikely and not credible. The Immigration Service concluded that as there were such credibility issues, the applicant’s scars could have been caused by other means than torture, as he claimed. It also doubted whether the applicant was from Cabinda province. 11. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen), requesting that the Immigration Service’s decision be quashed and he be granted asylum, or alternatively, secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances. He also requested that an oral hearing be held. The applicant also submitted to the court several new medical certificates, noting that it was common that such trauma as torture and epilepsy affect negatively a person’s memory and ability to recount events consistently. 12. On 19 August 2011 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal and refused his request for an oral hearing as unnecessary. It noted, however, that the discrepancies in the applicant’s story were minor and did not give reason to doubt that he originated from Cabinda. On the other hand, the Administrative Court did not consider it likely that the applicant would have been arrested and tortured after the rest of the family had been killed. The applicant’s previous arrest when he was 14 years old seemed to be unconnected with later events. The Administrative Court considered, furthermore, that it was not likely that Angolan officials would be interested in the applicant now that his uncle was dead. Although the human rights situation in Cabinda was not very satisfactory, it concluded that the applicant could be returned there without a real risk of ill-treatment. 13. On an unspecified date the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltnings-domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Administrative Court. 14. On 12 October 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. The applicant was notified of the decision on 30 October 2012. 15. On 21 December 2012 the applicant lodged a new asylum application, referring to the same grounds as in his first application. He also submitted new medical certificates, arguing that his current state of health prevented his removal or that removal to Angola would amount to inhuman treatment as no medical treatment would be available for him there. He also submitted certificates of his studies in Finland and relied on them as grounds for a residence permit. 16. On 15 January 2013 the Immigration Service rejected the application after having examined it in a fast-track procedure and decided to expel him to Angola. It also imposed a two-year-ban on entry into Finland and the Schengen-area. The Immigration Service considered that the applicant’s situation had not changed since the previous application and that there were no grounds for a residence permit or grounds preventing the applicant’s removal to Angola. It noted that the situation in the Cabinda area had calmed down, even though some attacks were still reported between the Angolan army and some rebel groups of the FLEC-FAC. However, the applicant could relocate internally to other parts of Angola if he wished. As for his health, the Immigration Service noted that mental health care was available in Angola, although a shortage of medical staff in general was reported. Post-traumatic stress disorder could be treated in one private clinic in Luanda. The treatment of epilepsy was not mentioned. 17. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court, requesting again that a stay on removal be granted. 18. On 7 February 2013 the Administrative Court notified the applicant that the request for interim measures had been refused. The applicant’s appeal before the Administrative Court remained pending before that court. 19. On 19 September 2013 the Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s appeal. 20. By letter dated 21 October 2013 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, requesting that the Administrative Court’s decision be quashed and he be granted asylum or, alternatively, secondary protection or a residence permit due to individual humanitarian circumstances. He claimed that his vulnerability continued to increase and that he was clearly in need of protection. 21. On 17 April 2014 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal. 22. According to Article 9, paragraph 4, of the Constitution of Finland (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag; Act no. 731/1999), the right of foreigners to enter Finland and to remain in the country is regulated by an Act. A foreigner shall not be deported, extradited or returned to another country, if in consequence he or she is in danger of a death sentence, torture or other treatment violating human dignity. 23. According to section 87, subsection 1, of the Aliens Act (ulkomaalaislaki, utlänningslagen; Act no. 301/2004), aliens residing in the country are granted asylum if they reside outside their home country or country of permanent residence owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of ethnic origin, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion and if they, because of this fear, are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country. 24. Section 88, subsection 1, of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009) provides that an alien residing in Finland is issued with a residence permit on grounds of subsidiary protection if the requirements for granting asylum under section 87 are not met, but substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person, if returned to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence, would face a real risk of being subjected to serious harm, and he or she is unable, or owing to such risk, unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. Serious harm means: 1) the death penalty or execution; 2) torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or 3) serious and individual threat as a result of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflicts. 25. Under section 88a of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009), an alien residing in Finland is issued with a residence permit on the basis of humanitarian protection, if there are no grounds under section 87 or 88 for granting asylum or providing subsidiary protection, but he or she cannot return to his or her country of origin or country of former habitual residence as a result of an environmental catastrophe or a bad security situation which may be due to an international or internal armed conflict or a poor human rights situation. 26. According to section 88b of the Act (as amended by Act no. 323/2009), the well-founded fear of being persecuted referred to in section 87b or the real risk of being subjected to serious harm referred to in section 88 may be based on incidents after the applicant’s departure from his or her home country or country of permanent residence or on acts that the applicant has participated in since his or her departure. 27. Section 98, subsection 2, of the Act (as amended by Act no. 432/2009) provides that the requirements for issuing a residence permit are assessed individually for each applicant by taking account of the applicant’s statements on his or her circumstances in the State in question and of real time information on the circumstances in that State obtained from various sources. After obtaining the statement, the authorities shall decide on the matter in favour of the applicant on the basis of his or her statement if the applicant has contributed to the investigation of the matter as far as possible, and if the authorities are convinced of the veracity of the application with regard to the applicant’s need for international protection. 28. According to section 147 of the Act, no one may be refused entry and sent back or deported to an area where he or she could be subject to the death penalty, torture, persecution or other treatment violating human dignity or from where he or she could be sent to such an area. 29. Section 147b of the Aliens Act (as amended by Act no. 1214/2013) incorporates into the Finnish legal system the Council Decision 2004/573/EC of 29 April 2004 on the organisation of joint flights for removals from the territory of two or more member States, of third-country nationals who are subjects of individual removal orders. The annex to the Decision contains common guidelines on security provisions for joint removals by air including, inter alia, an obligation for the Member States to ensure that the returnees for whom they are responsible are in an appropriate state of health, which allows legally and factually for safe removal by air. 30. The Home Office’s Country of Origin Information Report on Angola of September 2010 provides the following information: “The United States State Department 2009 Country Report on Human Rights Practices on Angola observed that “the Memorandum of Understanding for Peace and Reconciliation for Cabinda Province, signed in 2006, largely brought an end to the insurgency in the province, although sporadic attacks by dissident factions of the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC) and counterinsurgency operations by the Armed Forces of Angola (FAA) continued during the year. ... The intensity of the armed conflict in Cabinda has declined as a result of large-scale counterinsurgency operations in 2002-2003, and the government publicly claims that the Cabinda conflict came to a close in 2006, when a peace agreement was signed with a faction of the rebel Liberation Front for the Independence of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC). But the campaign for independence remains unresolved, and sporadic guerrilla attacks have been ongoing.” 31. According to the U.S. Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2013 in Angola of January 2013: “The three most important human rights abuses were cruel, excessive, and degrading punishment, including reported cases of torture and beatings as well as unlawful killings by police and other security personnel; limits on freedoms of assembly, association, speech, and press; and official corruption and impunity.” 32. Concerning the availability of medical drugs for mental health, the Home Office’s Country of Origin Information Report on Angola of September 2010 states the following: “...the following therapeutic drugs are generally available at the primary health care level of the country: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin sodium, amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, diazepam, fluphenazine, haloperidol, lithium. Prices keep on fluctuating depending on the availability of drugs.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
133,001-140745,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,M.V. v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney;Robert Spano;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"1. The applicant, MV, is an Argentinean national who was born in 1973 and lives in Stanmore. The President granted the applicant's request for her identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 3). She is represented before the Court by Ms C. Ferguson of Liberty, a nonGovernmental organisation based in London. 2. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ms Y. Ahmed of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant was born in Argentina in 1973. She was the eldest of four children: two sisters (VV and FV) and one brother (LV). The applicant's parents separated in 1981 and in 1983 her mother (AP) began a relationship with a British citizen (PON). In 1985 the applicant's mother travelled to England to set up home with PON and she was later joined by her four children. 5. The applicant alleges that following the move to London she was emotionally, physically and sexually abused by PON. 6. In 1986 the applicant moved to Argentina, where she lived with her grandparents. During this time she had no conscious recollection of the sexual abuse; however, due to her erratic behaviour she was sent twice weekly to a psychiatrist. 7. The applicant returned to London in 1988 to live with her mother, PON, and her three younger siblings. She claims that on her return PON once again began to abuse her both physically and sexually. The abuse continued until she moved out of the family home in 1991. 8. Initially the applicant did not tell anyone of the abuse. However, in 1991 her younger sister, VV, told a family friend that she had been sexually abused by PON. This information was eventually related to AP, who confronted the applicant about it. The applicant confirmed that she too had been sexually abused by PON. AP did not immediately report the allegations to the police. 9. Instead, in 1992 AP left PON and returned to Argentina with FV. VV had already returned to Argentina and was living with her grandparents while the applicant had gone to live in Portugal. 10. By 1993 AP, VV and FV had returned to the United Kingdom. It was at this time that AP reported the allegations of sexual abuse by PON to the Metropolitan Police. During the subsequent investigation witness statements were taken from the applicant, VV, FV, AP, PON's ex-wife (CON), and his two children from that marriage (GON and KON). The applicant's brother, LV, was not interviewed at this time. 11. In her interview VV revealed that PON had abused her in a number of ways from the age of eight, predominantly by rubbing himself against her with his penis. She also described being fondled in a jacuzzi, horsewhipped, bitten on her bottom and karate-chopped between her legs. FV also described being made to have a shower with PON and being punished by him with a whip. She also stated that she was aware VV had been touched inappropriately by PON. 12. In April 1993 the applicant returned from Portugal to give a statement. In that statement she described what had taken place in 1986 when AP had gone away for a week, leaving the children in the care of PON. The applicant was twelve years old at the time. She stated: “ [PON] asked me if I would sleep with him. I was only 12 so I thought nothing of it. I went to sleep in his bed ... I remember [he] had wrapped his leg over me and pulled me close. I was scared. I was lying on my stomach and [he] was lying on my right. I remember him breathing. I was not sure what [he] was doing but I felt he was trying to make me take my Mum's place while she was away ... My Mum was away for a week. I cannot remember how many times this happened but I think it happened more than once.” 13. The applicant also described a time when she was fifteen years old when AP had returned to Argentina for three weeks: “[PON] told me that he had a heart condition and asked me to sleep with him as he was scared to sleep alone. I said I would. When it came time to go to bed I went into my brother's room, got the sofa bed and put that next to his bed and slept there. He made me hold his hand but nothing else. The next day he was angry and said I was no company and that he would ask [VV] to take my place.” 14. She also stated that: “I also remember when I was 12 he would give me driving lessons. He would sit me on his lap and get me to move the steering wheel. I think this was strange now because he never offered to do this when I was 16.” 15. Social services' records also indicated that AP had informed a social worker on 10 March 1993 that the applicant had told a friend that PON had fondled her breasts when she was twelve. 16. In her interviews with police and social services KON at times claimed that she had not been abused, while on other occasions she implied that she had. She said that T, another child of PON who was living in Malta, had told her that he had put his hands down her jeans and fondled her. 17. PON was arrested and questioned in May 1993. Although the tapes of the interview have since been destroyed the entry in the crime report stated that he denied all of the allegations. He was released on bail and told to return to the police station on 14 June 1993. 18. On or about 20 May 1993 the police decided, without any reference to the Crown Prosecution Service, that no further action would be taken against PON. The relevant entry in the crime report, which was written by PC G, read as follows: “Nothing has been heard directly from Malta about T [another child of PON] being abused. This matter will have to be reinvestigated should T ever come to England and make an allegation. In discussion with Detective Sergeant [B] we have formed the opinion that there is insufficient evidence for a successful prosecution in this case. A lot of pressure would be put on KON in respect of her evidence. It is not clear that she would attend court, leaving MV and VV unsupported in their account of what happened. In view of the above I shall classify this as no crime. Should any further evidence come to light this will of course be reclassified and investigated accordingly.” 19. On 20 May 1993 PC G informed PON's solicitor by telephone that he would not face prosecution. PC G and Detective Sergeant B also informed the applicant and her family that no prosecution would take place and that this decision had been made 'in order to protect the children'. 20. On 18 August 1993 a child protection case conference was held concerning VV and FV. Detective Sergeant B was in attendance. At that meeting AP produced a tape recording of a telephone conversation she had with PON. In the course of the conversation PON belittled the abuse and sought to blame VV for what had happened. It appears that AP had further tape recordings but the police did not ask to see them at this time. 21. The conference concluded that: “We believe that [VV] has been sexually abused and we will place her name on the Child Protection Register in the category of Sexual Abuse and likely significant harm of emotional abuse. Appropriate boundaries have been breached by [PON] entering the room whilst [FV] was in the shower. We believe he has abused other children and that [FV] is at risk of being abused by him. We will therefore place her name on the register in the category of likely significant harm from sexual abuse.” 22. It was therefore decided that social services would seek to accommodate VV and treatment would be offered to her. FV was to remain with AP under the condition that she have no contact with PON. Treatment was also to be offered to her. 23. In August 1993 FV went to live with her biological father in Portugal. However, she returned to the United Kingdom in December 1993 and thereafter lived with AP and PON, who were again co-habiting. Her name was again placed on the Child Protection Register. 24. In 1994 AP married PON. The relationship was on and off for the next few years before finally coming to an end in January 1999. 25. In 1999 all interview records, case notebooks and the custody record were destroyed. 26. In November 2000 the applicant's brother, LV, committed suicide. The following month, the police re-opened the investigation into the allegations of abuse. It was agreed, however, that the re-investigation would only consider new evidence. 27. On 6 June 2001 the applicant gave a further statement. In that statement she explained: “I made a witness statement to Police on the 10th April 1993, regarding [PON]. I was 19 years old and at the time couldn't bring myself to give the full details of what took place. I wish to add the following...” 28. She proceeded to set out in greater detail the allegations made in April 1993. In particular, she stated that during the “driving lessons” PON had had an erection and moved under her. Moreover, she claimed that after inviting her to sleep in his bed he had also had an erection and was rubbing himself against her in a sexual motion. Afterwards, her nightdress was wet. In addition, she alleged that the sexual abuse had been accompanied by serious cruelty, physical abuse and the humiliation of all the children. 29. PON was arrested on 4 July 2001 and subsequently charged with thirteen counts of indecency and child cruelty, two counts of indecency and one count of cruelty related to offences committed against the applicant. 30. On 28 August 2001 the police were given AP's tape recordings of conversations she had had with PON concerning the abuse. One of the tapes contained the following statements by PON: “I want you to understand something. These things that happened with [VV] happened three years ago, OK. And they got out of hand between us but not too much, [AP], but it doesn't make it right...I want to sort this out with you and [VV] ... at the end of the day...I was the adult and I should have fucking stopped it. But I never took her knickers down or tried to screw her or anything like that, for fuck's sake...what happened with [VV] was the situation, not the way I am. OK. You can trust me ... Things happened with [VV], but not what you think happened, not what you think happened...I'll tell you what happened and I'm not proud of it. I'm ashamed. It got too close with [VV], but it wasn't one way, and I was the adult and should have stopped it. But she never touched me or done anything ... I've never done anything that bad to [VV] Bad enough, but not that bad.” 31. On 3 September 2002 Croydon Crown Court ordered that the prosecution against PON be stayed because of abuse of process. The court gave three reasons for its decision: first, in 1993 PON had been told unequivocally that no further police action would be taken; secondly, little evidence had been discovered in addition to that which was available in 1993; thirdly, there was material which was no longer available, particularly in relation to contemporaneous notes of interview, as a result of which it would be impossible for PON to have a fair trial. The applicant did not challenge this decision. 32. During the hearing, police officers gave slightly divergent evidence concerning the 1993 investigation. Detective Sergeant B indicated that there had been a prima facie case against PON but it was not considered to be in the best interests of the applicant and her siblings to put the case before a court. Sergeant G (formerly PC G) agreed that the reason not to proceed was mainly to do with the children's welfare but stated that in any case there had been insufficient evidence to prosecute. 33. On 11 October 2005 the applicant filed a civil claim in which she claimed damages from the Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis for personal injury and loss arising from the alleged negligent manner in which the police had pursued the allegations of child cruelty and indecent assault against PON and from the decision not to prosecute. The Commissioner applied to have the application struck out on the basis that it disclosed no reasonable grounds. 34. In a decision dated 21 June 2006, the District Judge considered the decision not to prosecute to be separate and apart from the police investigation. Insofar as the claim concerned the conduct of the police investigation, the judge held that the allegations had to be struck out as the law did not impose a duty of care on the police in respect of the conduct of a criminal investigation. Such a duty could only arise if it could be shown that the police had assumed responsibility towards a particular claimant in such a manner as to give rise to a duty. However, that was not the position in the present case. The judge accepted that exceptionally, in a child cruelty and sexual abuse case, if an investigation had been carried out so negligently that a child was not protected from future harm, it was at least arguable that the police might exceptionally be held liable. However, he held that the above exception did not apply to the applicant as she was no longer a child in 1993 and had therefore been in no different a position to any ordinary witness or victim. 35. With regard to the failure to prosecute, the District Judge considered it arguable that a limited duty of care might arise in the context of the facts of the case. In particular, the judge found it disturbing that the CPS was not apparently even consulted with regard to the failure to prosecute PON, particularly in view of the severity and magnitude of the alleged offences. Indeed, he noted that it would have been expected that the file was at least sent to the CPS for its consideration as to whether or not to prosecute. However, instead of sending the file to the CPS the police had taken the decision not to prosecute themselves on the ground that it would not be in the best interests of the applicant or her sisters. 36. The Commissioner of Police appealed to the County Court against the District Judge's decision, maintaining that he should have struck out the claim regarding the decision not to prosecute. The applicant cross-appealed on the ground that the judge had been wrong to strike out the claim in relation to the investigation. Following a lengthy consideration of the District Judge's decision, on 8 February 2007 the court dismissed the appeal and the cross-appeal, leaving the decision of the District Judge as it was. In doing so, the judge noted that it was possible, even if the possibility was not a very strong one, that further examination of the facts, reasoning and information behind the 1993 decision not to prosecute might lead to the conclusion that the taking of that decision gave rise to a limited duty of care. 37. The Commissioner appealed to the Court of Appeal. At the hearing, counsel for the applicant conceded that there could be no claim for negligent failure to investigate the complaints properly in 1993 and the lower courts had been right to strike out those aspects of the claim. He argued, however, that the decision not to prosecute was different because in coming to that decision the police had taken into account the interests of the children. 38. On 21 December 2007 the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and struck out the applicant's claim altogether. It found that following Hill v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1989] AC 53 (see below), the existence of a duty of care in a case such as the present would not be in the public interest as it would lead to the police carrying out their duties in a detrimentally defensive frame of mind. In any case, the Court of Appeal noted that even if there had been a duty of care, the applicant's Particulars of Claim did not disclose a cause of action because she would have had to have pleaded – and could not possibly have pleaded – that no reasonable prosecutor would have failed to prosecute. 39. On 30 July 2008 the House of Lords refused to grant the applicant permission to appeal on the basis that the petition did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance. 40. On 10 February 2006 Dr. N, a Consultant Psychiatrist, prepared a report on the applicant. 41. In that report he noted that she was suffering from clinical depression which was moderate in its severity. Although he noted evidence of propensity to mental disorder within the family, he concluded that her experience of abuse while she was a child was the original cause of the mental disorder now afflicting her. However, he considered that the applicant's experience of uneven and unsettled parenting by AP was also a contributory factor. 42. With regard to the question of whether the failure of the original prosecution of PON was a significant contributing factor, Dr. N acknowledged that the answer was “a difficult and complicated determination resting as it does upon the implication of the narrative biography, the complex family dynamics, subconscious psychological themes and a broader consideration of [the applicant's] personality, psychological constitution and prospects”. Nevertheless, although the argument was “both subtle and complex”, he concluded that “a significant proportion of [the applicant's] ongoing psychological difficulties can be traced to the failure of the original prosecution of [PON] in 1993”. 43. Physical and sexual abuse of a child are criminal offences in England and Wales. Prior to 1 May 2004, the relevant sexual offences were set out in the Sexual Offences Act 1956, the Sexual Offences Act 1967, the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 and the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 (“the Sexual Offences Act 1956 to 1992”). Cruelty to a person under sixteen years of age is – and was at the material time – a criminal offence by reason of section 1(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. 44. Under domestic law the police owe no general duty of care in tort to victims of crime to investigate their allegations (Hill v. Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1989] AC 53). However, this position is not tantamount to a “blanket immunity” and in certain cases the police could be found to owe a duty of care to a victim (see, for example, Swinney v. Chief Constable of Northumbria Police Force [1997] QB 464, in which the police appeared to have assumed responsibility for the victim's safety). 45. Section 6(1) of the Act provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. 46. Section 7(1) of the Act provides that a person who claims that a public authority has acted or proposes to act in a way which is unlawful pursuant to section 6(1) may bring proceedings against the authority under the Act in the appropriate court or tribunal or may rely on the Convention rights concerned in any legal proceedings. 47. Pursuant to section 8, the court may grant such relief or remedy, or make any such order within its powers as it considers just and reasonable in relation to any act of a public authority which it finds is unlawful.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant is a Croatian national, who was born in 1981. The President decided that the applicant’s identity should not be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr I. Farčić, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. 2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant worked as a police inspector in one of the local branches of the Z. Police Department. 5. During 2012 and 2013 the Split Police Department (Policijska uprava Splitsko-dalmatinska) investigated an organised chain of prostitution in the Split area. The investigation disclosed that the applicant had several contacts with the principal suspect in the investigation, M.H., and that he was one of the clients of the services organised by M.H. 6. In this connection two police inspectors of the Split Police Department, D.Z. and S.K., were ordered to interview the applicant and to obtain from him the available evidence. 7. On 26 March 2013 D.Z. and S.K. came to the premises of the Z. Police Department in order to interview the applicant. 8. In the morning of the same day the Chief of Crime Police of the Z. Police Department invited the applicant to his office. When the applicant arrived at around 9.30 a.m., the secretary of the Chief of Crime Police called M.A., a police inspector at the Z. Police Department, to escort the applicant to a meeting room for an interview with D.Z. and S.K. 9. According to the applicant, while escorting him to the meeting room the inspector M.A. without any reason started pulling his arm saying that he was a “dirty policeman” and that he knew those of his kind very well. The applicant protested against the use of force which made M.A. to press him even harder. The applicant also alleged that during the interview M.A. and the inspectors of the Split Police Department exerted pressure on him forcing him to confess. In particular, S.K. threatened to beat him if he would not confess. 10. According to the Government, the applicant was escorted to a meeting room without any use of force by M.A. or any of the other police officers. There was also no use of force or any other form of ill-treatment or coercion against the applicant during the interview. 11. A note of the applicant’s interview dated 26 March 2013 available to the Court shows that the applicant confessed to having one sexual intercourse with a prostitute in Split. The applicant also gave his mobile phone card to the police officers and duly signed a seizure record indicating that he had no objections. 12. After the interview the applicant returned to his work where he resumed with his duties until the end of the working day. 13. On 29 March 2013, at around 7.30 p.m., the applicant saw a doctor in a hospital in Z. concerning the injuries he had allegedly sustained in the premises of the Z. Police Department on 26 March 2013. The relevant part of the medical record reads: “According to the statement of the injured person ...: During the performance of his duties a crime inspector at [the Z. Police Department] injured him on his left arm. Diagnosis: Contusion on the left side of chest. Contusion and large haematoma on the left upper arm.” 14. The relevant part of another medical record of the same day reads: “Time of the injury: 26.03.2013 9.30 a.m. Reason for [the examination]: During the performance of his duties a crime inspector at [the Z. Police Department] injured him on the left shoulder. Main diagnosis: S20 – superficial injuries of chest (torso).” 15. The applicant underwent further medical examinations on 8 and 17 April 2013, which indicated recession of the injuries on his upper arm and chest. 16. Following the applicant’s medical examination on 29 March 2013 (see paragraphs 13 and 14 above), the hospital forwarded a copy of his medical record to the Z. Police Department. 17. On 16 April 2013 the applicant was interviewed in the Z. Police Department concerning his alleged ill-treatment of 26 March 2013. The applicant stated that he had been forcefully grabbed by the hand by one of the Z. Police Department inspectors who escorted him to a meeting room. Inside the meeting room the inspector threatened him with ill-treatment saying that he should know very well why he had been summoned to an interview. At one point two inspectors of the Split Police Department had joined them and then he was questioned concerning his alleged contacts with prostitutes. The applicant also explained that following his interview he had said to an on-duty officer at the police station, Z.T., what had happened to him. He also stated that only later he had gone to see his lawyer and then decided that he should lodge an official complaint concerning his alleged ill-treatment. 18. On 18 April 2013 the inspector M.A. was interviewed and he denied any use of force against the applicant. On 23 and 24 April 2013 the inspectors of the Split Police Department D.Z. and S.K. submitted their reports denying any threats or use of force against the applicant. 19. On 25 April 2013 the applicant’s colleague Z.T. was interviewed. Z.T. stated that upon the applicant’s return from his meeting at the Z. Police Department on 26 March 2013, he had explained to Z.T. that he had been interviewed by the police inspectors concerning his alleged contacts with prostitutes. The applicant had also said to Z.T. that while escorting him to the meeting room one of the police inspectors took him by the hand. However, Z.T. explained that although the applicant had said that the inspectors were rude he did not say that he was ill-treated or injured nor did he explain in what manner were the inspectors rude. The following day Z.T. went together with the applicant to the internal control department and on their way there the applicant had not mentioned to Z.T. any injuries nor did he complain of any pain. 20. On 17 May 2013 the Z. Police Department forwarded the material obtained during its inquiry to the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Z.). 21. On 17 April 2013 the applicant sent an email to the Internal Control Unit of the Ministry of the Interior (Služba za unutarnju kontrolu Ministarstva unutarnjih poslova; hereinafter: the “Internal Control Unit”) complaining about his alleged ill-treatment by a police inspector during his interview in the Z. Police Department on 26 March 2013. He in particular alleged that he had been grabbed by the hand and pulled by a police inspector who escorted him to a meeting room where the same inspector then continued with the threats forcing him to confess to the alleged involvement in prostitution. The applicant also contended that the police inspector had forcefully taken his mobile phone and searched it. There were allegedly some other police officers who laughed at him. 22. Further, on 15 May 2013 the applicant forwarded a photograph to the Internal Control Unit depicting the alleged injuries he had sustained as a result of his ill-treatment of 26 March 2013. 23. During its inquiry the Internal Control Unit obtained a report from the Z. Police Department as well as the applicant’s medical records and reports form the inspectors D.Z. and S.K., and it interviewed the applicant, the inspector M.A. and the applicant’s colleague Z.T., as well as the Chief of Crime Police of the Z. Police Department. 24. On 18 July 2013 the Internal Control Unit informed the applicant that it considered his allegations unfounded and unsubstantiated. 25. The applicant challenged these findings and the Internal Control Unit informed him on 26 July 2013 that his complaints were forwarded to the Commission for Complaints of the Ministry of the Interior (Povjerentsvo za rad po pritužbama Ministarstva unutarnjih poslova; hereinafter: the “Commission”). 26. The proceedings before the Commission are still pending. 27. On 26 June 2013 the applicant sent a letter to the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office complaining about his alleged ill-treatment during his interview in the Z. Police Department on 26 March 2013. 28. On 2 July 2013 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the Chief of the Z. Police Department, the Chief for Crime Police of the Z. Police Department and his deputy, the inspectors M.A. and S.K. and the Head of the Internal Control Unit, alleging his ill-treatment during the interview of 26 March 2013 and their abuse of powers by lodging criminal complaints against him in connection with his alleged involvement in the prostitution (see paragraph 36 below). In connection with the alleged ill-treatment, the applicant submitted in general terms that the inspector M.A. had unlawfully used force against him and that the inspector S.K. had threatened him, forcing him to confess to his alleged involvement in prostitution. 29. During the investigation, the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office interviewed the Chief for Crime Police of the Z. Police Department and the inspector M.A., who denied any unlawfulness or the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment. 30. In the further course of the investigation the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office summoned the applicant’s colleague Z.T. for an interview. 31. The investigation before the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office is still pending. 32. Meanwhile, on an unspecified date the applicant also lodged a criminal complaint against the Chief for Crime Police of the Z. Police Department and his deputy as well as the inspectors M.A. and S.K. before the State Attorney’s Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta; hereinafter: the “State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office”) alleging his ill-treatment during the interview of 26 March 2013 and irregularities in processing the case against him concerning his alleged involvement in prostitution. 33. On 31 October 2013 the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office rejected the applicant’s criminal complaint as ill-founded on the grounds that there was no evidence that on 26 March 2013 he had left the premises of the Z. Police Department with any injuries and that the fact that he had sought medical help only three days after the alleged ill-treatment remained fully unexplained. This led to a conclusion that his injuries had not been caused in the course of his police interview. The State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office also indicated that it did not find any irregularities in processing of the applicant’s case by any of the persons involved. 34. On 27 March 2013 the applicant was provisionally suspended from the police service. 35. The disciplinary proceedings against the applicant in connection with his alleged involvement in prostitution, and concerning another event of alleged breach of the confidentiality of information, are still pending. 36. On 5 April 2013 the Split Police Department lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant before the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office in connection with a suspicion of his involvement in a prostitution scheme. 37. On an unspecified date the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office rejected the criminal complaint as ill-founded. 38. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000, 28/2001, 41/2001, 55/2001, 76/2010 and 85/2010) read as follows: Article 23 “No one shall be subjected to any form of ill-treatment ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
135,001-174975,ENG,ITA;CHE,ADMISSIBILITY,2017,E.T. AND N.T. v. SWITZERLAND AND ITALY,4,Inadmissible,Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"1. The applicants, Ms E.T. (“the first applicant”), born in 1986, and her son N.T. (“the second applicant”), born in 2009, are Eritrean nationals. The President granted the applicants’ request for their identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). They were represented before the Court by Ms S. Motz, a lawyer practising in Zurich. 3. In 2004 the first applicant fled her home country, travelling via Sudan and Libya, from where she reached the island of Lampedusa in Italy where she claimed asylum on 9 November 2006. She was assigned to a centre for asylum-seekers in Crotone, Calabria. After two months there, she was recognised as a refugee. However, she was no longer entitled to stay in the asylum centre. She therefore went to Rome where her boyfriend, who had fled with her from Eritrea and had also been recognised as a refugee, was living. It was very difficult for the first applicant to find a place to stay and she slept in a train station in Rome and later in a squat for refugees called “Selam Palace”. She claimed that the situation in that squat had been especially difficult for women. Her boyfriend had not been allowed to stay with her and she therefore had lived under the constant threat of sexual attacks from other men living there. Without knowledge of the Italian language it was furthermore impossible for her to find a job. She received food from soup kitchens run by Caritas in Rome. The first applicant and her boyfriend also approached the Ufficio Immigrazione in Via Assisi 39a, the communal accommodation office for homeless people in Rome (“the immigration office”). The immigration office put them on a waiting list. Some months later, on 11 February 2008, the first applicant was allocated a sleeping place but she was somehow not informed of this. The applicant remained in the Selam Palace for more than a year. She became pregnant with the second applicant and her boyfriend left her. Owing to the unbearable living conditions in Italy she decided, when she was several months pregnant, to apply for asylum in Switzerland. 4. On 5 March 2009 she applied for asylum in Switzerland. On 25 June 2009 she gave birth to her son, the second applicant. By a decision of 23 July 2009 the Federal Office for Migration (“the FOM”) dismissed her asylum request based on her having been granted refugee status in Italy. In November 2009 both applicants were removed to Italy. 5. During the applicants’ second stay in Italy, they were informed by the immigration office in Rome that they could not be provided with housing immediately, but that they would be put on a waiting list. The first applicant approached private organisations to obtain housing, without success. As she was even unable to find a place for her and her son to sleep in one of the squats in Rome, both applicants ended up sleeping in the streets and in the main train station with other homeless people. With the remainder of the money the first applicant had received from the Swiss authorities she decided to travel, together with the second applicant, to Norway to apply for asylum there. She sought to claim asylum there in December 2009 and her asylum request was registered on 1 January 2010. Approximately one and a half years later it was dismissed and in February 2011 they were removed from Norway to Italy. 6. In Italy the first applicant unsuccessfully approached on several occasions the immigration office in Rome as well as private organisations in order to obtain accommodation. In relation to a residence document for her son, the immigration office informed her that she should return to Crotone since she had been registered there and the authorities there were responsible for her. In April 2011 the applicant therefore travelled to Crotone in order to register her son and to seek accommodation for them. The authorities there however informed her that there was no organisation which could assist her and that she should return to Rome. Upon her return to Rome, the immigration office eventually registered her on the waiting list on 18 June 2011. Since no accommodation in Rome was available, the applicants had to return to the Selam Palace. The living conditions in that squat were unacceptable, especially for a child. Owing to the precarious sanitary conditions and the lack of adequate nutrition, the second applicant suffered serious dental problems. As the first applicant could furthermore not pay the required fees for staying in the Selam Palace, she was repeatedly asked to leave the place. 7. Out of despair and in order to avoid sleeping in the streets of Rome in wintertime with a little child, the first applicant decided to travel to Switzerland again. She applied a second time for asylum in Switzerland on 10 November 2011. According to the immigration office in Rome, the applicants would have received a place to stay in November 2011, but at this point they had already gone to Switzerland. On 25 October 2012 the FOM dismissed the applicants’ request on the basis that the applicants could avail themselves of the protection of a safe third country, namely Italy. 8. On 1 July 2013 the applicants lodged a qualified application for review with the FOM. The applicants claimed that the FOM had failed to take into account the various indications that the applicants had to live in inhuman conditions in Italy. By decision of 2 August 2013 the FOM dismissed their request ruling that Italy was under an obligation under the EU Qualification Directive to provide the applicants with accommodation and financial support. In addition, private aid organisations could also assist the applicants. The FOM also held that the removal to Italy would not violate the rights of the child under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. 9. Upon appeal, the Federal Administrative Court (“the FAC”) granted the applicants interim measures on 26 August 2013 in order to await the outcome of the proceedings in Switzerland. By a decision of 14 November 2013 the FAC dismissed the applicants’ appeal. 10. With regard to a possible breach of Article 3 of the Convention, the FAC established that based on the facts of the case no particular risk of illtreatment in Italy could be identified. Italy had signed all the relevant international human-rights treaties which it was obliged to respect and was bound to the EU Qualification Directive, which provides that recognised refugees should in principle be treated like nationals regarding social assistance and health care. The FAC found that some structural deficits for refugees in Italy existed, primarily in the regions of Lampedusa, Sicily and Calabria as well as in Rome and Milan. Based on the facts of the case, the FAC had no doubts that the situation for refugees and asylum-seekers in Rome was unbearable and that they were not provided with basic social assistance. Furthermore, it accepted that there was a considerable risk if returned to Rome, the applicants would be obliged to live in the streets again. Since the immigration office in Rome had already offered the applicants a place to stay in the past, it could be expected that they would also be offered one in the future, however not immediately. Therefore, the FAC considered the risk of the applicants’ living in the streets of Rome upon their return there to be considerable. However, the situation for refugees was not as bad in other regions of Italy as in Rome. As recognised refugees, the applicants had the possibility to settle in another region of Italy where the living conditions were presumably better. In this regard the FAC held that it was not comprehensible why the first applicant, who had been able to seek refuge in Switzerland and Norway, had not travelled to another region of Italy, in particular to the North, in order to look for housing there. It found that it was feasible to expect the applicants to seek and find housing in another region of Italy, as, for example, provided by Caritas in Bolzano (House of Margareth), in Bressanone (House of Solidarity), in Bologna (Centro polifunzionale Madre Teresa di Calcutta) as well as in different places in Trieste. The FAC stated that it was more likely than not that the applicants would be able to find adequate accommodation there and would be able to live with dignity. Therefore, they were not at risk of ill-treatment if returned to Italy. 11. Following this ruling, the Swiss Refugee Council (Schweizerische Flüchtlingshilfe), a Swiss non-governmental organisation (“NGO”), contacted on behalf of the applicants the mentioned organisations in Bolzano, Bressanone, Bologna and Trieste in order to enquire whether the applicants could be accommodated there. The Swiss Refugee Council was however informed that none of the organisations would be able to accommodate the applicants as they firstly needed to have their official residence in that municipality and secondly there were no resources for a single mother with her child. As there were very long waiting lists, it was impossible to tell how long it would take to obtain a place. In addition, the fact that the applicants had been registered in Crotone made it even more difficult for them to relocate elsewhere despite the fact that the situation in Crotone was well-known for being inadequate for single mothers with children. It was also possible that the mother and the child would be separated since social services only had obligations towards the child but not towards the mother. 12. On 26 May 2014, the applicants submitted a letter written by the teacher of the second applicant about his integration in Switzerland. The applicants also repeated their complaints. 13. The relevant provisions of the Federal Asylum Act of 26 June 1998, as in force at the relevant time, read as follows: “... 2. The Federal Council shall identify states in which on the basis of its findings: a. States of origin or provenance which are safe, that is to say those in which the applicant runs no risk of persecution; b. safe third countries, that is to say those in which it considers that the principle of non-refoulement, within the meaning of section (5)(1), is actually observed. 3. It shall periodically review decisions made under paragraph 2. 1. If the asylum-seeker has arrived from a country where he or she does not run the risk of persecution within the meaning of section 6a(2)(a), the Office [the Federal Office for Migration, now the State Secretariat for Migration [Staatssekretariat für Migration]] shall not examine the application unless there are signs of persecution. 2. As a general rule, the Office shall not examine an asylum application where the asylum-seeker a. can return to a safe third country within the meaning of section 6a(2)(b) where he or she has resided previously; ...” 14. A detailed description of the asylum procedure and the legal framework and organisation of the reception system for asylum-seekers in Italy is also set out in the Grand Chamber judgment Tarakhel v. Switzerland (no. 29217/12, §§ 37-50, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). 15. By a letter of 9 January 2014, the co-Agent of the Italian Government submitted a message of 7 January 2014 of the Servizio centrale, the body running the SPRAR (Sistema di protezione per richiedenti asilo e rifugiati) network, stating that it had asked the municipality of Sezze to accommodate the applicants as a single-parent family in the appropriate structures put in place by the municipality. 16. By a letter of 27 January 2014, the co-Agent of the Italian Government submitted a note from the Ministry of the Interior and replied to the Acting President’s invitation to provide the Court with a letter from the NGO in question which confirms the availability of accommodation for the applicants. The co-Agent’s reply included the following: “It is clear from the aforementioned memorandum that the Ministry of the Interior, on the basis of its own requirements, may directly allocate places in favour of beneficiaries of international protection in the reception facilities that are part of the SPRAR network. Accordingly, the message of 7 January 2014 of the Servizio centrale, which is running the SPRAR network, constitutes in itself confirmation of the reservation in the reception project in favour of the applicant and her son, without further confirmation being necessary.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
136,001-148717,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,SMAGILOV v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant, Mr Vladimir Nikolayevich Smagilov, is a Russian national, who was born in 1959 and lives in Perm. 2. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, the Representative of the Russian Federation at the European Court of Human Rights. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. In 1999 the applicant bought a desktop computer from a private company F. He subsequently brought proceedings claiming that he had been misled about the technical characteristics of the hardware, that he had not been provided with a user manual, that the seller had failed to comply with consumer protection legislation and that the warranty was partly void. 5. On 26 October 1999 the Sverdlovskiy District Court of Perm (“the District Court”) issued a summary judgment in the applicant’s favour annulled the sale and ordered payment of damages. However, on 19 October 2000 the judgment was set aside on appeal by the Perm Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) and the case was sent back for reconsideration. 6. In order to secure enforcement of the future judgment the applicant requested the District Court to apply interim measures, namely the attachment of the hardware in the defendant’s possession and an order for the defendant to deposit the amount of the damages claimed or, alternatively, the attachment of property in the same amount. 7. On 11 March 2001 the District Court granted the applicant’s request in part and ordered the attachment of the hardware in the defendant’s possession. The other requested measures were refused in view of the defendant’s solvency and active participation in the proceedings. The applicant did not appeal. 8. On 5 February 2002 the District Court gave a new judgment allowing the applicant’s claims in part concerning the warranty on the hardware and dismissing all the other claims. On 11 June 2002 the Regional Court set aside the judgment in part and required that the remaining claims be reconsidered. 9. In a summary judgment of 19 December 2002 the District Court awarded the applicant 357,319 Russian roubles (RUB) (10,900 euros (EUR)) in damages and ordered the defendant to replace the original desktop computer. 10. On 30 April 2003 the Bailiffs’ Service at the request of the applicant initiated enforcement proceedings against the debtor company F. 11. In view of the apparent lack of progress in the enforcement proceedings, in 2004 the applicant lodged a new action seeking annulment of the sale and recovery of damages. On 15 June 2004 the District Court in a summary judgment granted his claims, annulled the sale and awarded the applicant an additional RUB 265,879 (EUR 8,100) in damages. 12. On 20 May and 8 October 2004 the competent authorities refused to open criminal proceedings against the debtor company for its failure to comply with the judgment. The decision of 8 October 2004 was upheld at last instance by the Regional Court on 8 February 2005. 13. Discontent with the lack of progress in the enforcement of the judgment of 19 December 2002, the applicant requested that the bailiff’s actions and inaction be recognised as unlawful. On 10 November 2004 the District Court found that the enforcement proceedings were indeed tainted by unjustified delays and inaction and the bailiff’s inaction was ruled unlawful. 14. In 2005 the applicant also brought proceedings against the regional Judicial Department seeking damages for the allegedly unlawful refusal of the District Court judge to apply the requested interim measures to secure enforcement of the judgment (see paragraphs 6-7 above). 15. On 5 September 2005 the District Court dismissed the complaint without consideration on the ground that it lacked legal basis. The dismissal was upheld on appeal by the Regional Court on 4 October 2005. 16. In 2007 the applicant attempted to initiate civil proceedings against the Treasury of the Russian Federation and the regional Bailiffs’ Service for the failure to enforce the judgment in his favour. On 3 May 2007 the proceedings were adjourned by the District Court owing to the applicant’s failure to formulate his claims against all of the defendants and to provide their postal addresses. The applicant was given time to correct these defects. On 12 July 2007 the Regional Court upheld the adjournment on appeal. It appears that the applicant has never corrected the defects indicated by the domestic courts and that the proceedings have remained adjourned. 17. The basic principles regarding compensation for damage caused by public authorities and their officials are enshrined in the Constitution of the Russian Federation of 1993. In Article 53 the Constitution provides that everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by unlawful actions (or inaction) of State bodies and their officials. Article 52 secures the abovementioned right with a constitutional obligation of the State to ensure access to a court and compensation for damage in cases where public authorities and their officials infringe rights protected by law. 18. The Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation of 2002, which entered into force on 1 February 2003, establishes the framework for challenging the decisions or actions (or inaction) of any State or local self-government authority or official. 19. Chapter 25 of the Code of Civil Procedure, entitled “Proceedings to challenge decisions and actions (or inaction) of State bodies, local selfgovernment authorities, officials or State or municipal civil servants” provides in the relevant part as follows: “1. A citizen or legal person may challenge before a court any decision, action (or inaction) of a State or local self-government authority, official, or a State or municipal civil servant if they consider that their rights and freedoms have been violated. A citizen or legal person may lodge an application directly with a court or with a superior, in order of subordination, State or local self-government authority or official, or State or municipal civil servant. ... 4. The court may suspend enforcement of the challenged decision until entry into force of the judicial decision.” “The decisions, actions (or inaction) of State or local self-government authorities, officials, or State or municipal civil servants, which may be challenged in civil proceedings are collective and independent decisions, actions (or inaction) resulting in: - a violation of a citizen’s rights and freedoms, - a restriction on the exercise by a citizen of his rights and freedoms, - an obligation or legal responsibility of a citizen that is devoid of lawful basis.” “1. Where the court establishes that an application is well-founded, it shall adopt a decision ordering the relevant State or local self-government authority or official, or State or municipal civil servants to provide full redress for the violation of the rights and freedoms or the restriction on the exercise by a citizen of his rights and freedoms. ... 4. The court shall dismiss an application if it establishes that the challenged decision or action was adopted or performed within the scope of powers of a State or local self-government authority or official, or State or municipal civil servant, and that the rights and freedoms of a citizen were not violated.” 20. Article 136 of the Code of Civil Procedure governs the handling of lawsuits submitted in disregard of the procedural requirements and provides as follows: “1. A judge who establishes that a lawsuit has been submitted to the court without following the requirements [as regards its form, necessary elements and supporting documents] shall adjourn the proceedings, inform the plaintiff about the adjournment, and set a reasonable time-limit for correction of the defects. 2. The lawsuit shall be considered lodged on the date of its initial submission if the plaintiff complies with the instructions of the judge. Otherwise the lawsuit shall be considered as not submitted and returned to the plaintiff with all of the attached documents. 3. An appeal shall lie against a ruling to adjourn proceedings on a lawsuit.” 21. Chapter 13 of the Code governs all matters related to interim measures within the civil proceedings. In the relevant parts it provides as follows: “Upon an application of a party to the proceedings a judge or a court may order an interim measures. An interim measure may be ordered at any stage of the proceedings, if a failure to order it may impede or prevent enforcement of a court’s decision.” “1. An appeal shall lie against any ruling ordering an interim measure ...” 22. Title II of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation of 1995, which entered into force on 1 March 1996, governs liability for damage. Article 1064, establishing basic principles of civil liability for damage, provides in the relevant parts as follows: “1. Damage caused to an individual or his property, as well as damage to the property of a legal entity, shall be subject to full compensation by the person who caused the damage. The law may prescribe that compensation for damage be due from a person other than the person who caused the damage ... 2. A person who causes damage shall not be liable for compensation in respect thereof if he proves that it was not caused by any fault on his part. However, the law may prescribe that compensation for damage be due even where there was no fault on the part of the person who caused it. 3. Damage caused by lawful actions shall be subject to compensation where prescribed by law ...” 23. Article 1069 of the Civil Code dealing with damage caused by a State or local self-government authority or official provides as follows: “Damage caused to an individual or a legal entity as a result of unlawful actions (or inaction) of State authorities, local self-government authorities or their officials, including damage resulting from an act of a State authority or local self-government authority that is incompatible with a law or another legal act, shall be subject to compensation. The damage shall be compensated for at the expense of the Treasury of the Russian Federation, the treasury of a subject of the Russian Federation, or the treasury of a municipal authority, respectively.” 24. In addition to the general provisions on compensation for unlawful actions (or inaction) of State authorities and their officials Title II of the Civil Code stipulates specific rules for damage caused by law-enforcement authorities and the courts: “1. Damage caused to an individual as a result of unlawful conviction, unlawful criminal prosecution, unlawful detention or release on his recognizance, unlawful administrative arrest, and damage caused to a legal entity as a result of unlawful administrative suspension of activities, shall be fully compensated for by the Treasury of the Russian Federation, and where prescribed by law by the treasury of a subject of the Russian Federation or the treasury of a municipality, in full regardless of any guilt on the part of any official of an inquiry or preliminary investigation authority, prosecutor’s office or court. 2. Damage caused to an individual or a legal entity by unlawful actions of inquiry and preliminary investigation authorities and prosecutor’s offices, where they do not entail the consequences mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, shall be subject to compensation under Article 1069 of the present Code. Damage caused in the administration of justice shall be subject to compensation if the guilt of a judge has been established by a final and binding judgment of conviction.” 25. The Constitutional Court in its judgments and decisions has provided a constitutional interpretation of Article 1069 of the Civil Code in conjunction with Articles 52 and 53 of the Russian Constitution (see Judgments No. 1-P of 4 June 2009, No. 9-P of 16 June 2009, and Decisions No. 22-O of 20 February 2002, No. 1005-O-O of 4 June 2009), including the following principles: 26. In its decision no. 338-O of 4 October 2005 the Constitutional Court emphasised with reference to the case-law of the Court that enforcement of a judgment was an integral part of the judicial protection of rights and that the review of bailiffs’ actions (or inaction) must be performed by their superiors and by the courts. 27. Following the constitutional review of the specific rules stated in paragraph 2 of Article 1070 of the Civil Code on damage caused by law-enforcement authorities and the courts, the Constitutional Court found them constitutional in so far as they provided for special conditions as to State liability for damage caused in the administration of justice (Ruling no. 1-P of 25 January 2001). However the Ruling clarified that the term “administration of justice” applied only to judicial decisions on the merits of the case, while procedural rulings fell outside its scope. State liability for damage caused, unlawful procedural acts or failure to act could arise even in the absence of a final criminal conviction of a judge, if the fault of the judge had been established in civil proceedings. 28. Both the Supreme Court and the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation (which until unification of the courts in 2014 was the highest court for commercial disputes) have issued case-law reviews and guidelines clarifying various procedural and substantive aspects of the right to receive compensation under Article 1069 of the Civil Code as established in the practice of the Russian courts. These decisions of the Supreme Commercial Court of the Russian Federation remain in force unless superseded by newly adopted decisions of the unified Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. 29. In decree no. 23 of 2006 of the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court it was stressed that a defendant to a lawsuit under Article 1069 should always be a public entity, but not a structural unit thereof or an official in a personal capacity. The compensation must accordingly be recovered only from the public entity. 30. In joint Decree no. 30 / 64 of 23 December 2010 of the Plenum of the Supreme Court and the Plenum of the Supreme Commercial Court, the courts highlighted that while the post-Burdov 2 legislative scheme only guaranteed compensation for non-enforcement of judgments against the State, nothing precluded lawsuits from being brought in other disputes concerning the non-enforcement of judgments under Articles 151 and 1069 of the Civil Code. 31. Information Letter no. 145 of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court of 31 May 2011 in particular mentioned the following points:",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

A list of the applicants, who lodged the present applications between 23 December 2005 and 31 August 2006, is set out in the appendix. 2. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agents, most recently, Mr I. Lishchyna. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 27 July 2002 the Air Force of Ukraine staged a military aviation show at the Sknyliv aerodrome in Lviv. During the aerobatics performance, an SU-27 military aircraft crashed into a crowd of spectators and exploded. Both pilots had successfully ejected before the explosion. As a result of the crash, seventy-seven people were killed and over 290 people, including the applicants, sustained damage to their health (see details in paragraphs 17-50 below). 5. On the date of the accident criminal proceedings were instituted to establish the cause of the crash. 6. On various dates the applicants were admitted in these proceedings as injured parties and civil claimants. Following individualised assessments of the applicants’ injuries by forensic experts within the framework of those proceedings, they were divided in three categories: “minor injuries”, “injuries of intermediate seriousness” and “grave injuries” depending on their impact on the applicants’ health and well-being, the reversibility or irreversibility of their nature, the length of recovery and the intensity of the medical intervention required. The seriousness of both the physical and the emotional trauma were taken into account in the process of attribution to a category. 7. On 27 August 2004 the criminal proceedings against four officers of the rank of general (hereinafter “the organisers’ case”) were disjoined from the criminal proceedings against the pilots and the supporting ground crew (hereinafter “the performers’ case”). 8. On 23 June 2005 the Central Region Military Court of Appeal examined the performers’ case and found the two pilots of the crashed aircraft and three supporting crew members guilty of negligence. These officers were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. 9. On the same date the court also ruled on the applicants’ civil claims, awarding them various amounts in respect of pecuniary damage (mostly medical expenses) and non-pecuniary damage in connection with physical injuries and emotional distress, to be paid by the Ministry of Defence (see details in the appended table below). 10. The applicants appealed, seeking, in particular, an increase in the compensation payments. 11. On 2 March 2006 the Military Panel of the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicants’ appeals and the judgment in the performers’ case became final. 12. Between June 2006 and March 2007 all the judgment awards due to the applicants were paid out. 13. Some applicants lodged further civil claims within the framework of the organisers’ case, which was still ongoing at the material time. 14. On 11 June 2008 the Central Region Military Court of Appeal examined the organisers’ case and acquitted the four officers charged in these proceedings. 15. On 22 October 2008 this decision was upheld on appeal by the Military Panel of the Supreme Court of Ukraine and all the civil claims lodged within the framework of the organisers’ case were left unexamined in view of the acquittal. 16. On various dates starting from 2002, in addition to the compensation awarded by the court, almost all of the applicants also obtained payments in State and municipal aid from the Sknyliv accident victim relief funds (see details in the appended table below). Every applicant also obtained further payments ranging from 2,620 hryvnias (UAH) (Ms Liliya Belinska; minor emotional injury) to UAH 41,000 (Mr Denis Gavrylov; grave injury) from charitable funds set up and managed by the authorities to attract private donations in aid to the Sknyliv accident victims. On various occasions some of the applicants were also provided with vacation vouchers and recreational treatment vouchers to facilitate their mental and physical recovery. For more details concerning the accident, the ensuing investigation and State and municipal aid to the victims see Mikhno v. Ukraine, no. 32514/12, §§ 12-58 and 67-71, 1 September 2016 and Svitlana Atamanyuk and Others v. Ukraine, nos. 36314/06 and 3 others, §§ 17-64 and 71-75, 1 September 2016). 17. The present application was lodged by two Ukrainian nationals who are resident in Lviv: Mrs Tetiana Kostyantynivna Gavrylova, born in 1949 and Mr Denis Oleksandrovych Gavrylov, born in 1987. Mrs Tetiana Gavrylova is the mother of Mr Denis Gavrylov. The applicants were represented by Mr T.R. Sendega, a lawyer practising in Lviv. 18. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Mrs Tetiana Gavrylova sustained a blunt soft tissues leg injury with haemorrhage and multiple abrasions cumulatively classified by domestic forensic experts as injuries of “intermediate seriousness”. 19. Mr Denis Gavrylov had his popliteal artery and right leg muscles crushed. He also sustained multiple abrasions, contusions and other injuries cumulatively classified by domestic forensic experts as a “grave injury”. Following the accident, he underwent treatment in the hospital rehabilitation unit followed by lengthy inpatient and outpatient treatment. 20. By the time the present application was lodged in December 2005, Mr Gavrylov had been classified as suffering from “second (intermediate) degree” disability under domestic classification and was in receipt of a disability pension. 21. The present application was lodged by three Ukrainian nationals resident in Lviv: Mrs Natalya Yaroslavivna Chorna, born in 1971, Mr Anton Bogdanovych Chornyy born in 1977 and Mr Bogdan Antonovych Chornyy, born in 1999. The first two applicants are spouses and the third applicant is their son. They were represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 22. According to the applicants, they were so close to the site of the SU27 aircraft crash that their clothes were stained with the blood and body parts of people injured and dying around them. In order to reach safety, they had to make their way past numerous mutilated corpses and disfigured screaming people along the aerodrome runway. 23. Mrs Natalya Chorna sustained an ankle injury with a ligament rupture, contusion and haematoma. Subsequently she was also diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, which transformed into asthenic-depressive neurosis. Her injuries were classified as injuries of “intermediate seriousness” by domestic forensic experts. 24. Mr Anton Chornyy was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. His psychological trauma was classified by domestic forensic experts as a “minor injury”. 25. Mr Bogdan Chornyy, a three-year old minor at the date of the accident, sustained a contused cerebral wound, concussion and a haematoma. He also developed post-traumatic stress disorder, which included symptoms such as fear of crowds and sleep disturbance. He also suffered from various forms of physiological dysfunction, including a stutter and disruption of his speech development. Mr Bogdan Chornyy’s injuries were classified by the domestic forensic experts as ones of “intermediate seriousness”. On several occasions in the years that followed, Mr Bogdan Chornyy was placed on inpatient treatment programmes in psychoneurological institutions. 26. According to the applicants, at the date of the exchange of observations in 2013, they were still suffering from the after-effects of the accident. They provided numerous medical documents as evidence that they had continued to be under on-going medical supervision in connection with the psychological trauma sustained at the accident site. 27. The present application was lodged by Mr Boris Borisovich Yudin, a Ukrainian national born in 1946 and resident in Lviv. The applicant was represented by Ms Y.V. Kulbiy-Kukhar, a lawyer practising in Lviv. 28. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Boris Yudin sustained a heavy cerebral contusion with subarachnoid haemorrhage and a fracture of the clavicular bone. For six days after the accident he was in a coma. Upon regaining consciousness, he suffered from partial amnesia, temporary speech loss, hallucinations and was unable to walk. Following intensive inpatient neurological treatment, Boris Yudin regained some cerebral functions. However, he never attained full recovery and by 2006 he had been classified as suffering from disability of “the first degree” in need of outside assistance for meeting basic daily needs. According to classification by domestic forensic experts, Boris Yudin’s trauma was classified as a “grave injury”. 29. The present application was lodged by two Ukrainian nationals ‒ Mrs Iryna Grygorivna Reshetilova, born in 1950, and Mr Viktor Mykhaylovych Yegorov, born in 1957, and a US national ‒ Mr Nikita Sergejevich Bastrakov, born in 1998. The first two applicants are the grandparents of the third applicant. All three applicants are resident in Lviv. They were represented by Mr A.P. Syvyk, a lawyer practising in Lviv. 30. According to the applicants, on the date of the accident, moments before the SU-27 hit the ground, Mr Bastrakov − a four-year-old minor at that time − was watching it with his mouth open, while Mrs Reshetilova said to him in amusement: “Wow, look how low can this airplane fly!” The next moment, Mr Yegorov, having suddenly realised that the aircraft was falling, pushed his grandson to the ground and covered him with his body, urging his wife to likewise lie on the ground. Moments later, the applicants were hit by the heat wave from the aircraft’s turbines, which burnt their clothes and skin. The soles of Mr Yegorov’s shoes were also completely burned. When the applicants finally got onto their feet, they were covered with other people’s blood and with soot from the aircraft, which had exploded some distance from them. 31. As a result of the accident, Mrs Reshetilova suffered multiple burns to her face, limbs and eyes. The heat wave from the aircraft’s turbines also entered her respiratory system and burned her larynx, trachea, bronchi and lungs. In addition, Mrs Reshetilova suffered an acute neurological reaction to stress. Domestic forensic experts classified her injuries as “minor”. According to the applicant, this classification was incorrect, as she had never fully recovered from her injuries. She provided extensive medical documentation as evidence to prove that the after-effects of her injuries included chronic obstructive bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, encephalopathy, and various other medical complications. By 2006 Mrs Reshetilova had been classified as suffering from general disability of the “third (mildest) degree” according to the domestic classification system. 32. Mr Viktor Yegorov sustained contusion of the chest area, fractures of the fifth and seventh vertebra and multiple abrasions cumulatively classified by domestic forensic experts as “injuries of intermediate seriousness”. He also developed complications, including frequent headaches, back pain and a number of other neurological symptoms. 33. Mr Nikita Bastrakov sustained a hand wound, face abrasions and post-traumatic stress disorder manifested most markedly, through phobias, asthenic symptoms and bed-wetting. His injuries were classified by domestic forensic experts as being of “intermediate seriousness”. 34. The present application was lodged by Mrs Galyna Ivanivna Kurylka, a Ukrainian national born in 1958 and resident in Lviv. The applicant was represented by Mr D. A. Gudyma and Mrs S. V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 35. As a result of the accident, the applicant suffered contusion of her foot and developed post-traumatic stress disorder classified by domestic forensic experts as a “minor injury”. According to the applicant, this classification was incorrect, as her mental state had in fact deteriorated to a point that she was forced to quit her employment as a kindergarten mentor. After a series of inpatient and outpatient treatment programmes, in 2006 Mrs Kurylka was classified as suffering from “second-degree” (moderately serious) disability and unfit for work, excluding the performance of domestic tasks. At the time of the exchange of observations in 2013, Mrs Kurylka was unemployed on a disability pension and was under permanent outpatient psychiatric supervision. In addition, several times per year she participated in courses of inpatient rehabilitative treatment in psycho-neurological institutions. 36. The present application was lodged by Ms Khrystyna Viktorivna Koshulap (married name Dzyunka), a Ukrainian national born in 1989 and resident in Lviv. She was represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 37. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Ms Koshulap, a thirteen-year-old minor at that time, sustained a complicated hand injury with damage to the extensor tendons classified by domestic forensic experts as an “injury of intermediate seriousness”. She underwent a series of reconstructive operations followed by inpatient and outpatient treatment programmes. It is not clear from the case file whether the applicant has fully recovered. 38. The present application was lodged by two Ukrainian nationals resident in Lviv: Mr Anatoliy Romanovych Garasymiv, born in 1964, and Mr Volodymyr Anatoliyovych Garasymiv, born in 1991. Mr Anatoliy Garasymiv is the father of Mr Volodymyr Garasymiv. The applicants were represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 39. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Mr Anatoliy Garasymiv sustained cerebral concussion, multiple facial and head burns, as well abrasions to the fingers and knees, cumulatively classified by domestic experts as “minor injuries”. According to him, this classification was incorrect, as he had never regained his health and continued to suffer from the after-effects of the accident at the date of the exchange of observations in 2013. As a result of his physical injuries and stress, Mr Anatoliy Garasymiv started suffering, in particular, from frequent headaches, hypertonic disease, and other complications. Within a few months of the accident he was forced to abandon his career as a military wind instrument player and was eventually dismissed from the military forces on health grounds. By 2006, Mr Anatoliy Garasymiv was classified as suffering from disability entailing 40% loss of capacity to work. 40. Mr Volodymyr Garasymiv, an eleven-year-old minor at the date of the accident, developed post-traumatic stress disorder classified by domestic experts as “minor injury”. 41. The present application was lodged by Ms Liliya Bogdanivna Belinska (married name Salo), a Ukrainian national born in 1985 and resident in Lviv. She was represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 42. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Ms Liliya Belinska, a seventeen-year-old minor on the date of the accident, developed posttraumatic stress disorder, which was treated on an outpatient basis. Her trauma was classified by domestic forensic experts as a “minor injury”. 43. The present application was lodged by Ms Liubov Grygorivna Stupets, a Ukrainian national born in 1961 and resident in Lviv. She was represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 44. Ms Liubov Stupets sustained rupture of the acromio-clavicular ligament, her injury having been classified by domestic experts as one of “intermediate seriousness”. According to the medical documents presented by Ms Stupets, treatment of this trauma required several surgical interventions and extensive inpatient rehabilitation treatment. The applicant had to abandon her career in sports and as a school physical education teacher. In November 2002 she was classified as suffering from disability of the “third degree”. By 2006 her state of health was still deteriorating: she developed post-traumatic arthritis, pain syndrome, and a number of neurological and other conditions. At the date of the exchange of observations in 2013, the applicant was receiving a disability pension. 45. The present application was lodged by Ms Nataliya Yaroslavivna Sivanych (married name Buntseva), a Ukrainian national born in 1985 and residing in Lviv. She was represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 46. As a result of the Sknyliv air show accident, Ms Nataliya Sivanych sustained cerebral concussion, numerous wounds and fractures of several foot bones, which required inpatient treatment followed by an outpatient rehabilitation programme. The applicant’s injuries were cumulatively classified by domestic forensic experts as ones of “intermediate seriousness.” 47. The present application was lodged by two Ukrainian nationals residing in Lviv: Mr Anatoliy Mykolayovych Shevchuk, born in1967 and Mr Andriy Anatoliyovych Shevchuk, born in 1991. Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk is Mr Andriy Shevchuk’s father. The applicants were represented by Mr D.A. Gudyma and Ms S.V. Khyliuk, lawyers practising in Lviv. 48. According to the applicants, as the fallen aircraft exploded, parts of it flew their way. Both of them would have probably been killed, had it not been for Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk’s quick reaction: he managed to push his son to the ground and cover him with his body just before the moment they would have otherwise been hit by these flying parts. When the applicants got up, they saw numerous mutilated bodies of dead, burnt and wounded people around them. Whilst attempting to provide first aid to accident survivors, Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk lost view of his son, who wandered off in the midst of the mutilated bodies and screaming people. After having looked for his son for about an hour, Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk found him uninjured physically, but in a state of deep mental shock, unable to speak or make productive contact with others. Mr Andriy Shevchuk was immediately placed in a psycho-neurological hospital for inpatient treatment. 49. On 28 July 2002 Mr Anatoliy Shevchuk went back to work and attempted to resume his normal duties. However, after suddenly developing a stutter, he applied for psychiatric assistance. 50. Subsequently, both applicants underwent several sessions of inpatient psychiatric treatment followed by outpatient treatment and regular supervision. They were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder classified by domestic experts as an “injury of intermediate seriousness”. 51. Article 49 of the Constitution of Ukraine (1996) provides, in particular, as follows: “ Everyone has the right to health protection, medical care and medical insurance. Health protection is ensured through state funding of the relevant socio-economic, medical and sanitary health improvement and prophylactic programmes.

138,001-157966,ENG,SWE,CHAMBER,2015,CASE OF JOVANOVIC v. SWEDEN,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life),Aleš Pejchal;Angelika Nußberger;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena Jäderblom;Josep Casadevall;Síofra O’Leary,"5. The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Eskilstuna, Sweden. She originates from Serbia and is a Serbian Orthodox Christian. In April 2007 she started a relationship with a Serbian man, B., who lived in Sweden, and in August 2007 they married in Serbia. Subsequently, the applicant was first granted a temporary residence permit in Sweden until December 2009 and then, in April 2010, she was granted a permanent residence permit. The applicant moved to Sweden in January 2008 and, on 25 July 2008, she and B. had a son, X. 6. Due to a suspected infection, X remained in hospital for a week following his birth before he was discharged in good health. On 20 August 2008 the applicant and B. took X to hospital where it was revealed that he had bruises on his genitals. The family was allowed to return home after X had been examined. On the following day X’s condition worsened and he suffered from cramps. The applicant and B. again took him to hospital. X suffered extensive bleeding in the brain and a chief physician at the hospital suspected that he had been severely ill-treated. X was kept in hospital. 7. On 25 August 2008, a physician filed a report on suspected child abuse with the social services and, on the same date, the Employment and Family Council (arbetsmarknads- och familjenämnden, hereafter the Social Council) in Eskilstuna decided, under section 6 of the Act with Special Provisions on the Care of Young Persons (Lagen med särskilda bestämmelser om vård av unga, 1990:52; hereafter the “1990 Act”), to take X into immediate compulsory public care on a provisional basis. The decision was executed on that same day. 8. On 2 September 2008 the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Södermanland confirmed the decision of the Social Council. It appears that the applicant did not appeal against this decision. 9. Subsequently, the Social Council applied to the County Administrative Court for a care order in respect of X. The applicant and B., who were represented by legal counsel, opposed the measure while X’s legal representative agreed that it would be in the child’s best interest to be placed in compulsory public care. 10. By judgment of 28 October 2008 the County Administrative Court, after having held an oral hearing, granted a care order in respect of X. The court noted that, according to a medical certificate submitted by a chief physician, X had bruises on his genitals, probably injuries from being squeezed. Bleeding in the brain and a red spot on the left side of the chest strongly suggested that X had been gripped tightly and violently shaken and suffered from “shaken baby syndrome”. X had severe brain injuries and would probably suffer lifelong mental and physical disabilities. The court found that X’s injuries had occurred while he had been in his parents’ care. Thus, in the court’s opinion, it did not matter who had actually caused the injuries but it sufficed to state that the parents had failed to protect X from being injured. The court concluded that the parents had shown a serious lack of ability to care for their son. The judgment had immediate effect. 11. On 9 March 2009 the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm upheld the lower court’s judgment. It held that neither the oral statements made before it, nor anyreached by the County Administrative Court. 12. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen) which, on 17 June 2009, refused leave to appeal. 13. In the meantime, on 19 September 2008, X was transferred from the hospital to an evaluation and treatment home (utrednings- och behandlingshem) together with the applicant and B. The main responsibility of that home was to secure X’s protection. It also had the tasks of evaluating the parents’ ability to care for X, of providing the parents with such abilities if needed and of supporting the parents in their crisis situation. The staff at the home found, after the family had been there for eight weeks, that the applicant had shown good ability to satisfy X’s basic physical needs, take care of his practical needs and had been constantly present for him. However, she had shown considerable flaws in her emotional interaction with X and it was said, among other things, that she had not been able to separate her need for consolation and emotional care from X’s feelings and needs. Her attitude towards X was described as if she objectified him rather than regarded him as an individual in his own right, which in the report was described as highly worrying. It was further noted that she did not accept X’s injuries and that she did not talk at all about his future disabilities. As regards B., the staff at the home noted inter alia that he had been absent to a great extent due to his work commitments. 14. In December 2008 a criminal investigation concerning suspected child abuse in respect of the applicant and B. was discontinued since it was impossible to prove that either of them had committed the abuse. 15. In March 2009 X was placed in a family home (familjehem) consisting of a Swedish married couple. 16. In September 2009 the applicant twice reported B. to the police, claiming he had threatened to kill her and her family. 17. On 5 February 2010 the applicant requested the Social Council to terminate the public care. She insisted that she had never ill-treated X nor witnessed anyone else doing so. She had had no reason to suspect that X risked ill-treatment at home. Moreover, she submitted that she and B. had divorced and that, through an interim decision, she had been granted sole custody of X while B. had limited visiting rights. Furthermore, she had completed her studies in Swedish for immigrants and was planning to find work. 18. The Social Council ordered an investigation into the family’s situation which was completed on 22 February 2010. The purpose was to investigate and analyse whether X should remain in public care. The social services spoke with the applicant and B., visited the family home and gathered relevant information for the case. Once finalised, the investigation report stated, inter alia, that according to a medical certificate issued by Professor O.F., a specialist on “shaken baby syndrome”, X was suffering from that syndrome. It was also stressed that X’s life had been in danger when he had been shaken, that he had suffered lasting brain injuries and would need care for the rest of his life. It was further noted that X had suffered injuries to his genitals. Moreover, it was stressed that it was the social services’ responsibility to ensure X’s safety and that, regardless of which parent had caused X’s injuries, the other parent had failed to protect him. 19. On 25 March 2010 the Social Council rejected the applicant’s request to terminate the public care. In its decision the Social Council referred to the findings of the investigation report. 20. The applicant appealed against the decision to the County Administrative Court and requested that the care order be terminated. She maintained that there was no need to keep X in public care as she was fully capable of caring for her own child. She further criticised the medical certificates that had been submitted in the case and contested the assumption that X suffered from “shaken baby syndrome”. Instead she claimed that X’s injuries had been caused by malpractice of personnel at the hospital where he had been treated. She further argued that X’s human rights were being violated since he was not allowed to speak his native language and practise his religion. She also complained about the proceedings before the Social Council, which she considered to be flawed. 21. The Social Council contested the applicant’s claims, stressing that X’s life had been in danger and that he had suffered lasting brain injuries while in his parents’ care. 22. On 28 May 2010 the County Administrative Court rejected the applicant’s request to obtain an opinion from the Legal Advisory Council of the National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsens Rättsliga råd). According to the County Administrative Court, there was no reason to obtain such an opinion. 23. Both parties submitted documentary evidence. The applicant submitted, inter alia, a medical certificate of her own, stating that X likely suffered from a severe brain injury, probably anoxic brain injury (injury to the brain due to a lack of oxygen). 24. On 20 August 2010 the County Administrative Court held an oral hearing in the case, where the applicant insisted that she had not in any way ill-treated X. Nor had she seen that X had been harmed by B. or any other person. According to her, there was nothing to suggest any flaws in her parental abilities and she maintained that X’s injuries had been caused by malpractice at the hospital. The Social Council stated that it could not rule out the possibility that X had been ill-treated at home. It further stressed that the submitted medical certificates showed that someone had shaken X, causing him severe injuries. X’s legal representative agreed that it would be in his best interest to remain in public care. 25. On 31 August 2010 the County Administrative Court rejected the appeal. Firstly, it found that there had been no flaws in the Social Council’s handling of the case which could affect the court’s assessment. The court then noted that the applicant had contested the physicians’ conclusions and, moreover, that she had submitted a medical certificate of her own. However, the court considered that the applicant’s reasoning in this regard was based on speculation and accusations which, in all essential parts, were unsubstantiated. It held that the medical certificate submitted by the applicant did not in any way contradict those previously submitted. Thus, nothing had emerged that would lead the court to reassess the circumstances that had led to the initial decision to take X into public care. Furthermore, the court found that the changes to the applicant’s life (the divorce and obtaining sole custody of X) were not sufficient to have a decisive effect on the outcome of the proceedings. It also stressed that it was important that X continue to bond with his family home parents. Furthermore, the court took into consideration that X had been subjected to severe ill-treatment while in his parents’ care and that the circumstances surrounding the incident had not been clarified. Thus, the compulsory public care order should remain in place. 26. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal, maintaining her request for an opinion from the Legal Advisory Council. The applicant also reiterated her criticism of the conclusions given in the medical certificates and, again, questioned the assumption that X suffered from “shaken baby syndrome”. She further maintained that X’s injuries had been caused by malpractice at the hospital. The applicant also questioned the family home’s ability to care for her son. 27. The Social Council and X’s legal representative both contested the applicant’s claims. 28. On 3 November 2010 the Administrative Court of Appeal granted the applicant’s request for an opinion from the Legal Advisory Council. The opinion was submitted to the court on 18 January 2011. It referred to a certificate by the scientific advisor T.A., a physician specialised in medical radiology, which stated, inter alia, that X’s injuries had been caused by severe violence and that his injuries corresponded exactly to “shaken baby syndrome”. The injuries could not have been caused by illness or complications related to an illness nor through a minor accident such as a fall from a changing table or similar. The injuries could not have been a consequence of an injury during delivery either. Thus, T.A. wholly agreed with the assessments previously made by Professor O.F. 29. On 18 March 2011 the Administrative Court of Appeal held an oral hearing where the applicant stated that she had started to question her earlier position that X’s injuries had not been caused by ill-treatment in their home. Although she had not actually witnessed anyone harming X, she said that the only person, apart from herself, who could have done so was B. On the day they had taken X to the hospital, B. had been in a bad temper. On that day B. had taken care of X while she had been in the bathroom preparing a bath for X, and from the bathroom she had heard X cry and had gone to see what was the matter. B. had then told her to leave the room and after she had done so the baby had become quiet and B. had left the apartment. Just shortly after this and while undressing X, she had noticed that something was wrong with him and that he was having trouble breathing. B. had threatened her and told her that she would be expelled from Sweden if she were to tell anyone what had happened. She also told the court that B. had often been irritated when X cried and that he had had a tendency to “explode”. The applicant further stated that her life was stable, she spoke Swedish, had an apartment and work, and she would do everything to ensure that X received the care and treatment he needed. 30. The Social Council maintained that X would be exposed to danger if he were to be left in the applicant’s care. X’s legal representative contested the applicant’s claims and pointed out that, although it had not been clarified who had caused X’s injuries, it must be presumed that it was one of the parents. Although she found no reason to question that, with help, the applicant would be able to care for her son, she considered that he was in need of protection until it had been established who had caused his injuries. 31. On 12 April 2011 the Administrative Court of Appeal upheld the lower court’s judgment. From the outset, it noted that the primary consideration was the best interests of the child. The court then observed that X needed extensive care and great responsibility was therefore placed on the custodian in terms of understanding X’s needs. Thus, the court considered it encouraging that the applicant had now accepted the conclusions in the medical certificate concerning X’s state of health and the cause of his injuries. In addition, the court considered that the applicant’s life situation had improved since the decision to take X into public care. Of decisive importance to the court was, however, whether X’s needs could be met by the applicant. In this context, the court noted that it had still not been clarified who had caused his injuries. The court further considered that, in the light of the applicant’s statement before the court, her previous behaviour was difficult to understand. Although the court acknowledged the applicant’s exposed situation at the time of X’s injuries, it nevertheless stressed that the conditions in the family had led to serious deficiencies in X’s care, causing him life-threatening injuries and lifelong disabilities. The court concluded that there was still a clear risk of impairment to X’s health and development if the public care were to be terminated. 32. Upon further appeal by the applicant, the Supreme Administrative Court refused leave to appeal on 20 June 2011. 33. On 29 September 2011, in proceedings regarding custody of X between the applicant and B., the District Court (tingsrätten) repealed its provisional decision of 22 October 2009 to grant sole custody of X to the applicant and decided that the parents should have joint custody. It appears that the applicant and B. had agreed that they needed to cooperate on questions relating to X’s future situation. 34. On 12 December 2012 and on 10 July 2013 the Social Council decided that the public care should continue. As far as is known to the Court, the applicant did not appeal against these decisions. 35. Following the granting of the public care order, the applicant’s contact rights to visit X were regularly examined by the domestic authorities. During X’s first three weeks in the family home, the applicant and B. visited him three times per week. Subsequently, the applicant and B. visited him once a week. During the visits, an interpreter and a support person were present. 36. On 4 June 2009, the Social Council decided to reduce the parents’ contact rights to once every other month since the visits had had a clearly negative effect on X’s mental state. The applicant did not agree with the changes and appealed against the decision to the County Administrative Court. On 15 October 2009 the court dismissed the appeal. The applicant did not lodge a further appeal with the appellate courts. In January 2010 the contact rights were extended to one and a half hours once every month, as X was feeling better. However, on 22 July 2010 the Social Council decided again to reduce the parents’ contact rights to one hour every month, since X had been affected negatively during and after the visits. 37. The applicant appealed against the decision, maintaining that she had not in any way ill-treated X and that she wanted to care for him. On 31 August 2010 the County Administrative Court, after having held an oral hearing, upheld the Council’s decision. The court observed that X had reacted negatively during the visits and held that, due to his great need of care and treatment for his disabilities, it was important for him to be in a stable and calm environment and be allowed to bond with his family home parents. 38. The applicant appealed to the Administrative Court of Appeal which, after having held an oral hearing, rejected the appeal on 12 April 2011. The court noted that the Social Council intended to film the visits and subsequently, with the help of the Child and Youth Psychiatric Clinic (Barn- och ungdomspsykiatrin), analyse the results. Having regard to this, and the observations made by the Social Council during the visits, the court held that the contact restrictions should remain. The applicant did not appeal against the decision to the Supreme Administrative Court. 39. In the meantime, in May 2010, the applicant requested that X be placed in another family home since she considered that the current family home couple did not care sufficiently well for her son. She also added that she considered it to be X’s right to be placed in a Serbian family. In September 2010, after having carried out an investigation, the Social Council rejected the request on the ground that it would not be in X’s best interest to be moved to another family home and that his needs were best met by remaining where he was. The applicant does not appear to have appealed against this decision to the administrative courts. 40. On 26 October 2011 the Social Council decided that the applicant would be allowed to speak Serbian to X during the visits. 41. Following the filming of the applicant and X during one hour, in a report dated 3 June 2012, the company, which had been assigned by the Social Council to carry out the filming and analysing the emotional interplay between the applicant and X, stated that the applicant had shown sensitivity towards X and that they had shown a genuinely good interplay. It was further noted that the applicant had the necessary abilities to support X in his future development. The report concluded that it was of great importance for X to be allowed to see his mother much more often. It was also recommended that the visits take place without the presence of the family home parents. 42. On 12 June 2012, the contact rights of the applicant and B. were extended to one and a half hours once every month. It was also considered that the meetings functioned without a support person present. According to the Government, this arrangement was to remain in place until the end of 2013 and the applicant had not requested any changes to it. Moreover, a meeting between the applicant, the family home and the Social Council, scheduled for October 2013, was cancelled upon request by both the applicant and the family home, as they had already agreed on the remaining visits for that year. The Court has not been informed whether any subsequent changes to the time, form or frequency of the visits have taken place. 43. At present the applicant is working as a kindergarten teacher.",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0
139,001-147481,ENG,CYP,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,CAKICISOY AND OTHERS v. CYPRUS,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix. 2. The Cypriot Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicants are 247 Turkish Cypriots relatives of 84 men who were killed during the conflict in Cyprus in 1974. 5. The applicants and their relatives were living in or about the area of Tochni (Taşkent) village. On 14 August 1974 armed Greek Cypriots who were mostly from the locality arrived at the village and collected the male Turkish-Cypriot population of the village and marched them to a Greek elementary school in the Greek Cypriot sector. Among the abductors were named villagers under the command of a named Greek Cypriot man, A.D., from the village, along with two Greek soldiers in uniform with a mainland Greek accent. 6. Some fifty Turkish-Cypriot men, including children as young as 12 years, were kept overnight at the school. Fifteen Turkish-Cypriot men from two other villages were also brought to the school. Two Greek officers from the mainland told them they were prisoners of war and led them to believe that they would be taken to a prison camp at Limassol. Next morning, the Turkish-Cypriot men and boys were loaded on two buses under armed guard. They were taken away to an unknown destination. 7. A statement by Suat Huseyin, reported in newspapers shortly afterwards and later included in a book on the conflict, gave the following account of the fate of the men. Suat Huseyin, his father and brother were amongst the men loaded on the buses. Their bus drove past Limassol and stopped at a junction. The armed men ordered the prisoners to march into the countryside. They were ordered to stop at a hollow and allowed to smoke. Almost immediately, shooting began. Suat Huseyin was hit in the stomach and legs and fell down pretending to be dead. He heard the four armed guards speaking in a mainland Greek accent, saying “That is the end of them, let’s go now and bring a bulldozer and bury them.” Suat Huseyin’s cousin was also still alive but badly wounded but Suat was unable to help him due to his own injuries. He fled the scene, hiding out in the hills for six days. He was eventually picked up by a UN ambulance and taken to a British base. He later went to the north in a helicopter. 8. In June 1989, the stories of various villagers, naming Greek Cypriots involved in the incident, were published in a booklet “The Tragedy of Turkish Cypriot missing persons in Cyprus – Third decade” 9. The applicants provided information that on 21 November 2004, the alleged perpetrator, A.D., made a statement to the newspaper “Alithia”, stating inter alia that he and others had acted together with the government forces and had done what the government forces ordered them to do. He confirmed the gathering of the Turkish Cypriot men and that they had been loaded onto buses by soldiers from Hirokitia. 10. No information about the applicants’ missing relatives was given nor any investigative measure taken until, on 14 June 2003, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a statement in newspapers published in northern Cyprus inviting the families of missing persons to give blood samples to the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics to aid in the identification of remains. The applicants came south and gave blood samples between 16 and 23 July 2003. 11. No news was forthcoming for some time so in 2005 the applicants contacted both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney- General of Cyprus asking for information. On receiving no reply within thirty days, some of the applicants filed five cases in the Supreme Court on 25 and 26 March 2006 against the Attorney General, Council of Ministers, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs claiming that the authorities had failed to initiate all relevant procedures to ascertain the fate of the disappeared men during the three elapsed years and that the authorities should be ordered to conduct an effective investigation to locate and identify the remains and to identify and prosecute the perpetrators. 12. The United Nations Committee on Missing Persons (“the UNCMP”) had meanwhile commenced exhumations. On 29 May 2007, excavation began in a mountain region in Yerasa village and soon after remains of 43 missing men from the three villages were found. The remains of 3 of the remaining 18 missing men were later found at another location. A newspaper account dated 22 July 2011 explained that the remains of this group of victims had been transferred by Greek Cypriots from one burial spot to another unknown location due to a minefield – the remains of three-four men had been left behind. The DNA analysis of the remains has not yet been issued by the CMP. 13. On 29 May 2008, the Supreme Court rejected the claims finding that the subject-matter constituted an “act of State”, with which the courts could not interfere. The plaintiffs appealed. The decision was upheld on 18 May 2011 (see Relevant domestic law and practice below). 14. According to information submitted by the Government, the Attorney General ordered an investigation into the death of 84 missing persons from Tochni on 27 October 2005. Steps taken included as follows. 15. The police took statements from four out of the five relatives of missing persons who had written to the Attorney General naming seven persons as implicated in the events leading to their relatives’ deaths and requesting an investigation. These four witnesses named six persons, including three brothers, as arresting the missing men and confining them at the elementary school. The men had been boarded on a bus next day. One witness stated that it was four Greek Cypriots in uniform whom he did not know who put the men on the bus. The witness who had survived the incident stated that it was the Greek Cypriots who put the men on the bus who later killed them but he did not know their identities. 16. Of the six persons named as arresting the missing men (including the individuals referred to in paragraph 9 above), the police found that two had died. Statements were taken from the remaining four. Three denied any involvement; the fourth admitted taking Turkish Cypriots to be confined at the school. He had left at that stage but named three men who remained to guard the prisoners. On investigation the police found these three men had since died. A statement was also taken from a former policeman who had visited the elementary school at the time; while he named a man guarding the prisoners, it transpired that this man had died. The police officer also confirmed that orders had been given to confine the Turkish Cypriots but did not remember the source of the orders – with some doubt, he thought they might have come from the national guard general staff. A former Mari army officer named by a witness as passing on orders to confine Turkish Cypriots was located; he claimed not to remember whether the orders came from or whether it was his own initiative; he only recalled confining Turkish Cypriot males from Mari in the village coffee shop. 17. Police made efforts to track the source of the orders. A search of the national guard records yielded no results. 18. On 13 January 2011, the Attorney-General gave instructions to the police for further investigative steps. Following the Court’s decision in the case of Emin and Others v Cyprus, he took further steps to ensure the transmission of information about the finding of bodies of missing persons. On 30 May 2012, he was then informed by the CMP of the discovery of the remains of 47 unidentified remains from Tochni village. He in turn informed the chief of police, noting that an investigation was already pending. 19. On 11 April 2013, the Attorney General was informed of the identification of the bodies of three of the missing men from Tochni. On 22 April 2013 he ordered a specific investigation into their deaths. 20. In March 2013, the police submitted the Tochni investigation file to the Attorney General. He gave instructions on 5 June 2013 for further investigation, inter alia to investigate the historical background of the 1974 events, to explore the possibility that some of those known to be implicated in the 1963-1964 events might have been involved in Tochni killings, to broaden the temporal scope of the investigation so as not to be restricted to orders given on the day of the second invasion (14 August 1974) and to investigate further the allegation of the witness survivor that the bus had been stopped at a police checkpoint on the route to Limassol. He ordered that the investigation should not be closed without the discovery and identification of all the missing men and joined all relevant investigations. 21. According to the Government, which found difficulty in reconciling names of applicants with those included in official records, DNA samples were taken from 91 villagers in order to assist in the identification of remains. 38 of these were applicants in this case. These samples were taken in 2003 from the villagers who gave them voluntarily after signing a consent form in the Turkish language. The consent form stated that the DNA would be isolated from the sample and stored and registered at CING (the DNA Identification Laboratory) and that the DNA would be used in tests and identification studies for the identification of the remains of their missing relatives. The results would be communicated to any Cypriot person or institution as authorised by the President of the Republic and to the donor after approval by the Government. 22. CING processed the samples, isolating the DNA which was stored. In 2005-7, during negotiations with the UNCMP, it was clear that the Turkish Cypriot member wanted fresh samples to be taken. This was reflected in the UN agreement with CING for provision of funds. Fresh samples of blood were accordingly obtained from Turkish-Cypriot relatives under the auspices of the Turkish-Cypriot member who verified that all had signed, and understood, a fresh consent form indicating that the DNA isolated from the sample would be transmitted by the Turkish-Cypriot member of the UNCMP to CING to be genotyped and only to be used in the framework of the UNCMP programme of identifying remains. The form stated that previous consent forms were revoked. It was stated that at the end of the UNCMP project copies of all available data would be transferred to the Turkish-Cypriot member of the UNCMP. 23. It appears that CING holds DNA samples from 108 applicants, transferred to them in 2007 by the Turkish-Cypriot member of the UNCMP. At this stage, the previous samples from 2003 were destroyed for 57 out of the 91 villagers. This was in accordance with the revocation of the former forms of consent and new arrangements. Copies of official records of destruction of the material have been provided. 24. The DNA samples of those individuals who only donated blood in 2003 are still stored and no analysis has yet been made. No Turkish Cypriot who gave a sample in 2003 has approached CING requesting any information about the fate of their sample. 25. On 12 June 2012, the Turkish-Cypriot member of the CMP requested a digital copy of all the data related to the Turkish-Cypriot relatives of missing persons. CING transmitted the data on 25 June 2012. 26. According to the Government, the destruction of samples given by any of the 34 remaining villagers or applicants who only gave samples in 2003 is subject to the procedure set out in Standard Operating Procedures of the CING laboratory – a form existed whereby requests for destruction could be lodged. 27. According to the applicants, CING was no longer involved in identification of remains. Their role has been superceded by an agreement in 2012 between the UNCMP and the International Committee on Missing Persons in Sarajevo to which organisation all blood samples are now sent for testing. The applicants pointed out that they were not sent copies of the destruction records and had not been informed that their samples had been destroyed at the time. For those who had given samples not yet destroyed, they had not been given any information about their use or fate. 28. In these cases lodged in 2006, the relatives of five Turkish-Cypriot men who went missing on 14 August 1974 after they had been taken from their homes by armed Greek Cypriots, lodged applications under Article 146 of the Constitution, claiming that the Republic of Cyprus had known of the deaths of the missing persons but had not searched for the corpses or brought the guilty persons to justice and that the Republic had not taken the necessary actions to pursue an effective investigation to determine the whereabouts and fate of the missing persons. In their response, the Republic of Cyprus stated that they had not been passive but had been unable to pursue their intentions to exhume and identify corpses due to the agreement between the United Nations, the Turkish-Cypriot side and themselves that exhumations would be conducted by a common programme of the Committee of Missing Persons. They also pointed out that exhumations had begun in 2004 and the programme indicated the likelihood of the exhumation of the graves in the relevant area would commence in August 2008. They disputed that the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the courts but fell rather under the supervision of the United Nations and the authority and initiative of the President of the Republic. 29.

She is the cousin of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was shot dead by police officers on 22 July 2005. 13. On 7 July 2005 four suicide bombers detonated explosions on the London transport network. Three of the suicide bombers were on underground trains and one was on a bus. Fifty-six people, including the four suicide bombers, were killed in the attack and many more were injured. 14. The Metropolitan Police Service (“MPS”) initiated a major police investigation to establish the identities of persons involved in or otherwise connected with the explosions. Available intelligence indicated that terrorists were actively planning a further attack within a matter of days and the threat level posed to the United Kingdom from international terrorism was raised from Level 3 to Level 1. 15. On 21 July 2005, precisely two weeks after the first bombings, four explosive devices were discovered in rucksacks left on three underground trains and on one bus. As it was feared that the failed bombers would regroup the following morning and attempt to detonate further explosions, the MPS immediately launched an operation to find them (Operation THESEUS 2). This operation was led, as Gold Commander, by Police Commander John McDowall. 16. At 4.20 a.m. on 22 July 2005 Commander McDowall was informed that intelligence had identified Hussain Osman as a suspect in the failed bombings of 21 July. Both Mr Osman and another suspect were thought to be living in an apartment at 21 Scotia Road, London. 17. At 4.38 a.m. on 22 July 2005 Commander McDowall decided to mount surveillance operations at both Scotia Road and another London address. The overall aim of the operation at 21 Scotia Road was to establish whether the suspects were present in the apartment and to arrest them safely if they came out. Commander McDowall’s strategy for this operation was not recorded; however, it would appear to have been to control the premises at Scotia Road through covert surveillance, to follow persons leaving the premises until it was felt safe to challenge them, and then to stop them. In order to implement this strategy his plan was that a surveillance team from SO12 (Special Branch) should be in attendance at Scotia Road. They were to be supported by a unit from SO19, a Specialist Crime & Operations branch of the MPS. The unit from SO19 consisted of highly trained Special Firearms Officers (“SFOs”) who were usually deployed on pre-planned operations. Although some surveillance officers were armed for their own protection and that of the public, their training did not enable them to be used as a resource to arrest armed suspects. SO19 would normally undertake this task, although armed officers from SO12 could be used for this purpose as a last resort. 18. The Crown Prosecution Service (“CPS”) Review Note later found that if Commander McDowall’s strategy had been followed (notably, had the team from SO19 been deployed in time to support the surveillance teams at Scotia Road), events would not have unfolded as they did. 19. Commander McDowall appointed Commander Cressida Dick as the Designated Senior Officer (“DSO”) in charge who was to be responsible for achieving the THESEUS 2 strategy safely. As such, she had responsibility for the operation at 21 Scotia Road on 22 July 2005. She was based in Control Room 1600, where she was supported by Trojan 80, an experienced SFO from SO19 who was acting as her tactical adviser. 20. Detective Chief Inspector C (“DCI C”) was appointed as Silver Commander for the operation at Scotia Road. Although a Silver Commander would normally have ultimate responsibility for the management of an incident and deployment of firearms resources, on this occasion the DSO retained this responsibility and DCI C operated as the DSO’s ground commander. DCI C was supported by and accompanied on the ground by Trojan 84, who, like Trojan 80, was an experienced SFO from SO19 who was acting as a tactical adviser. Trojan 84 was in charge of the SFO team to be deployed and he was in direct contact with Trojan 80. 21. Detective Superintendent Jon Boutcher (“DS Boutcher”), the Senior Investigating Officer for the investigation into the identity of the persons responsible for the bombings on 7 July 2005, was also appointed as a Silver Commander. 22. At 5.00 a.m. on 22 July 2005 a surveillance team from SO12 was called out. No request was made at this stage for a unit from SO19. 23. By 6.04 a.m. two surveillance teams from SO12 had been deployed to the Scotia Road address to control the premises and to follow anyone coming out of the apartments. 21 Scotia Road was accessed by the same doorway as 17 Scotia Road and the surveillance teams were stationed in an observation van which had a view of that doorway. 24. The Anti-Terrorist Branch of the MPS (“SO13”) deployed four officers to assist with any arrest and to gain intelligence. DS Boutcher was the link between the Control Room and SO13. 25. At 6.50 a.m. Commander McDowall held a briefing during which the firearms strategy was outlined. Trojan 80 was present at the briefing together with the Silver Commanders for the surveillance operations at Scotia Road and the second London address. The DSO arrived at 7.15 a.m.; however, Commander McDowall spoke to her after the briefing to ensure she had all the information and assistance she needed. 26. As they had not been called out earlier (see paragraph 22 above), SFOs from SO19 were allocated to the operation when they reported for duty. At 7.45 a.m. Trojan 84 briefed the SFOs. The briefing was not recorded but he appears to have told the team that they “may be required to use unusual tactics because of the environment they were in and that they should think about this”. When asked for clarification Trojan 84 added that, in relation to a critical shot, the instruction would come directly from the DSO. However, if they were deployed to intercept a subject and there was an opportunity to challenge but the subject was non-compliant, a critical shot could be taken. The CPS later found that this briefing “stoked the [SFOs] fears that they would meet suicide bombers and that they may have to shoot such people”. 27. Following the briefing the unit from SO19 travelled to a police station at Nightingale Lane, which was about two miles from Scotia Road. They stopped off for petrol on the way. Upon arrival they received a further briefing from DCI C, which commenced at 8.50 a.m. The briefing was not recorded but it appears that DCI C confirmed the terrorists had the capacity to attach a device to themselves that would be difficult to detect. He described the individuals involved in the bombings as being “deadly and determined” and “up for it”. The CPS later criticised this briefing as unbalanced as DCI C had failed to caution the SFOs that not everyone they would stop leaving Scotia Road would be a suicide bomber and that they should not overreact in the heat of the moment. 28. The team from SO19 was not deployed on the ground until after 9.30 a.m. 29. Jean Charles de Menezes was a Brazilian national who lived at 17 Scotia Road. At 9.33 a.m. he left his apartment building through the common doorway in order to go to work. An officer in the surveillance van saw Mr de Menezes, described him and suggested “it would be worth someone else having a look”. However, as the unit from SO19 had not yet reached Scotia Road it was not possible to stop Mr de Menezes at this stage (as per the strategy outlined at paragraph 17 above). Instead, he was followed by the surveillance officers. 30. On leaving Scotia Road Mr de Menezes walked a short distance to a bus stop and got on a bus heading towards Brixton. The CCTV on the bus did not capture the entire journey due to vibrations but Mr de Menezes was recorded as being on the bus by 9.39 a.m. At this point the surveillance team described him as “a good possible likeness” to Hussain Osman. By 9.46 a.m. the description had changed to “not identical”. 31. At 9.47 a.m. Mr de Menezes got off the bus. He was then seen using his mobile phone before running back to the bus and reboarding. 32. There are conflicting accounts of whether a positive identification was made of Mr de Menezes as the suspect at this stage. It appears from the Stockwell One Report of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (the “IPCC” – see paragraphs 45-71 below) that those on the ground had not been able to identify Mr de Menezes as Hussein Osman. The fact that the Surveillance Running Log refers to him at each entry as being an “U/I [unidentified] male” lends some support to this position. Nevertheless, those in Control Room 1600 appear to have believed that a positive identification of Hussein Osman had been made. 33. At around the time that Mr de Menezes reboarded the bus the unit from SO19 began to make its way towards Brixton. The SFO team leader later told the IPCC that he heard over the radio that “it was definitely our man and that he was nervous and twitchy”. 34. At 9.59 a.m. the surveillance teams were asked to give a percentage indication of the likelihood that Mr de Menezes was the suspect and they replied that it was “impossible [to do so] but thought that it was [the] suspect”. 35. Mr de Menezes got off the bus at Stockwell and walked towards Stockwell underground station. There were several surveillance officers in the vicinity and their leader offered to stop Mr de Menezes before he entered the station. The DSO initially ordered that they perform the stop, having been informed that the unit from SO19 was not yet in a position to intervene. However, almost immediately thereafter she was informed that the unit was on hand. As a consequence, she countermanded her original order and instructed the SFOs to stop Mr de Menezes. By this time Mr de Menezes was already in the underground station. Trojan 84 relayed the order to the SFOs, informing them that “they want us to stop the subject getting on the tube”. The SFOs were told that they were going to Code Red, which meant that they were to have ultimate control of the situation and that an armed interception was imminent. 36. The CCTV at the station shows Mr de Menezes entering the station at 10.03 a.m. wearing a thin denim jacket, a T-shirt and denim jeans, walking calmly and not carrying anything. He went down an escalator and onto a platform. There is no CCTV recording of the lower end of the escalator or of the platform: the relevant tapes, when seized by the MPS, were blank. The IPCC Stockwell One Report and the CPS later found that this was because a cable had been damaged during recent refurbishment works. 37. At 10.05 a.m. a number of SFOs entered Stockwell underground station and ran down the escalators. At 10.06 a.m. they followed Mr de Menezes onto the platform. Eyewitness accounts as to what exactly happened next are conflicting and some of the witnesses gave accounts which it is now known could not have been accurate. However, it would appear from the accounts quoted in the IPCC Stockwell One Report that: Mr de Menezes went into the third coach of a stationary train and sat down; one of the surveillance officers shouted to the SFOs that Mr de Menezes was there; Mr de Menezes stood up, arms down; he was pushed back onto his seat and pinned down by two police officers; according to one witness his hand may have moved towards the left hand side of his trouser waistband; and two SFOs (Charlie 2 and Charlie 12) shot Mr de Menezes several times and killed him. 38. Within days of the shooting, after it had become apparent that Mr de Menezes had not been involved in the attempted terror attacks on 21 July, the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis, the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs expressed their profound regret at his death. A representative of the MPS travelled to meet his family in Brazil and apologised directly to them on behalf of the police. An ex gratia payment was agreed upon to ensure that the family’s financial needs were met. They were encouraged to take independent legal advice from a solicitor in the United Kingdom and they were advised that their legal costs in doing so would be met. 39. The Police Reform Act 2002 and the Police (Complaints and Misconduct) Regulations 2004 required a police shooting to be referred to the IPCC. However, following the shooting of Mr de Menezes the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis wrote to the Home Office to inform it that he had decided not to refer the matter to the IPCC at that time. 40. As it was not immediately clear that Mr de Menezes had not been connected to the attempted bombings, the Anti-Terrorist Branch initially retained primary control of the scene of the shooting. During this time the Department of Professional Standards (“DPS”), an independent section of the MPS which had been notified of the shooting at 10.38 a.m. on 22 July 2005, ensured the integrity of the scene, interviewed witnesses, and completed forensic retrieval. 41. After the shooting Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 had been taken to a police station. At 2.30 p.m., having taken legal advice, they indicated that they would not be making statements at that time. Instead, they made their statements together at approximately 2.00 p.m. the next day, after they had been told that Mr de Menezes was not connected to the attempted bombings. Some of the details they initially provided have since been either proved false or called into doubt. For example, they initially indicated that Mr de Menezes had been wearing a bulky jacket (CCTV footage showed him wearing a light denim jacket) and that the officers from SO19 had shouted “armed police” when they boarded the train (the IPCC considered such an action to be “illogical” when confronting a possible suicide bomber). 42. An officer from SO12 had seized the surveillance log at 12.35 p.m. on 22 July 2005. However, at 8.40 p.m. the same day it was handed back to the officers from the unit. Around this time an amendment appears to have been made to an entry; the words “a split second view of his face. I believe it was [the suspect]” appear to have been altered to read “I believe it was NOT [the suspect]”. 43. At 9.45 p.m. on 22 July 2005 the Anti-Terrorist Branch formally handed over control of the scene to the DPS as they were satisfied that Mr de Menezes was not connected to the attempted bombings. 44. On 23 July 2005 a post-mortem examination took place and recorded the cause of death as “multiple gunshot wounds to the head. The cause of death is severe disruption to the brain”. 45. On 25 July 2005 the DPS formally referred the investigation to the IPCC, whose investigation began on 27 July 2005 when the DPS provided it with the relevant material in its possession. Because of the seriousness of – and the public interest in – the matter, the IPCC determined that it would use its own staff to carry out the investigation. It was overseen by the Chair of the IPCC personally and the investigating team possessed all the powers and privileges of a police constable carrying out an investigation. 46. The purpose of the investigation was to advise the CPS of any criminal offence that might have been committed; to provide it with the evidence necessary to come to a decision about any prosecution; to enable the “responsible authorities” of the officers concerned (the MPS and Metropolitan Police Authority, or “MPA”) to consider what disciplinary or other action they might need to take; to inform the Secretary of State for the Home Department of the circumstances of Mr de Menezes’ death; and to assist the coroner in relation to any inquest. 47. In particular, the investigation by the IPCC was to examine: a) the information that led to the surveillance of the apartments at Scotia Road; b) the command structure of the operation, including details of the numbers and types of specialist officers deployed and the tactics available to them; c) the qualification and training of those involved and their suitability to carry out their role; d) details of the briefing given to the officers involved and any description or photograph of any suspect made available; e) whether or not the operation was designated as a “KRATOS” operation (the national strategy for dealing with suspected suicide bombers which permitted the use of lethal force if absolutely necessary) and the policy, operational tactics and authority levels of “KRATOS”; f) the details of the mobile surveillance operation from Scotia Road to Stockwell underground station; g) the details of police action once Mr de Menezes had reached Stockwell underground station; h) whether or not the policy and operational authorities of “KRATOS” were followed and were effective; and i) whether “KRATOS” was compliant with Article 2 of the Convention. 48. The IPCC was also to report on the actions and statements of the DPS from the time of the incident to the formal handover of the investigation to the IPCC to ensure that the IPCC investigation met its obligations under Article 2 of the Convention. 49. During the course of the investigation nearly 890 witness statements were taken from police, forensic experts and civilian witnesses and more than 800 exhibits were collected. The family of Mr de Menezes, together with their legal representatives, were given regular detailed verbal briefings on the progress of the investigation and eventually on its conclusions. 50. On 30 September 2005 the IPCC investigating team submitted a report to the IPCC indicating, inter alia, that certain officers might have committed criminal or disciplinary offences. The IPCC therefore wrote to the MPS and to the MPA about the officers concerned. 51. On 19 January 2006 the IPCC Stockwell One Report was completed and submitted to the CPS. On 6 and 22 March 2006 the legal representatives of Mr de Menezes were briefed on the IPCC investigation and report. IPCC personnel also offered to travel to Brazil to brief any member of his family residing there. On 14 March 2006 the IPCC submitted its recommendations to the MPS, MPA, Her Majesty’s Inspector of Constabulary and to the Home Office. 52. The report considered all the witness statements and outlined in detail the events of 22 July 2005 and the investigative steps which followed the shooting. In particular, it examined the actions and responsibility of the Commanders, their advisers and all the frontline SFOs and surveillance officers. While it accepted that the death of Mr de Menezes was not the result of any deliberate act designed to endanger the life of any innocent third party, it nevertheless concluded that: “20.01 There can be no doubt that on the morning of 22 July 2005 a combination of circumstances between 0500 and 1006 led to the killing of an entirely innocent man.” 53. With regard to this “combination of circumstances”, it identified a number of failings. 54. First, it criticised the briefings given by DCI C and Trojan 84: “20.8 There is no doubt that the briefings provided by [DCI C and Trojan 84] included a comprehensive update on the intelligence including the links between 7 July and 21 July and the possibility that the firearms officers may have to confront one of the terrorists who had survived the suicide bombings the previous day. What the briefing for [SO19], and indeed the other teams, did not include was any rider about the circumstances in which the Operation KRATOS policy could be used. That policy was only one option available to the Metropolitan Police for dealing with suspected terrorists and suicide bombers. The [SO19] officers were not told that it should only be used as a matter of last resort when they were sure of the identity of the person in relation to whom the policy was to be applied. That should have been included in the briefing.” 55. Secondly, it criticised the failure to implement Commander McDowall’s strategy by deploying the unit from SO19 to Scotia Road earlier: “20.15 The management of the operation between 07:15hrs and 09:30hrs should have involved giving practical effect to the strategy devised by Commander MCDOWALL so that appropriate resources were in place at SCOTIA ROAD from the earliest possible time. Commander DICK was in charge of the operation following her briefing from Commander MCDOWALL. The policy, which is described at paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4, was, in essence, one of containment, stop and arrest. What occurred between 07:15hrs and 10:06hrs was a failure of that policy. Between 07:15hrs and 09:33hrs there was no adequate effort to put in place police resources at SCOTIA ROAD that would have enabled the Metropolitan Police to give effect to the policy. During those hours there was a series of briefings. None of the eight people who left the flats before Mr DE MENEZES left were stopped in accordance with the strategy and when he left he was simply followed while ineffective attempts were made during the course of half an hour to determine whether he was [the suspect]. If appropriate resources had been in place there would have been the opportunity to stop Mr DE MENEZES during the course of his five minute walk from SCOTIA ROAD before catching the bus in TULSE HILL. ... ... ... 20.32 Detective Chief Inspector C, the Silver Commander, was effectively the ground commander with responsibility for SO12, SO13 and [SO19] officers. However owing to the fact that he was still with SO13 and [SO19] at NIGHTINGALE LANE when Mr DE MENEZES left SCOTIA ROAD, and stationary at the T.A. Centre when DE MENEZES was identified as the suspect at BRIXTON, DCI C was always playing ‘Catch up’ in respect of the operation. ... ... ... 20.49 ... evidence from the CCTV at STOCKWELL underground station reveals that the [SO19] officers did not enter the station until two minutes after MR DE MENEZES had passed though the ticket barriers. 20.50 While two minutes is a very short time period, the delay in [SO19] getting to the scene and the failure to get a positive identification had enabled a person, believed to be a possible suspect for attempting to detonate a bomb on the underground system the day before, to get on the same bus twice and enter an underground station.” 56. Thirdly, the report was critical of the delay in handing the investigation to the IPCC: “17.22 The pressures under which the Metropolitan Police were operating following the events of 7 July and 21 July are self-evident. However, the fact that the independent body established by an Act of Parliament to investigate complaints and serious incidents involving the police, and which has independently investigated every fatal police shooting since 1 April 2004, was now to be excluded from the scene, is a major concern for an independent investigation, and should never occur again. 17.23 The fact that there was such concern over the problems with the CCTV tapes at STOCKWELL and the fact that the hard drives on the train were missing highlights the problem. This issue could have been resolved a lot earlier had they been under the control of the IPCC. ... ... ... 17.25 The failure to allow the IPCC access has also been highlighted by the fact that the surveillance log 165330 has been altered. ... ... ... 17.33 Had the IPCC been involved at the commencement of the investigation, the surveillance log would not have been released for amendments to be made.” 57. Nevertheless, the IPCC found that high vibrations had interfered with the recording of most of the bus journey, the hard drive on the train had not been replaced on the relevant day, and the recording equipment in the station had been broken during prior refurbishments. Consequently, it concluded that there was “no evidence of a cover-up to withhold this evidence from the investigation”. 58. Likewise, two expert witnesses who examined the surveillance log could not agree either that it had been altered or, if it had been, who might have altered it. 59. The report also identified a number of individuals whom the CPS might consider prosecuting. 60. As to the shooting of Mr de Menezes after he had been tackled on the train, the IPCC noted: “20.71 The actions of Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 should be considered in light of the day’s events and those of the previous two weeks. At the briefing, they were supplied with a full briefing on the capabilities of the terror suspects. During the operation they had heard the man being followed was being identified as one of the suspects from the previous day’s attempted bombings. On arrival at STOCKWELL, [SO19] went to State Red, authorising a firearms intervention, following an order from the DSO to stop the man from entering the station and tube train. 20.72 They had seen ‘Ivor’ [a surveillance officer from SO12] point at the suspect, who they saw get off his seat. ‘Ivor’ then grabbed the man and forced him back to the seats. Both officers state they believed they had to act immediately to prevent loss of life to the people on the train. ... ... ... 20.74 Charlies 2 and 12 clearly believed they were acting in self-defence, and had the right in law to use the force they did. The [CPS] may wish to consider whether the actions of Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 amount to murder in the context of their justification for the shooting of Mr DE MENEZES and having regard to the fact that there were explanations given for the shooting at that time which did not accord with the accounts given 36 hours later. ... ... ... 20.94 ... [The CPS] ... may also wish to consider whether they were grossly negligent to come to the conclusion that they were confronting a suicide bomber.” 61. With regard to the role of the DSO, the IPCC stated: “20.77 The order given by Commander DICK was to stop the suspect getting onto the underground station and subsequently the underground train. When interviewed she was asked to explain the word ‘Stop’ and her response was that ‘Stop’ is a common word in policing terms and it was meant as ‘stop and detain’. This opinion is supported by DCI C and Trojan 80 and 84. 20.78 However, the way the order was received by [SO19] must be considered. Following a full briefing, many of the [SO19] officers have described that they believed that they would have to confront a suicide bomber. The [SO19] officers have stated that they believed the man being followed on the bus had been identified as one of the suspects for the failed bombings on 21 July 2005. They had been in a situation of trying to ‘Catch up’ with the surveillance team since their briefing had finished. And as they approached STOCKWELL underground station they hear that the suspect had entered the underground station and they received an order to stop him getting on the underground train. I do not believe that the use of the word ‘Stop’ can be related to normal policing duties. With the mind-set of the [SO19] officers believing that a suicide bomber had entered the underground station, to receive such an order to stop him from DSO cannot be related to normal duties. They had not had the benefit of a rider to their briefing of the sort to which I refer at paragraph 20.8. If they had received such a briefing they might have been more cautious in the way they approached and dealt with Mr DE MENEZES. ... ... ... 20.82 I [Senior Investigator J.D. Cummins] comment at paragraph 20.47 on the consequences of the surveillance team having failed to adequately identify the person they were following. However, that team had spent thirty minutes following and staying with Mr DE MENEZES and attempting to identify him. That provided Commander DICK with a thirty minute opportunity to act in accordance with the operation strategy. There was no attempt to do so. 20.83 The SO12 officers who were following Mr DE MENEZES had been authorised to carry firearms for their personal protection and the protection of the public. In the context of the events of 7 July and 21 July when, respectively, there had been a successful detonation and an attempted detonation of bombs on buses it was a failure of the management of the operation to permit Mr DE MENEZES to get on the bus at TULSE HILL. If he had been a suicide bomber that event could have been catastrophic. Therefore the failure to use SO12 to stop him getting back on the bus in BRIXTON is an even more inexplicable failure to apply the strategy. ... ... ... 20.87 [The DSO] has endorsed that she was the person in command. The [CPS] may wish to consider whether the manner in which this operation was commanded, the failures to have resources properly deployed and the absence of any other tactical options could be considered to be grossly negligent.” 62. With regard to the “identification” of Mr de Menezes as the suspect, the IPCC noted: “20.53 ... James [the head of the surveillance teams] did not communicate that some of his team thought that the subject was not [the suspect]. This information should have been fully communicated to [the DSO] as it may have influenced her decision-making. The [CPS] may wish to consider whether this negligence by ‘James’ ... satisfies the test for gross negligence.” 63. As to any potential offence on the part of the eight officers on board the train: “20.91 Given that they believed they were confronting a suicide bomber it is perhaps illogical that they would have challenged him prior to trying to detain him. The [CPS] may wish to consider whether any of the eight officers on the train who state they shouted or heard the words ‘armed police’ have conspired to ... pervert the course of justice. ...” 64. As the IPCC did not consider that Trojan 80, Trojan 84 and DCI C had been in a position to influence the outcome of events, it was of the opinion that they could not be held responsible. 65. In respect of the possible alteration of the surveillance log (see paragraphs 42 and 56 above), the IPCC did not find sufficient evidence against any individual to suggest that criminal proceedings might be appropriate. 66. The IPCC noted that in the course of its investigation grave concerns had been raised about the effectiveness of the police response on 22 July 2005. These concerns were not only that an entirely innocent member of the public had been killed in error but also that the police response might not have been adequate to stop a terrorist who was intent on causing harm. It therefore made a number of detailed operational recommendations. 67. The IPCC underlined two operational concerns about the use of firearms: the substantial delay between the time the unit from SO19 was requested and when it was deployed, and the lack of clarity about the command to “stop” the suspect given the likely mind-set of the SFOs. It also made detailed recommendations on command and control issues in firearms operations, including the need to clarify the roles and responsibilities within the chain of command; to establish a clear and common understanding of the circumstances surrounding future operations; and, given the failure to implement Commander McDowall’s strategy to ensure the deployment of the unit from SO19 in time, to put in place better communications channels. 68. In respect of the surveillance operations, the IPCC expressed concern that the surveillance team, the SFOs, and those in command were not used to working together and were not sufficiently familiar with each other’s working practices; that two surveillance officers believed the person being followed was not the suspect and that this was not communicated to the DSO; and that the surveillance log had been altered. 69. In relation to the post-incident management, the IPCC repeated its concern about the delay in handing the scene and the investigation to it, and about the fact that Charlie 2 and Charlie 12 had been allowed to return to their own base, refresh themselves, confer and write up their notes together. 70. As regards the communications infrastructure, the IPCC was concerned that key briefings and strategic and tactical decisions were not recorded and furthermore that the command and control of the incident was inevitably lost when the unit from SO19 entered the underground. Concerns were also expressed that the existing Firearms Manual and the “KRATOS” policy were patently insufficient to deal with the current terrorist threat. 71. The IPCC Stockwell One Report was not made public until 8 November 2007 as publication was delayed pending the criminal trial of the Office of the Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis (“OCPM”) (see paragraphs 100-101 below). 72. On 14 October 2005 the MPA referred a complaint to the IPCC about the MPS’s handling of public statements following the shooting of Mr de Menezes. The IPCC carried out a second investigation and the IPCC Stockwell Two Report was published on 2 August 2007. The contents of that report are not directly relevant to the complaint currently before the Court. 73. The IPCC had the power to recommend or direct the MPS to bring disciplinary proceedings against individuals. During the IPCC investigation fifteen officers were served with notices under Regulation 9 of the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2004, informing them that they were being investigated and warning them that the investigation might result in disciplinary proceedings being brought against them. 74. However, on 11 May 2007 the IPCC decided that no disciplinary action should be pursued against any of the eleven frontline and surveillance officers involved in the operation since there was no realistic prospect of any disciplinary charges being upheld. One surveillance officer received “words of advice” in connection with the alteration of the surveillance log. 75. A decision concerning disciplinary charges against the two Commanders and their tactical advisers was postponed until after the prosecution of the OCPM (see paragraphs 100-101 below). 76. On receiving the IPCC Stockwell One Report, the CPS considered whether to bring prosecutions against any individual officers for murder, involuntary manslaughter by way of gross negligence (“gross negligence manslaughter”), misconduct in public office, forgery or attempting to pervert the course of justice. It also considered whether to prosecute the OCPM or any individual for offences under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (“the 1974 Act”). In deciding whether or not to prosecute, it first had to apply a threshold evidential test, namely, whether or not there was a realistic prospect of conviction, before asking whether or not prosecution would be in the public interest (see paragraph 163 below). 77. By letter dated 17 July 2006 the CPS notified the deceased’s family that the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) had decided to prosecute the OCPM, not in his individual capacity but as an employer of police officers, for failing to provide for the health, safety and welfare of Mr de Menezes contrary to sections 3 and 33 of the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 157-158 below). No individual was to be prosecuted in relation to the death as there was “insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any individual police officer”; that is, it was more likely than not that a jury would not convict. 78. The decision letter, in so far as relevant, provided as follows: “In the circumstances of this case, if the prosecution could prove that [the SFOs] were not acting in self defence (either of themselves or others) then they would be charged with murder. The order was given that Jean Charles was to be stopped from getting on the train. Although officers in the control room intended that Jean Charles should be arrested outside the station, the [SFO team] were not in place to make such an arrest, nor was this intention made explicit to the [SFOs] who were being sent down to the train. All the available evidence suggests that they believed that Jean Charles had been identified as a suicide bomber, that they had been directed to stop him from blowing up the train and that they had to shoot him to prevent that .... The burden would be on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that these two officers did not honestly and genuinely believe that they were facing a lethal threat and so I looked to see if there was sufficient evidence to disprove that they had such an honest and genuine belief. Both officers stated that Jean Charles was wearing a ‘bulky’ jacket when they saw him but in fact Jean Charles was wearing a simple denim jacket. I therefore took this into account as it could indicate that the officers had lied. However even if I could prove that the officers had lied, rather than simply being mistaken, this alone would not be enough to commence a prosecution for murder as there could be other reasons for an officer to lie. I also considered their explanations of Jean Charles’s movements when they approached him, to see if there was evidence that they had fabricated those accounts to justify their actions. Both refer to Jean Charles getting up and advancing towards them with his hands down by his side before he was tackled by a surveillance officer and forced back into the seat. The [SFOs] then shot Jean Charles. I had to consider whether the prosecution could argue that the restraint meant that no bomb could be detonated and that the firearms officers’ actions were unlawful. However I must bear in mind that this happened in a matter of seconds and there is some independent evidence that supports the officers’ accounts that they feared Jean Charles might detonate a bomb. A witness sitting opposite Jean Charles said ‘I got the impression that he was reaching to the left hand side of his trouser waistband.’ ... As I cannot prove the officers did not act in genuine self-defence, I cannot charge them with murder or any other offence of assault, including manslaughter. There is some disagreement between officers and the members of the public as to whether any warning was given that armed police were approaching the train. In a situation such as this, where a warning to a suspected bomber could be fatal for officers and the public, no warning should be given. However some police officers say that they did hear a call of ‘armed police’ before the shooting and although passengers did hear officers shouting as they ran down the stairs, none of them heard the words ‘armed police.’ Both of the [SFOs] say that they shouted ‘armed police’ immediately before they fired but whether they did, and if so, whether it was intended as a warning to Jean Charles or to others in the carriage is unclear. There is no doubt that some police officers did shout something before any shots were fired .... Unless I could prove that officers had lied ... to mislead any investigation, I could not prosecute them for attempting to pervert the course of justice. Next I carefully examined the roles of those police officers concerned in planning the surveillance and stop and those who carried it out. ... there were a number of people involved and there is no doubt that messages were misinterpreted with tragic consequences. I have considered whether any errors or other conduct by individuals could be categorised as criminal. In this I have applied the law on gross negligence manslaughter, misconduct in public office and the [1974] Act. Even where I found that individuals had made mistakes, I found insufficient evidence that those mistakes were so bad that they could be described as criminal. As criminal proceedings are to be brought against the [OCPM], I cannot provide you with a detailed account of the conduct of those individuals, as that conduct will form part of the prosecution case.” 79. More detailed reasons were provided in a fifty-page Review Note dated 9 March 2006 as well as in a Final Review Note of 9 July 2006. 80. In respect of the investigation by the IPCC, the Review Note stated that: “I am satisfied that the investigation has complied with Article 2 and the procedural requirements that flow from it. The IPCC is clearly independent of the Metropolitan Police and the investigation has not been limited to the actual shooting on the train but has examined the whole of the operation. I have had a number of discussions with senior investigators at the IPCC who have assisted me with any queries I have raised. I am therefore satisfied that I have sufficient material before me to reach a decision on the criminal liability of those officers involved in the operation that led to the death of Mr de Menezes and the Commissioner as corporation sole.” 81. However, the Review Note drew attention to one particular evidential difficulty: “Perhaps the most significant problem in understanding what occurred is that there is an almost complete absence of any worthwhile contemporaneous records and the accounts from the participants vary significantly on all the crucial aspects. It is at times impossible to say with any certainty what was said, by whom, to whom and when. There is also the issue that some accounts were made in the knowledge that something terrible had gone wrong.” 82. With regard to the witness statements taken from the passengers on the train, the Review Note indicated that there were inevitable inconsistencies in their recollections of events with the consequence that “the accounts do not match either among themselves or with those of the police”. For example, some of the witnesses confused Mr de Menezes with “Ivor”, one of the surveillance officers. 83. With regard to Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, the Review Note reiterated that there was insufficient evidence to persuade a jury that they did not genuinely believe they were acting in self-defence. It noted that, if they did hold a genuine belief, then the actions they took in shooting dead a “suicide bomber” would be reasonable and would not be unlawful. 84. As for Commander Cressida Dick, the Review Note stated that there was no evidence against her to sustain a charge of murder as she did not order any officer to open fire. The prosecutor was, however, satisfied that there was evidence her actions and direction and failure to plan fell below the standard of a reasonable officer in her position and, as such, a breach of the duty of care and causation could be shown. Nevertheless, he considered that there was “nowhere near enough” evidence to persuade a jury that her conduct was so bad as to justify a charge of gross negligence manslaughter. He also considered the possibility of prosecuting Commander Dick for offences under sections 7 and 33 of the 1974 Act, but, having applied the relevant criteria, found that the prosecution of her or of any of the other individual officers under these provisions would not be in accordance with Health and Safety Executive Policy. 85. In the Review Note the prosecutor identified Trojan 84 as the officer most closely connected with the death of Mr de Menezes. In particular, he had failed to dispatch firearms cover to Scotia Road, he gave the briefing that stoked the SFOs fears that they would meet suicide bombers and that they might have to shoot them, and, finally, he should have known that once the SFOs were away from the armed response vehicle and were to engage with a potential suicide bomber the overwhelming likelihood was that they would shoot. However, he could not be prosecuted for murder as he did not direct the officers to fire and his actions were not “bad” enough to satisfy the test for gross negligence manslaughter. 86. Likewise, the prosecutor considered that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Trojan 80, DCI C or the surveillance teams for gross negligence manslaughter. 87. The Review Note considered the alleged alteration of the log (see paragraph 56 above), but found that it had been examined by two experts who did not agree to the required standard either that there had been alterations or, if there had been, who might have made them. Therefore, as it could not be proved that the relevant entry was a forgery, let alone who might have forged it, there was no basis for a prosecution for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. 88. It also indicated that there was no evidence the police or anyone else had tampered with the recording equipment on the bus, at the station or on the train. Although there were gaps in the recordings at all three locations, the IPCC investigation had revealed that high vibrations had interfered with the recording of most of the bus journey, the hard drive on the train had not been replaced on the relevant day, and the recording equipment in the station had been broken during prior refurbishments. 89. The Review Note explained in greater detail the decision to prosecute the OCPM. The prosecutor indicated that: “In my view, this operation was badly handled from the moment it passed from Commander [McDowall]. It resulted in an innocent man being shot dead in the most horrific manner. The Metropolitan Police were under tremendous pressure and were doing their best to protect the public from suicide bombers. These are factors that I take into account but these do not detract from the failure to carry out [Commander McDowall’s] strategy which would have best protected Mr de Menezes.” 90. He continued: “In my view, the lack of planning led to the death of de Menezes and, as such, constituted an offence under section 3 of the [1974 Act]. I believe that if such a charge is preferred, we can prove the case on the evidence already available but a decision not to prosecute individuals will enable the IPCC to seek further evidence to strengthen the case, from those individuals who are at present declining to.” 91. The only defence open would be one of “reasonable practicability” and it was “difficult to see how the police could argue the lack of reasonable practicability in ensuring the safety of [Mr de Menezes]. If this came to a contested trial, the police would probably have to call a number of officers ... who were interviewed as suspects. Their failures in the planning would then be highlighted”. 92. On 16 October 2006 the applicant sought leave to apply for judicial review of the decision not to prosecute any individual police officer for criminal offences, which she argued was incompatible with Article 2 of the Convention. 93. In particular, the applicant argued that the threshold evidential test in the Crown Prosecutors’ Code (“the Code”), which prevented a prosecution unless a jury properly directed was likely to convict (see paragraph 163 below), was not compatible with Article 2. She also submitted that Article 2 required the courts to undertake a more intensive review of a prosecutor’s decision than that provided for in R v. Director of Public Prosecutions, ex parte Manning [2001] 1 QB 330, in which the Divisional Court stated that it would accord great weight to the judgment of experienced prosecutors and, as such, a prosecutorial decision would be lawful if it was taken in accordance with the Code and was a decision reasonably open to the prosecutor on the material before him (see paragraph 165 below). 94. On 14 December 2006 a Divisional Court of the High Court granted permission to apply for judicial review but dismissed the substantive application. 95. In relation to the compatibility of the Code with Article 2, the court found that this Court’s jurisprudence did not determine any particular evidential test to be applied when deciding whether or not there should be a prosecution. The test set out in the Code was therefore compatible with the obligation under Article 2 to put in place effective criminal law provisions to deter the commission of offences against the person, backed up by law enforcement machinery for the prevention, suppression and punishment of breaches of such provisions. Bringing prosecutions which were likely to fail, even if they could survive a dismissal application and a submission of no case to answer, would have profound consequences for all parties concerned. Furthermore, if the threshold was lowered in cases where lethal force was employed by State agents, it was likely that a significant proportion of prosecutions would fail because the evidence was lacking. If this were to happen, public confidence in both law enforcement agencies and in the CPS would be undermined. 96. The court also held that Article 2 did not require a change to the established position regarding judicial review of a decision not to prosecute. The “careful scrutiny” review required in Öneryıldız v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, § 96, ECHR 2004XII was compatible both with the test outlined in the Manning case (see paragraph 165 below) and with the domestic courts’ general approach to cases involving fundamental human rights. 97. Thirdly, applying the Manning test, the court found that the decision of the CPS was in accordance with the Code and was one which was reasonably open to it. The decision was taken by a very senior and highly experienced prosecutor and it was reviewed by the head of the CPS and by independent counsel. It was lengthy, careful, thorough, clear and detailed and the CPS had applied the correct test to each individual considered; namely, “whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, or, in other words, whether a jury was more likely to convict than not to convict”. 98. Although it was not necessary for the court to go so far, it also indicated that it saw “no reason to disagree with the decision”. Consequently, it concluded that the DPP’s decision was lawful and dismissed the applicant’s challenge to it. Leave to appeal to the House of Lords was refused by the court and, on 26 July 2007, by the House of Lords itself. 99. On 22 January 2007 the court also rejected an application by the OCPM to have the charges under the 1974 Act dismissed. 100. On 1 October 2007 the criminal trial of the OCPM commenced. A total of forty-seven witnesses were called to give evidence during the course of the trial, including Commander McDowall and Commander Dick. The prosecution argued that the OCPM was guilty of the following: a) Commander McDowall’s strategy had not been communicated adequately to the officers who took over the running of the operations on 22 July 2005, the surveillance officers or the SFOs; b) Commander McDowall’s strategy for controlling the premises was not adequately planned for or carried out; c) the Control Room officers, the SFOs and the surveillance officers had a confused and inconsistent understanding of the strategy for Scotia Road; d) officers had not been deployed to stop and question persons emerging from the Scotia Road premises, including Mr de Menezes; e) the SFOs were not in attendance at Scotia Road when Mr de Menezes emerged from the common doorway; f) there was no contingency plan for dealing with persons who emerged from the apartment building before the firearms officers arrived; g) persons emerging from Scotia Road had not been stopped and questioned; h) a safe and appropriate area where those leaving Scotia Road could be stopped and questioned had not been identified; i) the briefings given to the SFOs were inaccurate, unbalanced, and provided the SFOs with inadequate and inaccurate information about the operation, including the operation at Scotia Road; j) the information concerning the identification of Mr de Menezes, his clothing, demeanour and likely level of threat, was not properly or accurately assessed or disseminated to officers and, in particular, to the SFOs; k) doubts about the correctness of the identification of Mr de Menezes as the suspect were not communicated to the control room; l) the control room officers failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of Mr de Menezes as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers; m) the SFOs had not been deployed at relevant locations in time to prevent Mr de Menezes from getting on the bus and entering Stockwell underground station; n) the SFOs failed to satisfy themselves that a positive identification of Mr de Menezes as the suspect had been made by the surveillance officers; o) effective steps were not taken to stop underground trains or buses so as to minimise the risk to the travelling public; p) Mr de Menezes was permitted to get on a bus twice and to enter Stockwell underground station despite being suspected of being a suicide bomber and despite having emerged from an address linked to a suspected suicide bomber; q) a clear and timely order that Mr de Menezes be stopped or arrested before he entered Stockwell underground station had not been given; r) accurate information had not been given to the DSO about the location of the SFOs when she was deciding whether the SFOs or officers from the Anti-Terrorist Branch should stop Mr de Menezes; and s) the risk inherent in effecting the arrest of Mr de Menezes by armed officers had not been minimised, whether in relation to the location, timing or manner of his arrest. 101. On 1 November 2007 the jury returned a verdict, finding the OCPM guilty of breaching sections 3 and 33 of the 1974 Act (see paragraphs 157 and 158 below). The jury also attached a rider to its verdict to the effect that Commander Dick bore no “personal culpability” for the impugned events. This rider was endorsed by the trial judge. The OCPM was fined GBP 175,000 and ordered to pay costs of GBP 385,000. 102. After the trial, the IPCC decided not to issue a recommendation for the senior officers to face disciplinary proceedings. In particular, it had regard to the jury’s rider that no blame should attach to Commander Dick, who was the most senior officer. 103. The inquest, which had been adjourned pending the trial of the OCPM, commenced on 22 October 2008. In the course of the inquest seventy-one witnesses were called, including Commander McDowall, Commander Dick, Trojan 80, Trojan 84, Charlie 2 and Charlie 12. The family of Mr de Menezes were represented at the hearing at the State’s expense and were able to cross-examine witnesses and make submissions. 104. On 24 November 2008 the coroner delivered a written Ruling on what, if any, verdicts should be left to the jury. The options available to him were lawful killing, unlawful killing and an open verdict. However, the coroner was not permitted to leave a verdict to a jury if it fell foul of the test used to determine a submission of “no case to answer”; namely, if there was no evidence to support it or the evidence was so weak, vague or inconsistent with other evidence that, taken at its highest, a jury properly directed could not properly return that verdict (see paragraph 166 below). 105. The coroner therefore considered the verdicts to be left to the jury separately as regards certain police officers. 106. The coroner found that: “16. ... There is no doubt that the officers intended to kill Mr de Menezes when they fired. Therefore, if their contention that [they] were acting lawfully in defence of themselves or others could be disproved, they would have committed ... the offence of murder. 17. There is agreement between all Interested Persons as to what test I should apply in determining whether the officers acted lawfully in defence of themselves and others: (i) Did the officer honestly and genuinely believe that it was necessary for him to use force in defence of himself and/or others? This is a question of subjective belief. Even if the belief was mistaken, and even if the mistake was unreasonable, the defence can still run. The reasonableness of the belief is only relevant in helping the jury to decide whether the belief was honestly held. (ii) If the officer did hold the belief, did he use no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances as he believed existed at the time? This is an objective test, but it is applied realistically. Where a person faces a threat, the Courts will not judge with too precise a measure the degree of force he uses... It is also significant for present purposes that a person under threat is not required to wait passively for the blow to fall. A pre-emptive strike can be justified by the circumstances. ... ... ... 18. The legal test is no different when the person facing the threat is a police officer or a soldier. However, as Waller LJ said in Bennett at paragraph 15, the tribunal is entitled to take account of the person’s training when applying the two limbs of the test to the facts of the given case. The same must apply to specific briefings as well as general training.” 107. It was accepted by the parties that the SFOs honestly believed that the man in front of them in the carriage was Hussain Osman, the person who was strongly suspected of having attempted to explode a bomb on the underground the day before. However, the coroner rejected the submission on behalf of the de Menezes’ family that the officers did not honestly believe that Mr de Menezes represented an imminent threat. He therefore found that the jury could not properly conclude to the criminal standard of proof that the two officers did not honestly believe that Mr de Menezes represented a mortal threat to those around them. In reaching that conclusion, he stated that: “27. If the officers honestly believed that Mr de Menezes represented a mortal threat to themselves and those around them, it could not be said that they used more force than was reasonably necessary... An argument was made... to the effect that [one of the officers] used excessive force because he fired too many times ... In my judgment, it has no merit. The events took place in a few seconds, and one cannot fairly say that some of the shots to the head constituted reasonable force and some did not. In any event, the officers had been trained to fire until the threat was neutralised.” 108. The coroner therefore declined to leave to the jury the option of returning a verdict of unlawful killing in relation to the actions of Charlie 2 and Charlie 12. 109. The coroner then considered whether the senior officers could safely be found to have committed manslaughter by reason of having caused death by gross negligence. It was accepted by all parties that this offence had to be proved against a particular officer; the failings of a number of persons could not be aggregated. Four elements had to be proved in order to establish that the offence had been committed: the defendant must have owed a duty of care to the victim, the defendant must have breached that duty, the breach must have caused the death (namely, made a more than minimal causal contribution to the death), and the breach must be characterised as “gross”. 110. In relation to the duty of care, the coroner concluded that “35. ... a police officer can owe a duty of care in directing other police officers to perform an armed interception. The content of the duty here would be to take reasonable care to ensure that such an interception took place in such a location and at such a time as to minimise, so far as reasonably practicable, the risk of unnecessary injury to the subject of the intervention, to the officers concerned and to others in the immediate vicinity. In this case the duty would not arise before the point at which firearms officers were ordered to move through with a view to performing an interception.” 111. In relation to Commander McDowall, there were three alleged breaches of a duty of care: that he should have set a strategic plan to ensure that suspects were stopped between leaving the premises and reaching the public transport system; that he did not ensure that the unit from SO19 was deployed sooner; and that he had failed to keep himself informed and to ensure that his orders were being followed. In respect of each of these allegations the coroner did not accept that Commander McDowall had owed any duty of care to Mr de Menezes. However, even if a breach of duty could be established, the coroner did not accept that it had led to Mr de Menezes’ death. 112. There were three allegations against Commander Dick: “54. ... First, ... that [she] failed to ensure that the block on Scotia Road was kept under careful surveillance control and that tactics were employed to ensure that all suspects could be identified and stopped before reaching a bus stop. As it happens, the nearest bus stop was on Upper Tulse Hill, only a few minutes’ walk from the block. The first obstacle [to this] argument is the difficulty of constructing a positive duty of care at that stage to stop Mr de Menezes close to his home. In my judgment, no such duty could exist. Even if it could, I consider that it would not have been practicable to implement this as a fixed and inflexible tactical plan... In any event, the surveillance control was good: Mr de Menezes was kept continually under surveillance but the covert status of the operation near Scotia Road was maintained. The failure to stop him at an earlier stage was based on an inability of officers to say whether he was identifiable with the suspect. Therefore, his death was not caused by any failure of surveillance control at Scotia Road. 55. Secondly, it is alleged that [the DSO] failed to keep herself informed of where surveillance and firearms officers were as Mr de Menezes was travelling from Tulse Hill towards Stockwell. Again, I do not think that a police officer owes a duty to a person under surveillance to ensure that he is informed of the movements of other officers, at least before any intervention is immediately in prospect. If there were such a duty, it would only be to keep oneself reasonably well-informed, since it would not be practicable to keep note of the precise position of every officer and car. The thrust of the evidence is that [the DSO] did keep herself reasonably well-informed. She was aware, through the surveillance monitor in the control room, that surveillance officers were following Mr de Menezes and of what they were saying. In any event, as [counsel for the family of Mr de Menezes] accepts, nothing could have been done to stop Mr de Menezes between his getting on the bus at Tulse Hill and his alighting at Stockwell. [The DSO] had [the SFOs] at the proper holding point at the time she wanted to deploy them. In the minutes before she ordered the intervention, she was relying upon information from [her tactical adviser] as to the position and readiness of the [SFOs]. In my judgment, she was entitled to rely upon that information. In all those circumstances, any failure on her part to keep herself informed was not causative of the fatal events in the carriage. 56. Thirdly, it is submitted ... that [the DSO] failed to exercise proper judgment in her decisions in the last critical minutes, after Mr de Menezes left the bus at Stockwell. In my judgment, she probably did owe a duty of care to him at this stage in making decisions and giving directions for an armed stop. However, she cannot fairly be said to have breached that duty. When she became aware that the subject of surveillance had left the bus, she ordered the [SFOs] to perform an armed stop. Upon hearing that they were not in a position to make the stop, she instructed the surveillance officers to do so. That order cannot be characterised as negligent. If there were any slight delay in giving the order, that can probably be explained by the need to take thought before ordering a suspected suicide bomber to be stopped by officers who were not trained for such situations. Once she was told that the [SFOs] were in position, she countermanded the earlier order. It might be possible to say that she made the wrong decision at that point, given where Mr de Menezes was known to be, but these were fast-moving events and her decision cannot be described as negligent. [It was submitted] that using [SFOs] gave rise to a particular risk that lethal force would be used. However, there were obvious advantages to using officers who had the training and experience to perform armed interventions in a public place.” 113. As to this officer, the coroner stated as follows: “58. The first charge against [Trojan 80] is that, upon arriving at New Scotland Yard at around 6.00 a.m., he failed to take steps to expedite the despatch of [the unit from SO19] to the Scotia Road area. For the reasons already given, I do not consider that he would have owed a duty of care to Mr de Menezes in this regard. In any event, when he started work, all the critical decisions had been taken in relation to the [SFOs] deployments. It would probably not have been safe or sensible to try to expedite the deployments at that stage. As explained in paragraph 52 above, I do not think it can be established to the necessary standard of proof that any delay in deploying firearms teams was causally relevant to the death of Mr de Menezes. 59. The second allegation is that he failed to devise a tactical plan to ensure that any suspect coming out of the block was stopped before reaching a bus stop. This is, in essence, the same as one of the allegations made against [the DSO]. For the reasons I have given in paragraph 54, this argument fails at every stage. 60. The third point made in criticism of [Trojan 80] is that he failed to pass on to [the DSO] accurate information about the position of the [SFOs] in the minutes after it became apparent that Mr de Menezes was leaving the bus. However, [Trojan 80] was reliant for his information on the tactical adviser who was with the team on the ground, ‘Trojan 84’. That officer initially told [Trojan 80] that his team were ‘not in contention’ because they were behind the wrong bus. [Trojan 80] duly passed on that information. Even if it were incorrect, it is difficult to criticise him for passing it on.” 114. If, contrary to all of the above, any of the allegations were made out, the coroner concluded that none approached the level of gross or criminal negligence. 115. In light of the above, the coroner decided not to leave the potential short-form verdict of unlawful killing to the jury in respect of the senior officers and instead left them to decide between a verdict of lawful killing and an open verdict. 116. The coroner also included in his Ruling a list of proposed questions which would be left to the jury and which required responses of “yes”, ”no”, or ”cannot decide”. Having heard the parties’ submissions, on 1 December 2008 he finalised the list of questions to include questions of fact concerning the events in the train carriage and questions concerning the factors which had contributed to Mr de Menezes’ death. However, he refused to leave “open questions” to the jury inviting them to add any other factors which they regarded as causally relevant. 117. On 2 December 2008 Mr de Menezes’ mother had sought leave to apply for judicial review of the coroner’s decision to exclude both the verdict of unlawful killing and certain narrative verdict questions. At the hearing, she pursued the second point only because by that date the coroner had started summing up and had already indicated the verdicts which were to be left to the jury. 118. The claimant argued that the coroner had been obliged to ensure that the jury members were permitted to resolve the disputed factual issues at the heart of the case and were able properly to determine by what means and in what circumstances Mr de Menezes had come by his death. The question of how he came by his death went far beyond determining whether to return a verdict of lawful killing or an open verdict. The coroner’s approach had precluded the jury from commenting on whether or not they regarded any particular failings by the police as serious and, if so, how serious – and how important in terms of accountability – these failings were. As such, the jury’s findings were at best likely to beg more questions and at worst be confusing or meaningless. The claimant therefore wished to put additional narrative verdict questions to the jury once the coroner’s summing up was finished. 119. On 3 December 2008 Silber J refused leave to apply for judicial review. 120. First, he found that the existing verdicts and questions satisfied the statutory obligation under section 11 of the Coroners Act and Rule 36(1)(b) of the Coroners Rules (see paragraphs 167 and 168 below) to enable the jury members to ascertain by what means and in what circumstances Mr de Menezes had come by his death. Furthermore, the inquiry required by the coroner of the jury in this case was significantly more demanding than that sought from, and given by, the jury in both Bubbins v. the United Kingdom no. 50196/99, ECHR 2005II and McCann and Others v. the United Kingdom 27 September 1995, Series A no. 324, and in those cases this Court had found that the procedural obligations under Article 2 of the Convention had been met. 121. Secondly, the judge observed that the claimant had not pointed to any case decided domestically or in this Court which held that specific questions were required to be asked of a jury over and above asking “by what means and in what circumstances” the deceased had died. 122. Thirdly, as the coroner had a discretion “to decide how best in the particular case to elicit the jury’s conclusion on the central issue or issues”, the judge considered that the only grounds for interfering with it would probably be Wednesbury grounds; namely, that the coroner’s decision was so unreasonable that no reasonable coroner would have done the same. 123. Fourthly, the judge found that there was a risk that if the jury members were required to answer the additional questions proposed by the claimant they would be acting in contravention of Rule 36(2) of the Coroners Rules 1984 by expressing opinions on matters other than those on which they were entitled to comment and, in particular, by appearing to determine questions of criminal or civil liability. 124. Fifthly, he considered that the proposed questions would expose the jury to a risk of making contradictory and conflicting findings. 125. Sixthly, the judge found that the claimant had failed to show, even arguably, that there were strong grounds for disturbing the decision of the coroner. 126. The claimant’s grounds relating to the short-form verdicts were adjourned generally with liberty to both parties to apply to restore. The claimant subsequently agreed that no further action would be taken in relation to these grounds because, inter alia, even if the judicial review was successful the only remedy for the family would be for the court to order a fresh inquest and the claimant did not “see any great benefit in re-hearing all the evidence to enable a different jury to come to a verdict, particularly bearing in mind the very high cost of holding such an inquest”. 127. On 12 December 2008 the jury returned an “open verdict”. In answering the questions left to them the jury found as follows: a) that Charlie 12 did not shout “armed police”; b) that while Mr de Menezes did stand up before being grabbed in a bear hug by one of the surveillance officers, he did not move towards the SFOs; c) that the general difficulty in identifying the man under surveillance in the time available and the innocent behaviour of Mr de Menezes (which may have increased suspicion) were not contributory factors to his death; d) that the following were contributory factors to his death: the failure to obtain and provide to surveillance officers better photographic images of the failed bomber Hussain Osman; the fact that the views of the surveillance officers regarding the identification of the suspect were not accurately communicated to the command team and the SFOs; the failure by police to ensure that Mr de Menezes was stopped before he reached public transport; the fact that the position of the cars containing the SFOs was not accurately known by the command team as the SFO teams were approaching Stockwell underground station; the shortcomings in the communications system between various police teams on the ground; and a failure to conclude at the time that surveillance officers could have been used to carry out the stop on Mr Menezes at Stockwell underground station; and e) it was not clear whether the pressure on police after the suicide attacks in July 2005 was a contributory factor to Mr de Menezes’ death. 128. After the verdict the coroner delivered a report as he was required to do under Rule 43 of the Coroners Rules 1984. In the report he identified MPS systems and practices which gave rise to concern and the risk that other deaths might arise in the future. He further identified action which should be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuance of such circumstances or to eliminate or reduce the risk of death created by such circumstances. The coroner also reviewed material indicating which remedial steps had already been taken to develop police practice since the events of July 2005. 129. In the report the coroner expressed concerns about the command structure employed by the police on 22 July 2005 and observed that the Association of Chief Police Officers (“ACPO”) manual on the police use of firearms and the command structure should be reviewed. He also made specific recommendations about the role of the DSO, who was responsible for ordering any intentional shot that might be required in anti-terrorist operations. 130. The coroner also reported on the communication problems that the jury found had contributed to the death of Mr de Menezes. He recommended that changes should be made to the systems and methods of communication to ensure that there was better information available to enable accurate identification to be made and communicated and to ensure that appropriately trained police officers were available to deal with possible terrorist threats on the basis of as much up-to-date information as possible. 131. Finally, the coroner made recommendations about the recording of briefing and control room activity and recommended that the practice of police witnesses conferring before recording their accounts of events should cease. 132. Following the inquest, further meetings and exchanges of correspondence took place between the CPS and Mr de Menezes’ family. On 26 March 2009 the family asked the DPP to review the decision not to prosecute in light of new evidence which had emerged at the inquest. 133. On 8 April 2009 the DPP confirmed by letter that there remained insufficient evidence to prosecute any individual. 134. Mr de Menezes’ family did not apply for leave to seek judicial review of this decision, considering that there would be no prospect of success in light of the previous judicial review action. The factual matrix had not significantly changed: the claim would have been on similar grounds to the previous claim for review and was therefore bound to fail. 135. By letter dated 2 October 2009 the Chairman of the IPCC rejected the family’s request to review its decision not to initiate disciplinary proceedings as no new evidence had emerged during the inquest to justify bringing disciplinary charges against any individual officer. 136. He noted that the trial of the OCPM and the inquest had confirmed the conclusion of the IPCC that Mr de Menezes was killed because of mistakes that could and should have been avoided. Indeed, the trial of the OCPM, the coroner’s report, the IPCC recommendations, Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary, the MPA and the MPS had all recognised the organisational failings that led to his death. Major efforts had been made to rectify these organisational failings and it was necessary to take them into account when judging the individual culpability of the officers concerned. Every independent judicial, prosecuting and disciplinary authority which had considered the conduct of the officers had concluded that individual criminal or disciplinary charges were not merited. 137. In respect of Charlie 2 and Charlie 12, there was insufficient evidence to undermine their claim that they honestly believed they were dealing with a suicide bomber or to warrant proceedings based on the disciplinary offences of using excessive force or abusing authority. The officers had had at best five to ten seconds to assess whether to shoot to kill and given the overall scene of confusion, coupled with the stress of the circumstances, it was not possible to conclude that the mistakes which were made were deliberate or negligent. 138. With regard to Commander McDowall, the IPCC concluded that it was not likely that any tribunal would find that failings which occurred after he set his strategy were due to negligence on his part. 139. As for Commander Dick, the IPCC had regard to the criminal jury’s unambiguous conclusion that she had no personal culpability, especially as no evidence had emerged at the inquest which would cause a disciplinary tribunal to ignore this finding. 140. The IPCC considered that there was no evidence that might cause a tribunal to accept the jury’s rider in respect of Commander Dick but not in respect of Trojan 80 or DCI C. 141. In respect of “James”, the IPCC accepted that the degree of doubt as to the identity of Mr de Menezes was not communicated sufficiently clearly by the surveillance team. However, the IPCC concluded that this was the result of technical as well as personal shortcomings, the speed and stress of the circumstances and the lack of an unambiguous communications process. 142. A civil action in damages was brought by the family of Mr de Menezes (including the applicant) against the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. This was settled by way of mediation during the week of 16 November 2009. The settlement was on a confidential basis. 143. Following the death of Mr de Menezes the MPS took a number of steps to improve its methods of command and control in counter-terrorism operations. In particular, a common command model was introduced for planned firearms operations, a smaller team, or “cadre” of firearms commanders was formed, a new cadre of ACPO officers was created to deal with high-risk counter-terrorism operations and a new ACPO Firearms Manual was published. 144. In addition, a Surveillance Command was formed to provide consistency of training, procedure and professional practice and to create a platform for increased inter-operability (that is, how different units and personnel work together operationally) with other departments and national units. There has been a structured rotation of teams between counter-terrorism and crime operations to familiarise personnel in both types of operation. 145. Furthermore, a new counter-terrorism control room came into operation and steps were taken to clarify the roles and responsibilities of control room staff and to provide them with high quality training. Operational delivery of a new secure photo-imaging system for transmitting images of suspects and other data has also taken place. Audio recording is now available in the control room, which is activated when dealing with any suicide bombing threat, and a new and evolving covert airwave communication system has been introduced to ensure effective radio communications are available throughout the London underground system as well as above ground. 146. Pursuant to ACPO guidance issued in October 2008, the practice of officers writing up their notes together after an incident has ceased in cases where police officers have discharged firearms. Internal instructions drawn up in consultation with the IPCC and DPS have since extended this change of practice to officers involved in other (non-shooting) death and serious injury cases.",[],[],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],0

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"5. On 4 May 1999 the applicant and F.H. Ltd., a commercial company incorporated under Cypriot law, signed a deed of acknowledgement of debt before a notary. Under the terms of the deed the applicant declared that he had borrowed 100,000 United States dollars (USD) from F.H. Ltd. and undertook to repay that sum with interest by 30 June 1999. The document also contained choice of law and jurisdiction clauses according to which it was to be governed “in all respects” by Cypriot law and the Cypriot courts were to have non-exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising out of it. 6. In 2003 F.H. Ltd. brought proceedings against the applicant in the Limassol District Court (Επαρχιακό Δικαστήριο Λεμεσού, Cyprus), alleging that he had not repaid the above-mentioned debt and requesting that he be ordered to pay the debt together with interest. 7. In an order of 27 June 2003 the District Court summoned the applicant to appear before it. Since the applicant was not resident in Cyprus, F.H. Ltd. made an ex parte application to the same court on 11 September 2003 seeking a fresh order enabling a summons to be served on the applicant outside the country, requiring him to appear within thirty days from the date of service. In that connection the claimant company’s lawyer produced an affidavit declaring that the defendant was habitually resident at an address in G. Street in Riga and that a summons could be served on him at that address. The applicant, for his part, contended that it had been objectively impossible for him to receive the summons at that address, which was simply the address at which he had signed the loan contract and the deed of acknowledgement of debt in 1999 and was not his home or business premises. 8. On 7 October 2003 the Limassol District Court ordered that the applicant be summoned at the above-mentioned address. It summoned him to appear or to come forward within thirty days of receiving the summons, failing which all future announcements concerning the case would be posted on the court’s noticeboard. An affidavit produced by an employee of the firm of lawyers representing F.H. Ltd. showed that, in accordance with the court order, the summons was sent by recorded delivery on 16 November 2003 to the address in G. Street in Riga. It also showed that the legal firm had received a post office slip confirming that the letter had been received by the applicant on 18 November 2003 (the Latvian national holiday and therefore a non-working day in Latvia). The applicant claimed never to have received the summons. 9. As the applicant did not appear, the Limassol District Court, ruling in his absence on 24 May 2004, ordered him to pay the claimant USD 100,000 or the equivalent in Cypriot pounds (CYP), plus interest at an annual rate of 10% of the aforementioned amount from 30 June 1999 until payment of the debt. The applicant was also ordered to pay costs and expenses in a gross amount of CYP 699.50, plus interest at an annual rate of 8%. According to the judgment, which was finalised on 3 June 2004, the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing but had not attended. The judgment itself made no reference to the fact that it was final or to the available remedies. 10. On 22 February 2005 F.H. Ltd. applied to the Riga City Latgale District Court (Rīgas pilsētas Latgales priekšpilsētas tiesa, Latvia) seeking recognition and enforcement of the judgment of 24 May 2004. In its request the company also sought to have a protective measure applied. It stated that the applicant was the owner of real property in Garkalne (a district of Riga) which, according to the land register, was already mortgaged to a bank. Accordingly, fearing that the applicant might seek to evade enforcement of the judgment, it asked the District Court to place a charge on the property and record it in the land register. Lastly, it requested that the applicant be ordered to pay the costs. In its request the company gave as the applicant’s place of residence an address in Č. Street in Riga which differed from the address previously notified to the Cypriot court. 11. On 28 April 2005 the Latgale District Court adjourned examination of the company’s request, pointing to a series of substantive defects which the company was given one month to correct. In particular, the court noted that the company had omitted to explain why it had referred to the address in Č. Street, when the applicant’s presumed address, as it had featured hitherto in the case, was in G. Street. 12. On 26 May 2005 F.H. Ltd. submitted a corrigendum in which it explained, among other points, that according to the data taken from the register of residents (Iedzīvotāju reģistrs), the address in Č. Street was the applicant’s officially declared home address. As to the address in G. Street, the company’s representatives had assumed it to be the applicant’s actual residence. 13. In an order of 31 May 2005 the Latgale District Court ruled that the corrigendum submitted by F.H. Ltd. was insufficient to remedy all the defects in its request. The court declined to examine the request and sent it back to the company. The latter lodged an appeal with the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa), which set aside the impugned order on 23 January 2006 and remitted the case to the District Court, instructing it to examine the request for recognition and enforcement as rectified by the corrigendum of 26 May 2005. 14. In an order of 27 February 2006 issued without the parties being present, the Latgale District Court allowed F.H. Ltd.’s request in full. It ordered the recognition and enforcement of the Limassol District Court’s judgment of 24 May 2004 and the entry in the Garkalne municipal land register of a charge on the property owned by the applicant in that municipality. The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs. 15. It was not until 16 June 2006 that the applicant learnt – by chance, according to his account – of the existence of both the Cypriot court judgment of 24 May 2004 and the Latvian court order of 27 February 2006. He did not attempt to challenge the Cypriot judgment before the Cypriot courts. However, he lodged a so-called ancillary appeal (blakus sūdzība) against the above-mentioned order with the Riga Regional Court, while asking the Latgale District Court to extend the time allowed for lodging the appeal. In that connection the applicant observed that there was nothing in the case file to indicate that he had been summoned to appear at the hearing of 27 February 2006 or that he had been notified of the order issued that day. Accordingly, the thirty-day period laid down by the Civil Procedure Law should start running on 16 June 2006, the date on which he had become aware of the order in question. 16. In an order of 13 July 2006 the Latgale District Court granted the applicant’s request and extended the time-limit for lodging an appeal. It noted, inter alia, as follows: “... It is clear from the court order of 27 February 2006 that the issue of recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment was determined in the absence of the parties, on the basis of the documents furnished by the claimant [F.H. Ltd.]. At the same time the order states that it is open to the applicant to appeal against it within thirty days from the date of receipt of the copy [of that order], in accordance with section 641(2) of the Civil Procedure Law. The court considers the circumstances to which the applicant, P. Avotiņš, refers, to be established, namely the fact that he did not receive the order ... of 27 February 2006 until 16 June 2006, this being attested to by the reference in the list of consultations [appended to the case file], and by the fact that the order, served [on the applicant] by the court, was returned on 10 April 2006... It is apparent from the documents appended to the appeal that the applicant has not lived at his declared address in [Č.] Street since 1 May 2004; this confirms ... the statement made by his representative at the hearing, according to which the applicant no longer lives at the above-mentioned address. Accordingly, the thirty-day period should ... run from the date on which the applicant received the order in question... At the same time, the court does not accept the view of the representative of [F.H. Ltd.] that the applicant himself is responsible for his failure to receive the correspondence because he did not declare his home address promptly, and that the time allowed [for lodging an appeal] should not therefore be extended. The fact of not complying with the legislation on registration of residence is not sufficient to justify the potential consequences if the court were to refuse to allow the applicant to exercise the fundamental rights guaranteed by the State as regards access to the courts and judicial protection, including the right to appeal against a decision. ...” 17. In his grounds of appeal before the Riga Regional Court the applicant argued that the recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia was in breach of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and and commercial matters (known as the “Brussels I Regulation”, hereafter “the Regulation”) and of the relevant provisions of the Latvian Civil Procedure Law. He submitted two arguments in that regard. 18. First, the applicant observed that in accordance with Article 34(2) of the Regulation (corresponding in substance to section 637(2), third subparagraph, of the Latvian Civil Procedure Law), a judgment given in default in another Member State could not be recognised if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence. In the applicant’s view, those provisions had been breached in his case. The applicant maintained that both the Cypriot lawyers who had represented the claimant company in the Limassol District Court and the Latvian lawyers who had represented it in the Latvian courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in Riga. He observed in that connection that he had had professional dealings with the Cypriot lawyers, who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office; as to the Latvian lawyers, he had met them in person. Therefore, they must all have been aware of his business address. Furthermore, the summons could have been sent to the applicant’s home address in Garkalne, as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and his property there was entered under his name in the land register, which the lawyers could have consulted. However, instead of having the summons sent to one of those addresses, which were known and accessible, the lawyers had given the courts an address where it was objectively impossible to reach him. 19. Second, the applicant observed that, under the terms of Article 38(1) of the Regulation and section 637(2), second sub-paragraph, of the Latvian Civil Procedure Law, a judgment had to be enforceable in the State of origin in order to be enforceable in the Member State requested. In the instant case, there had been a threefold breach of those requirements. Firstly, the requesting party had only submitted the text of the Cypriot court judgment to the Latvian court, and not the certificate required in accordance with Annex V to the Regulation. In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under Article 55(1) of the Regulation the court in which enforcement was sought could, in some circumstances, exempt the requesting party from the obligation to produce a certificate; however, in the present case, the Latgale District Court had omitted to explain whether and for what reason it considered that the requesting party could be exempted from that obligation. Secondly, the Cypriot judgment itself had contained no reference to its entry into force or possible remedies. Lastly, in order to be enforced in accordance with the Regulation, a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin; however, none of the documents produced by the company demonstrated that the judgment of 24 May 2004 was enforceable in Cyprus. The applicant therefore concluded that the judgment could under no circumstances be recognised and enforced in Latvia. 20. In a judgment of 2 October 2006 the Regional Court allowed the applicant’s appeal on the merits, quashed the impugned order and rejected the request for recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment. 21. F.H. Ltd. lodged an appeal against that judgment with the Senate of the Supreme Court, which examined it at a hearing on 31 January 2007. At the start of the hearing the appellant company submitted copies of several documents to the Senate, including the certificate provided for by Article 54 of the Regulation and by Annex V thereto, dated 18 January 2007 and signed by an acting judge of the Limassol District Court. According to the certificate, the document instituting the proceedings had been served on the applicant on 27 November 2003. The last part of the certificate, intended for the name of the person against whom the judgment was enforceable, had been left blank. When asked to comment on these documents, the applicant’s lawyer argued that they were clearly insufficient to render the judgment enforceable. 22. In a final judgment of 31 January 2007 the Senate quashed and annulled the Regional Court judgment of 2 October 2006 and allowed F.H. Ltd.’s claims. It ordered the recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment and the entry in the land register of a charge on the applicant’s property in Garkalne. The relevant extracts from the judgment read as follows: “ ... It is clear from the documents in the case file that the Limassol District Court judgment was made final. This is confirmed by the explanations provided by both parties at the Regional Court hearing on 2 October 2006, according to which no appeal had been lodged against the judgment, and by the certificate issued on 18 January 2007... As [the applicant] did not appeal against the judgment, his lawyer’s submissions to the effect that [he] was not duly notified of the examination of the case by a foreign court are of no importance. Having regard to the foregoing, the Senate accepts that the judgment of the Limassol District Court (Cyprus) of 24 May 2004 should be recognised and enforced in Latvia. Article 36 of the Regulation provides that a foreign judgment may under no circumstances be reviewed as to its substance; in accordance with section 644(1) of the Civil Procedure Law, once such judgments have been recognised they are to be enforced in accordance with the conditions laid down by the same Law. ...” 23. On the basis of the Senate judgment the Latgale District Court issued a writ of execution (izpildu raksts) on 14 February 2007. The applicant complied immediately with the terms of the writ and paid the bailiff employed by the claimant company a total of 90,244.62 Latvian lati (LVL, approximately 129,000 euros (EUR)), comprising LVL 84,366.04 for the principal debt and LVL 5,878.58 in enforcement costs. He then requested that the charge on his property in Garkalne be lifted. In two orders dated 24 January 2008 the judge with responsibility for land registers (Zemesgrāmatu nodaļas tiesnesis) refused the request. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Senate of the Supreme Court which, in an order of 14 May 2008, lifted the charge on the property.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
142,001-184463,ENG,MNE,ADMISSIBILITY,2018,IVANOVIĆ AND DOO DAILY PRESS v. MONTENEGRO,4,Inadmissible,Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström,"1. The applicants are Mr Željko Ivanović (“the first applicant”), a Montenegrin national who was born in 1962 and lives in Podgorica, and D.O.O. Daily Press (“the second applicant”), a publishing company with its registered office in Podgorica. They are represented before the Court by Mr B. Lutovac and M. Đukić, lawyers practising in Podgorica (Montenegro) and Novi Sad (Serbia), respectively. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The first applicant is a journalist and a co-founder and the executive director of the Montenegrin daily newspaper Vijesti. The second applicant is the publisher of the newspaper. 4. On 1 September 2007 Vijesti celebrated its 10th anniversary. After leaving the celebration venue the first applicant was assaulted in the dark and beaten up by three unidentified attackers. As a result of the assault he sustained a broken cheekbone (jagodična kost) and a number of haematomas and bruises. 5. Between 2 and 4 September 2007 Vijesti published several articles relating to the assault, some of them including the first applicant’s own comments. 6. In particular, on 2 September 2007 an article entitled “A club from Đukanović and the family” (Palica od Ɖukanovića i familije) was published: “[The first applicant] said that the former Prime Minister Milo Ɖukanović had sent his hellhounds (poslao svoje kerbere) yesterday morning to beat him up. [The first applicant] said that ‘those who rule Montenegro’ had congratulated Vijesti on its tenth anniversary by these means. ‘It is a greeting from those ruling Montenegro, and that is Milo Đukanović and his family, be it biological or criminal’, said [the first applicant...]. On Radio Crna Gora [he] told Ɖukanović not to send his people on an ambush in the dark but to put himself on the line (sam izađe na crtu) instead of backing out in this kind of situation (umjesto što u takvim situacijama spušta pogled). ... [The first applicant] considers that this was a warning to Vijesti to surrender (da polože oružje), and that there is an attempt to drown even the small islands of freedom in Montenegro, which make Đukanović nervous.” 7. The same day another article was published, entitled “We shall not be intimidated” (Neće nas uplašiti), signed by Vijesti’s editorial board (redakcija). It contained, inter alia, the following: “For Vijesti there is no dilemma that the assault against [its] colleague Ivanović, with his sharp criticism of reality here, is [not only] an attack on all those free-minded people gathered in Vijesti and around it, but also an attack on freedom of thought and speech in general. The motive is to silence Vijesti and all those, who unfortunately are not numerous, who refuse to consider transitional mud and crime as the best of all society. To intimidate all those who do not want to live in a State where the mafia and authorities are interwoven to such an extent that it is difficult to distinguish one from the other (isprepleteni do neprepoznatljivosti), where the political top and mafia bottom are often on the same level, where smuggling is the backbone (okosnica) of the value system, and honest work and righteousness (pravednost) are laughed at in grandiose cafes. The intention is to warn once again those who do not accept this, that the list of unsolved murders can go on indefinitely (sezati u nedogled). It is difficult to expect that the police in this case will go beyond its limits, blockades in mind and in organisation, and will solve the crime, arrest the attackers, identify (razobličiti) and imprison the instigators, those who ordered this. Even before Vijesti claimed that the Montenegrin police were managed from outside the police, the prosecution from outside the prosecution, the judiciary from outside the judiciary, that there was a parallel secret service, State Security or the National Security Agency, all the same. It is a Montenegrin reality and that is the real force, that is the weakness of the State (nemoć države). In any event, the objective responsibility for all that and for the assault against Ivanović lies with the regime headed for 17 years by Milo Ɖukanović, who rules it even now, regardless of form. He and his people, from the top to the bottom, are responsible for an atmosphere in which journalists, writers, and all those who dare to think and speak differently, get hurt. Vijesti has no dilemma about it and it will continue its uncompromising criticism of both the ambiance and people responsible.” 8. It was also mentioned that a few hours before the assault the telephone of one of the editors-in-chief of Vijesti had rung and that the person on the other end of the line had politely introduced himself as Milo Ɖukanović. 9. On 3 September 2007 an article entitled “Even the birds know that he is the boss” (I vrapci znaju da je kapo) was published in Vijesti, and contained the following statements by the first applicant: “The man who has four wars waged in the territory of ex-Yugoslavia on his conscience, an accomplice in politics which destroyed one country, killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions of others, a person who is charged with organised crime and criminal association before the relevant investigative bodies of European countries, the boss who developed a criminal-financial octopus which is strangling (drži za vrat) Montenegro – that moral mountain of a man (gromada) is hurt, his honour harmed, and his mental anguish is such that only the courts can repair it (jedino sud može sanirati). ... I am ready for any court, even Ɖukanović’s, as I do not see anything new or any misdemeanour (prekršajno) in anything I said, and even the birds know that he is the boss of the family, be it biological or criminal, which rules Montenegro and decides on all things, including the most precious – human life. I invite him to try to prove his truth and defence on the public stage, and not through courts, prosecutors, criminals and his spokespeople. Because Ɖukanović needs to know that nothing lasts forever (ničija nije gorjela do zore). My mother and I, we wish his child all the best. We want him in the future, as an honest and honourable citizen, to enjoy and be free and safe in a just and fair society, confident that the system of evil and injustice created and established throughout Montenegro by his father – for which both I and much more my mother suffer today – will go to the dustbin of history.” 10. On 4 September 2007 an article entitled “Various kinds of pressure” (Raznovrstan repertoar pritisaka) was published in Vijesti, including the following statement by the first applicant: “These pressures came from the top of the State. Our family members were dismissed from work, threatened by anonymous calls, various inspections were sent to the company..., in the end they attempted to steal (otmu) the majority of stocks so that the daily could be edited as it suited Mr Ɖukanović. When all of this did not work out, the traditional methods were employed.” 11. On 6 September 2007 Mr M. Đukanović (hereinafter “the plaintiff”) instituted civil proceedings against the applicants, seeking 1,000,000 euros (EUR) for the damage caused by all of the above articles and statements by the first applicant contained therein. 12. The applicants submitted that all the most senior political and State officials, including the plaintiff, should be held objectively responsible for increased crime, including assaults on and even the murder of journalists (poslenika javne riječi), and that the impugned articles should be seen in that context. They further maintained that the statements at issue were value judgments, and that the plaintiff, as a politician, had to display a greater degree of tolerance. They proposed that the parties to the proceedings and a number of other people be heard, and that an expert witness assess the level of mental anguish allegedly suffered by the plaintiff. They also maintained that the amount sought was too high and was aimed at suppressing freedom of expression. The applicants submitted that the courts should take into account the context and circumstances in which the statements had been made and the articles published. They relied, inter alia, on Article 10 of the Convention and the Court’s case-law. 13. On 19 May 2008 the Court of First Instance (Osnovni sud) in Podgorica ruled partly in favour of the plaintiff, concluding that his honour and reputation had been harmed, and ordering the applicants jointly to pay the plaintiff EUR 20,000 in non-pecuniary damages and to publish the judgment in Vijesti at their own expense. In particular, the court found that the plaintiff’s honour and reputation had been harmed by the first applicant’s statements in the article “A club from Ɖukanović and his family”, and the contents of the article “Even the birds know that he is the boss”, which described the plaintiff and his family as criminals, and which associated him with organised crime and criminal association. The court relied on Articles 16, 20, 34, 35 and 36 of the Constitution in force at the time, sections 1 and 20 of the Media Act (see paragraphs 39-45 below), and Articles 8 and 10 § 2 of the Convention. 14. In particular, the court considered that freedom of the press and other forms of public information, and the right to dignity and personal rights had to be balanced. It held that “parts of the above articles” were not value judgments but factual information, susceptible to proof, which had not been previously verified or proved, aimed at discrediting not only the plaintiff but his private and family life too. By publishing the above texts, which contained inaccurate, unproved information, without prior verification, subsequent rectification, acceptance of a mistake or a public apology to the plaintiff, the first applicant had persisted in harming the plaintiff’s reputation. As the executive director of a news medium, the first applicant was especially expected to respect the rules when publishing information, particularly that which could be harmful to others. The above texts harshly (grubo) harmed the plaintiff’s honour and reputation, considerably overstepping the limits of criticism to be tolerated by a politician, especially given that the impugned articles did not criticise the plaintiff’s public work but put the plaintiff and his family in a criminal context. 15. The court further held that “the right of the media to publish negative information and criticism relating to politicians did not give [them] the right to violate fundamental human values, the protection of which was provided in respect of every citizen regardless of his/her being a public figure or not. ... Public officials could not have fewer rights than others as that would be a violation of the principle of equality, which was guaranteed by the Constitution.” 16. The first applicant’s allegations that he had made the impugned statements when he had been in a specific state after the assault were dismissed as unfounded. The court also refused other proposed evidence as unnecessary. 17. In assessing the amount of damages the court took into account the importance of the plaintiff’s honour and reputation, the fact that several articles had been published in a daily newspaper which had a high circulation (visokotiražan), traditional understanding of Montenegrin society of moral human values, as well as the criminal context in which both the plaintiff’s personality and his family had been put. 18. Both the plaintiff and the applicants appealed against the decision. 19. On 30 September 2009 the High Court (Viši sud) in Podgorica held that only the following statements harmed the plaintiff’s honour and reputation: “Đukanović had sent his hellhounds to beat [the first applicant] up”; “it is a greeting from those ruling Montenegro, and that is Đukanović and his family, be it biological or criminal”; “the boss who developed a criminal-financial octopus which is strangling Montenegro”, and “he is the boss of the family, be it biological or criminal, which rules Montenegro and decides on all things, including the most precious – human life”. It further held that instead of proving the veracity of the statements the applicants had repeated them. They had thereby misused freedom of expression, given that by “exercising it one could not insult others and harm their honour, reputation and dignity”, which was also prescribed in Article 10 § 2 of the Convention. 20. The court took into account the Court’s opinion that politicians should display a greater degree of tolerance towards criticism, but considered that the above statements overstepped the limits provided for by freedom of expression and the plaintiff’s obligation in that regard, especially given that the applicants had not refrained from mentioning the plaintiff’s family in the same insulting context. 21. It also considered that the compensation of EUR 20,000 was too high and reduced it to EUR 10,000 jointly. 22. Lastly, the court held that the other articles and statements, especially the text “We shall not be intimidated”, criticised the situation in Montenegrin society, and represented value judgments in respect of which no damages should be awarded. The court held that the applicants’ arguments in that regard, submitted in their appeal, were well-founded, which influenced the amount of the damages awarded. The amount was also influenced by the circumstances in which the texts had been written and the statements made, but the court considered that these factors did not justify the publication of untrue information and its transmission through the media, but rather represented its misuse. According to the High Court, the Convention and the Court did not protect that kind of information and statements. 23. This decision was served on the applicants on 17 October 2009. 24. On 4 March 2016 a bailiff (javni izvršitelj) issued an enforcement order on the basis of which the plaintiff collected EUR 16,113.79 from the second applicant’s account. The amount was increased due to the accrued interest. 25. On 31 October 2007 the State prosecutor (Osnovni državni tužilac) filed an indictment against R.P. for violent behaviour, and M.B. for violent behaviour and inflicting serious bodily harm on the first applicant. 26. On 15 January 2008 the Court of First Instance in Podgorica found R.P. and M.B. guilty, on the basis of their confessions, and sentenced them both to four years’ imprisonment. It also established that they had been assisted by “a certain Miki from Sarajevo”. On 16 May 2008 the High Court in Podgorica reduced their sentences to one year. 27. On 5 March 2012 the first applicant’s lawyer sent a letter to the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office submitting that R.P. and M.B. had been convicted contrary to all the evidence, and that even if they had been involved in the assault, there had been at least two more people involved. He requested that the investigation be reopened in order to identify the others involved. 28. Below is further information considered relevant by the parties. 29. In spring 2004 a publisher and the director of Dan, a pro-opposition daily newspaper, was killed in the street. 30. In May 2007 a group of individuals, including the first applicant, organised a petition and issued a press release opposing the award of a regional peace prize to the plaintiff. He was nevertheless awarded the prize. 31. The first applicant’s gross income was 34,118.84 euros (EUR) in 2008 and EUR 36,808.88 in 2009. The second applicant’s profits were EUR 560,889 in 2008 and EUR 13,967 in 2009. 32. Between November 2007 and February 2014 there were eighteen separate attacks (involving the planting of explosive devices, physical assaults, threats, car arson and the stoning of premises) against journalists or premises of Vijesti. In spite of numerous measures undertaken by the relevant authorities (questioning of various individuals, obtaining camera footage, checking telephone communications and polygraph questioning) thirteen of these attacks remain unsolved to date. In five other cases the perpetrators were identified, found guilty in criminal or misdemeanour proceedings, and either fined, given a suspended sentence, or sentenced to between two and nine months in prison. 33. In December 2014 one person was found guilty of coercion and jeopardising the safety of a freelance journalist, and was sentenced to four months in prison. In March 2015 five other individuals were found guilty of violent behaviour against a journalist of Dan and were sentenced to between eleven and fifteen months in prison. 34. Between January 2012 and October 2015 the domestic courts ruled in eight cases of an alleged harming of honour and reputation, in six of which respondent parties were journalists and/or daily newspapers and/or companies publishing daily newspapers. The courts dismissed seven of them, and in one ruled partly in favour of the claimant (an individual), awarding him EUR 2,500 of the EUR 9,000 claimed against a journalist/writer. 35. On several occasions in 2013 and 2014 the Media Development Investment Fund urged the plaintiff to refrain from provocative language when speaking about Vijesti. 36. On 31 January 2014 Human Rights Action/Akcija za ljudska prava, a Montenegrin NGO, issued a report entitled “Prosecution of attacks on journalists in Montenegro”. The report mentions thirty cases of assaults, threats, arson and so forth against various journalists (including the assault against the first applicant), human rights campaigners and a writer. In one incident a person (the writer’s driver/bodyguard) was murdered. All of the incidents took place between 27 May 2004 and 3 January 2014. According to the report, the murders of the Dan editor-in-chief and the writer’s bodyguard have never been resolved, some prosecutions became timebarred, and in some cases where the perpetrators were identified their motives and those who ordered the attacks remained unknown. The report also considered the judgments issued in respect of the applicants to be in breach of Article 10. 37. Between 2012 and 2015 reports were issued by Freedom House (in 2012, 2013 and 2015), the US State Department (in 2012 and 2013) and the UN Human Rights Council (in 2014), which noted assaults and threats against journalists in Montenegro, the pressure they faced, the limited investigations and the consequent lack of accountability. 38. In October 2015 the Global Investigative Journalism Network awarded its prize to the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project “for [its] series ‘Unholy Alliances’ on Montenegro as a mafia state”, which “exposed how [the plaintiff] and his family bank [were] at the centre of an unholy alliance of government, organised crime and business.” 39. Article 16 of the Constitution in force at the time provided that everybody was obliged to respect the rights and freedoms of others, and that any abuse (zloupotreba) of those rights or freedoms was considered anticonstitutional and subject to punishment. 40. Article 20 guaranteed the inviolability of an individual’s physical and psychological integrity, privacy and personal rights, and his or her dignity and safety. 41. Article 34 provided, inter alia, for freedom of expression. 42. Article 35 provided for freedom of the press and other media, as well as the right of individuals (građani) to publicly express their opinions through the media (u sredstvima javnog obavještavanja). 43. Article 36 provided for the right to reply and correction of incorrect published data or information, as well as the right to compensation for damage caused by the publication of untrue data or information. 44. Section 1 provides that the media in Montenegro are free, and that freedom of information is guaranteed in accordance with the standards provided in international human rights texts (UN, OSCE, Council of Europe, EU). It further provides that the Act should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the principles of the Convention and the Court’s case-law. 45. Section 20 provides that, unless otherwise provided by the Act, the founder of the medium is responsible for the content it publishes. Should the media publish content which violates the statutorily protected interest of a person to whom the relevant information refers or insults someone’s honour or integrity, or disseminate untrue allegations about someone’s life, knowledge or competencies, the person concerned is entitled to lodge a compensation claim against the author and the founder of the medium. 46. Section 16 provided that everyone had to refrain from actions which could cause damage to others. 47. Under Articles 199 and 200, inter alia, anyone who had suffered mental anguish as a consequence of a breach of his honour or reputation could, depending on its duration and intensity, sue for financial compensation before the civil courts and, in addition, request other forms of redress “which might be capable” of affording adequate non-pecuniary satisfaction.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
143,001-178682,ENG,EST,ADMISSIBILITY,2017,V.P. v. ESTONIA,4,Inadmissible,Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Julia Laffranque;Ledi Bianku;Robert Spano;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström,"1. The applicant, Ms V.P., is an Estonian national who was born in 1928 and lives in X. The President granted the applicant’s request for her identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). She was represented before the Court by Mr A. Junti, a lawyer practising in Tallinn. 2. The Estonian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Kuurberg, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 4. The applicant was born in 1928 and lives in X. 5. The case concerns the suicide of the applicant’s son, L., who was born in 1955. He had a history of mental illness (paranoid schizophrenia) and had been placed in a psychiatric hospital fourteen times from 1980. From 1989 he was also classed as a disability pensioner. 6. On 30 April 2012 L. attempted to commit suicide by taking a large number of pills that had been prescribed for him and the applicant. The applicant called an ambulance. L. was diagnosed with intoxication and taken to Hospital Y. An extract from L.’s medical file (haiguslugu) contains a reference that after admission to hospital he had intermittently expressed suicidal thoughts. Owing to a lack of space L. was initially placed in the intensive care unit of the renal department. On 1 May 2012 he was transferred from the renal department to the intensive care unit of the department of internal medicine, located on the twelfth floor of the hospital. L. committed suicide on the same day by jumping out of the window. 7. Hospital staff immediately notified the police and the officer who responded to the call wrote up a report. According to the report, documents were drawn up on site, the deceased was photographed and the body was sent for an autopsy, and the doctor on duty gave a statement. The report stated that the doctor had noted that the windows on the twelfth floor did not have locks, and that two nurses on duty had been dealing with another patient in a neighbouring room at the time of the incident. The report also noted that patients were not restrained and kept in their beds in the intensive care unit, as that was considered too extreme a measure. 8. On 1 June 2012 the applicant requested an explanation from the hospital as to why, in particular, the safety of L., who had been a suicidal patient, had not been ensured and why he had not been sent to a psychiatric clinic. According to the reply of 19 July 2012, victims of poisoning were usually taken to that particular hospital as they needed special supervision and care. That had been the case with L., who had been under regular supervision. However, hospital staff had not been with the patient at all times. The reply referred to the fact that symptoms of poisoning usually took one to three days to go away. Patients then had a psychiatric consultation and were transferred for inpatient treatment at a psychiatric clinic or were referred for outpatient care. 9. An autopsy was performed on L. on 2 May 2012. The death certificate (arstlik surmateatis) stated that he had died from injuries to his internal organs and that he had fractures of the skull and skeletal bones and trauma to the head, torso and limbs. The death was initially noted as “accidental” (the relevant box on the form having been ticked). A new death certificate was issued on 5 February 2014, where the cause of death was updated to “suicide” by jumping out of a window. 10. On 30 October 2012 the applicant turned to the Expert Committee on the Quality of Health-Care Services (Tervishoiuteenuse kvaliteedi ekspertkomisjon; hereinafter the “Expert Committee”). The Expert Committee heard the applicant and examined the medical documentation concerning L. It also had an expert opinion of one of its members at its disposal. The Expert Committee gave its opinion on 13 December 2012. It found that the psychiatric treatment L. had received had been in compliance with standard medical practice, and that there had been no link between his previous psychiatric treatment and the attempted suicide on 30 April 2012. Placing L. in the renal and internal medicine departments had been justified as he had been in need of medical supervision. His suicidal tendencies had been properly assessed upon his admission to hospital on 30 April 2012. However, the supervision he had been under had been insufficient and the technical characteristics of the building – the fact that the windows could not be closed to prevent people jumping out – had also served as factors contributing to his suicide. The Expert Committee recommended that Hospital Y implement a procedure for the supervision of suicidal patients and train its staff accordingly. It recommended the use of technical solutions to minimise the risk of suicide, such as monitoring equipment in the rooms and windows with shatterproof glass that could not be opened. The Expert Committee noted that its assessment created no legal rights or obligations but that it could be used as evidence in civil proceedings. 11. On 14 May 2013 the applicant lodged an offence report with the local prosecutor’s office. The prosecutor analysed three potential offences – manslaughter, manslaughter by negligence and placing a person in danger. However, by a letter of 23 May 2013 he refused to institute criminal proceedings on the grounds that the elements of a criminal offence were lacking. According to the prosecutor, there was no reference to the fact that someone might have assisted L. in jumping out of the window. The prosecutor also noted that hospital personnel were responsible for protecting the life and health of their patients (a so-called duty of care, garandikohustus), but he considered that hospital personnel could not objectively be expected to constantly monitor patients or that patients should be tied to their beds or placed in windowless rooms with the door locked. With regard to the offence of placing a person in danger, the prosecutor considered that the height of the hospital and the existence of a window in the hospital room had not, as such, been dangerous, but they had become a threat in the light of L.’s own self-harming activity. Hence, it had not been the medical personnel who had placed L. in danger, rather he had created the danger himself. 12. On 31 May 2013 the applicant appealed to the Office of the Prosecutor General (Riigiprokuratuur), referring to the liability of the health-care provider and the obligation to effectively investigate incidences of death in hospitals. She also noted that it was not clear whether someone else might have been involved in L.’s jumping out of the window. Her appeal was dismissed on 18 June 2013. The Prosecutor General considered that it had been correct to take L. to the regional hospital, Y, where it had been possible to treat him for poisoning, which would not have been possible in a psychiatric clinic. The Prosecutor General also noted that although there had been deficiencies in the training of medical personnel and that the risk of suicide had not been kept at a minimum by applying all the possible technical means, those shortcomings had not reached the level required for criminal liability. 13. On 10 July 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Tallinn Court of Appeal (Tallinna Ringkonnakohus), requesting that the court oblige the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings. She acknowledged that such an appeal had to be filed by a lawyer (advokaat) but noted that she had been assisted by a legal adviser (jurist) from the Estonian Patient Advocacy Association (a non-governmental organisation promoting patient rights) and asked the court of appeal to make an exception in the question of legal representation in her case. If an exception could not be made, the applicant requested that she be granted legal aid and given more time to draw up a request to that effect. 14. By a decision of 21 August 2013 the Tallinn Court of Appeal declined to examine the appeal since it had not been lodged by a lawyer and there were no grounds for making an exception to that requirement. The court of appeal also rejected the application for more time for lodging a request for legal aid, noting that no reasons had been advanced for the applicant’s failure to submit supporting documents in time to prove her lack of means. In addition, the court of appeal noted that the applicant’s prospects of success in the appeal were negligible. The refusal to institute criminal proceedings and the decision of the Office of the Prosecutor General had contained detailed reasons as to why there were no grounds to initiate criminal proceedings. The conclusion that the hospital staff had not committed any criminal offence had been well-founded. 15. The applicant then asked the Supreme Court (Riigikohus) to grant her legal aid to lodge an appeal against the court of appeal’s decision. An appeal to the Supreme Court also had to be lodged by a lawyer. By a decision of 30 September 2013 the Supreme Court refused to grant legal aid. It considered that the decisions of the Prosecutor General and the court of appeal had been well reasoned, showing why no criminal proceedings had been commenced and that an appeal against the court of appeal’s decision would have had no prospect of success. 16. The relevant domestic law, namely references to the Obligations Act, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Penal Code is set out in the case of Rõigas v. Estonia (no. 49045/13, §§ 25–47, 12 September 2017). 17. In addition, further references to domestic law are relevant in the instant case. 18. Under Article 207 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminaalmenetluse seadustik), a victim can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Prosecutor General against a refusal to institute criminal proceedings. 19. Under Article 208, if the appeal mentioned in Article 207 is dismissed by order of the Office of the Prosecutor General, the victim of an alleged offence may lodge a complaint with the court of appeal. Such a complaint must be lodged through a lawyer (advokaat). 20. The Health-Care Services Organisation Act (Tervishoiuteenuste korraldamise seadus) sets out how the provision of health services should be organised and the requirements for such services. It regulates, inter alia, the registration of health-care professionals and the recognition of their professional qualifications as well as the licensing of activities in certain fields of health-care services. All such activities are carried out by the Health Board (Terviseamet) (Chapter 3 of the Act). 21. In addition, the Health-Care Services Organisation Act regulates the role and competences of the Expert Committee: “(1) The Expert Committee on the Quality of Health-Care Services ... is an advisory committee whose purpose is to assess the quality of health-care services provided to patients and to make proposals arising from that assessment to the Health Board, the Estonian Health Insurance Fund and health-care providers. (2) The Committee’s competencies are to: 1. assess the quality of health-care services provided to patients; 2. make proposals to the Health Board for the initiation of supervisory proceedings over the activity of health-care providers; 3. make proposals to health-care providers for assessing the competence of healthcare professionals and sending them to in-service training; 4. make proposals to health-care providers for changing the way they organise their work; ...” 22. Under section 60 of the Health-Care Services Organisation Act and section 1 of the Statute of the Health Board (Terviseameti põhimäärus), the Health Board is a governmental authority operating within the purview of the Ministry of Social Affairs. It has supervisory powers over compliance with the requirements established for health-care providers. Individuals have the right to submit complaints to the Health Board regarding such compliance. 23. Section 3 of the Regulation on the requirements for ensuring the quality of health-care services (Tervishoiuteenuste kvaliteedi tagamise nõuded), as in force at the material time, stated that a patient’s health-care provider was responsible for the health-care service provided to that person. In order to ensure and develop the quality of health-care services and reduce the risks entailed in the provision of such services, health-care providers had to develop and implement quality management systems in line with good medical and service practice. That quality management system had to, inter alia, address the question of ensuring a professional quality and quality in the organisation’s management of its work (section 5). 24. Section 8 of the regulation concerned the annual training of health-care professionals in order to ensure their professional development and raise their competence. The provision obliged each health-care provider to draw up a training plan for health-care professionals for each calendar year. In line with such training plans, health-care providers had to ensure at least sixty hours of specialised training for health-care professionals. 25. The Regulation on requirements for types of hospital (Haigla liikide nõuded) establishes a list of mandatory and permissible inpatient and outpatient services to be provided by general hospitals, central hospitals, regional hospitals, specialist hospitals, rehabilitation hospitals and local hospitals, as well as minimum requirements for staff, equipment and furnishings for the provision of inpatient and outpatient health-care services and for the main facilities used for treatment and diagnostics. 26. As relevant in the instant case, the regulation provides that regional hospitals must provide inpatient and outpatient services in all fields, including emergency and psychiatric care (section 31(1)). It requires certain medical professionals to be present at the hospital at all times, including doctors for emergency treatment, internal medicine and a psychiatrist (section 31(3)). Section 44 provides that in order to offer psychiatric health-care services, certain types of equipment (including stomach pumps in case of poisoning) and rooms that meet certain specifications as to size need to be available. Among other things, the regulation requires that it be possible to securely isolate and constantly monitor patients. It states that a security alarm should also be provided. 27. The relevant case-law regarding criminal and civil remedies is set out in the case of Rõigas (mentioned above, §§ 51–64).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

SWEDEN,3,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Expulsion) (Conditional) (Iraq),Aleš Pejchal;André Potocki;Ganna Yudkivska;Helena Jäderblom;Johan Hirschfeldt;Mark Villiger;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"7. The applicant was born in 1978. She is from Baghdad and is of Mandaean denomination. She was once married, but divorced her husband in 1999, after which she lived with their son, born in 1998, in Iraq while her former husband moved to the United States. 8. The applicant arrived in Sweden on 27 August 2007 and applied for a residence permit the following day and for asylum on 21 January 2008. She stated that she and her son had left Iraq on 25 July 2007 and had then stayed with relatives in Amman, Jordan, for a month. In Amman she had left behind her son, because she had not been able to afford his trip. Later, her former husband had come to Jordan and brought the son back with him to the United States. To the Swedish authorities the applicant submitted an Iraqi citizenship certificate, an identity card, divorce documents and a membership card for Mandaeans regarding her and her son. 9. Assisted by legal counsel, the applicant stated in essence the following in support of her application. Her main reason for leaving Iraq was the generally insecure situation for Mandaeans in Iraq, which had affected her and her family personally. Her fears had led to her son going to school only sporadically during the past year. Moreover, at the beginning of June 2007 her mother had received a threatening phone call from someone who had wanted to contact the applicant, presumably to forcibly remarry her with another man. If they did not comply, the applicant understood that her family would have to leave the neighbourhood. They had taken the threats very seriously and she had moved immediately with her son to her grandmother’s house in the al-Dora neighbourhood of Baghdad, where they had stayed for a month. The applicant further stated that her only remaining relative in Iraq was her mother. 10. On 31 October 2008 the Migration Board (Migrationsverket) rejected the application and ordered the applicant’s deportation to Iraq. The Board held that she had not proved her identity, but that she had made it plausible that she was from Iraq. It further considered that the situation in Iraq as such did not constitute grounds for asylum. While noting that Mandaeans were an exposed minority, their general situation did not suffice either for an individual be granted protection, but his or her personal circumstances would have to be assessed. The Board went on to state that the applicant had not submitted any written evidence in support of her allegations of persecution. Furthermore, she had received a threat on only one occasion and it had not been shown that the person threatening her had referred to her religious beliefs. Nor was there any other indication that she had been ill-treated on account of those beliefs or that she had received other threats before leaving Iraq. The Board then noted that the applicant’s brother, who had also applied for asylum in Sweden, had had his application rejected and his deportation to Iraq ordered and that, consequently, the applicant would likely not lack a male network upon return to Iraq. In conclusion, the Board found that she had not made it probable that she was at personal risk of being subjected to serious ill-treatment if she returned to Iraq. 11. The applicant’s brother, who had arrived in Sweden on 18 December 2007, had his application for a residence permit rejected by the Migration Board on 2 October 2008. 12. The applicant appealed, adding the following to her story. Mandaeans, being the smallest and most vulnerable minority in Iraq, were subjected to extortion, kidnappings and murder. Mandaean women and children had been forced to convert to Islam, often after having been assaulted and raped. The Mandaeans were not a large enough community to be able to protect and support each other and there was no particular region where they could settle safely. This was enough to show that she was in need of protection. The applicant asserted that the threat against her had to be seen against this background. Her whole existence had been marked by the threatening atmosphere and demands directed at non-Muslim women and in particular the Mandaeans. Her situation had been further aggravated by the fact that she is a single woman without a social network in Iraq. Her mother had had the intention of leaving the country as well, but the applicant had no information on her whereabouts. Furthermore, in Sweden the applicant had met a Muslim man from Iraq together with whom she now lived. This situation would never be accepted in Iraq. Also, when she had talked about her new relationship in Sweden, her family had reacted very negatively and had virtually frozen her out. 13. On 14 December 2009 the Migration Court (Migrationsdomstolen) upheld the decision of the Board. The court acknowledged the difficult situation for Mandaeans in Iraq and stated that, consequently, a lower threshold was applied in assessing the individual risks than in Iraqi cases in general. The general situation for Mandaeans did not suffice of itself to be granted protection, however; an assessment of the applicant’s individual circumstances was necessary. In the absence of written evidence, the court went on to examine the statements made by the applicant. It considered that the threat received concerning forced marriage was primarily related to the general security situation in Iraq at the time. In the two years since the applicant had left the country, the security situation had improved. While the Mandaeans remained disadvantaged, there was no sign that she was still being searched for in Iraq. Nor was there anything to indicate that her mother’s possible exile had been caused by continued threats. The court further found that the negative reaction of the applicant’s family to her new relationship did not imply a need of protection. In that connection, it further noted that the asylum appeal lodged by her brother, who had not turned his back on her, had been rejected on the same day. Thus, she could return to Iraq with him and thereby have a social network in the country. 14. On 16 February 2010 the Migration Court of Appeal (Migrations-överdomstolen) refused the applicant leave to appeal. On 25 February 2010 it refused leave to appeal also in the applicant’s brother’s case. 15. Subsequently, the applicant, as well as her brother, claimed that there were impediments to the enforcement of their deportation orders. Their petition mainly concerned the brother’s period of active duty in the Iraqi army, during which he had gained knowledge of important people in the army and their illegal actions. This knowledge would put both the applicant and her brother at risk if they were returned. The applicant further claimed that her mother had been kidnapped. 16. On 8 May 2010 the Migration Board rejected the petition, finding that no new circumstances justifying a reconsideration had been presented. It considered that the claims made in relation to the brother did not in any way show that there were threats against him or the applicant. The allegation that the mother had been kidnapped was actually new, but it was unclear when this incident was supposed to have happened and there was nothing to conclude that the possible kidnapping had any personal connection to the situation of the applicant and her brother. The applicant did not appeal against the Board’s decision. 17. On 23 August 2010 the applicant submitted a letter to the Migration Board, which was perceived by the Board as a new petition for reconsideration. The applicant stated that, if she were forced to return to Iraq, she would have to do so without her current partner or her brother, who were both in Sweden. Her partner had been issued a visa to Syria, as he was born in Damascus, and could not return to Iraq. Consequently, they would be separated, because she could not travel to Syria since she lacked a passport and would not be granted a visa. The applicant further asserted that she had no relatives in Iraq. 18. On 25 August 2010 the Migration Board decided not to reconsider the case. Although the fact that the applicant’s partner had been granted a visa to Syria was considered to be new, the Board stated that this fact did not constitute a lasting impediment to the enforcement of the deportation order. The applicant did not appeal against the Board’s decision. 19. The respondent Government have submitted the following notes to the Court, taken from the files of the Migration Board. The applicant’s mother was living with relatives and friends in Baghdad. When the applicant left Iraq, her grandmother and cousins were living in the al-Dora neighbourhood of Baghdad. In Sweden, the applicant has been living in the same flat as her brother and her partner from October 2009 onwards. Her partner left Sweden in October 2010 to be reunited with his family in Syria, whereas her brother is still in Sweden. Furthermore, in reply to the Government’s request for information in the case, the Migration Board had stated that it was likely that the applicant had a large number of relatives left in Baghdad. 20. The applicant has given the following additional account to the Court. Following her divorce in 1999, she went to live with her parents and her brother. Her father, under whose protection she was living, died in 2005. Her grandmother, with whom she had briefly lived after the threatening telephone call, died in 2008. To her knowledge, she has no relatives left in Iraq, cousins or others. Several relatives are living abroad, in Sweden, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Canada. Her sister is living in Denmark. After the applicant and her brother had left Iraq, their mother went to live with a Christian family in Baghdad, from whom she rented a room. In the beginning of 2010, the applicant and her brother received information about their mother’s disappearance. The family with whom the mother had lived called the applicant’s uncle in Sweden and said that they did not think that she had left voluntarily. A police report, sent to the uncle only in 2012, states that the report was filed on 7 June 2011 by the mother’s landlord, who had told the police that the mother had been missing since 5 December 2010. The applicant does not know why the landlord did not file a report earlier or why he did not state that her mother had been missing for several months before December 2010. The applicant is still unaware of what has happened to her mother following her disappearance. However, given the time that has passed without any contact with her, she assumes that she is dead. The applicant is still in a relationship with the man she met in Sweden, although he is now living in Syria. The people who disowned her because of that relationship were her relatives in Sweden, with the exception of her brother. The brother married a relative, who is a Swedish citizen, on 27 May 2012. He left Sweden and applied at the Embassy in Tehran for a Swedish residence permit based on his marriage. By a decision of 5 November 2013 the Migration Board granted him a residence permit until 5 November 2015. 21. The basic provisions applicable in the present case, concerning the right of aliens to enter and to remain in Sweden, are laid down in the Aliens Act (Utlänningslagen, 2005:716). 22. An alien who is considered to be a refugee or otherwise in need of protection is, with certain exceptions, entitled to a residence permit in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 1 of the Act). The term “refugee” refers to an alien who is outside the country of his or her nationality owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted on grounds of race, nationality, religious or political beliefs, or on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or other membership of a particular social group and who is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country (Chapter 4, section 1). This applies irrespective of whether the persecution is at the hands of the authorities of the country or if those authorities cannot be expected to offer protection against persecution by private individuals. By “an alien otherwise in need of protection” is meant, inter alia, a person who has left the country of his or her nationality because of a well-founded fear of being sentenced to death or receiving corporal punishment, or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 4, section 2). 23. Moreover, if a residence permit cannot be granted on the above grounds, such a permit may be issued to an alien if, after an overall assessment of his or her situation, there are such particularly distressing circumstances (synnerligen ömmande omständigheter) to allow him or her to remain in Sweden (Chapter 5, section 6). Special consideration should be given, inter alia, to the alien’s health status. According to the preparatory works (Government Bill 2004/05:170, pp. 190-191), life-threatening physical or mental illness for which no treatment can be given in the alien’s home country could constitute a reason for the grant of a residence permit. 24. As regards the enforcement of a deportation or expulsion order, account has to be taken of the risk of capital punishment or torture and other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. According to a special provision on impediments to enforcement, an alien must not be sent to a country where there are reasonable grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of suffering capital or corporal punishment or of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Chapter 12, section 1). In addition, an alien must not, in principle, be sent to a country where he or she risks persecution (Chapter 12, section 2). 25. Under certain conditions, an alien may be granted a residence permit even if a deportation or expulsion order has acquired legal force. This is the case where new circumstances have emerged which indicate that there are reasonable grounds for believing, inter alia, that an enforcement would put the alien in danger of being subjected to capital or corporal punishment, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment or there are medical or other special reasons why the order should not be enforced (Chapter 12, section 18). If a residence permit cannot be granted under these criteria, the Migration Board may instead decide to re-examine the matter. Such a re-examination shall be carried out where it may be assumed, on the basis of new circumstances invoked by the alien, that there are lasting impediments to enforcement of the nature referred to in Chapter 12, sections 1 and 2, and these circumstances could not have been invoked previously or the alien shows that he or she has a valid excuse for not having done so. Should the applicable conditions not have been met, the Migration Board shall decide not to grant a re-examination (Chapter 12, section 19). 26. Matters concerning the right of aliens to enter and remain in Sweden are dealt with by three instances: the Migration Board, the Migration Court and the Migration Court of Appeal. 27. A deportation or expulsion order may – save for a few exceptions of no relevance to the present case – be enforced only when it has acquired legal force. Thus, appeals to the courts against the Migration Board’s decision in ordinary proceedings determining the right to asylum and a residence permit have an automatic suspensive effect. If the alien subsequent to the ordinary proceedings having acquired legal force lodges a petition under Chapter 12, sections 18 or 19, it is up to the Board to decide whether to suspend the enforcement (inhibition) on the basis of the new circumstances presented. Accordingly, such a petition has no automatic suspensive effect, nor does an appeal to the courts against the Board’s decision taken under section 19 (no appeal lie against a decision pursuant to section 18). 28. In its Report on Human Rights in Iraq: July – December 2012, published in June 2013, the Human Rights Office of the United Nations Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) gave, inter alia, the following summary (at pp. vii-viii): “Violence and armed violence continued to take their toll on civilians in Iraq. According to the Government of Iraq, 1,704 civilians were killed and 6,651 were injured in the second half of 2012, resulting in a total of 3,102 killed and 12,146 injured for 2012. According to UNAMI, 1,892 civilians were killed and 6,719 were injured in the last six months of 2012, resulting in a total of at least 3,238 civilians who were killed and 10,379 who were injured for the year. These figures indicate that the trend of recent years of a reduction in the numbers of civilian casualties has reversed and that the impact of violence on civilians looks set to increase in the near to medium future. Terrorists and armed groups continued to favour asymmetric tactics that deliberately target civilians or were carried out heedless of the impact on civilians. Political instability and regional developments continued to impact negatively on the security situation in Iraq, with its concomitant toll on civilians. Although the Government takes the impact of violence on civilians extremely seriously and has taken measures to enhance security, more needs to be done to ensure the proper coordination of financial, medical and other forms of support for the victims of violence. ... Women continue to suffer from domestic and other forms of violence, and to face discrimination and other barriers in accessing economic, social and educational opportunities. The law continues to permit ‘honour’ as a mitigating factor in crimes of violence committed against women and family members. There is still no effective system of shelters and coordinated care for the victims of domestic violence, and services available to victims remain inadequate. The family protection bill remains stalled in the Council of Representatives. Women’s representation at a senior level in political, governmental and judicial institutions remains low at the federal, governorate and district levels. ... Iraq’s various ethnic and religious groups continued to be targeted by violence. In particular, members of the Turkmen community were subjected to various acts of violence, including kidnapping, murder, harassment, and other threats. Members of religious communities, including Yezidis, Christians and Shabaks, also suffered threats and acts of violence. Shi’a pilgrims attending various religious festivals and activities similarly came under attack in various parts of the country.” In regard to the Kurdistan region, the report stated (at p. ix): “The overall human rights situation in the Kurdistan Region continued to improve, although challenges remain, including concerns over respect for freedoms of assembly and expression, and the protection of journalists. The Kurdistan Region experienced almost no insurgent violence, although civilians living in areas close to the international borders continued to suffer from the effects of cross-border shelling and military operations conducted by foreign forces. ... Progress was made towards full implementation of the Law on Combatting Violence Against Women, with the establishment of a high level inter-ministerial committee to oversee implementation of the law, and the adoption of a five-year plan to combat violence against women, along with other reforms and initiatives.” 29. In his report of 16 February 2011, the Representative of the (United Nations) Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons, Mr Walter Kälin, noted the following (at paras. 9-10) after a visit to Iraq in September/October 2010: ”Despite improvements in the overall security situation since 2006, the situation in Iraq is still characterized by continued indiscriminate attacks against civilians, including religious and ethnic minorities, arbitrary arrests, alleged ill-treatment while in detention, and sexual and gender-based violence. Moreover, impunity is reported as being widespread, while access to justice is largely absent due to fear of reprisals, lack of capacity among rule of law institutions, corruption and lack of awareness of accountability mechanisms. In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, while the security situation is considerably better than in the rest of the country, specific concerns have been raised with regard to, inter alia: serious violations of the rights of suspects and detainees by KRG [Kurdistan Regional Government] authorities; sexual and gender-based violence; and the impact of anti-terrorism legislation on human rights, including specifically the practice of keeping persons in de facto unlimited administrative detention.” 30. The UK Border Agency Iraq Operational Guidance Note of December 2011 noted (at paras. 2.3.4 and 2.3.5): “Violence, albeit still far above what ought to be tolerable, has levelled off in the past two years. Iraqi security forces have taken the lead in several important operations. Recently, they have withstood three noteworthy tests: the departure of close to 100,000 US troops since January 2009; the March 2010 parliamentary elections; and, over the past several months, political uncertainty prompted by institutional deadlock. If insurgents remain as weak as they are and find no fresh opportunity to exploit political fractures, security forces operating at less-than-optimal levels still should face no serious difficulty in confronting them. It has been reported that although oversight by the MOI [Ministry of Interior] and MOD [Ministry of Defence] has increased, problems continue with all security forces, arising from sectarian divisions, corruption, and unwillingness to serve outside the areas in which personnel were recruited. ...” 31. In its July – December 2012 report, UNAMI noted, inter alia, the following: “While there have been some improvements in terms of security for Iraq’s ethnic and religious groups, their situation remains precarious. During the second half of 2012, UNAMI continued to receive reports of attacks directed at persons on account of their ethnic or religious affiliations. UNAMI has particular concerns regarding the situation of the Turkmen community in the disputed areas, Christian families that migrated from Baghdad to Erbil following attacks against the community in 2010, and the rising tension between the Shabak and the Christian minorities in Ninewa. Figures collected by UNAMI indicate that members of minority groups are still leaving their homes in many areas on account of insecurity and acts of violence perpetrated against their communities, compounded by lack of access to basic services and poor economic opportunities.” This report does not contain any information on the Mandaean community, but UNAMI’s 2011 report, published in May 2012, noted the following about their situation in the Kurdistan Region (at p. 32): “The numbers of Sabian Mandaean families have fallen to approximately 75 in the Kurdistan Region due to migration of members of the group. Some community representatives informed UNAMI that they do not face any threat or persecution in the Kurdistan Region and they are supported by the Government, but most are migrating for economic reasons.” 32. The Minority Rights Group International described the Mandaeans in Iraq thus (Iraq’s Minorities: Participation in Public Life, November 2011, p. 9): “Sabean Mandaeans, whose religion is one of the oldest surviving Gnostic religions in the world, have existed in Iraq for more than two millennia. Many of the 60,000–70,000 present in the Middle East once lived in Iraq, but today, their numbers there have dwindled to around 5,000 people, mainly through displacement, but also through killings. Traditionally, many Sabean Mandaeans have worked as goldsmiths; the resulting perception that they are wealthy has contributed to their being targeted for kidnapping. They are forbidden by their faith to marry outside the religion, which has contributed to their reduced numbers since 2003.” In regard to minority women, the Minority Rights Group International gave, inter alia, the following account (ibid., p. 25): “For minority women, the situation again follows the general trend, with the added security risk that comes from being from a minority. Fifty-seven per cent of respondents to the IMC [Iraqi Minorities Council] survey said that they believed that women needed to hide their religious affiliation, either by not wearing their religious symbols or traditional makeup, by covering their heads even if they are secular or non-Muslims, or by not speaking in their traditional languages ... . A number of Faili Kurd, Sabean-Mandaean and Christian women stated that they avoid speaking their language (e.g. Assyrian, Armenian) or wearing clothes that indicate their community belonging when in public. Non-Muslim minority women in particular complain of pressure to modify their dress. ... Overall, only 25 per cent of respondents surveyed said that they thought that women felt safe when leaving the home. Sabean-Mandaean women have reported being pressured to convert to Islam; they also report physical and verbal abuse on the street from university staff, or, if in employment, for not covering their heads and not adhering to an Islamic dress code.” 33. On 31 May 2012 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued the latest Eligibility Guidelines for Assessing the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Iraq (hereafter “the UNHCR Guidelines”). The situation for members of religious minorities is summarised as follows (at p. 27): Iraq are likely to be in need of international refugee protection on the grounds of religion, (imputed) political opinion or membership in a particular social group. Christian converts are likely to be in need of international refugee protection in the whole country, including the Kurdistan Region.” In regard to minority women, UNHCR states (at p. 27): “Minority women are likely the most vulnerable section of Iraqi society, facing violence and discrimination from a variety of actors on account both of their gender and their religious affiliation. Minority women’s freedom of movement and freedom to express their religious identity through the way they dress has been severely restricted by ongoing threats of violence and growing religious intolerance. This, in turn, restricts their access to health services, employment and education.” UNHCR give the following information relating to the Mandaean community (at p. 29): “The Sabaean-Mandaean religion is a gnostic religion with John the Baptist as a central figure and considered a prophet. Its adherents cannot marry outside the faith and they do not accept converts. Before 2003, there were an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Mandaeans living in Iraq many of whom were well educated and worked as doctors, engineers, dentists and jewelers. After the fall of the former regime, Sunni and Shi’ite armed groups, as well as criminals, have singled out Sabaean-Mandaeans on the basis of their religion, profession and (perceived) wealth. Some Sabaean-Mandaeans elders, who traditionally wear long beards, have reportedly been attacked by Shi’ite militants who have mistaken them for strictly observant Sunni Arabs or Wahhabists. Sabaean-Mandaeans are particularly vulnerable to attacks for several reasons. Unlike other groups in Iraq, the pacifist Mandaeans did not form militias to defend themselves. Further, the already small community lives mainly in scattered groups. Their disputed status as “people of the book”, which under the Qur’an would provide them with a level of protection, failed to dissuade extremist groups from targeting them. As a result of general violence and targeted attacks, large numbers of Mandaeans fled Iraq, mainly to Syria and Jordan. Currently, an estimated 3,500 to 7,000 Mandaeans remain in Iraq. Most of them live in Baghdad and southern Iraq, including in Amara, Basrah and Nassiriyah. According to a spokesman for the Mandaean community, there are currently about 500 Mandaean families in southern Iraq, mostly in the Governorate of Basrah. Since 2003, Sabaean-Mandaeans have been subjected to threats, abductions and killings. There are also reports of forced conversions to Islam and some Sabaean-Mandaeans have reportedly been killed for refusing to do so. Most religious leaders have either been killed or fled the country. Eight Sabaean-Mandaeans were reportedly killed and five injured in 2010 in what were reported to be targeted attacks. In 2011, additional kidnappings and killings were reported by the Mandaean Associations Union. Sabaean-Mandaean goldsmiths reportedly continued to receive threats and suffer from attacks. Even in cases of kidnapping for ransom, the perpetrators may deliberately single out Sabaean-Mandaeans due to their vulnerable status as a religious minority, considered “infidel”. There have been reports of kidnapped Sabaean-Mandaeans killed or remaining missing despite the payment of ransom. In addition to targeted violence perpetrated against Sabaean-Mandaeans, the community has also suffered from social marginalization and religious discrimination. There are no schools in southern and central Iraq that teach children in their language, Aramaic, and children are obliged to undertake Qur’anic studies at public schools. Sabaean-Mandaean women are pressured to observe the hijab in public in order to avoid physical and verbal abuse, although their religion does not require veiling. Reportedly, Sabaean-Mandaean women have been pressured to marry outside their faith in contradiction with their own religious customs and have been pressured to convert to Islam.” 34. In its International Religious Freedom Report for 2012, published on 20 May 2013, the United States Department of State summarises the religious situation in Iraq thus: “The constitution provides for religious freedom and the government generally respected religious freedom in practice. The trend in the government’s respect for religious freedom did not change significantly during the year. The constitution recognizes Islam as the official religion, mandates that Islam be considered a source of legislation, and states that no law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of Islam. However, it also states that no law may contradict principles of democracy or the rights and basic freedoms stipulated in the constitution. The constitution guarantees freedom from intellectual, political, and religious coercion. Some apparent contradictions between the constitution and other legal provisions were tested in court during the year; the courts upheld full legal protection for religious freedom in those cases. Other contradictions remain untested. Officials sometimes misused their authority to limit freedom for religious groups other than their own. However, the government continued to call for tolerance and acceptance of all religious minorities, provided security for places of worship such as churches, mosques, shrines, and religious pilgrimage sites and routes, and funded the construction and renovation of places of worship for some religious minorities. Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) and other terrorist and illegally armed groups commited violent attacks that restricted the ability of all believers to practice their religion. There were reports of societal abuses and discrimination based on religious affiliation, belief, or practice. Sectarian violence occurred throughout the country, although to a lesser extent in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR), and restricted religious freedom. No reliable statistics on religiously motivated violence were available. The overwhelming majority of mass casualty terrorist attacks targeted Muslims. A combination of sectarian hiring practices, corruption, targeted attacks, and the uneven application of the law had a detrimental economic effect on minority non-Muslim communities, and contributed to the departure of non-Muslims from the country.” 35. Designating Iraq as a “country of particular concern” for the sixth year running, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedoms, in its 2013 Annual Report, published on 30 April 2013, made the following findings: “Over the last several years the Iraqi government has made efforts to increase security for religious sites and worshippers, provide a stronger voice for Iraq’s smallest minorities in parliament, and revise secondary school textbooks to portray minorities in a more positive light. Nevertheless, the government of Iraq continues to tolerate systematic, ongoing, and egregious religious freedom violations, including violent religiously-motivated attacks. Violence against Iraqi civilians continued in 2012 at approximately the same level as in 2011. In addition, the government took actions that increased, rather than reduced, Sunni-Shi’i and Arab-Kurdish tensions, threatening the country’s already fragile stability and further exacerbating the poor religious freedom environment. ... Shi’i Muslims experienced the worst attacks of any religious community during the reporting period, including against pilgrims participating in celebrations on or around important religious holidays. The government has proven unable to stop religiously-motivated attacks from occurring and lacks the will or capacity to investigate attacks and bring perpetrators to justice. This has created a climate of impunity, which in turn exacerbates a perpetual sense of fear for all religious communities, particularly the smallest ones. Large percentages of the country’s smallest religious minorities – which include Chaldo-Assyrian and other Christians, Sabean Mandaeans, and Yezidis – have fled the country in recent years, threatening these communities’ continued existence in Iraq. The diminished numbers that remain face official discrimination, marginalization, and neglect, particularly in areas of northern Iraq over which the Iraqi government and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) dispute control. Religious freedom abuses continue towards women and individuals who do not conform to strict interpretations of religious norms or attacks on businesses viewed as “un-Islamic”. However, in a positive development, the Iraqi parliament shelved a problematic draft Information Crimes law that would have restricted the freedoms of religion and expression. Additionally the KRG parliament rejected a draft law to “protect sanctities,” which, if adopted, would violate these same freedoms. However, there are reports that KRG officials may still pursue legal action against the media for offending religion, Kurdish history, or national symbols. ... Many of the non-Muslim minorities internally displaced by violence have gone to the north of the country, mainly to Nineveh governorate and the territory of the KRG, which is comprised of three other governorates. Northern Iraq, particularly the Nineveh Plains area of Nineveh governorate, is the historic homeland of Iraq’s Christian community, and the Yezidi community is indigenous to Nineveh and the KRG governorate of Dahuk. The three KRG governorates are relatively secure, but Nineveh governorate, particularly in and around its capital Mosul, remains extremely dangerous, and control over this ethnically and religiously mixed area is disputed between the KRG and the central Iraqi government. Religious and ethnic minorities in these areas, including non-Muslims and ethnic Shabak and Turkomen, have accused Kurdish forces and officials of engaging in systematic abuses and discrimination against them to further Kurdish territorial claims. These accusations include reports of Kurdish officials interfering with minorities’ voting rights; encroaching on, seizing, and refusing to return minority land; conditioning the provision of services and assistance to minority communities on support for Kurdish expansion; forcing minorities to identify themselves as either Arabs or Kurds; and impeding the formation of local minority police forces. The minorities also accuse both Arab and Kurdish officials of ignoring these vulnerable communities as they focus on their fight for territorial control.” 36. The Representative of the UN Secretary-General stated in the above-mentioned report of 16 February 2011 (at para. 65): ”In the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, the Representative acknowledges that KRG has received and provided safety to IDPs [internally displaced persons] from all over Iraq regardless of their origin, particularly in the aftermath of the sectarian violence in the country 2006. Stronger coordination and cooperation mechanisms between the Central Government and KRG are necessary however, to address the situation of IDPs in this region, including vulnerable groups, as well as a number of administrative and financial assistance issues, such as difficulties in transferring PDS cards [Public Distribution System food ration cards] and receiving pensions, which are adversely affecting the rights and standard of living of IDPs. As well, while improved social, security, and economic conditions prevail in this region, continued cross border attacks continue to cause periodic displacement of its border populations. The Representative believes that stronger cooperation between the Government of Iraq and KRG, as well as concerted diplomatic efforts and border dialogues with relevant neighbouring countries, must be undertaken in order to prevent and raise awareness of the impact of cross-border attacks on civilian populations.” 37. The UNHCR Guidelines contain the following observations (at pp. 27 and 48-51): “In the Kurdistan Region, the rights of religious minorities are generally respected and groups can worship freely without interference. The KRG Ministry of Education funds public schools at the elementary and high school level in the Aramaic language. The curriculum in the Kurdistan Region does not contain religion or Qur’an studies. A significant number of religious minorities, in particular Christians, have sought refuge in the region. ... A large number of persons from the central governorates have found refuge in the three northern governorates since 2006. Commensurate with the sharp decrease in new displacements generally, the flow of new arrivals has decreased significantly; however, only a few of those previously displaced have to date returned to their places of origin. The influx of IDPs has had an important impact on the host communities, including increasing housing and rental prices, additional pressure on already strained public services and concerns about security and demographic shifts. At the same time, the three northern governorates have also benefited from the migration of professionals bringing skills and disposable incomes that boost the local economy. Unskilled IDPs have provided a source of affordable labour for the construction industry. The KRG authorities continue to implement stringent controls on the presence of persons not originating from the Kurdistan Region. Depending on the applicant, particularly his/her ethnic and political profile, he/she may not be allowed to relocate to or take up legal residence in the three northern governorates for security, political or demographic reasons. Others may be able to enter and legalize their stay, but may fear continued persecution as they may still be within reach of the actors of persecution or face undue hardship. Therefore, despite the hospitable attitude of the KRG authorities towards a considerable number of IDPs, the availability of an IFA/IRA [internal flight/relocation alternative] must be carefully assessed on a case-by-case basis ... ... Since the fall of the former regime, the KRG authorities are very vigilant about who enters the Kurdistan Region and have introduced strict security measures at their checkpoints. However, there are no official and publicly accessible regulations concerning procedures and practices at the entry checkpoints into the Kurdistan Region. An ad hoc and often inconsistent approach can be expected in terms of who is granted access, varying not only from governorate to governorate, but also from checkpoint to checkpoint. The approach at a particular checkpoint may be influenced by several factors including the overall security situation, the particular checkpoint and its staff, the instructions issued on that day and the particular governorate where the checkpoint is situated. UNHCR has repeatedly sought to obtain information and clarification from the KRG authorities on checkpoint practices and entry/residence in the Kurdistan Region, without success. Therefore, persons seeking to relocate to the Kurdistan Region depend on informal information with regard to entry procedures. Individuals/families wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region can seek to obtain a tourist, work or residence card. The tourist card, which is commonly given to persons from central and southern Iraq who seek to enter the Kurdistan Region, allows the holder to stay for up to 30 days. Depending on the person’s profile, but also the checkpoint and the officer in charge, persons seeking to enter as tourists may be required to produce a sponsor. Arabs, Turkmen and Kurds from the disputed areas are usually requested to have a sponsor, while Kurds (not from the disputed areas) and Christians are able to enter without a sponsor. Alternatively, persons who have a proof of employment (letter of appointment) can obtain a work card, which is valid for 10-15 days and is, in principle, renewable. Persons seeking to stay more than 30 days should in principle obtain a residence card. Long-term stays always require a sponsor. UNHCR is not aware of any IDPs who have received the residence card. The sponsorship process lacks clarity and there is no uniform procedure in place. In some cases, the sponsor is required to be physically present at the checkpoint to secure the person’s entry. In other cases, it seems to suffice that a person seeking to relocate to the Kurdistan Region produces a letter notarized by a court clerk attesting to the person’s connection to the sponsor. In some cases, the officer at the checkpoint will simply make a phone call to the sponsor to verify the acquaintance. Iraqis without sufficiently strong ties to the Kurdistan Region and who, therefore, are unable to find a sponsor, may be denied entry into the Kurdistan Region. There are reportedly also different requirements as to the nature of the sponsor. UNHCR is aware of individuals who have been refused entry into the Kurdistan Region. Arabs, Turkmen and certain profiles of Kurds will likely face extensive questioning and may be denied entry at the checkpoint, mostly due to security concerns. In particular, single Arab males, including minors, are likely either to be denied entry into the Kurdistan Region or to be allowed entry only after a lengthy administrative procedure and heavy interrogation. Checkpoints reportedly maintain “blacklists” of individuals banned from entering the Kurdistan Region, including those considered a security risk, but also those who have previously overstayed or did not renew their residence permits. Christians, especially those who fled due to targeted attacks, reportedly do not face difficulties in entering the Kurdistan Region. Persons not originating from one of the three northern governorates intending to remain in the Kurdistan Region for more than 30 days must approach the neighbourhood security station (Asayish) in the area of relocation to obtain a permit to stay (“information card” or karti zaniyari). As with the entry procedures, there are no official rules or regulations concerning the issuance of information cards. Generally, in all three governorates, a sponsor is required in order to obtain the information card. This means that those that were able to enter without a sponsor are, at this stage, obliged to find a sponsor. Families, provided they have a sponsor from the governorate concerned and the necessary personal documentation, are usually able to secure the information card. Single people apparently face more difficulties. Persons who do not have a sponsor will not be able to regularize their continued stay and may be forced to leave. Persons fleeing persecution at the hands of the KRG or the ruling parties will almost always not be able to find protection in another part of the Kurdistan Region. Persons fleeing persecution at the hands of non-state actors (e.g. family/tribe in the case of fear from “honour killing” or blood feud) may still be within reach of their persecutors. The same applies for persons fearing persecution by armed Islamist groups.” 38. As regards the acquisition of identity documents, the UK Border Agency maintained (Iraq Operational Guidance Note of December 2011, para. 2.4.5, and of December 2012, para. 2.4.4): “It is not necessary for an individual to return to their registered place of residence to transfer documents to a new area of Iraq. It is possible for example to apply at a registration office in Baghdad, to have documents transferred from elsewhere in Iraq. However the MoDM [Ministry of Displacement and Migration] have said that in practice this does not happen because it is now safe enough for someone to return to their registered place of residence to arrange to transfer documents. The processes and procedures were the same throughout governorates across south and central Iraq.” Disagreeing with the UNHCR as to the possibility of internal relocation for Iraqi asylum seekers, the Border Agency further stated (Iraq Operational Guidance Note of December 2011, para. 2.4.14): “We do not however accept UNHCR’s conclusions on internal relocation from the central governorates and consider that there is likely to be considerable scope for internal relocation that achieves both safety and reasonableness in all the circumstances. We consider UNHCR’s position is tied in with general policy considerations (e.g. about managing the rates of return) deriving from their general and Iraq-specific remit; we do not consider that in the light of the evidence taken as a whole that mere civilian returnees are at real risk of persecution under the Refugee Convention or of serious harm under either the [EU] Qualification Directive or Article 3 [of the European Convention on Human Rights] currently.” In its December 2012 note (at para. 2.4.17), the Border Agency added the conclusions drawn by the UK Upper Tribunal (see the following paragraph). 39. In a country guidance determination, MK (documents – relocation) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00126 (IAC), delivered on 25 April 2012, the UK Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) concluded, among other things, the following (at para. 88): “Entry into and residence in the KRG can be effected by any Iraqi national with a CSID [Civil Status ID], INC [Iraqi Nationality Certificate] and PDS, after registration with the Asayish (local security office). An Arab may need a sponsor; a Kurd will not. Living conditions in the KRG for a person who has relocated there are not without difficulties, but there are jobs, and there is access to free health care facilities, education, rented accommodation and financial and other support from UNHCR.” 40. The findings in MK were endorsed in a recent country guidance determination, HM and others (Article 15(c)) Iraq CG [2012] UKUT 00409 (IAC), of 13 November 2012. Having particular regard to the Danish/UK report extensively quoted below (at § 42), the Upper Tribunal stated (at para. 348): “Taking the evidence as a whole, we consider that if anything, it tends to show that no-one needs a sponsor, rather than, as was concluded in MK, that a Kurd will not and an Arab may. By needing a sponsor we refer not only to entry but also to residence in the KRG. ...” On the issue of identity documents, it further noted (at para. 358): “... [In MK] the Tribunal commented that there was nothing to show that it was, or perhaps ever had been, the case that a central register in Baghdad had been kept. [F]urther evidence [now presented] requires us to modify that position. Given the current state of the evidence in this regard, we consider that we can add to the guidance in MK by noting the existence of the Central Archive retaining civil identity records on microfiche, providing a further way in which a person can identify themselves and obtain a copy of their CSID, whether from abroad or within Iraq.” 41. The Finnish Immigration Service and the Swiss Federal Office for Migration published on 1 February 2012 the Report on Joint Finnish-Swiss Fact-Finding Mission to Amman and the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) Area, May 10-22, 2011 (“the Finnish/Swiss report”). In summarising the situation (at p. 3), it noted, among other things, the following: “At the time of the FFM [Fact-Finding Mission], there seemed to be little discrimination against ethnic or religious minorities. The flight of Christians from Central Iraq to the KRG area has continued since the bomb attack on a church in Baghdad in October 2010. Internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees are better off in the KRG area than in the rest of Iraq and generally felt safe in the region at the time of the FFM. At the same time, some suffer from poverty, remain unregistered, and lack access to proper housing, education, health care, and employment.” It further stated (at pp. 49-50): “Interviewed sources confirmed that the KRG is open and liberal toward religious minorities and normally also toward ethnic minorities. The areas controlled by the KRG can be considered safe for minorities. In the Iraqi Kurdish areas, a majority of Kurds live close to minorities such as Christians, Arabs, Turkmen, Yazidis, Fayli Kurds, Shabak, Kakai, and Mandaeans / Sabaeans. Fayli Kurds, Yazidis, Kakai, and Shabak are perceived as Kurds and therefore are generally not persecuted, but they can be under social pressure for assimilation.” On the subject of entry procedures at the KRG area border, the report gave the following account (at pp. 59-60): “The fact-finding mission learned that there have been no relevant, recent changes to KRG entry and screening procedures. UNHCR Iraq in Erbil indicated that there are no government statistics available on who has entered the KRG area and who has been denied access. There are four main entry checkpoints to the KRG area, which are controlled by the KRG Security Protection Agency. The checkpoints apply basically the same entry procedures. At the same time, some international organizations, NGOs, and the UNHCR claimed that the guidelines on entry practices are not consistent between the three northern governorates of the KRG or between checkpoints leading to a single governorate. There are also no published instructions or regulations on entry procedures, as these would be against the Iraqi Constitution. According to the UNHCR, entry often depends on the commander on duty and the commander’s daily instructions at the checkpoint. The procedures can be tightened or relaxed according to the current security situation in the area. Several NGOs and the UNHCR have surveyed IDPs at different times concerning entry procedures to the KRG region at different checkpoints. A comparison of the results shows differences in entry practices between governorates and time periods. For instance, the surveys show that the need for a sponsor / guarantor has essentially ceased at a Dohuk governorate entry checkpoint, but that even at one checkpoint congruency can lack at different times. ... People who are denied entry to the KRG area are often not of Kurdish ethnicity. Kurds and Christians are generally allowed entry, whereas single male Sunni Arabs without a sponsor in the KRG area are refused. The UNHCR noted that female Arabs have also had trouble entering the KRG area. Single females are also at higher risk of harassment by authorities. However, a source mentioned that Arabs from Central and Southern Iraq who invest in the KRG area are welcomed to the region. According to another source, IDPs with money are able to move to Erbil and start a business. Anyone wishing to enter the KRG area who does not originate from the region typically needs to know someone there (a so-called sponsor / guarantor) or have a letter of reference from an employer in the KRG area. A sponsor is needed if the person wants to stay in the KRG area for more than 10 days or wants to register and seek residency in the region. If someone enters the KRG area and subsequently commits a crime, his or her sponsor will be punished and may even face a prison sentence. A member of the immediate family or some other relative often acts as the sponsor. An institution such as an university can also act as a sponsor. The fact-finding mission received conflicting information during interviews on whether or not a church can act as a sponsor. The policy applied to Christians was said to have been relaxed after the bomb attack at a church in Baghdad in October 2010. Christians may currently be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors. The fact-finding mission heard that it is easier for Kurds originating outside the KRG area than for persons of other ethnicities to find a sponsor in the region.” 42. Published in March 2012, the Joint Report of the Danish Immigration Service / UK Border Agency Fact Finding Mission to Erbil and Dahuk, Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), conducted 11 to 22 November 2011 (“the Danish/UK report”) gave the following information: “1.02 According to the Director of an international NGO in Erbil, all Iraqis irrespective of ethnic origin or religious orientation are free to enter KRI through the KRG external checkpoints by presenting their Iraqi Civil ID Card [and] there were thousands of persons of Arab origin living in KRI, many living with their families, whilst others had come to KRI for work, including individuals. ... 1.08 [The Director of the Bureau of Migration and Displacement (BMD) of the Ministry of Interior in Erbil explained that at] present approximately 40,000 IDP families from [southern and central] Iraq and the disputed areas reside in all three governorates of KRI, i.e. Erbil, Suleimaniyah and Dohuk governorates. ... 1.10 ... [The Director of BMD stated that] there are large numbers of IDPs from religious minority communities in [southern and central] Iraq and the disputed areas. These are mostly Christians and Saebaens who were displaced following sectarian violence. ... 2.04 [The Head of the Private Bureau of General Security (Asayish)] explained that it was important the KRG authorities knew who was entering KRI and therefore the Asayish had good levels of cooperation with Iraqi intelligence, sharing details of persons who they were required to arrest and stop. In addition the Asayish maintained their own classified information on terrorist groups, such as Ansar-e-Islam or Al Qaeda in Iraq. [He] explained there were two security lists in operation, the “black list”, which included persons who had an arrest warrant outstanding for their detention and a second list, i.e. the “stop list”. ... 2.16 According to [the Head of Asayish,] at KRG external checkpoints, documents would be required to prove the identity of a person[. T]his could include their Civil ID Card, Nationality Card, passport or, if they worked for a government department, their departmental ID card. However[, he] further explained that a person would not necessarily be denied entry into KRI because he or she lacked some identification documents, as the system is computerised. [He] went on to explain that a person already on their database system would be logged with their photo and name recorded onto the system. Consequently such a person could even enter KRI with only a driving licence or a similar document which proved the individual’s identity and Iraqi citizenship. ... 2.28 [The General Manager of Kurdistan checkpoints in the Kurdistan Regional Security Protection Agency, KRG Ministry of Interior, Erbil] explained [that] after a person had finished providing information about their identity to Asayish at the KRG external checkpoint, they would then undergo a second procedure at the checkpoint to apply for the appropriate entry card. There existed three entry cards: a Tourism Card, a Work Card, and an Information Card/Residency Card for those seeking to reside in KRI. Once the relevant card had been issued, the person would then be free to travel throughout KRI, including travel between the three KRI governorates, without being required to show any further form of documentation. [He] stated that this procedure made it easy for anyone to move freely within KRI. ... 2.30 During a visit by the delegation to the Mosul-Erbil checkpoint, ... [w]hen asked what would happen if a person did not have an address or know anyone in KRI, [the major who had overall operational responsibility for the checkpoint] explained that such a person would still be allowed to enter and the majority of those coming into KRI were migrant workers in search of employment with no reference in KRI. 2.31 PAO [Public Aid Organisation, the UNHCR Protection and Assistance Centre partner in Erbil] outlined the entry procedures at the KRG external checkpoints and noted that persons seeking to enter the KRI would be questioned and asked to provide their identification, usually a Civil ID Card or Nationality Card, after which they would obtain one of three cards for entry – a Tourism Card, valid for 1 day or up to 1 month and which was renewable; a Work Card valid for 10 – 15 days which was also renewable; or an Information Card/Residency Card for those seeking to reside in KRI. PAO did not know how long this card, issued at the checkpoint, would be valid for. ... 3.05 The Director of an international NGO in Erbil explained that whenever there are specific security concerns and/or threats of terrorist attacks the security and entry procedures will be adapted to the situation. Such procedures only related to security concerns and not to any other factor and these procedures are normal even in Europe. 3.06 When asked if there would be variations in applied entry procedures at KRG checkpoints, an international organization (A) stated that such variations are only related to security concerns and precautions and nothing else. 3.07 According to Harikar NGO, all entry procedures are only related to security considerations and nothing else. Harikar NGO emphasized that its cooperation with the Asayish is good and that the Asayish comply with the law, including the procedures applied at KRG checkpoints. Harikar NGO has not noticed any irregularities or arbitrary practices at the checkpoints. 3.08 [The Head of Asayish] clarified that the policy requiring a person to provide a reference at the KRG external checkpoint, i.e. before entry, existed when the security situation was more precarious, but was abandoned around two or three years ago. However[, he] added there may still be some instances in which a person was asked by Asayish at the checkpoint to make a telephone call to somebody they knew, to verify their identity. 3.09 During a tour of the Mosul-Erbil checkpoint [the major who had overall operational responsibility for the checkpoint] explained that there was no longer a requirement for a reference to be present at the KRG external checkpoint and [that] this procedure was abolished around four years ago. ... 3.11 The Director of an international NGO in Erbil explained that the former requirement that a reference should be present at the KRG checkpoint in order for a person to enter KRI has been abolished. 3.12 Harikar NGO stated that there is no requirement for a reference to be present at a KRG checkpoint in order for an Iraqi from outside KRI to enter. ... ... 4.34 When asked how persons without genuine identity documents would be treated by the KRG authorities when seeking to enter KRI, an international organization (B) explained that a Kurd without personal ID documents may be treated more sympathetically and be permitted entry because they would normally know someone in KRI who could identify him or her or they would have a known family/clan name which was recognised. With regard to Christians, the entry arrangements were significantly easier and such persons may even be able to enter KRI without providing any documentation at all. This was because Christians were not considered a terrorist threat to the region – the KRG authorities were very lenient towards Christians. However, the international organization (B) concluded that a person of Arab origin without genuine documents to identify themselves would not be permitted entry. ... 4.41 According to the Director of an international NGO in Erbil, all Iraqis irrespective of ethnic origin or religious orientation are free to enter KRI through the KRG external checkpoints by presenting their Iraqi Civil ID Card. The Director added that Iraqi Turkmen, Christians and Faili Kurds normally enter through these checkpoints without any difficulties. On the other hand Iraqis of Arab origin would normally be required to undergo greater scrutiny, requested to present their Civil ID Card at the checkpoint and explain the nature and intention of their visit to KRI. However, this procedure was unproblematic and did not require that a reference should be present at the checkpoint. According to [the Director] all persons would be required to routinely show their Civil ID Card at the entry checkpoint and persons of Arab origin faced no problems in staying in the KRI. However the same source clarified that persons of Arab origin would normally have their Civil ID Card photocopied as an extra security precaution. The Director emphasized that persons of Arab origin do not need a reference to be present at the checkpoint.”",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0
145,001-164167,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,SIHLER-JAUCH AND JAUCH v. GERMANY,4,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Erik Møse;Ganna Yudkivska;Mārtiņš Mits;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"1. The applicant in the first case, Ms Dorothea Sihler-Jauch, is a German national who was born in 1958. The applicant in the second case, Mr Günther Jauch, is a German national who was born in 1956. Both applicants live in Potsdam and were represented before the Court by Ms K. Schmitt, a lawyer practising in Berlin. 2. The second applicant is a well-known journalist, producer and television presenter. The television shows he was presenting at the relevant time included a political talk show and a news magazine. 4. The applicants married in July 2006. The wedding reception was held in the Belvedere, an ancient palace surrounded by an English garden in Potsdam. The wedding ceremony took place in the Friedenskirche, also in Potsdam. Both locations are well-known tourist attractions and are generally open to the public. 5. Among the 180 wedding guests were well-known journalists, television presenters and sports personalities. The mayor of Berlin also attended the wedding. 6. Due to the anticipated media interest in the wedding, the applicants’ legal representative had informed the relevant newspapers beforehand that the applicants did not wish any reports to appear containing details of the wedding. In addition, both locations were closed to the public and only invited guests were allowed inside. 7. On 13 July 2006 the magazine Bunte, a so-called “people’s magazine” with a circulation of approximately 650,000, published an article about the wedding. The article was announced on the cover of the magazine and illustrated with several photographs. Besides photographs of wedding guests and old photographs of the applicants, one photograph showed the first applicant on her wedding day, taken before the wedding ceremony inside the restricted area. It was (erroneously) captioned “NEWLY WED Thea Sihler after the wedding vows” (FRISCH GETRAUT Thea Sihler nach dem Jawort). During the subsequent civil proceedings, the question of where the photograph of the first applicant had been taken from was a matter of contention. While the applicants asserted that it had been taken from outside the restricted area, through a hole in the wall ‒ using a strong telephoto lens ‒ the magazine maintained that they had no information regarding the photograph’s provenance since it had been purchased from a stock photographic agency. They speculated, however, that it could just as easily have come from one of the accredited photographers, or from an invited guest, or from a member of staff. 8. The article itself informed the reader about the precautions taken by the applicants to prevent press coverage but also gave details about the wedding, including the nature of the catering, the drinks, the applicants’ outfits, the music and the decoration of the church. The article also included quotes from the address given by the priest, and from the speeches of the second applicant and the first applicant’s father, as well as an excerpt from an intercessory prayer recited by one of the applicants’ children. 9. After publication of the article and at the request of the applicants, the magazine signed a cease and desist declaration regarding the further publication of a number of statements from the article outlining the details of the wedding. The magazine refused to sign such a declaration in respect of the above-mentioned photograph of the first applicant. 10. On 1 August 2006 the Berlin Regional Court issued a cease and desist order in respect of further publication of the photograph of the first applicant on her wedding day. 11. The first applicant brought proceedings against the magazine, claiming EUR 250,000 as a notional licence fee, EUR 75,000 in damages and EUR 997.37 of pre-trial expenses for the cease and desist declaration. 12. On 11 January 2008 the Hamburg Regional Court reaffirmed the cease and desist order, awarded the applicant EUR 25,000 in damages and ordered the magazine to reimburse the pre-trial expenses. 13. The court held that the article concerned an event of public interest because the second applicant was one of the most famous and popular television presenters in Germany, who had a strong influence on shaping public opinion. His wedding was therefore anyway of public interest and even more especially so since the public were interested in knowing who had a sufficiently close relationship with him to be invited to attend his wedding. The latter point was of particular importance in terms of enabling the public to judge the second applicant’s journalistic independence. The court also found that the chosen wedding locations increased the level of public interest in the wedding, since the two places were amongst Germany’s most popular tourist attractions. The court found that neither the article nor the photograph showed the applicants in a negative light, nor were they in any way derogatory. Nor did the photograph touch on the core of the applicants’ privacy, as it did not show the wedding ceremony itself. Nonetheless, the court found that publication thereof had not been justified by a legitimate interest as the first applicant had chosen to retreat to a secluded place, away from the public eye. Furthermore, the applicants had made clear their intention to prevent press coverage of their wedding by asking the press to refrain from reporting it and taking precautions to create a degree of seclusion by restricting access to the wedding location(s). 14. However, the court held that publication of the article alone ‒ regardless of the accompanying photograph ‒ constituted a serious enough violation of the first applicant’s personality rights to justify damages. In particular the publication of core details of the wedding party and ceremony ‒ such as quotes from the speeches, the range of drinks and food offered during the wedding and the choice of music ‒ could not be justified by any public interest but rather constituted a voyeuristic intrusion into the applicants’ privacy. Concerning the notional licence fee, the court held that it could not be considered normal commercial practice to pay royalties to the subjects of a news report. Consequently the magazine had not saved royalties which they would normally have had to pay to the first applicant for publishing the report and the photograph. 15. On 21 October 2008 the Hamburg Court of Appeal set the Regional Court’s judgment aside and dismissed the first applicant’s action in its entirety. It confirmed the Regional Court’s reasoning regarding public interest on the basis of the popularity of the wedding locations. It furthermore, and in particular, emphasised that, owing to the influence of the second applicant on public opinion and his role in presenting political television shows, the public had a legitimate interest in knowing who was invited to his wedding ‒ including the mayor of Berlin ‒ and to judge whether the public opinion presented by him was consistent with or contradictory to his real life. As the wedding was a shared event in the life of both the applicants, the first applicant was obliged to accept the public’s interest in the life of the second applicant. 16. However, the court disagreed with the findings of the Regional Court concerning the level of interference with the first applicant’s personality rights. It held that the details published about the wedding, such as information regarding drinks, food and music, were not core private issues but constituted information that was generally discussed and of interest in the context of a wedding. Furthermore, the court pointed out that it was normal practice and to be expected that, in the context of a wedding, photos would be taken by different people, whether invited guests or not. As the photo of the first applicant did not show her in a negative light and was not published on the front page of the magazine, its publication could be justified by public interest. Lastly, the Court of Appeal gave special consideration to the publication of quotes from the priest’s address, the speeches of the second applicant and the first applicant’s father, and an excerpt from an intercessory prayer recited by one of the applicants’ children. It reasoned that this information was more intrusive than the rest of the published details. Nonetheless, even though the wedding was not open to the general public, around 180 guests had been invited, and they were not bound to confidentiality. As these guests were not all part of the core family, the speakers and the applicant had to accept that certain information would be communicated to persons who were not invited and to the general public. In conclusion it reasoned that the mere desire on the part of the applicants to have no press coverage could not outweigh the legitimate public interest in the wedding, the published details and the photograph. 17. The first applicant’s complaint against the refusal of leave to appeal on points of law was rejected. 18. On 12 May 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint, without providing reasons (1 BvR 760/10). 19. The second applicant also brought proceedings against the magazine, claiming damages of at least EUR 25,000 and EUR 1057.69 in pre-trial expenses for the cease and desist declaration. 20. On 24 April 2009 the Hamburg Regional Court dismissed the second applicant’s action. It endorsed the reasoning of the Hamburg Court of Appeal and quoted its judgment of 21 October 2008 at length. 21. The applicant’s appeal and complaint against the denial of leave to appeal on points of law were rejected. 22. Article 5 §§ 1 and 2 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) guarantee freedom of expression and the freedom of the press and provide that these freedoms are subject to the limitations laid down in the provisions of the general laws and in the statutory provisions for the protection of young people and are also subject to the obligation to respect personal honour (Recht der persönlichen Ehre). 23. Section 22 § 1 of the Copyright (Arts Domain) Act (Gesetz betreffend das Urheberrecht an Werken der bildenden Künste und der Photographie) provides that images can only be disseminated with the express consent of the person concerned. Section 23 § 1 (1) of the Act provides for exceptions to that rule in cases where the images portray an aspect of contemporary society (Bildnisse aus dem Bereich der Zeitgeschichte) as long as publication does not interfere with a legitimate interest of the person concerned (section 23 § 2). 24. Article 823 § 1 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides that anyone who, intentionally or negligently, unlawfully infringes another’s right to life, physical integrity, health, freedom, property or other similar right, shall be liable to furnish compensation for the resulting damage. Article 253 of the Civil Code stipulates that monetary compensation may be demanded in respect of non-pecuniary damage only in the circumstances provided for by law. These include an injury to a person’s body, health, freedom or sexual selfdetermination.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
146,001-159782,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,2016,CASE OF BERGMANN v. GERMANY,2,No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Procedure prescribed by law;Article 5-1-e - Persons of unsound mind);No violation of Article 7 - No punishment without law (Article 7-1 - Heavier penalty;Conviction;Criminal offence),Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Khanlar Hajiyev;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"5. The applicant was born in 1943 and is currently detained in the centre for persons in preventive detention on the premises of Rosdorf Prison (hereinafter the “Rosdorf preventive detention centre”). 6. Between 1966 and 1984, the applicant was convicted by the criminal courts five times. He was found guilty of sexual assault of a seven-year-old girl and attempted rape of a fourteen-year-old girl, committed under the influence of alcohol, and of attempted sexual acts with a thirteen-year-old boy. He was found to have committed other unlawful acts, including arson and strangulating a ten-year-old boy during a burglary, but was not held criminally liable because he had been drunk. He was sentenced, in particular, to terms of imprisonment ranging from six months to ten years. 7. On 18 April 1986 the Hanover Regional Court convicted the applicant of two counts of attempted murder, combined with attempted rape in one case, and of two counts of dangerous assault. It sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment and ordered his preventive detention under Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 46 below). 8. The Regional Court found that between 7 July 1985 and 3 October 1985, the applicant had stabbed a nineteen-year-old female cyclist in the back in a life-threatening manner for sexual gratification; had stabbed a male cyclist he had mistaken for a woman twice in the back and at the temple, again for sexual gratification; and had stabbed a twentythree yearold woman three times in a life-threatening manner in an attempt to rape her. He had committed those offences under the influence of alcohol in a park in Hanover. Still drunk, he had then broken into a house, strangulated a four-year-old girl and had injured her with a knife below the waist for sexual gratification. He was arrested on 9 October 1985. 9. Having consulted two medical experts, the Regional Court found that at the time of committing the offences, the applicant had been in a state of diminished criminal responsibility (Article 21 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 62 below). He was diagnosed with sexual deviance, a personality disorder and psycho-organic syndrome, which was probably a consequence of his longstanding alcohol abuse. As long as the applicant did not drink alcohol, those abnormalities did not affect his criminal responsibility as he was able to control his aggression. However, combined with the consumption of alcohol, they led to his criminal responsibility being diminished. 10. The Regional Court decided to order the applicant’s preventive detention under Article 66 § 2 of the Criminal Code. It considered that as a result of his personality disorder, the applicant had a propensity to commit serious offences which seriously harmed the victims both physically and mentally. As confirmed by the two medical experts, there was a high risk that if released, the applicant would commit further violent offences for sexual gratification under the influence of alcohol, similar to those of which he had been found guilty. He therefore presented a danger to the general public. 11. Lastly, the Regional Court decided not to order the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital under Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 63 below). The court endorsed the experts’ finding that the applicant’s personality disorder could no longer be treated because his sexually deviant aggressive behaviour had lasted for decades and because he would be unable to pursue psychotherapy in view of his limited intellectual capacity. Public security could therefore be better safeguarded by placing the applicant in preventive detention. 12. The applicant served his full term of imprisonment, and on 12 June 2001 he was placed for the first time in preventive detention, for which he was held in a wing of Celle prison. By 11 June 2011 he had served ten years in preventive detention. 13. The courts responsible for the execution of sentences ordered the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention at regular intervals. In particular, the Lüneburg Regional Court ordered the continuation of his detention on 13 May 2011 and 5 October 2012. 14. On 26 July 2013 the Lüneburg Regional Court, sitting as a chamber responsible for the execution of sentences, ordered the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention. The Regional Court further ordered the Rosdorf Prison authorities to offer the applicant, within three months of the date on which its decision became final, a specific anti-hormonal therapy with medication aimed at reducing his sadistic fantasies and his libido, and thus his dangerousness. The court had consulted the Celle Prison authorities and the prosecution and had heard the applicant in person as well as his counsel, who represented him throughout the proceedings before the domestic courts. 15. The Regional Court considered that the requirements for ordering the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention laid down in the second sentence of section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraph 53 below) had been met. 16. The Regional Court confirmed that the said transitional provision was applicable to the applicant’s case. It noted that at the time of his last offence on 3 October 1985, the applicant’s first placement in preventive detention could not exceed ten years. It was only following the entry into force of the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other Dangerous Offences Act on 31 January 1998 (see paragraph 51 below) that the courts responsible for the execution of sentences could prolong preventive detention without any maximum duration. The applicant therefore fell within the category of detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged retrospectively, as defined by the Federal Constitutional Court in its judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 66-72 below). The Regional Court further noted that the second sentence of section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code had regard to, and had taken up, the standards set up by the Federal Constitutional Court in the above-mentioned judgment for the continuation of retrospectively ordered or retrospectively prolonged preventive detention. 17. The Regional Court considered that, in accordance with section 316f(2) of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section 1(1) of the Therapy Detention Act (see paragraph 64 below). It endorsed the findings made on that point by W., an external psychiatric expert it had consulted, in his report dated 8 June 2013. The expert had been obliged to draw up his report on the basis of the case files as the applicant had refused to be examined. Expert W. had confirmed that the applicant suffered from sexual sadism, a sexual deviance, and was addicted to alcohol, even though he had not drunk since being detained. The Regional Court stressed that expert W.’s assessment confirmed the findings made by a number of previous experts, notably those made in January and May 2011 by two experts who had diagnosed the applicant with a sexual preference disorder with sadomasochistic, fetishist and paedophiliac elements and with an alcohol addiction without current consumption of alcohol. 18. Furthermore, the Regional Court found that, as required by section 316f(2), second sentence, of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, there was still a very high risk that, owing to specific circumstances relating to his personality and his conduct, the applicant would if released commit the most serious sexually motivated violent offences, similar to those of which he had been convicted. Endorsing the findings of expert W., in accordance with the above-mentioned previous expert reports, the court noted that the applicant had admitted to his sadistic fantasies but had been unable to address them through therapy. In Celle Prison, he had stopped participating in any activities for persons in preventive detention. The Regional Court stressed that, in his assessment of the applicant’s dangerousness, the expert had taken into consideration his advanced age of sixty-nine years. However, he had convincingly explained that the applicant’s sexual deviance had not yet been considerably alleviated thereby. Furthermore, his alcohol addiction had not yet been treated adequately. However, the consumption of alcohol further increased the high risk that the applicant would commit sexual or violent offences again if released. 19. The Regional Court considered that the prolongation of the preventive detention of the applicant, who had been detained for almost thirty years, was still proportionate in view of the considerable threat he posed to the public. It noted in that context that the applicant’s detention in a supervised residence, which it had suggested in its previous decision, was not possible in practice. 20. As regards the order issued by the Regional Court, based on Article 67d § 2 of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with Article 66c § 1 sub-paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 49 and 54 below), that the Rosdorf Prison authorities offer the applicant specific anti-hormonal therapy, the court found that that order was necessary to guarantee the applicant sufficient care while in preventive detention. Expert W. had stressed – as he had already done in 2012 – that the prison authorities must at least attempt to treat the applicant, who was willing to undergo treatment with medication. The anti-hormonal therapy to be offered had proved to diminish sadistic fantasies and the libido, and could therefore reduce the applicant’s dangerousness. 21. On 1 August 2013 the applicant lodged an appeal against the Regional Court’s decision, for which he submitted reasons on 14 August 2013. He argued, in particular, that his preventive detention, a penalty which had been prolonged retrospectively, failed to comply with the Convention. 22. On 2 September 2013 the Celle Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal. Endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, it confirmed that the requirements laid down in section 316f(2), second sentence, of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code for ordering the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention had been met. 23. Taking into account the report submitted by expert W., the Court of Appeal held that the applicant was suffering from a mental disorder as defined in section 1(1) of the Therapy Detention Act. Referring to the Federal Constitutional Court’s case-law (see paragraphs 73-76 below), it found that a mental disorder under that Act did not require that the disorder was such as to diminish or exclude the criminal responsibility of the person concerned for the purposes of Articles 20 and 21 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 61-62 below). Specific disorders affecting a person’s personality, conduct, sexual preference and control of impulses were covered by the notion of “mental disorder” in section 1(1) of the Therapy Detention Act. The applicant’s sexual sadism and his alcohol addiction without current consumption of alcohol amounted to a mental disorder within the meaning of that provision. 24. Moreover, there was still a very high risk that, if released, the applicant would commit the most serious violent and sexual offences, similar to those of which he had been convicted, owing to specific circumstances relating to his personality and his conduct. The applicant’s dangerousness had not been reduced through therapy; nor had he become less dangerous by his advancing age. He currently did not participate in any serious therapeutic activities and kept trivialising his offences. Moreover, expert W. had confirmed that his mental illness was difficult to treat. The Court of Appeal further endorsed the Regional Court’s finding that the applicant’s continued detention was still proportionate, despite the considerable overall length of his detention. 25. On 24 September 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court against the decisions of the Lüneburg Regional Court and the Celle Court of Appeal. He claimed that the order for the continuation of his preventive detention violated his constitutional right to liberty, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law. 26. The applicant argued that under the European Court of Human Rights’ well-established case-law (he referred to M. v. Germany, no. 19359/04, ECHR 2009), the retrospective prolongation of a person’s preventive detention – a penalty – beyond the former ten-year time-limit breached the prohibition on retrospective punishment under Article 7 of the Convention and did not comply with sub-paragraph (a) of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Moreover, his continuing preventive detention could not be justified under sub-paragraph (e) of Article 5 § 1 either. He did not suffer from a mental disease as required by that provision. In addition, the notion and scope of “mental disorder” under the applicable provisions of domestic law and in the domestic courts’ case-law was unclear. 27. The applicant further stressed that the Regional Court had recommended his placement in a supervised residence. In those circumstances, his continued preventive detention on the premises of Rosdorf Prison was no longer proportionate. He conceded, however, that his detention in the new preventive detention centre on the premises of Rosdorf Prison complied with the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment. 28. On 29 October 2013 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint without giving reasons (file no. 2 BvR 2182/13). The decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 7 November 2013. 29. On 5 December 2011 the Lüneburg Regional Court, civil section, ordered the applicant’s placement in Moringen Psychiatric Hospital under the Therapy Detention Act. It found that the applicant suffered from a mental disorder for the purposes of section 1 of that Act and that there was a high risk that, if released, he would commit further serious offences. On 31 January 2012 the Celle Court of Appeal quashed that decision on the grounds that detention under the Therapy Detention Act could only be ordered once the preventive detention of the person concerned had been terminated by a final decision. 30. On 25 April 2014 the Göttingen Regional Court, in a decision reviewing the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention, ordered the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention. It noted that the applicant had repeatedly refused treatment with medication to diminish his libido. 31. On 15 January 2015 the Göttingen Regional Court, having consulted medical expert J., again ordered the continuation of the applicant’s preventive detention under Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code, read in conjunction with section 316f(2), second sentence, of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 51 and 53 below). On 24 April 2015 the Braunschweig Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant against the decision of the Regional Court. 32. Until 20 February 2012 the applicant had been held in preventive detention in a wing of Celle Prison. He had participated in therapy with a psychologist between 2005 and 2010, but had then stopped that therapy. He had refused to participate in the alcohol addiction treatment programme offered to him or any other treatment measures. 33. On 20 February 2012 the applicant was transferred with his consent to a wing of Celle Prison for persons in preventive detention where a transitional concept had been adopted. The aim was to improve the available treatment options in the light of the duty to differentiate preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment, by reference to the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment in M. v. Germany (cited above) and the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 66-72 below). The applicant participated in group therapy sessions run by a doctor and in a social skills training course. He stopped attending the group for addicts and refused to take medication to reduce his libido for fear of side effects. 34. Since 2 June 2013 the applicant has been detained in the new Rosdorf centre for persons in preventive detention, a separate building constructed on the premises of Rosdorf Prison. 35. The conception of preventive detention in the centre was developed in order to comply with the constitutional requirement to differentiate between preventive detention and imprisonment, as defined in the Federal Constitutional Court’s judgment of 4 May 2011 (see paragraphs 67 and 70 below) and as further specified in the newly enacted Article 66c of the Criminal Code and in the Lower Saxony Preventive Detention Act (see paragraphs 54, 56-57 and 59-60 below). 36. Up to forty-five persons can be detained in the Rosdorf centre. Detainees are placed in apartment units measuring some 23 square metres containing two furnished rooms and a bathroom. With the exception of detainees posing a particular security risk, the detainees can move freely within the preventive detention building and on its outdoor premises from 6 a.m. to 9.45 p.m. They may furnish and paint their rooms, to which they have their own keys. The rooms are equipped with a controlled access to the internet including e-mail, telephone, television, CD and DVD player and radio. There are common rooms for residential groups consisting of some seven detainees, which include a kitchen, a dining room, a television room and rooms for games, handicraft work and exercise. The outdoor premises, measuring some 1,600 square metres, can be used for sports, recreation or gardening. 37. Persons in preventive detention in the Rosdorf centre may wear their own clothes. They can either take meals prepared by the centre’s staff or prepare their own meals (in which case they receive an allowance for purchasing food in the centre’s supermarket). Persons in preventive detention may work, but are not obliged to do so. They may receive visits regularly. 38. According to information furnished by the Government, at the relevant time the applicant was one of some thirty persons detained in the Rosdorf preventive detention centre. In order to comply with the duty to provide the necessary therapy and care and to motivate detainees to participate in the relevant therapies and treatment, the centre’s staff comprised one psychiatrist, four psychologists, five social workers and twenty-five members of the general prison service. The staffing situation was similar to that of Moringen Psychiatric Hospital, situated in the same Land and where persons were detained under Article 63 of the Criminal Code. 39. Detainees are examined at the beginning of preventive detention in order to determine the necessary therapy and care. A personal treatment plan (Vollzugsplan) is then drawn up. 40. According to the personal treatment plan drawn up for the applicant by the Rosdorf centre on 28 November 2014, it was noted that in the past, from July 2013 until August 2014, the applicant participated in group sessions aimed at preventing detainees from relapsing into excessive alcohol consumption. He then stopped attending the meetings. He also regularly participated in group sessions at which detainees discussed their experiences during leave from detention. He stopped participating in those meetings in August 2014 too, arguing that the participants were not granted sufficient additional leave. In addition, he had motivation meetings with a psychologist fortnightly until March 2014, when he stopped attending the meetings, alleging that the psychologist lacked experience. He took part in weekly residential group meetings from June 2013 until February 2014, when he stopped attending the meetings, arguing that his treatment plan did not meet his expectations. He did not take part in any structured leisure activities and spent most of his day alone watching television. He declined repeated invitations to take part in group sessions of the treatment programme for offenders. Thus, as from August 2014 the applicant no longer participated in any therapy measures. He proved reliable during leave from the detention centre under escort on a number of occasions. 41. According to the Rosdorf centre’s treatment plan for the applicant of 28 November 2014 and an internal note from a staff member of the centre, the applicant has refused regular and repeated offers to start a treatment with medication to reduce his libido, which had been recommended by expert W. in 2013, for fear of side effects. In December 2014 he showed willing for the first time to take up such treatment.",[],[],[],"['5', '7']","['5-1', '7-1']",['5-1-e'],0
147,001-170286,ENG,BGR,CHAMBER,2017,CASE OF SARBYANOVA-PASHALIYSKA AND PASHALIYSKA V. BULGARIA,4,No violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2-1 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect);No violation of Article 13+2 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 2 - Right to life;Article 2-1 - Effective investigation),André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik Møse;Khanlar Hajiyev;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"5. The applicants are the wife and daughter of Mr Ivan Mirchev Pashaliysky, who was killed on 2 June 2000 in an office situated in a hotel in Sofia. He died as a result of suffering severe trauma to his brain, chest, torso and limbs, which led to irreversible damage to several of his vital organs. The trauma was caused by a number of kicks and punches and blows inflicted with different objects. 6. On the day of the incident a private security guard was called to the office premises where Mr Pashaliysky was later found dead in order to investigate a brawl reportedly happening there. The security guard knocked on the office entrance door and an individual, S.V., opened it. The security guard caught a brief glimpse of Mr Pashaliysky lying helpless on the floor with blood on his face. S.V. was holding a long oval-shaped object. Having been told by S.V. that there was no problem, the security guard left. 7. It would appear that earlier that day, using the telephone of the office in question, S.V. had called Ch.M., a friend and business partner of Mr Pashaliysky, threatening to kill them both if Ch.M. failed to deliver an undisclosed sum of money to S.V. without delay. 8. The incident was reported to the police by an investigator, who had been tipped off earlier the same day. The police arrested S.V. that night. Traces of the crime having been discovered on S.V.’s hands and clothes, an investigator charged him on 3 June 2000 with murder. On 5 June 2000 a prosecutor indicted S.V. for the murder of Ivan Mirchev Pashaliysky, which had been committed three days earlier. 9. A prosecutor from the Sofia city public prosecutor’s office found on 20 April 2001 that there were reasons for amending the indictment by applying a law providing for a heavier penalty. She also found that not all available evidence had been collected. In particular, no expert DNA analysis had been carried out on the material found under the victim’s nails; several key witnesses had not been questioned about the reasons for their presence in the office in which the victim had been killed on the day in question and about the reason for the return to the office of one of them during the evening of the same day; no confrontation had been held between two of those witnesses, despite several discrepancies between their respective statements; and no information had been collected about the state in which the police officers had found the accused at the time of his arrest. On 20 April 2001 the prosecutor returned the case to the investigating authorities for further investigative measures, giving specific instructions aimed at the remedying of the deficiencies in the investigation. 10. The case was returned on three other occasions (on 17 July 2001, 18 July 2003 and on 2 October 2003) for further investigative steps, which the prosecutor listed specifically. 11. The case file was sent to the Sofia City Court on an unspecified date in November 2003. Both applicants were named as private prosecutors and the second applicant, at her request, also as a civil party seeking nonpecuniary damages. 12. At the start of the trial the defendant’s lawyer claimed that the indictment was defective because it did not contain a clear description of the offence with which the defendant had been charged; the lawyer sought, without success, the return of the case for further investigation. A number of hearings took place during the trial. The proceedings before the Sofia City Court ended on 11 June 2007, when the court sentenced S.V. to fifteen years’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay damages to the second applicant. 13. Both S.V. and the applicants lodged appeals with the Sofia Court of Appeal. S.V. submitted in particular that the sentence had been based entirely on guesswork as to who the perpetrator had been. Most importantly, S.V. claimed that the indictment had been entirely silent about the manner in which he was considered to have killed the victim, there being no description of the circumstances in which the victim was killed. Referring to interpretative decision no. 2 of 2002 of the Supreme Court of Cassation (see paragraph 21 below), he claimed that these procedural flaws were fundamental and that the court should have returned the case to the investigation stage. 14. On 18 July 2008 the Sofia Court of Appeal accepted that the indictment had not contained a description of how the accused had killed the victim and that this had been a fundamental procedural defect which had prevented the defendant from effectively exercising his rights. The court then quashed the first-instance court sentence and returned the case to the pre-trial stage so that the procedural flaw in question could be redressed. 15. On 16 August 2008 the prosecution indicted S.V. anew for the murder of Mr. Pashaliysky and the first-instance court, the Sofia City Court, opened fresh proceedings against him. The first two scheduled hearings were postponed because the defendant’s lawyer failed to appear. On 11 February 2009 the court recognised the second applicant as a civil party seeking non-pecuniary damages but refused to name both applicants as private prosecutors. After an appeal by the applicants that refusal was quashed on 13 March 2009 by the Sofia Court of Appeal. The witnesses were then heard again in the course of the trial so that the applicants could exercise their rights as private prosecutors. 16. Sixteen hearings took place thereafter, at which the applicants made numerous requests for evidence to be gathered and witnesses to be heard. Subsequently, the presiding judge was elected President of the Supreme Administrative Court as a result of which the trial stage was started anew. A new presiding judge was appointed, yet no further hearing was scheduled for about a year. The applicants complained about the delay to the Inspectorate of the Supreme Judicial Council, asking that disciplinary sanctions be imposed on the new presiding judge. The Inspectorate replied on 21 February 2012. It acknowledged that the criminal proceedings in the case had lasted eleven years and recognised that this was incompatible with the requirement of a reasonable length of proceedings. It nonetheless held that the judge in question could not be sanctioned, given that the duration of the other cases that she had heard had not exceeded an acceptable length. 17. On an unspecified later date the new presiding judge was sent back to the court from which she had been transferred and the case had to begin anew once again. 18. On 9 December 2013 the proceedings before the first-instance court ended. The Sofia City Court found S.V. guilty of murder and sentenced him to twelve years’ imprisonment. The first-instance court also ruled that S.V. had to pay some 50,000 euros (EUR) in damages to the second applicant as a civil party. After an appeal by S.V. the Sofia Court of Appeal carried out a thorough analysis of the witness statements given at first instance, of the record of the examination of the murder scene conducted on the day after the killing, of the search and seizure measures, and of the conclusions of the numerous expert reports, the autopsy, etc. Following this, on 22 December 2014 the appellate court upheld the guilty verdict and sentence, but lowered the amount in damages to be paid to the second applicant to around EUR 8,000. Following a cassation appeal by S.V. the Supreme Court of Cassation upheld the appellate court’s judgment in its entirety in a final judgment of 2 November 2015.",[],[],[],"['13', '2']",['2-1'],[],0

LITHUANIA,4,No violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions),Egidijus Kūris;Ganna Yudkivska;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Marko Bošnjak;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1940 and lives in Plungė. 6. The father of the applicant’s husband owned 9.24 hectares of land in Telšiai region. This plot was nationalised in 1940. 7. In 1991 the brother of the applicant’s husband applied to the national authorities for the land to be returned to him and his brothers. In 1993 the three brothers signed an agreement and decided to divide their father’s plot of land into three equal parts of 3.08 hectares and V.V., the applicant’s husband, asked for the return of his plot of land in natura. 8. In November 1999 V.V. participated in a meeting at the Plungė District Land Service of the Telšiai County Administration (hereinafter “the Plungė District Land Service”), where he was informed that all of his father’s land was already being used by others and could not be returned to him in natura. He was offered either monetary compensation, the restoration of his property rights in another cadastral area or a plot of land of equivalent value. V.V. did not agree to any of those offers. 9. In January 2000 the the Plungė District Land Service asked V.V. to choose the form of restitution of his property rights. V.V. replied that he had already chosen the form of restitution in 1991, which was restitution in natura. 10. In April 2002 a meeting was held at the Plungė District Land Service, where V.V. again refused to choose a different form of restitution. V.V. was also offered two plots of land of 2.5 and 0.5 hectares. He stated that he would have to think about the offer and would inform the authorities before 1 May 2002. 11. During a meeting at the Plungė District Land Service in May 2002, V.V. said that he had not been offered any other forms of restitution in writing but acknowledged that the matter had been discussed orally. During a meeting in June 2002, V.V. reiterated his wish to receive the land in natura and when he was asked to choose another form of restitution, he said that he would think about it. 12. In July 2003 the Plungė District Land Service informed V.V. that because it was impossible to restore his property rights in natura, he had to choose either a plot of land or forest of equivalent value, monetary compensation or compensation in Government bonds. V.V. was also informed that if a form of restitution was not chosen, the property rights would be restored in the form determined by the authorities. 13. In November 2003 V.V. was invited to participate in a meeting at the the Plungė District Land Service, concerning the territorial plan of the area and the choice of the form of restitution. V.V. did not take part in the meeting. 14. In May 2005 V.V. asked the authorities whether and when he would be paid damages for the failure to restore his property rights in natura or to provide him with a plot of land of equivalent value. He also suggested that the Lithuanian authorities find out what “a plot of land of equivalent value” meant because the plots offered to him had not been of equivalent value („ir būtų gerai, kad žemėtvarkininkai išsiaiškintų žodžio „lygiavertis“ prasmę ir nesiūlytų įstatymo nuostatų neatitinkančių variantų“). In June 2005 the Plungė District Land Service asked V.V. to submit a written request to obtain a plot of land of equivalent value so that the authorities could prepare a document on the transfer of the land. V.V. replied that he had never been offered any plots of land of equivalent value and would only accept the restoration of his property rights in natura or a plot of land that was truly of equivalent value. V.V. also again refused the plots of land offered to him, stating that they were not of equivalent value. In July 2005 the authorities asked V.V. to choose a form of compensation for the land. He again replied that he had chosen that the land be returned to him in natura in 1991. In August 2005 V.V. reminded the authorities that he wanted the land to be returned in natura or to receive a plot of land of equivalent value. 15. In October 2005 V.V.’s representative participated in a meeting at the Plungė District Land Service, where she was asked to inform the authorities which land V.V. wanted in order to restore his property rights. Two plots of land were shown to the representative and the next day she replied that she refused to accept them. In November 2005 she was informed that because V.V. and she had refused to accept the plots of land, she had to inform the authorities before 1 December 2005 whether V.V. wanted monetary compensation or compensation in Government bonds as the form of restitution. She was also informed that if no response was received, the authorities would choose the form of restitution themselves. 16. On 14 November 2005 V.V. died and the applicant became his heir. In April 2006 the Plungė District Land Service informed the applicant that she had to submit a written request to the authorities for the preparation of a document on the transfer of land and to actively choose a plot of land. The applicant replied that she would not submit any request if the land was not returned to her in natura or a plot of equivalent value was not provided. 17. In October 2006 the applicant sent two letters to the Plungė District Land Service and stated that she would accept a plot of land of equivalent value if such a plot was given to her and a preliminary agreement was prepared on the transfer of such a plot. She also refused to agree to a document on the transfer of land and repeatedly asked to have her property rights restored in natura or to be provided with a plot of land of equal value. 18. In November 2006 the Plungė District Land Service informed the applicant about the procedure for the assessment of the value of land and the calculation methods used, and asked the applicant to agree with the assessment. In December 2006 the Plungė District Land Service informed the applicant that in order to provide her with a plot of land, the authorities had to prepare a document on the transfer of land. The Plungė District Land Service also observed that there was no possibility to conclude the preliminary agreement requested by the applicant because it was not provided for in the domestic law. The Plungė District Land Service repeated that the document on a transfer of the land had already been prepared and the applicant had to sign it and indicate the area where she would like to receive a plot of land of equivalent value. In February 2007 the Plungė District Land Service informed the applicant about the procedure for restitution and reiterated that the applicant had to sign the document on the transfer of land. In May 2007 the applicant asked the authorities when the issue of the restoration of V.V.’s property rights in natura or by providing her a plot of land of equivalent value would be dealt with. In June and July 2007 the Plungė District Land Service repeatedly informed the applicant that she had to sign the document. The Plungė District Land Service also informed the applicant that it was not possible to provide her with the plot of land first. In response, the applicant stated that she would sign the land transfer document after she had been shown a plot of equivalent value. 19. In August 2007 during a meeting at the Plungė District Land Service it had been decided to include V.V.’s request to restore his property rights into the preparation of an additional territorial plan of the area. In November 2007 the Plungė District Land Service established that because the applicant had refused to clearly indicate the form of restitution, she would be paid monetary compensation for the land. It gave the applicant ten working days to change the suggested form of restitution. 20. The applicant repeatedly did not choose the form of restitution for the land by the time indicated by the authorities, which is by 7 May 2008, and on 13 May 2008 a decision was taken to restore V.V.’s property rights by paying monetary compensation of 3,437 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 995 euros (EUR)). The compensation was then adjusted (indeksuota) and the final sum to be paid was LTL 5,499 (approximately EUR 1,593). The national authorities indicated V.V. as the person to whom the compensation had to be paid. The applicant was sent the decision on 28 May 2008. In their observations, the Government provided a document to the Court, indicating that the compensation had been paid on 2 December 2008 and 31 December 2008. 21. In June 2008 the applicant started court proceedings. She asked the court to annul the authorities’ decision of 13 May 2008 to restore V.V.’s property rights by paying him monetary compensation and to pay her LTL 3,000 (approximately EUR 869) in respect of pecuniary and nonpecuniary damage. She stated that she wanted the land to be returned in natura or to be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and she did not understand why the authorities kept asking her to make a new choice on the form of restitution each year. She further asked the authorities to explain why there had been no activity from 1993 to 1999 in the process of the restitution of her property rights. Finally, she complained that compensation calculated at LTL 3,437 (approximately EUR 995) was too low. 22. On 29 September 2008 the Šiauliai Regional Administrative Court established that in 1991 V.V. had asked for his property rights to be restored by being given 3.08 hectares of land in natura and that that had been a proper expression of his will. As the land in question was already being used by other people, V.V. and later the applicant had been asked to choose another form of restitution. However, they had never expressly done so. Moreover, the court held that the applicant had never changed the original wish to have the land returned in natura because she had refused to agree to the document on the transfer of land, which would have allowed her to have a plot of equivalent value returned to her. As a consequence, and in accordance with the domestic law, the national authorities had chosen monetary compensation as the form of restitution, which had not breached any requirements of the domestic law. As for damages, the court held that the authorities had acted correctly and the necessary conditions to pay damages had not been satisfied. 23. In October 2008 the applicant lodged an appeal. She complained that she had chosen the form of restitution because she wanted land of equal value to be returned to her in natura. She also stated that if her choice had been unclear to the authorities, they should have taken action to clarify it. She further complained that the monetary compensation was unjust and too low. 24. On 21 September 2009 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. The court stated that V.V. had expressed a wish for his property rights to be restored to him in natura. The court also established that V.V. had been aware of the fact that there was no possibility of returning the land to him in natura because it was already being used by other people. V.V. had been asked several times by the national authorities to choose another form of restitution but he had insisted on restitution in natura. The court held that the national authorities had failed to inform V.V. about the time-limit for choosing the form of restitution, as the domestic law provided for such information to be sent before 1 March 2003 and the letter had only been sent to V.V. on 27 March 2003. The court however observed that that circumstance was not of major significance because V.V. had written on 1 March 2003 that he would never change his mind about the form of restitution. After V.V. had died, the applicant had been asked to choose the form of restitution but had persisted in asking to have the land returned to her in natura or to be provided with a plot of equivalent value. The court also held that the applicant had misinterpreted the provisions of the domestic law because she had required that she be provided with a plot of land of equivalent value and a preliminary agreement, and had stated that only then would she sign a document on the transfer of land. That had been contrary to the procedure established in the domestic law. The court also considered that although at some point the applicant had indicated that providing her with a plot of land of equivalent value was an alternative way to restore her property rights, she had tied that form to her own rules and requirements, which were not possible under the domestic law. The court further observed that the national authorities had decided to pay the applicant monetary compensation as the form of restitution. Lastly, the court held that the applicant’s argument as to the amount of compensation was unsubstantiated because she had not provided specific arguments proving that the amount of compensation had been determined in breach of domestic requirements. 25. On 12 September 2016 the applicant started court proceedings for debt and interest over the failure of the national authorities to pay her monetary compensation. 26. In reply to the request by the authorities, on 29 September 2016 the notary dealing with the inheritance procedure for V.V.’s property stated that after V.V.’s death she had issued the applicant with certificates of the right to inheritance with regard to movable and immovable property. However, she had not issued the applicant with the document allowing the applicant to get the monetary compensation paid to V.V. because the applicant had not provided her with the decision of the national authorities of 13 May 2008 to restore V.V.’s property rights. 27. In their comments to the applicant’s reply to the Government’s observations, the Government acknowledged that the monetary compensation had never been transferred to the applicant “due to human error”. The national authorities could not transfer the monetary compensation to the applicant because of the absence of the document proving that she was an heir of V.V. and the absence of the applicant’s account number. The applicant submitted the relevant documents together with her account number and the compensation was transferred to her account on 14 November 2016.",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0
149,001-148075,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,ÖZTÜRK v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall,"1. The applicant, Mr Fuat Öztürk, is a Turkish national, who was born in 1968 and lives in Rotterdam. He is represented before the Court by Ms J. Serrarens, a lawyer practising in Maastricht. The Netherlands Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. Böcker, and their Deputy Agent, Ms L. Egmond, both of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. The Government of the Republic of Turkey were informed of their right to take part in the proceedings (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention) but did not express the desire to do so. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. In April 2007 the applicant, a convict prisoner who had been in detention since 1999, was transferred to the Penal Institution “Dordtse Poorten” in Dordrecht. 5. By letter of 2 April 2007 the Correctional Institutions Agency of the Ministry of Justice (Dienst Justitiële Inrichtingen van het Ministerie van Justitie) informed the Governor of “Dordtse Poorten” about a project for the taking of prisoners’ biometric data (photographic likenesses and fingerprints), referred to by the name of “Biometrics”, which was prompted by the finding that a number of prisoners in a different institution had assumed a false identity. The project, referred to as a “catch-up exercise” (inhaalslag), was intended to constitute the initial phase of a complete overhaul of the prisoner identification system. As part of this project, the Governor of “Dordtse Poorten” was asked to take biometric data of certain prisoners in his institution. 6. As one of the prisoners chosen, the applicant was informed by letter of the intention of the Governor to take his fingerprints and digital photograph. The letter did not provide information on the storage or use of the data taken. The applicant states that the penal institution’s staff members, when asked, told him that the data would be stored for “decades” in a national database that would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities. 7. On 23 April 2007 the applicant was asked to submit to the taking of his fingerprints and a digital photograph. He refused to do so, firstly, because he had already given these data when he was admitted to the penal institution and, secondly, because he opposed the fact that his data would be stored in a national database for an unknown length of time and that they would be accessible to the police and the judicial authorities. 8. Because of the applicant’s refusal to cooperate, the Unit Director of the penal institution imposed on the applicant three days’ solitary confinement in his own cell which included the removal of his television, starting on 24 April 2007. Later that day, the applicant submitted a complaint against this punishment to the Complaints Commission (beklagcommissie) of the penal institution’s Supervisory Board (Commissie van Toezicht), stating that he had complied with his obligations under Section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act (Penitentiaire Beginselenwet) when he had submitted to the taking of his fingerprints and digital photograph during his admittance to the penal institution. He further argued that he was not obliged to submit his data again because they would not be used internally, within the penal institution, but for a national database for which there was no legal basis in the Prisons Act or any other act. 9. On 25 July 2007 the Unit Director sanctioned the applicant a second time and the institution’s staff members threatened to report the applicant to the Public Prosecution Service for refusal to comply with an official order if he continued to refuse to provide his fingerprints and digital photograph. Following this threat, the applicant cooperated and submitted his data. He was, neither then, nor after his release, given any information on the way his data would be stored or used. 10. On 24 June 2008 the Complaints Commission of the penal institution’s Supervisory Board rejected the applicant’s complaint. It held that the sanction had not been unreasonable because the Governor had been obliged to comply with the instructions of the Correctional Institutions Agency; because the refusal of a prisoner to comply with an order of the Governor was a disciplinary offence; and because the applicant had refused to submit his data when ordered to do so by the Governor. 11. In his appeal to the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Application of Criminal Justice and Protection of Juveniles (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming) the applicant largely restated his arguments. He further submitted that the existence of a Determination of the Identity of Suspects, Convicted Persons and Witnesses Bill (Wetsvoorstel Wet identiteitsvaststelling verdachten, veroordeelden en getuigen), which provided a legal basis for the taking and processing of prisoners’ biometric data in a national database, proved that section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act did not yet confer any such power. 12. On 3 December 2008 the Appeals Board noted that in practice the identity of prisoners was checked at the time of admission to the institution. It further noted that on entering the institution the applicant had complied with this obligation to submit identifying data as provided for in section 28 (2) of the Prisons Act. It held that, even though the collection of the data itself had not been unlawful, it had been up to the Governor to explain to the applicant why his data needed to be taken a second time and to provide him afterwards with another opportunity to submit his data. As the Governor had failed to do so, the Appeals Board held that the sanction had been unreasonable. The Appeals Board awarded the applicant financial compensation in an amount of 22.50 euros (EUR). 13. The applicant was released on 7 September 2009. 14. In their further observations submitted in response to the applicant’s observations, the Government submitted a written statement on paper bearing the letterhead of the Judicial Information Service (Justitiële Informatiedienst) and dated 22 March 2013. It reads as follows: “Destruction The undersigned, J.J. Wiltvank, General Director of the Judicial Information Service, makes the following declaration: It is described in the official record (proces-verbaal) of destruction dated 12 December 2012 (annexed) that the personal information as used during the so-called ‘catch-up exercise’ has been destroyed; Supplementing this official record, the undersigned also declares that: during the period of processing the data were stored in a safe; the data were not used for any other purpose than for checking, once only; the data were compared, during this once-only check, against the HAVANK data [HAVANK, acronym for Het Automatisch Vinger Afdrukkensysteem Nederlandse Kollektie, The Automatic Fingerprint System Netherlands Collection]; as far as the Judicial Information Service are able to observe, these data have not been entered in the HAVANK database. ... I declare this to be a statement of the truth, made on 26 March 2012 [sic]. J.J. Wiltvank General Director of the Judicial Information Service” This document bears no manuscript signature. 15. Also annexed to the Government’s further observations were an official record attesting the destruction of “personal data of the catch-up exercise”, recording the destruction of information stored on CDs and external hard disc drives by Ministry of Justice officials and of the original fingerprints by a waste-processing company, Milieu Service Nederland. The official record includes the following: “Instruction On 21 November 2012 the Director of the Judicial Information Service instructed the undersigned to ensure the destruction of any personal data from the catch-up exercise that might still unjustifiably be stored (de mogelijk nog ten onrechte in bewaring zijnde persoonsgegevens). Stocktaking ... During stocktaking a search was carried out for other media that might exist outside the Judicial Information Service. From the information obtained from the then keeper of the mobile kits it appears that there are no data bearers left there all information was removed from the mobile kits upon transfer to the Judicial Information Service the mobile kits were dismantled a considerable time ago by the supplier HSB. ...” Attached to the official record is a “Destruction and Recycling Certificate” dated 10 December 2012, provided by Milieu Service Nederland. 16. The Prisons Act, as in force at the relevant time, in its relevant part provided as follows: “1. The Governor can oblige the prisoner to carry a valid identity document and to show this at the request of a civil servant or a staff member. 2. The prisoner is obliged to cooperate with the recording of his digital photograph, the taking of a fingerprint or the taking of a hand scan.” “Rules will be laid down by or pursuant to order in council concerning the creation of files. These rules will in any event give a definition of the detainees about whom a file must be created, the nature of the information contained therein, the right of the detainee concerned to inspect or obtain a copy of the file and the limits to this right, and the length of time and way in which the file is to be kept.” “1. A detainee may lodge a complaint with the Complaints Committee against a decision concerning him taken by or on behalf of the Governor. 2. A failure or refusal to give a decision is equated with a decision as referred to in subsection 1. If no decision has been given within the statutory time limit or, in the absence thereof, within a reasonable time limit, this is deemed to be a failure or refusal to give a decision. 3. The Governor must ensure that a detainee wishing to lodge a complaint is given an opportunity to do so as quickly as possible.” 17. The following is taken from the drafting history of the Prisons Act (Explanatory Memorandum (Memorie van Toelichting), Lower House of Parliament, no. 24,263, 1994-95 session, no. 3): “... Chapter VI of the Bill specifies permissible interferences with the constitutional rights of respect for one’s privacy and for the integrity of the body, the clothing and of the prisoner’s bodily secretion. ... The following powers are granted to the Governor to exercise control over the prisoners and the use of force against them: a. to impose a duty to provide proof of identity; ... a. Duty to provide identity The duty to provide proof of identity is copied from section 27 of the [former] Prison Rules (Gevangenismaatregel) with the addition of the [prisoner’s] explicit duty to cooperate with the recording of his likeness, or the taking of a fingerprint for the purpose of an identity check.” 18. The Prison Rules (Penitentiaire maatregel), as in force at the relevant time, in their relevant part provided as follows: “... 2. The other documents relating to the detainee are to be collated in an institutional file [i.e. a file peculiar to the institution]. They are to be arranged by subject in chronological order.” “... 4. The institutional file referred to in article 37, paragraph 2 must be destroyed six months after the detainee’s stay at the institution has ended. If the detainee is again confined in the institution before the end of this period, the limited retention period ceases to apply.” “1. In the event that inspection by the detainee of his file is denied on one of the grounds laid down in section 43 of the Personal Data Protection Act, the Governor may arrange for a member of the Supervisory Committee authorised by the detainee to inspect the data which the detainee has been denied leave to inspect. Sections 57 and 58 of the Act [i.e. the Prisons Act] apply mutatis mutandis. 2. Data from the file may be disclosed to Our Minister and the civil servant or staff designated by him in so far as necessary with a view to: a. dealing with requests concerning the detainee; b. dealing with procedures concerning the detainee; c. managing the files; d. dealing with other decisions concerning the detainee. The same applies to the assignment officer, the Governor and the civil servants or staff designated by them.” 19. The Act on the determination of the identity of suspects, convicted persons and witnesses (Wet identiteitsvaststelling verdachten, veroordeelden en getuigen) entered into force on 1 October 2010. It altered section 28 of the Prisons Act so as to empower the Governor to take a prisoner’s biometric data (fingerprints, DNA, photographic likeness). Delegated legislation is to govern the processing of these data. 20. Article 27b § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering) now provides for data needed to establish the identity of a suspect or convict to be stored in the “criminal procedure database” (strafrechtsketendatabank). 21. Detailed regulation of the criminal procedure database is provided by the Determination of the Identity of Suspects and Convicted Persons Decree (Besluit identiteitsvaststelling verdachten en veroordeelden), which also entered into force on 1 October 2010. This Decree sets rules for the organisation of the database in which biometric data of convicted persons are kept, storage and destruction of those data and access to them.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

LITHUANIA,4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Helen Keller;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Nebojša Vučinić;Robert Spano,"5. The applicant was born in 1979. 6. On 3 January 2003 the applicant started serving a sentence in the Pravieniškės Prison after his conviction for rape and theft. 7. In subsequent separate proceedings the applicant and his three accomplices were found guilty of murder and robbery committed as part of an organised group in 2000. A final decision in that case was adopted in 2013 by the Supreme Court. The applicant was sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment. That sentence was added to the applicant’s prior conviction, and a final sentence of thirteen years’ imprisonment was imposed. 8. On 25 May 2003 the applicant was found beaten up and unconscious in the Pravieniškės Prison after being attacked by other prisoners. A pre-trial investigation into the incident was opened the same day by the Pravieniškės Prison authorities, who informed the Kaišiadorys prosecutor about it. Immediately after the event an investigator of the prison inspected the area where it had taken place. 9. The same day the applicant was taken injured and unconscious to the Prison Department’s Hospital (Laisvės atėmimo vietų ligoninė) and then to the Emergency Hospital of Vilnius University (Vilniaus greitosios pagalbos universitetinė ligoninė), where he underwent an operation. Five days later he was transferred back to the Prison Department’s Hospital. 10. On 26 May 2003 the investigators ordered that the applicant be examined by a forensic medical expert. According to the medical record, the applicant had sustained beatings (muštinė žaizda) to the head and haematoma. 11. On 5 June 2003 the applicant’s mother wrote to the State authorities that she had learned about the incident only a week later, when she wanted to visit her son in the Pravieniškės Prison. She alleged that the prison was dangerous and demanded that those responsible for the assault on her son be found and punished. 12. By a letter of 13 June 2003 the Kaišiadorys prosecutor informed the applicant’s mother that a pre-trial investigation into the assault on her son had been opened on the day of the incident. She was also informed that a medical examination had been ordered to establish the severity of the injury. 13. On 1 July 2003 the Pravieniškės Prison investigator wrote to the Kaunas police that the applicant’s mother was avoiding coming to the prison and testifying and he therefore requested the police to question her as a witness; it was indispensable to ask her whether her son had ever told her about having disagreements with other prisoners or whether he had received threats. The police were also asked to employ operational measures to identify suspects and determine the circumstances surrounding the severe bodily injury (sunkus sveikatos sutrikdymas) of the applicant. 14. On 10 July 2003 the applicant was granted victim status by the investigators. It was explained to him that in that status he could submit requests or lodge complaints, under Article 28 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 43 below). On 10 July and 18 August 2003 the applicant was questioned about the incident. However, he stated that, given his state of health, he did not remember how he had been attacked and injured. 15. According to a medical certificate of 28 August 2003, a severe fracture of the skull had occurred as a result of what the doctors described as two blows to the applicant’s head. He had been unconscious for some time just after the assault, and then neurosurgery had been carried out. The doctors concluded that the applicant had sustained a serious head injury and would need a long period of rehabilitation. In August 2003 the applicant was declared Category II disabled, and in March 2004 he was declared Category III disabled (a less severe level of disability). As the applicant’s state of health improved, in February 2008 he was declared able to work at ninety percent. 16. On 28 August 2003 the applicant was discharged from the Prison Department’s Hospital and returned to the Pravieniškės Prison for outpatient health care. Afterwards, on different dates, the applicant spent time in Lukiškės Remand Prison, Pravieniškės Prison and the Prison Department’s Hospital. 17. On 10 September 2003 the applicant testified that on the day of the incident he was taking exercise when another prisoner approached him and asked him to go to the living quarters of the Pravieniškės Prison Wing no. 5. They went to a place where there were other prisoners, among whom the applicant noticed a person he had known earlier from the time outside the prison. That person was holding a knife, and hit (smogė) the applicant on the head. The applicant described him as a tall, well-built man of 40-45, who had previously been convicted of murder. The applicant was confident that he could recognise his attacker. On 25 September 2003 the applicant identified from photographs of forty three persons a suspect who appeared to be a certain E.J. 18. A report of 11 November 2003 from the Pravieniškės Prison showed that E.J. had a conviction for robbery under Article 272 of the Criminal Code, and had been sentenced to three years of imprisonment. According to that report, E.J. had left Pravieniškės Prison on 5 September 2002 for Lukiškės Remand Prison and had come back to the Pravieniškės Prison on 29 May 2003, which was four days after the incident. An extract from E.J.’s personal file indicates that E.J. arrived at Lukiškės Remand Prison on 5 September 2002 and left that prison on 29 May 2003. 19. On 19 December 2003 the Pravieniškės Prison authorities concluded, on the basis of the 11 November 2003 report, that on the day of the incident E.J. was not being held in the Pravieniškės Prison but was in Lukiškės Remand Prison in Vilnius. 20. According to the Pravieniškės Prison’s internal investigation report of 19 December 2003, the authorities questioned twenty eight witnesses, including prisoners, operational investigation measures were ordered, medical examinations were carried out and photographs of possible suspects were shown to the applicant and witnesses. 21. By a letter of 25 February 2004 to the Kaunas police, the Pravieniškės Prison authorities reiterated their request that suspects be identified. The letter also mentioned that, according to the medical report, the applicant had sustained two blows to the head with blunt objects (sužalojimai padaryti veikiant bukais daiktais – dviem smūgiais). The prison authorities also observed that the applicant’s testimony lacked consistency (apklausiamas keičia parodymus) and that he claimed not to remember the circumstances of the incident. 22. On 26 March 2004 the Kaunas police informed the Pravieniškės Prison investigators that no reliable information enabling identification of the perpetrators of the assault on the applicant had been established. 23. On 10 May and 13 July 2005 the Pravieniškės Prison authorities requested the Kaišiadorys prosecutor and the Kaunas and Plungė police authorities to order additional operational measures, inter alia, to question three witnesses – inmates of the Pravieniškės Prison at the time when the applicant was injured. The last letter ended with a request for the criminal police “to identify persons who had committed the impugned crime and to find the crime weapon” (nustatyti asmenis, padariusius minėtą nusikaltimą ir surasti nusikaltimo padarymo įrankius). 24. On 15 July 2005 the prosecutor ordered the Kaunas police to carry out the aforementioned actions. The prosecutor also informed the applicant’s mother that the criminal investigation file had been examined by a prosecutor. Twelve days later, the Plungė police authorities sent the report of questioning to the Pravieniškės Prison investigators. 25. Considering that the process of investigation was not producing any results, in February 2007 the applicant’s mother objected to the way the investigation in the case was being conducted and asked the prosecutors to find her son’s attackers. 26. By a letter of 27 April 2007 the prosecutor dismissed the complaint by the applicant’s mother that the criminal investigation was not effective. According to the prosecutor, even though a number of investigative actions had been carried out, it was not possible to identify the persons who had injured the applicant. It was explained to the applicant’s mother that, if she disagreed with the prosecutor’s conclusion, she could appeal to a court. 27. On 7 August 2008 the Kaišiadorys district prosecutor refused to comply with a request by the applicant’s mother to start an investigation into whether the Pravieniškės Prison authorities had failed to act and to protect her son’s safety and health in prison. In the decision, the prosecutor wrote: “The [applicant’s mother] cites matters which are relevant to the criminal case concerning the injury to M. Kardišauskas. A pre-trial investigation into this incident is already pending. In the event that a failure of the officers to perform their official duties is established, the question of their criminal responsibility will be decided subsequently. The question of pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage [caused to the applicant] will also be decided within the current pre-trial investigation, once a person or persons who have committed the crime, that is, injured M. Kardišauskas, are identified. If then, due to his state of health or for other reasons, M. Kardišauskas is unable to submit a civil claim on his own account, the prosecutors will have to submit such a claim, as prescribed by Article 117 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.” The decision stated that it could be appealed against within fourteen days to the pre-trial investigating judge of the Kaišiadorys district court. 28. According to a report by the Pravieniškės Prison authorities of 28 December 2007, even though prisoners who had served in that prison as of 2003 had been questioned about the attack on the applicant, no relevant information had been obtained. 29. On 19 April 2010 the prosecutor informed the applicant’s mother that no suspect had been identified during the investigation. 30. The pre-trial investigation was still pending on 7 June 2012, as was later observed by the Supreme Administrative Court in the administrative case for damages (see paragraphs 33-40 below). 31. In reply to a request for information by the applicant’s mother, on 9 January 2013 the prosecutor wrote to her that the pre-trial investigation was still pending, no suspect had been identified and no procedural decision had been taken in the criminal case. 32. In their observations of 4 November 2013 on the admissibility and merits of the case, the Government stated that the criminal investigation remained open until new circumstances came to light. On 20 January 2014 the Court received observations from the applicant, in which he noted that the criminal investigation was still continuing. 33. In April 2010 the applicant was granted State-guaranteed legal aid and on 18 October 2010 he instituted proceedings against the State. 34. Firstly, the applicant claimed damage to his health resulting from the failure of the prison authorities to protect him from ill-treatment. To this claim the Pravieniškės Prison administration responded that the applicant had never indicated that he was in danger in prison. 35. Secondly, in the rectified complaint of 29 November 2010 the applicant criticized the authorities for not having established who his assailant was. On 3 February 2011, when addressing the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court in writing, the applicant further argued that the authorities had failed to act diligently and to take all necessary measures so that the crime was solved quickly. 36. During those proceedings the applicant contended that the introduction of his civil claim for damages in respect of the injury had been delayed for objective reasons, namely the state of his health, his continuing stay in prison, the failure of the investigating authorities to indicate suspects and to inform the applicant in a timely fashion of the possibility of submitting such a claim and of his right to legal aid. 37. On 23 March 2011 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. The court established that the applicant had been injured on 25 May 2003, and the statutory time-limit to lodge a claim for damages caused by health impairment was three years. The applicant had lodged his claim only on 18 October 2010, that is, more than seven years after the injury had been sustained. 38. The applicant appealed. On 14 November 2011 the Supreme Administrative Court remitted the case to the first-instance court to verify whether part of the applicant’s claim that the pre-trial investigation had not been effective was also time-barred. 39. On 14 February 2012 Kaunas Regional Administrative Court refused to examine the applicant’s claim for damage caused to his health on the ground of prescription. The court established that as early as 2004 the applicant’s health had improved; he had been released from hospital and had returned to prison. The applicant had relatives to assist him in making use of his rights, and he could also have asked for free legal aid in a timely fashion. Lastly, it was only the applicant’s own unfounded belief that a court action for damages against the Pravieniškės Prison was not possible before the person who had attacked him was identified. 40. By a final decision of 7 June 2012 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the claim due to the expiry of the three-year prescription period applicable to claims relating to damage to health. The court rejected the applicant’s arguments that he had been misled by the prosecutors investigating the incident, who had convinced him that he would be able to lodge a civil claim for damages only after the person responsible for his injury was identified. The applicant’s contention that his health had prevented him from submitting the claim in time was likewise dismissed. The Supreme Administrative Court also observed that the applicant could have appealed against the investigating officers’ or prosecutor’s actions, if he considered them improper. However, the applicant had not made use of any of his rights under Article 28 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The pre-trial investigation was not yet over.",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing),George Nicolaou;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"5. The applicant, Mr Matthew O’Donnell, is an Irish national who was born in 1980. He is currently detained at HMP Maghaberry. 6. The applicant has an I.Q. of 62, which is within the bottom 1% of the general population. He has an understanding of spoken English equivalent to that of a six year-old child. 7. On the morning of 13 October 2004, the body of Mr Williamson was found on the banks of the Blackwater River in County Tyrone. 8. The applicant had spent most of the previous day drinking in public with the deceased and a third man, Mr Samuel Houston. There was evidence from witnesses that both Mr Houston and the applicant had been threatening and aggressive towards a number of individuals including the deceased. One witness also stated that, when Mr Houston produced a knife and said he was going to kill the deceased, the applicant encouraged him to “just kill him”. There was also evidence that the applicant and Mr Houston asked the deceased to come out to fight with them after they had been refused admission to a public house. 9. The deceased was last seen alive at around 1:30 a.m. on 13 October 2004 when he, Mr Houston and the applicant were seen making their way to a park area beside the Blackwater River. A post-mortem examination of the deceased revealed that he had been extensively beaten before his death and that he had sustained a number of knife wounds including a severance of the carotid artery. 10. The police searched the flat where the applicant was staying and found two sets of clothes which were heavily stained with the blood of the deceased (two sets of sweatshirts, a pair of blue jeans and pair of beige and navy tracksuit bottoms). The fact that two sets of clothes were found was material to the prosecution’s case that Mr Williamson was killed by two men. One of the items of clothing, namely the beige and navy tracksuit bottoms, had the applicant’s name tag ironed on to the back of the garment. A plastic bag containing a knife was also found at the applicant’s premises. The plastic bag and the knife contained blood which matched the blood of the deceased. Medical evidence indicated that the knife was one that could have been used to inflict the wounds sustained by the deceased. 11. Mr Houston admitted the manslaughter of Mr Williamson and was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment. 12. The applicant was arrested in the Republic of Ireland. He was interviewed by Irish police officers about the death of Mr Williamson. Those interviews were videotaped. He was subsequently extradited to Northern Ireland in April 2007. 13. At the applicant’s trial, the prosecution sought to rely on the interviews which had been conducted in the Republic of Ireland. The applicant challenged the admissibility of those interviews, inter alia on the ground that the proper procedures for interviewing a suspect with a mental handicap had not been followed. A voir dire (that is to say, a hearing to determine the admissibility of the contested evidence) was held, in the course of which evidence was led from clinical psychologists and psychiatrists who had examined the applicant and watched the interview tapes. At the conclusion of the voir dire, the trial judge decided to exclude the interviews from evidence. 14. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge rejected a defence submission that there was no case to answer. 15. The defence then applied to the trial judge for a ruling that the applicant’s mental condition made it undesirable for him to be called to give evidence. The effect of a favourable ruling would have been that the jury would not be permitted to draw an adverse inference from any failure of the applicant to give evidence in his own defence (see 28 below). In the course of the trial judge’s consideration of that application, a second voir dire was held, in which further evidence was given by one of the clinical psychologists, Dr Davies. The trial judge refused to allow Dr Davies to give evidence concerning the conclusions he had reached from watching the interview tapes. The trial judge reasoned that, once the interview tapes were excluded from evidence, they were excluded from evidence for all purposes. The trial judge did, however, hear evidence from Dr Davies as to his concern that the applicant’s low I.Q. would place him in considerable difficulty if he were to give evidence in his defence. In Dr Davies’ view, the applicant would be highly suggestible, he would have problems understanding questions and would find it difficult to give coherent responses. 16. In considering the defence application, the trial judge referred to the evidence of Dr Kennedy, consultant psychiatrist. The trial judge read out three passages of her report, the last which was the following: “He [the applicant] reports having had difficulty in comprehending court proceedings in the past as long words are used and people talk at speed. However, if account is taken of his need to have material simply phrased and to allow for adequate consultation with others to ascertain his understanding and clarify where necessary, it is my opinion that he should be capable of following proceedings and actively contributing to them.” 17. Turning to Dr Davies’ evidence, the trial judge noted that Dr Davies had entered a significant reservation in relation to the applicant’s ability to give evidence. Dr Davies had expressed doubts as to whether even in circumstances such as those referred to by Dr Kennedy the applicant could give a coherent account. 18. The trial judge refused the defence application, finding that he could control the manner in which questions would be asked and could ensure that no unfairness would result. In the event that the applicant chose not to give evidence the judge informed the parties that he would give an adverse inference direction to the jury. 19. The applicant elected not to testify but Dr Davies was permitted to give evidence to the jury as to the applicant’s vulnerability and the difficulties he would have faced. 20. The prosecution invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from the applicant’s failure to give evidence. The trial judge’s summing up contained the following direction to the jury: “I have said to you that the defendant has not given evidence and that is his right. He is entitled not to give evidence, to remain silent and to make the prosecution prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Two matters arise from his not giving evidence. The first is that you try this case according to the evidence. You will appreciate that the defendant has not given evidence at this trial to undermine, contradict or explain the evidence put before you by the prosecution. The second matter, as you heard him being told when I addressed Mr McGrory [counsel for the applicant], is that the law is that you may draw such inferences as appear proper from his failure to give evidence. It is for you to decide whether it is proper to hold the defendant’s failure to give evidence against him when deciding whether he is guilty. On the basis of the evidence of Dr Davies, Mr McGrory invites you not to hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence before you. Dr Davies’s contradicted evidence is that the defendant has an IQ of 62 and therefore is a person of very limited intellectual ability who should be regarded as mentally handicapped. He has the ability of a six year-old to understand spoken English. Dr Davies said that mentally handicapped people find giving evidence very challenging and his ability to provide a coherent and consistent account and to understand the implications of his replies is limited. Dr Davies said that he seems to have difficulty in functioning as an average person and has difficulty in maintaining relationships, keeping a job and performing everyday tasks such as looking after money. Dr Davies’s evidence about the accused and the abilities of mentally handicapped people in general about which I have just reminded you is an important factor to bear in mind, but there are others that you should bear in mind and consider as well. There is no evidence that the defendant is not fit to stand his trial; in other words, it has not been suggested that he cannot understand questions, nor has it been suggested that he cannot instruct his legal advisers as to the nature of his case. It has not been suggested that he is unable to remember what happened that night, indeed, Dr Davies did not ask him to recall the events of that night, so you do not know from what Dr Davies has said to what extent the defendant can explain what he did or where he went, indeed, when he was charged with Mr Williamson’s death he replied, ‘I didn’t go near him’, not, ‘I don’t know anything about it’, or, ‘I didn’t have anything to do with it.’ You have to consider along with many other questions you have to consider whether the answer he gave is not merely a denial of guilt, which it plainly is, but whether it implies that he knows something about the circumstances of Mr Williamson’s death. You should also consider whether the defendant, despite his undoubted handicaps, his low IQ and limited comprehension of English, could have answered questions in the witness box. I say that because Mr McGrory said in his closing remarks to you, ‘What chance would a man like that have in proceedings like this?’ I must tell you that the defence were well aware that had the defendant given evidence the court would have ensured he was treated fairly and given every chance to put his case and in particular that questions were simply phrased and put in such a way that they did not suggest the answer to him. It is not enough that a person would find it difficult to give evidence to excuse them from giving evidence. Many people have to give evidence and find it difficult - even children as young as six. Fortunately, we do not have that very often but it does happen sometimes. Every effort is made to simplify the proceedings and the form of questions to ensure that people like that can give evidence. If you think that because of the evidence of Dr Davies you should not hold it against the defendant that he has not given evidence do not hold it against him, but if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the evidence he relies on, that is, the evidence of Dr Davies, presents no adequate explanation for his absence from the witness box then you may hold his failure to give evidence against him. If you consider that there is no excuse for his not giving evidence what proper inferences - in other words, what conclusions - can you draw from the defendant’s decision not to give evidence before you? You may think that the defendant would have gone into the witness box to give you an explanation or answer to the case against him. If the only sensible explanation for his decision not to give evidence is that he has no answer to the case against him, or none that could have stood up to cross-examination, then it would be open to you to hold against him his failure to give evidence. It is for you to decide whether it is fair to hold that failure against him. In considering that it might be useful for you to consider what sort of questions might the defendant have had to face if he had given evidence.” 21. The trial judge went on to give examples of questions that might have been asked of the defendant had he given evidence before emphasising that the jury should not find him guilty only or mainly because he had not given evidence, but that they might take it into account as some additional support for the prosecution’s case and in deciding whether or not the case made on his behalf was or might be true. 22. The applicant was convicted by the jury and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of twelve years. He appealed against his conviction on three grounds: (i) that the trial judge had erred in not allowing Dr Davies to give evidence concerning the conclusions he had reached from watching the interview tapes; (ii) that the trial judge had erred in rejecting the applicant’s submission that it was undesirable for him to be called to give evidence; and (iii) that the trial judge had failed to direct the jury that they should not draw adverse inferences unless they were satisfied that there was case to answer. 23. On 28 January 2009 an application for leave to appeal was refused by a single judge of the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland. A renewed application was dismissed by the full court on 15 January 2010. 24. In respect of the first ground of appeal, namely the exclusion of the video evidence, the Court of Appeal accepted that the videotapes were admissible to demonstrate how the applicant expressed himself and to demonstrate that he was suggestible. However, the portion of the videotape on which the applicant had intended to rely did not in fact touch on suggestibility and, in any event, the applicant’s suggestibility was not in dispute between the experts who had testified for the prosecution and defence. Therefore, the omission of the evidence would not have had any material effect on the trial judge’s decision. 25. In respect of the second ground of appeal, namely the ruling under Article 4(1)(b) of the Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1988, the Court of Appeal considered that the trial judge had reached his conclusion in a proper and balanced manner and his conclusion was not unreasonable. The Court of Appeal noted that there was competing expert evidence in the case. On the one hand, there was the evidence of Dr Kennedy, a consultant psychiatrist, whose opinion was that the applicant “should be capable of following proceedings and actively contributing to them” if account were taken of his need to have material simply phrased and if he was allowed adequate consultation with others to ascertain his understanding and clarify matters where necessary. On the other, Dr Davies, a clinical psychologist, entered a significant reservation in relation to the applicant’s ability to give evidence. He did not know whether even where the procedures were simplified and the questions simply phrased, the applicant could give a coherent account of events. The Court of Appeal found that there was nothing unreasonable about the manner in which the trial judge preferred the evidence of the consultant psychiatrist over that of the clinical psychologist. 26. For the third ground, which related to the trial judge’s direction on a case to answer, the Court of Appeal recognised that, in England and Wales, trial judges were required to direct juries that they, the jury, had to find that there was a case to answer on the prosecution evidence before drawing an adverse inference (see paragraph 28 below). By contrast, in Northern Ireland, it was left to the judge in each case to decide whether to direct the jury in this manner, depending on the strength of the prosecution case. The Court of Appeal considered that, in the applicant’s case, the absence of such a direction to the jury reflected the trial judge’s view that this was not a case where the evidence was so weak as to require such a direction. The substantial body of evidence against the applicant supported that view. The trial was not, therefore, unfair. The Court of Appeal nonetheless recommended that the specimen direction in Northern Ireland should be amended to follow the approach taken in England and Wales, by adding a direction that the jury should not draw an adverse inference unless they consider that the prosecution case is such that it clearly calls for an answer. 27. The applicant asked the court to certify questions of general public importance for the consideration of the Supreme Court. It refused to do so in a decision handed down on 29 January 2010.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

From the beginning of April 2014 armed groups started to seize official buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions and announced the creation of self-proclaimed entities known as the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Luhansk People’s Republic” (the “DPR” and “LPR”). 7. In response, on 14 April 2014 the Government, who consider the armed groups to be terrorist organisations, authorised the use of force against them in the legal form of an “anti-terrorist operation”. 8. In June 2014 the armed groups started to seize offices of the National Bank of Ukraine and other regional financial institutions in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. 9. On 24 July 2014 the Ukrainian postal service Ukrposhta suspended its operations on the territories of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government, because of frequent attacks on its vehicles and employees by armed groups. 10. On 6 August 2014 the National Bank of Ukraine suspended all financial transactions on the territories outside the control of the Government (see paragraph 20 below). 11. Government forces recaptured some territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but certain parts of the regions have remained outside the Government’s control since that time. One part of the Donetsk region not under the Government’s control is the city of Donetsk. 12. On 2 September 2014, following changes in the law, jurisdiction of the courts in the non-controlled areas was transferred to the relevant courts in the neighbouring regions on the territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 34 to 36 below). 13. On 11 November 2014 all social benefit payments in the settlements of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were outside the control of the Government were suspended (see paragraph 26 below) 14. In December 2014 the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court and the Donetsk Regional Administrative Court of Appeal were relocated to the cities of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, territory controlled by the Government (see paragraphs 37 and 38 below). 15. The applicants were registered as recipients of social benefits with different departments of the Pension Fund of Ukraine in Donetsk. Some applicants had been receiving their social benefits until 30 June 2014, others until 31 August 2014. 16. On 16 June 2015 the first and second applicants registered themselves with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Krasnoarmiysk District of the Donetsk region (currently the city of Pokrovsk), controlled by the Government. On the same day their social benefits was reinstated, including social benefits due to them for the period 1 July 2014 to 16 June 2015. 17. The sixth applicant was registered with the Labour and Social Security Department of the Obolonskiy District in Kyiv on 9 September 2015. However, she did not apply for reinstatement of her social benefits. 18. The other applicants did not apply to the relevant social authorities on the territory controlled by the Government for reinstatement of their social benefits. 19. According to the Government, the sixth and seventh applicants travelled from Donetsk to the territory controlled by the Government after their social benefits had been suspended. The Government provided a certificate from the State Customs Office stating that the sixth and seventh applicants had entered the territory controlled by the Government on 31 October 2015, through an authorised checkpoint near the frontline between Ukrainian forces and “DPR” armed groups in the town of Zaitseve.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

The applicants are Serbian nationals and residents of the town of Majdanpek (their further personal details are set out in the Appendix to this decision). They were all represented before the Court by Mr D. Vasiljević, a lawyer practising in the same town. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were initially represented by their former Agent, Mr S. Carić, and subsequently by their current Agent, Ms Vanja Rodić. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 1. The imposition and collection of a specific local tax 3. An assembly of the Majdanpek local community (Gradska mesna zajednica Majdanpek) referred a proposal to its residents to levy a selfimposed local tax (samodoprinos, hereinafter “the SILT”) to fund the building/maintenance of certain facilities/utilities for the local community. 4. As a result of a ballot held between 10 June and 10 July 2006 in the Majdanpek local community, the proposal was approved. 5. On 11 July 2006 the Council of the Majdanpek local community (hereinafter “the Council”) enacted an Ordinance introducing the SILT and elaborating on its purpose, administration and levying. The Ordinance, inter alia, (a) specified the persons liable for the SILT (poreski dužnici), the basis, rate and the method of its collection (in the case of taxable incomes, “deduction at source”, the tax being paid by intermediary institutions (poreski platci), that is, the taxpayers’ employers (Articles 6-10; see also paragraph 44 below); (b) identified the local community’s current account X, held by the Majdanpek field office of the Zaječar Public Revenue Service (Uprava za javna plaćanja Zaječar, filijala Majdanpek), as the account to be used for the collection of the SILT (Article 15); (c) identified the exact amounts to be allocated per year for services, and entrusted the Council with adopting annual plans in that regard (Articles 4.2 and 5); (d) limited, temporarily, the local community’s power to levy the SILT to five years (Article 3) or until the resources needed to fund the designated projects had been collected (Article 4.1); (e) designated the local community’s finance departments to carry out the necessary financial administrative tasks and to track income and expenditure in accordance with the law (Article 12); (f) stated that if the targeted amount was collected before the expiry of the time allotted for levying the SILT, the process should be discontinued and any overpayments repaid to the intermediary institutions in order to be passed on to the SILT taxpayers (Article 16); and (g) provided that the legislation governing tax proceedings and tax administration should be applicable, as relevant, to various issues (Article 11). 6. It would appear that on an unspecified date, following certain legislative changes (see paragraph 42 below), the finance department of the Majdanpek municipality (Opštinska uprava opštine Majdanpek-odeljenje za budžet, finansije i trezor) informed all of its local communities, by an instruction of 17 December 2007, that all public revenues should be paid into the municipality’s current account Y. It would appear that the Majdanpek local community received this instruction on 19 December 2007, but did not inform the applicants’ employers of it. 7. The applicants’ liability to pay the SILT was discharged by their employers, who withheld their contributions on a “pay-as-you-earn” basis in the form of a periodic monthly deduction from their taxable wages. It would appear that various employers, including those of the applicants, continued to pay all or most of the contributions into account X. 2. Discontinuation of imposition of the SILT and the related refund proceedings 8. On 6 October 2010 a non-governmental organisation informed the officials of the Majdanpek municipality that, in analysing the annual financial reports of the Majdanpek local community, it had discovered that by June 2010 twice the targeted amount had already been collected. 9. It would appear that on 13 December 2010, on receiving the above information, the Majdanpek municipality requested an opinion on the collection of the SILT from the Finance Ministry and the Ministry of State Administration and Local Self-Government. 10. On 7 February 2011 the Finance Ministry, referring to Article 16 of the Ordinance (see paragraph 5(f) above), stated that the Council should have monitored the collection of incomes from the SILT on a regular basis and, if the required amount was collected before the expiry of the period of five years, should have informed the taxpayers that collection of the SILT was being discontinued and that any overpayments would be refunded to them. 11. Following pressure from the inhabitants of Majdanpek and the re-election of the Council’s members, the newly formed Council issued a decision on 23 March 2011 to discontinue the levying of the SILT. On the same date the Council also formed a Commission to establish the total amount collected in respect of the SILT. On 6 April 2011 the levying of the SILT was discontinued. 12. On 16 May 2011, on the basis of the data provided by the relevant finance departments of the Majdanpek municipality and the corresponding local community, the Commission found that: (a) the targeted amount had been collected by the end of February 2009 and, thereafter, a further RSD 33,410,126.99 dinars (RSD; 335,000 euros on that date) had been collected unlawfully and without cause; (b) each taxpayer was entitled to claim a refund of the amounts deducted from his or her income after the said date; and (c) a total of RSD 3,422,524.32 remained in the current accounts into which the SILT had been paid. 13. On 26 August 2011 the Ministry of Finance stated that the reimbursement of the overpaid public revenues – if the ground for collection of the public income had been wrong – should be carried out in accordance with the law governing the collection of public revenues and that refunds should be made from the relevant revenue account. 14. On an unspecified date in 2011 the finance department of the Majdanpek municipality announced that it would refund overpayments to the SILT taxpayers once they had filed their claims in that regard. 15. According to a report from the finance department submitted by the Government, it dismissed twelve applications as incomplete and adopted 1,869 decisions for the refund of overpayments, of which twenty-two were the subject of appeals. Two out of the twenty-two appeals are pending, while twenty have been decided upon. The first claim was submitted on 20 June 2011 and, since then, a total amount of RSD 12,938,571.70 has been reimbursed to citizens, the latest payment being made on 22 July 2013. The finance department further clarified that it had refunded only the overpaid SILT which the taxpayers’ employers as intermediary institutions had paid into current account Y (see paragraph 6 above). Following the instruction of 17 December 2007 (ibid.), the contributions paid into current account X (see paragraph 5(b) above) could not be considered as overpaid SILT, but only as “funds paid into the wrong current account”. 16. According to the documents submitted by the applicants, the first four applicants and twenty-four other SILT taxpayers filed a claim with the finance department of the Majdanpek municipality requesting the refunding of overpayments made after 1 March 2009. Between 30 July 2011 and 7 May 2012 the finance department ruled on their claims as follows. 17. In two cases, on 30 July 2011 and 7 May 2012 respectively, the finance department refunded the claimants without making reference to any current account. 18. Between 8 August 2011 and 30 January 2012 the finance department, referring to its instruction of 17 December 2007, agreed to refund the other claimants, including the first four applicants, only the overpaid SILT which their employers had paid into account Y, and rejected the remainder of their claims. In so doing, it informed the first four applicants and another two claimants that they could appeal to the Niš Regional Centre of the Ministry of Finance’s Public Revenue Service, and directed the remaining claimants to appeal to the Majdanpek municipality’s executive council (Opštinsko veće Opštine Majdanpek). On 21 February 2012 the latter authority rejected all the appeals in a one-sentence decision, on the same ground as that cited by the finance department. 19. It would appear that the first four applicants and the other two claimants did not appeal against the first-instance decisions. 20. The remaining three applicants and the majority of SILT taxpayers did not institute tax proceedings, but filed civil claims instead. 3. The relevant civil proceedings 21. Between 15 July and 2 November 2011 all of the applicants filed separate civil claims for unjust enrichment (tužba zbog sticanja bez osnova) with the Negotin Court of First Instance – Majdanpek unit (Osnovni sud u Negotinu – Sudska jedinica Majdanpek; hereinafter “the Court of First Instance”), seeking a refund of the overpaid SILT from the Majdanpek municipality and the Majdanpek local community jointly, together with the statutory interest accrued. It would appear that several hundred SILT taxpayers in Majdanpek pursued the same remedy. 22. On 17 August 2011 the Court of First Instance ruled in favour of one of the claimants. On 16 November 2011 the Negotin High Court quashed this judgment, stating that the matter in issue should not be considered as a civil matter. 23. On 23 and 25 November 2011 respectively the applicants’ lawyer applied to the Court of First Instance and its President, requesting them to initiate proceedings before the Supreme Court of Cassation to resolve the issue of civil jurisdiction in respect of the SILT refunds, in order to harmonise the domestic case-law (see paragraphs 48-50 below). On 26 November 2011 he also submitted a request to the Supreme Court of Cassation urging it to adopt an opinion on that issue. He did not receive any response to his requests. 24. Between 24 November 2011 and 6 January 2012 the Court of First Instance stated that it did not have competence ratione materiae to hear the applicants’ cases. In its reasoning, the court considered the SILT as a source of primary income for municipalities (izvorni prihod opštine). It observed that the Tax Proceedings and Tax Administration Act, which defined tax matters as public-law matters between the Central Revenue Service on the one hand and natural and legal persons on the other, empowered the latter to request a refund of overpaid or erroneously levied tax and ancillary contributions in tax proceedings. The court further stated that the provisions of that Act should accordingly be applicable to various SILT-related matters not specifically covered by the Local Government Act, and that, according to the Tax Proceedings and Tax Administration Act, the powers of local government departments as regards the assessment, levying and control of the primary incomes of municipalities should correspond to the powers of the Central Revenue Service. Therefore, and also given that the Majdanpek local community had never adopted a decision revoking the SILT, the present disputes could not be characterised as civil-law disputes coming within the competence ratione materiae of the civil courts. 25. Between 26 January 2012 and 21 February 2012 the Negotin High Court upheld the first-instance decisions on appeal. 4. Other civil suits 26. The Constitutional Court declared null and void several ordinances enacted by other local governments imposing or extending the levying of the SILT as being unlawful or unconstitutional for various reasons. 27. On 29 June 2006 the Constitutional Court declared null and void one such ordinance adopted by the Prijepolje local community as it had, inter alia, retroactively imposed the SILT between March 2003 and July 2006. In apparently more than three thousands cases examined between February 2010 and November 2011, the Prijepolje Court of First Instance and the Užice High Court accepted jurisdiction and upheld the claims for a refund of the above-mentioned unlawfully imposed SILT as being civil in nature. Referring to Articles 210-214 of the Obligations Act and the Local Government Finance Act (see paragraphs 60 and 45 below), the courts in question ordered the Prijepolje municipality and one of its local communities to jointly refund the claimants (see, for example, the final decisions of the Prijepolje Basic Court P. 1571/10 of 1 December 2010, P. 3124/10 of 25 November 2011 and P. 420/12 of 7 August 2012; and the decisions of the Užice High Court upholding the first-instance decisions of the Prijepolje Basic Court, Gž. 1675/10 of 13 December 2010; Gž. 65/11 of 19 January 2011; 62/11 of 21 January 2011; 58/11 of 18 January 2011; 172/11 of 4 February 2011; 70/11 of 24 January 2011 and 1234/11 of 15 July 2011). 5. Constitutional remedies 28. In a constitutional appeal of 23 March 2012 the first applicant contested the relevant judicial decisions in civil proceedings, relying on various Articles of the Constitution (see paragraph 35 below). He claimed that (i) the summary dismissal of his civil claim had arbitrarily deprived him of judicial protection and of the expected refunds; (ii) the municipal bodies had acted unlawfully, in an untimely manner and in breach of the rule of law and property rights when collecting the SILT and, thereafter, when ruling on his and others’ claims; and (iii) the divergent case-law of the competent courts in his case and of the domestic courts which had accepted jurisdiction ratione materiae in similar cases amounted to legal uncertainty, unequal protection of citizens before the law and discrimination against him. The applicant did not, however, provide the Constitutional Court with copies of any of the judgments in which the civil courts had accepted jurisdiction in cases similar to his own. 29. On 14 April 2012 the Constitutional Court, referring to Article 85 § 2 of the Constitutional Court Act (see paragraph 39 below), requested the applicant to provide a copy of the first-instance administrative decision in his case and, if he had appealed against it, of the second-instance decision. 30. On 25 April 2012 the first applicant provided a copy of the finance department’s decision of 16 August 2011, clarifying that he had not appealed against that decision to the executive council (compare and contrast with paragraph 18 above). He considered that avenue of redress to be futile in view of overall municipal policy and the rejection of claims in respect of contributions that had been paid into account X. 31. In its decision of 11 September 2012 the Constitutional Court held that the applicant had not been denied access to a court, given that the dispute in issue had been a “tax administrative” matter to be decided by the tax authorities rather than a civil matter for the civil courts. 32. It further dismissed the property-related complaints on the grounds that it “could not identify any link between the applicant’s allegations and the contested judicial decisions in civil proceedings”. Nevertheless, the Constitutional Court pursued its analysis, considering that the applicant and other SILT taxpayers should not have suffered harm on account of the Majdanpek local community’s failure to amend its Ordinance and inform the tax intermediaries in a legally valid manner of the change in the relevant current account. It concluded that “the applicant and his employer were entitled to request the reimbursement of overpayments from the Majdanpek local community in tax (administrative) proceedings, within the time-limits and prescription periods laid down by law, given that the overpayments had been paid into its current account”. 33. The Constitutional Court further summarily dismissed the applicant’s complaint alleging unequal protection of rights, considering that the general allegations before it, which were unsupported by evidence (paušalno izneti navodi), provided no constitutional basis for claiming a breach of that right. It also stated that there was no constitutional basis for examining the alleged violations of the general principles set out in Articles 18 to 21 (see paragraph 35 below), given that no violation of substantive constitutional rights had been found. 34. Throughout 2012 the other six applicants lodged constitutional appeals identical or very similar to that lodged by the first applicant. The Constitutional Court’s decisions rendered in their cases between 26 November 2012 and 18 December 2012 were summarised versions of its leading ruling in the first applicant’s case. 35. The relevant provisions of the Constitution relevant to the applicants’ appeals are as follows: Article 18 (direct application of guaranteed rights), Article 19 (purpose of constitutional guarantees), Article 20 §§ 1 and 3 (restriction of human rights), Article 21 §§ 1, 2 and 3 (equality and prohibition of discrimination), Article 22 § 1 (right to judicial protection of human rights), Article 32 § 1 (right to a fair trial), Article 35 § 2 (right to be awarded damages) and Article 58 §§ 1 and 4 (right to peaceful enjoyment of property). 36. Article 36 § 1 (3) provides, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court shall reject (odbaciće) a constitutional appeal when the appellant has failed, following an additional request issued in this regard, to furnish the court with all the relevant details indispensable for the proper conduct of the proceedings before it. 37. Article 36 § 1 (4) provides, inter alia, that the Constitutional Court shall reject a constitutional appeal whenever the relevant legal conditions for its examination have not been fulfilled. It is not required to issue any additional warning in this regard. 38. Article 85 § 1 refers to the compulsory information which must be contained in any constitutional appeal. This information includes: (a) the appellant’s personal data; (b) information concerning his or her legal counsel; (c) the particulars of the decision being challenged; (d) an indication of the relevant provisions of the Constitution; (e) a description of the violations alleged; (f) the redress sought by the appellant; and (g) the appellant’s personal signature. 39. Article 85 § 2 provides that appellants should also substantiate their constitutional appeals with any and all evidence of relevance for the determination of their case, provide a copy of the impugned decision, and demonstrate by means of supporting documents that all other effective remedies have already been exhausted. 40. According to this opinion, where a constitutional appeal lacks any of the compulsory elements (obavezni elementi) mentioned in Article 85 of the Constitutional Court Act, the appellant should be invited to provide the additional information by a certain deadline or have the appeal rejected pursuant to Article 36 § 1 (3) of the Constitutional Court Act. 41. The provisions regarding the legal nature and administration of local taxation, including the self-imposed local tax (“the SILT”), are set out in the following legal acts which have been amended or repealed on numerous occasions over the years: (a) the Local Government Act 2002 (Zakon o lokalnoj samoupravi, published in OG RS nos. 9/02, 33/04 and 135/04); (b) the Local Government Act 2007 (OG RS no. 129/07, which came into force on 1 January 2008 and repealed the Local Government Act 2002); (c) the Local Government Finance Act (Zakon o finansiranju lokalne samouprave, OG RS nos. 62/06, 47/11 and 93/12, which came into force on 1 January 2007 and repealed Article 5, Chapter V on local government financing and Articles 77 to 104 of the Local Government Act 2002); (d) the Budgetary System Act 2002 (Zakon o buǆetskom sistemu, OG RS nos. 9/02 ... 86/06); (e) the Budgetary System Act 2009 (OG RS nos. 54/09, 73/10 and 101/10); (f) the Act on Public Income and Public Expenditure (Zakon o javnim prihodima i javnim rashodima, OG RS nos. 76/91 ... 135/04); and (g) the Tax Proceedings and Tax Administration Act (Zakon o poreskom postupku i poreskoj administraciji, OG RS nos. 80/02 ... 2/2012). 42. The legal status of the SILT at the relevant time for the present cases will be summarised below. With the gradual decentralisation of governmentance in the early 2000s, the assessment, collection and control of several taxes and revenues, including the SILT, were redefined and transferred entirely from central to local government level (the Local Government Finance Act, Articles 60 and 6 in that order). Accordingly, the local government units (municipalities, towns and the city of Belgrade) have, in principle, the same rights and duties as the Central Revenue Service of the Ministry of Finance with its field offices (there are certain exception which are not relevant for the present case; see Articles 2a and 62 of the Tax Proceedings and Tax Administration Act). 43. The SILT was initially defined as a source of primary public revenue either for local government units such as municipalities or for the lower tier of government, the local communities (mesne zajednice), depending on whether the contributions in question were collected on and for the territory of the whole municipality or only the particular local community (Articles 78 § 14 and 73 § 1.2 of the Local Government Act 2002). However, the Local Government Act 2007 and the Local Government Finance Act (Articles 75 § 1.1 and 6 § 15 respectively) stipulated that the SILT was designed as a source of primary revenue exclusively for the local government units, and that the collected funds were credited to their budgets and strictly intended for specific purposes, while funds for the functioning of the local communities were provided only under specific budget headings. 44. Pursuant to the Local Government Finance Act, where a majority of citizens vote in favour of imposing the SILT for specific investments (for instance, to fund the building or maintenance of utility services or buildings of value to the community), contributions become mandatory and are required from all citizens with different taxable incomes, including those who voted against the SILT or did not vote at all (Article 26). The competent local government authorities subsequently define the procedures for calculating and collecting the SILT in the relevant decision, except where this is done by applying the principle of “deduction at source”. In the latter case, the deduction of the SILT from taxable income is the responsibility of those who pay these personal incomes and/or revenues (intermediaries; poreski platci), who deduct it when paying other applicable taxes and benefits (Article 28). The Act also provides that the legislation governing tax proceedings and tax administration should be applicable, as relevant, to issues such as the manner of determination and assessment of the SILT, its collection, deadlines for payments, statutes of limitation, calculation of interest and other issues not specifically covered by the relevant legislation (Article 30). 45. Lastly, the municipality’s administrative departments (opštinsko uprava) and the executive council (opštinsko veće) respectively decide at first and second instance on administrative matters which fall within the competence of the municipality (Articles 52 § 3 and 46 § 5 respectively of the Local Government Act 2007). 46. Article 4 provides that a court of law cannot refuse to consider a claim in respect of which its jurisdiction has been established by law or by the Constitution. 47. Article 29 provides that the Administrative Court adjudicates in administrative matters. 48. Article 31 provides that the Supreme Court of Cassation, inter alia, shall adopt general legal positions in order to ensure uniform application of the law by the courts. 49. Article 176 provided that where there was a large number of cases pending at first instance raising the same preliminary legal issue, the court of first instance could, either of its own motion or at the request of one of the parties, institute separate proceedings before the Supreme Court requesting the latter to resolve the issue in question. The lawsuits pending at first instance were stayed in the meantime. Article 178 provided that the Supreme Court determined the request under the procedure for the adoption of its legal opinions and could refuse to examine it if the preliminary legal issue was not of prejudicial importance in a large number of pending cases. 50. The Civil Procedure Act 2011 entered into force on 1 February 2012, thereby repealing the 2004 Act. Articles 180 to 185 correspond, in principle, to the provisions of the 2004 Act described at paragraph 49 above, save that the Supreme Court of Cassation has competence to rule on the request within sixty days of receiving it and to adjudicate on the issue. 51. Under Articles 19 and 56 §§ 3 and 4, no administrative authority may take over an administrative matter which is within the jurisdiction of another authority and decide thereon, save where so provided by law. If the authority finds that it is not competent to receive written submissions, its officer shall advise the claimant or appellant accordingly and refer him or her to the competent authority. If the submission was received by mail, the authority shall immediately send the submission to the competent authority and notify the party thereof. If the authority which does not have competence cannot establish with certainty which authority is competent in the matter, it must decline competence and serve that decision immediately on the party concerned. 52. Article 3 of the Act provides, inter alia, that the Administrative Court adjudicates on the lawfulness of final decisions rendered in administrative matters and/or in the determination of rights, duties or direct personal interests based on the law, where judicial protection has not been secured otherwise. 53. Under Article 5, an administrative matter within the meaning of this Act is an individual situation of public interest where the necessity to legally and authoritatively determine the future conduct of a party arises directly from the provisions of the law. 54. According to Article 6, the competent authorities for the purposes of this Act are, inter alia, local government bodies. 55. Articles 18 § 1 and 19 provide that judicial review proceedings may be brought within thirty days from the date on which the final decision was served on the party in question, or where an appellate administrative body fails to decide on an appeal lodged more than sixty days previously and again fails to do so within a further seven days after receipt of the plaintiff’s repeated request to this effect. The competent court should, in principle, hold a public hearing and may also rule in accordance with the principle of equity (načelo pravičnosti). 56. Article 42 § 1 provides that if the competent court decides to uphold the action it shall quash the impugned administrative act in part or whole and order fresh consideration of the case (spor ograničene jurisdikcije). Article 43 § 1 provides, however, that the competent court may instead rule on the merits of the claim, if the facts of the case and the very nature of the dispute in question allow for this particular course of action (spor pune jurisdikcije). Articles 41 §§ 1 to 4, 61 and 62 provide details of other situations in which a claimant’s request may be decided on the merits. 57. When deciding in a case concerning collection of the SILT, the Administrative Court considered that the municipality rather than the local community was the creditor in respect of the SILT for the purposes of standing to sue (see 9 U. 740/11 of 30 August 2011; see also Administrative Court Bulletin no. 3/2012). 58. No details of the practice of the Administrative Court on SILT refunds, if any, have been provided. However, between 9 December 2010 and 15 October 2012 the Administrative Court rendered six judgments in cases concerning tax refunds. In two of these judgments it quashed the administrative acts and/or ordered fresh consideration of the case, while in four cases it rejected (odbio) the applications for judicial review (see 7 U 427/10, 9 U 23584/10, 7 U 6202/10, 9 U 9004/10, 12 U 30082/10 and I-2 U 25802/10). 59. Furthermore, in six judgments rendered between 8 December 1999 and 9 April 2009 the Supreme Court and the Supreme Military Court (formerly the competent courts for judicial review in administrative matters), respectively, ruled on the merits of administrative disputes concerning property-related municipal decisions, pension entitlements, disability benefits, the right to stand for election and a proposed change in the registration of persons authorised to represent political parties (see Up. br. 2530/03, Už. 133/92, Už. 11/08, U.br. 1739/08, U.br. 48/08 and U.br. 1093/02). 60. Articles 210 to 219 set out provisions concerning unjust enrichment (sticanje bez osnova; condictio sine causa). Under the general rule set forth in Article 210, when a part of the property of one person passes, by any means, into the property of another person and that transfer has no basis in a legal transaction or statute, the beneficiary is required to return the property. If restitution is not possible, he or she is required to provide compensation equal to the value of the benefit received. The obligation to return the property or provide compensation for its value arises even when it was received in connection with a cause which did not come into existence or which subsequently ceased to exist.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

MALTA,4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect),Egidijus Kūris;Ganna Yudkivska;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bošnjak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"5. The applicants were born in 1964 and 1973 respectively and are detained in Corradino Correctional facility, Paola, Malta. 6. The first applicant is a Venezuelan national who has been detained in Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola, since September 2009. He is serving a tenyear prison sentence following a judgment of 21 March 2012. Since 10 January 2013 he has been detained in Division 3, cell no. 148. The first applicant has never asked for a transfer because, although there were prospects that he would be transferred to a division with an automated flushing system, this would also have meant that he would lose his individual cell and be placed in a dormitory, to the detriment of his privacy. 7. The first applicant submitted that his cell has one window and one air vent. The latter is clogged with dirt and debris and his cell window is positioned too high up, meaning that he therefore has to climb onto the sink to open or close it. He stated that the cell does not have adequate ventilation and it is subject to high temperatures in the summer and low temperatures in the winter. He alleged that he had not been provided with a heater during the winter and that his requests to this effect had been turned down. The prison authorities had provided him only with one blanket, other blankets and clothes having been received from NGOs. In the summer, when the temperature ranges between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius, the two fans purchased by the first applicant do not suffice as they merely circulate hot air, which is made worse in the absence of proper ventilation. 8. He also claimed that he has to use a bucket to flush his toilet. Given the low water pressure, it takes time to fill a bucket and sometimes more than one bucket is necessary to flush the toilet, making the situation deplorable, especially in the summer. 9. As the building housing the Division is more than 150 years old, the ceiling releases dust, which is allegedly harmful to the first applicant’s lungs. 10. The first applicant submitted that he does not have access to drinking water, since the tap water is rusty and filthy, and he therefore has to purchase drinking water. However, his job in prison pays only 0.60 euro (EUR) cents per day and in the summer he drinks three six packs of water a week, at considerable cost. The Government submitted that the first applicant received EUR 34.77 every four weeks in socalled “gratuity” remuneration and from the “Work and Pay” scheme, with which he had been involved since 2015. They stated that at the tuck shop a sixpack of water cost EUR 2.24 and an individual bottle EUR 0.38. 11. The second applicant, who is a national of the Dominican Republic, has been detained in Corradino Correctional Facility since 24 November 2009. He is serving a nine-year prison sentence following a judgment of 15 October 2012. Since 27 January 2012 he has been detained in Division 3, cell no. 155 (with the exception of one day 3 October 2015 spent in Division 6). 12. According to the Government, following communication of the complaint, the second applicant was asked whether he wanted to be transferred to another division and replied in the negative. 13. The second applicant submitted that his cell window is at a height of more than two metres and it is very difficult to open without endangering one’s life. Its metal protective bars make it difficult for the cell to admit any natural light. Although there are two openings for the purposes of ventilation, one of them is blocked and there is therefore not sufficient ventilation. 14. The second applicant alleged that the water is not drinkable; he therefore has to purchase it. The Government submitted that the second applicant received EUR 41.58 every four weeks in so-called “gratuity remuneration” and from the “Work and Pay” scheme, with which he had become involved prior to 2015. 15. The dust which falls from the cell’s ceiling allegedly affects the second applicant, who suffers from asthma. The Government submitted that the amount of dust falling from the ceiling of his cell was not abnormal, but was what emanates naturally from Maltese stone. They noted that the second applicant had never asked for materials to paint his cell. 16. The second applicant also submitted that because of the humidity in his cell and the fact that he does not have a heater, he frequently catches the flu during the winter months. The Government submitted that the cell was humid because the second applicant had blocked his vent with a towel and did not undertake any maintenance of his cell. 17. The second applicant noted that the light both inside and outside the cell is very poor, making it difficult for him to read. The Government noted that the second applicant had a ceiling light and another wallmounted light, as well a portable lamp which he had acquired. Natural light came in through three skylights and artificial light was provided through bell lamps of 400W each. The second applicant also claimed that the spiral staircase is not appropriate in the case of an emergency, since a stretcher could not be carried down it and it would not be possible to evacuate people two at a time. In this connection the Government submitted that other options were available should an emergency arise, such as the use of the walkway between the divisions.",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1966. At the time she submitted her complaint she lived in Madona Region, Latvia. 6. On 17 November 2006 the Madona District Court, acting as a firstinstance court, found the applicant guilty of a traffic offence which had caused moderate bodily injury to a victim. The court ordered the applicant to perform 100 hours of community service and suspended her driving licence for a year. 7. In establishing the applicant’s guilt, the first-instance court relied on incriminating statements by the victim and two witnesses. It also relied on other evidence, including a medical expert opinion on the bodily injuries sustained by the victim. 8. The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Vidzeme Regional Court. She alleged, inter alia, that the first instance court had failed to order an inspection and a technical examination of her vehicle, and had also not carried out a confrontation of witnesses. 9. On 13 February 2007 the Vidzeme Regional Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court but changed in part the punishment by revoking the suspension of the applicant’s driving licence. 10. On 8 March 2007 the applicant submitted an appeal on points of law to the Senate of the Supreme Court. She alleged that the appellate court had failed to carry out and to order a number of investigating activities. Specifically, according to the applicant, the appellate court has not carried out a confrontation between the witnesses and the victim. It has not ordered an investigative experiment, an inspection and a technical examination of her vehicle. 11. The applicant maintained that the evidence in the case was not sufficient to establish her guilt, and thus the appeal court had acted contrary to numerous sections of the Criminal Procedure Law. 12. In a letter dated 11 April 2007 a judge of the Senate of the Supreme Court informed the applicant that on 11 April 2007 her appeal on points of law was not admitted for examination in the cassation proceedings. It relied on section 573 of the Criminal Procedure Law and stated that “[the appeal on points of law] was not substantiated by any fundamental infringement of the Criminal Law or the Law on Criminal Procedure”.

156,001-161891,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,LE LIEVRE AND OTHERS v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Aleš Pejchal;Armen Harutyunyan;Ledi Bianku;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano,"1. In 2008, the island of Sark, an autonomous part of the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands with a population of some 600 residents, enacted a new electoral system. 2. The applicants are three British nationals, Tony Eric Le Lievre, Peter Tonks and Robert Knight, who were born respectively in 1953, 1948 and 1983. They are residents of Sark and, although they bring this application in their individual capacities, they have formed an unincorporated association called “Sark First”, which seeks reform of the island’s new electoral system. Their principal complaint to the Court is that the system does not comply with the requirements of Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, the right to free elections. 3. Sark’s constitutional position, the history of the reforms which led to the new electoral system, and the conduct of recent elections under that system are summarised at paragraphs 4–18 below. That summary is taken from the facts as submitted by the applicants and from two judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom concerning Sark: R (Barclay) v. Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (“Barclay (no. 1)”) and R (Barclay) v. Secretary of State for Justice (“Barclay (no. 2)”) (see relevant domestic law and practice at paragraphs 23–32 below). 4. The Channel Islands consist of the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey. The Bailiwicks are United Kingdom Crown Dependencies. The Bailiwick of Guernsey consists of the island Guernsey itself, the islands of Sark and Alderney, and several smaller islands. Sark and Alderney are autonomous from Guernsey. 5. The United Kingdom is responsible for the Bailiwick of Guernsey’s international obligations and has extended the application of the Convention and Protocol No. 1 to it through declarations under Article 56 of the Convention and Article 4 of Protocol No. 1. That responsibility is exercised primarily through the Privy Council. 6. Sark’s constitutional position can be traced back to the Anglo-French wars of 1202-14, when it came under the jurisdiction of the English Crown. Throughout its history Sark has, like the rest of the Channel Islands, retained its own customs, laws, courts and legislature. 7. Sark’s present constitutional position derives from letters patent issued by Queen Elizabeth I in 1565 which granted a perpetual lease of island to its first “Seigneur”. The lease has passed, either by sale or inheritance, down to the island’s current Seigneur, who still plays a role in the government of the island. 8. Guernsey, Alderney and Sark all have their own legislatures and, in general, the three islands legislate for themselves. 9. Sark’s legislature is called the Chief Pleas. The Chief Pleas legislates by two methods, Laws and Ordinances. In respect of Laws, after the Chief Pleas passes a Law, it is remitted as a Projet de Loi to officials in the Ministry of Justice, London. It is then remitted to the Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey, a Committee of the Privy Council (“the Committee”). The Committee includes the Secretary of State for Justice, the member of the United Kingdom cabinet responsible for the Ministry of Justice. If the Committee recommends that Royal Assent be granted, the Projet de Loi is presented to the Privy Council for Royal Assent so that it may become law. Royal Assent will then be given through an Order in Council. The Projet de Loi will not be presented to the Privy Council if the Committee decides not to recommend it for Royal Assent (see the Supreme Court’s judgment in Barclay (no. 1) at paragraph 17). 10. In considering whether or not to recommend approval, the Committee will in general respect the decision of the Chief Pleas, and there would tend to be a presumption in favour of recommending Royal Assent. But consideration is given to the Crown’s responsibilities, so that if a Projet de Loi violates the Crown’s international obligations or any fundamental constitutional principle or if it is clearly not in the public interest for it to become law, then a recommendation may be made to withhold Royal Assent (see the Barclay (no. 1) judgment at paragraph 18). 11. Historically, Sark was divided into 40 plots of land or “tenements”. Anyone who owned one of the tenements (“a tenant”) was entitled to a seat in the Chief Pleas. In 1922 the tenants were joined in the Chief Pleas by twelve elected members. 12. In March 2006, the Chief Pleas voted for a reform which would have provided for a legislature to consist of 16 tenants elected by the tenants and 16 deputies elected by the rest of the population. In April the Chief Pleas withdrew its support for the reform, a position supported by the Secretary of State for Justice, who wrote to the Seigneur stating that he “would not have been able to recommend for Royal Assent legislation about which there are serious or substantial ECHR compliance issues” (quoted in Barclay (no. 1) at paragraph 26). He continued: “[a]ny option which falls short of a wholly democratic process would cause me serious difficulties. ... I am concerned that Sark should give itself, and the UK, the best protection it can from ECHR challenge and its possible consequences ... [i]t is the UK which is vulnerable to an ECHR challenge. The UK cannot stand by and give that situation its tacit approval by doing nothing.” 13. In April 2007, the Chief Pleas approved another version of a new law which would still reserve seats in the Chief Pleas for tenants, but with those tenants elected by universal suffrage. The Secretary of State decided not to submit that proposal to the Privy Council over doubts as to whether it complied with the United Kingdom’s international obligations (Barclay (no. 1) at paragraph 27). 14. In 2008, the Chief Pleas then passed a Projet de Loi which proposed removing tenants from the Chief Pleas and replacing them with twentyeight elected members or “conseillers”. The Seigneur was to be an ex officio member of Chief Pleas, with a voice but no vote. The Seigneur did not have the right to veto Laws passed by the Chief Pleas (and this is would not change in the Projet de Loi). He would, however, retain the right to veto an Ordinance. In that case, the Ordinance would be placed again before the Chief Pleas within twenty-one days for its decision on whether to override the veto. The Projet de Loi also provided that the Seigneur could not sit on executive committees of the Chief Pleas, the main means through which the executive government of the island is conducted. 15. The 2008 Projet de Loi created the following electoral system for the island. All persons who had been resident on the island for 24 months could vote. Conseillers would serve four-year terms, but those terms would be staggered so that, subject to special rules governing by-elections and unforeseen vacancies, only fourteen of the twenty-eight conseillers would be elected at any one general election (save for the first general election at which all twenty-eight seats would be contested). 16. For any election, the island would be a single constituency with all eligible voters able to vote for all candidates. A voter would receive a number of votes equal to the number of vacancies being contested at the election (normally fourteen vacancies unless there were additional vacancies). The fourteen candidates gaining the most votes would be elected. 17. The Committee of the Privy Council recommended that the Reform Law should receive Royal Assent, concluding that it would not violate any of the United Kingdom’s international obligations. Royal Assent was accordingly given on 9 April 2008 and the Projet de Loi entered into force as the Reform (Sark) Law 2008 (“the 2008 Reform Law”). 18. Once Royal Assent was given to the 2008 Reform Law, Sark’s first general election on took place on 10 December 2008. Since then there have been three further general elections and two by-elections. The applicants have provided the following summary of the results for those elections: 19. Traditionally, sessions of the Chief Pleas were chaired by the island’s “Seneschal” who also serves as the island’s resident judge. Subsequent reforms have separated the Seneschal’s judicial and legislative functions: he now holds purely judicial office, his presiding role in Chief Pleas has been taken by a President of Chief Pleas. 20. Sark’s court of first instance is the court of the Seneschal. His court has unlimited jurisdiction in civil matters and shares jurisdiction in criminal matters with the Royal Court of Guernsey. When civil and criminal matters are decided at first instance by the court of the Seneschal, there is a right of appeal to the Royal Court of Guernsey then to the Court of Appeal for Guernsey and, finally, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. 21. Sark’s laws can, under certain circumstances be challenged in the United Kingdom courts. This arises because, under the law of England and Wales, there is the possibility of bringing a legal challenge to the making of an Order in Council. This is done by way of judicial review in the High Court for England and Wales and, on appeal, to the Court of Appeal and, finally, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Given that Royal Assent to legislation from the Bailiwick of Guernsey is given by an Order in Council (see paragraphs 9 and 10 above), it is, therefore, possible to challenge Guernsey legislation in the High Court through judicial review proceedings. This is, however, a limited jurisdiction, which the Supreme Court has made clear should not always be exercised: see Barclay (no. 2) at paragraphs 30–32 below. 22. The Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2000, a Law modelled on the United Kingdom Human Rights Act 1998, applies throughout the Bailiwick of Guernsey, including Sark. In summary, like the Human Rights Act, the Law constrains public authorities in the islands from acting contrary to Convention rights and requires the courts of the islands to take account of the case-law of the Convention bodies. It also requires the courts, so far as it is possible to do so, to read and give effect to primary legislation and subordinate legislation in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. When it is not possible for them to do so, the islands’ courts, like their counterparts in the United Kingdom, may make a declaration that the legislation is not compatible with the Convention (a declaration of incompatibility). 23. In Barclay (no. 1) certain aspects of the Reform Law were challenged by way of judicial review in the High Court of England and Wales, including whether the continued presence of the Seigneur and (at that time, the Seneschal) in the Chief Pleas was compatible with Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. 24. That judicial review challenge ultimately reached the United Kingdom Supreme Court, which gave judgment on 1 December 2009 dismissing the challenge: [2009] UKSC 9. 25. Lord Collins gave the lead judgment for the unanimous court. After reviewing the general principles which emerged from this Court’s case law on Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 (including the need to consider electoral rules in the round and in the light of historical and political factors), Lord Collins observed that there was no breach of Article 3 of Protocol No 1 arising from the Seigneur and Seneschal’s continued membership of Chief Pleas. He observed (at paragraph 66 of the judgment): “The starting point is that only Conseillers are entitled to vote in the Chief Pleas, and therefore it is only Conseillers who determine whether legislation is to be enacted. The electorate of Sark consists of fewer than 500 voters, who choose 28 elected Conseillers by a process of casting 28 votes each and electing the 28 candidates with the largest number of votes. There is therefore one Conseiller for every 17-18 persons in the electorate. It is not easy to envisage, in the words of Article 3, conditions which are more likely to ensure the expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature.” 26. Lord Collins went on to find that there was nothing in the travaux préparatoires of the Convention or the case-law of this Court which established that all members of the legislature should be elected, irrespective of their powers and irrespective of the circumstances. Indeed, to the contrary, the travaux préparatoires indicated that Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 had been drafted to recognise that, in some States, part of the legislature was not elected. 27. Instead, the effect of this Court’s case-law under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 was that all circumstances had to be considered. The presence of the Seigneur (and, at that time, the Seneschal) in the Chief Pleas did not contravene that Article. Even if their membership in the Chief Pleas was to be regarded as a limitation on the people’s right to choose the legislature, in light of the constitutional history and the political factors relevant to Sark, that limitation fell well within the margin of appreciation allowed by Article 3, not least given the long history of both positions and the difficulties that had occurred since 1922 in reforming the Chief Pleas (see paragraphs 11–17 above). 28. In respect of the Seigneur, his right to speak but not vote could not reasonably be said to frustrate the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. Nor was that conclusion affected by the Seigneur’s other powers and responsibilities on the island. For instance, the present Seigneur had never exercised his right of temporary veto over Ordinances and he had stated that he only envisaged using it in very limited circumstances. The remainder of the Seigneur’s other powers, such as the limited power to appointment certain of the island’s executive officials, did not affect the democratic process. 29. Finally, Article 14 could not assist the claimants in the case: their complaint under Article 14 was essentially the same as that made under Article 3 of Protocol No. 1. 30. In Barclay (no. 2), the same claimants challenged Reform (Sark) (Amendment) (No. 2) Law 2010, which removed the Seneschal from the Chief Pleas and made new provisions for his or her appointment, removal, renewal and remuneration. They did so by way of judicial review proceedings, commenced in the High Court for England and Wales, alleging that the provisions were incompatible with Article 6 and thus that the decision of the Committee of the Privy Council to recommend that Royal Assent be given to the Law through an Order in Council was unlawful. 31. The High Court rejected the challenges to provisions on appointment, removal and renewal of the Seneschal. It found, however, that the power of the Chief Pleas to reduce the Seneschal’s remuneration was incompatible with Article 6. 32. The latter part of the judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court, which allowed the appeal: [2014] UKSC 54. The Supreme Court found that, although the High Court had jurisdiction to hear such a challenge, it should not have exercised its discretion to hear it. For the courts of England and Wales to entertain challenges to the compatibility of Channel Islands legislation with the Convention would be to subvert the islands’ own human rights legislation (see, for instance, the Human Rights (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2000, set out at paragraph 22 above). The courts of the Bailiwick of Guernsey were infinitely better placed to assess the issues involved in human rights cases and there was the ultimate safeguard of an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Unlike the courts of England and Wales, the Judicial Committee had the inestimable benefit of the considered judgment of the courts of first instance and appeal in the island jurisdictions, and the island authorities would have every opportunity to take part in the case. The courts of the Bailiwick were the appropriate forum in which challenges to island legislation on grounds of incompatibility with the Convention should be heard (Lady Hale at paragraphs 37 and 39 of the Supreme Court’s judgment).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
157,001-165595,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,J.G. v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"1. The applicant, Mr J.G., is an Afghan national, who was born in 1985. He is currently living in the Netherlands. The Acting President decided that the applicant’s identity should not be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). He is represented before the Court by Ms Y. Coenders, a lawyer practising in Oss. 3. The applicant was born in Ghazni and is of Hazara ethnicity. Like the majority of the population in Afghanistan, he was a Muslim. He entered the Netherlands on 18 September 2003 and lodged a first asylum application on 18 October 2003, submitting, inter alia, that he had fled his village of origin following a dispute between his family and a local warlord over landownership, in the course of which his father and brother had fallen victim to vendetta killings and the applicant’s life had been threatened. It appears that that asylum application and a consecutive second asylum application lodged in August 2006 ended unsuccessfully for the applicant, with the relevant authorities considering that the applicant’s statements about the killing of his father and brother lacked credibility. Stating that these first two asylum proceedings are unrelated to the present application, the applicant has not submitted any further documents in this regard other than copies of reports from his first two interviews with the Immigration and Naturalisation Service (Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst). It nevertheless appears from the other documents in the file that the first asylum request was rejected on 31 March 2004 and that the appeal against that decision was upheld on 22 September 2004. The request was once more rejected on 13 June 2005, and the subsequent appeal dismissed on 27 March 2006. The second asylum application was rejected on 18 August 2006 and the appeal against that decision was dismissed on 6 September 2006. It further appears that, although possible, no further appeal was lodged in the proceedings on either the first or the second asylum request. 4. On 1 April 2008 the applicant lodged a fresh asylum application. Interviews were held with him by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service on 1 April and 4 June 2008. The applicant submitted – in addition to his previous submissions regarding the local warlord in his village of origin – that he had converted to Christianity during his stay in the Netherlands and that, as a consequence, he ran an additional real and individual risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 if he were to return to Afghanistan. In support of his claim, the applicant submitted a baptism certificate dated 23 December 2007 issued by the Kores Church in Apeldoorn. He further submitted, inter alia, that his first encounter with the Christian religion had been in a reception centre for asylum-seekers. He had visited a church for the first time out of curiosity in the last months of 2003 together with some Christian Afghans. While staying in different facilities, the applicant had gradually started to gain more Christian acquaintances; they had brought him a Bible and other reading material about the Christian religion, not only in Dutch but also in Dari and Pashto. The Bible had helped him particularly when he had been placed in immigration detention. He considered that love was the essence of the Christian religion, and in his daily life he tried to abide by the rules set out by Jesus, for example to love people and to treat them well. 5. On 5 September 2008 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) notified the applicant of her intention (voornemen) to reject his asylum application as she found his conversion to Christianity not credible. The Deputy Minister noted that it appeared from the applicant’s submissions that he had already been interested in Christianity in 2003, an interest which had grown in the course of the ensuing years and in particular through his contacts with another Afghan convert between 2005 and the middle of 2006. Yet he had nevertheless failed to mention such interest in the course of the proceedings on either his first asylum application or his second, and in those latter proceedings he had been registered as a Muslim – albeit a non-practising one – without the applicant giving any indication of his interest in a different religion. It also did not appear from the file relating to the applicant’s immigration detention that he had developed an interest in Christianity and neither had he made any mention of such in meetings with the Departure and Repatriation Service (Dienst Terugkeer en Vertrek) of the Ministry of Security and Justice. 6. In his comments (zienswijze) on the Deputy Minister’s intended refusal of his asylum application, the applicant submitted, inter alia, that he had replied “no” when he was asked in the interview pursuant to his second asylum application whether he was a practising Muslim. As he had not yet been baptised at that time, he had felt unable to say that he was a Christian. Moreover, when he had tried to explain to the officer of the Departure and Repatriation Service for what reasons he was unable to return to Afghanistan, he had been told that that Service was not concerned with such issues. 7. The Deputy Minister was not persuaded by the applicant’s comments and rejected the asylum request on 15 October 2008. In addition to the fact that the applicant’s alleged conversion was not believed, the Deputy Minister further considered that the alleged problems in the applicant’s village of origin had already been found to lack credibility in the previous asylum proceedings, while neither the applicant’s ethnicity nor the general security situation in Afghanistan gave rise to an assumption that he would be at risk of any treatment contrary to Article 3 if he were to return to that country (taking into account that Hazaras constituted the majority of the population of Ghazni where the applicant hailed from). 8. The applicant lodged an appeal against the Deputy Minister’s decision. In these proceedings, the Deputy Minister submitted, inter alia, that she considered it remarkable that the applicant, while he had been held in immigration detention, had made no mention of his interest in Christianity or of the problems which might arise as a result if he were expelled, yet he had been baptised three days after his release from detention. The Deputy Minister considered it likely that the applicant had let himself be baptised for effect only and found it implausible that he had genuinely converted. 9. Following a hearing on 17 September 2009, which was held in the presence of the applicant and counsel, the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 15 December 2009. It held that, pursuant to the case-law of the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State, hereinafter “the Division”), it could only review the impugned decision if the applicant had based his latest request for asylum on newly emerged facts or altered circumstances or if a relevant change in the law had occurred. The Regional Court agreed with the Deputy Minister’s finding that, notwithstanding the baptism certificate and an affidavit of the officiating minister (voorganger) of the Kores Church (to the effect that the applicant was an active member of that church), which had been submitted by the applicant, he had failed to demonstrate convincingly that he had converted to Christianity. This being the case, the alleged conversion could not be seen as constituting a newly emerged fact or altered circumstance. The Regional Court further held that the applicant had also not submitted any other arguments or documents on the basis of which the rejection of his earlier asylum application ought to be reconsidered. 10. A further appeal lodged by the applicant was dismissed by the Division on 22 October 2010 on summary grounds. 11. On 17 February 2011 the applicant lodged yet another asylum application, about which he was interviewed by the Immigration and Naturalisation Service on 21 February 2011. He submitted – in addition to his previous submissions – that his Christian beliefs had intensified, that he had been attending church services and Bible lessons and that he had converted others. He further submitted, inter alia, a certificate of attendance of a Bible studies course and a new affidavit of the officiating minister of the Kores Church dated 26 December 2010, stating that the applicant was a member of that church who attended its services, and affidavits of four Afghans stating that they had been converted by the applicant. Furthermore, he claimed that he had received threats from other Afghans in the Netherlands and in Afghanistan via telephone after he had told his mother, a nephew and others about his conversion and had tried to convert them. Lastly, the applicant referred to the deteriorating general security situation in Afghanistan. 12. On 2 May 2011, the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Asylum Policy (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie; the successor to the Deputy Minister of Justice as regards immigration matters) rejected the asylum request, considering that the documents submitted by the applicant could not be regarded as evidence of the applicant’s true conversion and holding that the applicant was (still) unable to provide an insight into the motivational process that had led to his alleged conversion. The assertion that his conversion had become known in Afghanistan was dismissed, as the Minister found the applicant’s statements in this regard inconsistent. Lastly, the Minister noted as a negative against the applicant that although he had had the opportunity to submit this information already during his previous asylum proceedings, he had failed to do so. As the applicant had thus still not made a plausible case for believing that his conversion was genuine, the Minister concluded that he was not eligible for asylum. Concerning the security situation in Afghanistan, particularly in the applicant’s home town of Ghazni, the Minister considered that although this might have deteriorated, it had not reached a level in which an Article 3 risk was to be assumed on account of a person’s mere presence in that place. The applicant lodged an appeal against the Minister’s decision. 13. At a hearing held before the Regional Court on 23 August 2012 in the presence of the applicant and counsel, two members of the Kores Church called as witnesses for the applicant testified about the latter’s church activities. On 4 July 2014 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, concurring with the Minister that his submissions did not repair the lack of credibility and lack of insight given regarding the motivational process around his alleged conversion, which had been observed in the previous asylum proceedings. The Regional Court concluded that the applicant had neither submitted any newly emerged facts or altered circumstances nor such exceptional circumstances relating to Article 3 of the Convention that it would be justified to proceed to a review of the impugned decision. 14. The applicant lodged a further appeal with the Division. 15. On 7 October 2014, the applicant was placed in immigration detention for removal purposes. Additionally, on that same day, a return decision (terugkeerbesluit) was taken and an entry ban (inreisverbod) of two years was imposed on the applicant by the Deputy Minister of Security and Justice (Staatssecretaris van Veiligheid en Justitie; the successor to the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Asylum Policy as regards immigration matters). 16. The application was lodged with the Court on 29 October 2014 and subsequently, on 4 November 2014, the applicant asked the Court to issue an interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of the Court staying his removal until his further appeal with the Division and his application with the Court had been decided upon. 17. On 5 November 2014, the Acting President of the Section decided to reject the request for an interim measure. 18. According to a letter received by the Registry on 12 March 2015, the further appeal by the applicant (see paragraph 14 above) was dismissed by the Division on 5 November 2014. 19. From a letter of the Deputy Minister of Security and Justice, dated 14 January 2015 and addressed to Mr J.S. Voordewind, a member of the Christian Union (ChristenUnie) lower house parliamentary party (Tweede Kamerfractie), it appears that the latter had, on 17 November 2014, asked the Deputy Minister to reconsider the applicant’s asylum request. Mr Voordewind had apparently noted that the applicant had started attending a different church one and a half years ago, namely the Hope for North (Hoop voor Noord) church in Amsterdam, and that that church did not readily issue statements on request when it concerned asylum-seekers; however, it had been happy to do so for the applicant who had been very active in that church. Furthermore, Mr Voordewind had seemingly expressed his disagreement with the finding (in the latest decision rejecting the applicant’s asylum request) that the applicant had not submitted any new facts or circumstances, urging that further research or a counter appraisal of the credibility of the applicant’s conversion should be performed in the given circumstances. The Deputy Minister replied in that letter that he saw no circumstances which gave rise to a need for a reconsideration of the refusal of the applicant’s asylum request, but that the applicant would be invited to lodge a fresh asylum request. 20. On 2 February 2015 the applicant lodged a fifth asylum request and an interview was held with him that same day. The applicant submitted, inter alia, that he had been a Christian and an active member of a church for seven consecutive years now, that all of his family members in Afghanistan knew about his conversion, and that his Christian belief had intensified even more since he had been attending the Hope for North church. In support of this claim, the applicant submitted an affidavit of the officiating minister and deacon (diaken) of the Hope for North church of 24 July 2014, attesting, inter alia, to the fact that the applicant had been an active member of that church since July 2013, attending church services every week; that they were convinced of the applicant’s sincere Christian belief; that their church was familiar with the fact that asylum-seekers might abuse it in order to obtain a residence permit; and that they were therefore very careful in giving statements. 21. The applicant further submitted a “Report Concerning the Credibility of Conversion” (Rapport Inzake Geloofwaardigheid Bekering), dated 29 November 2014 and drawn up in Dutch by Professor J.W. van S. of the Free University (Vrije Universiteit) of Amsterdam, a theology professor and a psychologist of religion. This report contains an assessment of the credibility of the applicant’s conversion to Christianity and commences with a general part in which definitions, different stages and types of conversion are described, followed by an elaboration of the analysis and classification of the credibility of conversion, all with references to other scientific reports. The second part of the report comprises an analysis of the applicant’s conversion based on his case file, that is to say all the records of interviews held with the applicant and all the decisions taken by the administrative and judicial authorities in the course of the proceedings concerning the applicant’s third and fourth asylum requests. The analysis entails an assessment of those documents based on eight questions through which the type of conversion is classified and the symptoms of different stages are compared for consistency to the assessed type; the departure from the previous religion and the motivations for conversion are compared to the way in which that process has been expressed and three dimensions (affection, cognisance, behaviour) of conversion are assessed for consistency. The conclusion of this report, in so far as relevant, reads as follows: “Based on the criteria concerning internal and external consistency, I find [the applicant]’s conversion credible. It appears to concern an active conversion (as opposed to a passive conversion) in which a change of religious beliefs occurs after a change in behaviour instigated by a crisis during which the convert experiences a lack of purpose. The different stages of the so-called ‘RAMBO model’ (pertaining to an active convert) are clearly recognisable. The motivations are consistent with the way they are expressed and the three dimensions of conversion are clearly visible and consistent with the religion he has converted to.” 22. Lastly, the applicant submitted an affidavit of 26 January 2015 from the preacher of the Rotterdam detention centre for asylum-seekers, attesting, inter alia, that the applicant was a Christian, that he had converted other asylum-seekers and that he attended church every Sunday including going to Bible-study groups. 23. By decision of 23 February 2015 the Deputy Minister rejected the asylum request, considering that there were no newly emerged facts or circumstances. The Deputy Minister took the view that since the documents submitted by the applicant (the abovementioned report on credibility as well as the affidavits) had been drawn up at the applicant’s request they could not be regarded as legally relevant new facts. With regard to Professor Van S.’s credibility report, the Deputy Minister considered that it could have been drawn up and submitted in previous asylum proceedings, which the applicant had failed to do without giving reasons as to why this had not been possible. Moreover, the fact that the report had been based on documents and that no assessment in person had been carried out discredited, in the Deputy Minister’s view, the value of the report. Lastly, the Deputy Minister observed that the report presupposed the alleged vendetta killings of the applicant’s father and brother as a basis for the crisis experienced by the applicant, but that that account of events had been found to lack credence in the proceedings in the applicant’s first application for asylum. 24. On 10 March 2015 the Repatriation and Departure Service of the Ministry of Security and Justice informed the applicant’s lawyer that a charter flight to Kabul, Afghanistan, had been arranged for the applicant’s removal, scheduled for 23 March 2015. 25. The applicant lodged an appeal against the Deputy Minister’s rejection with the Regional Court, accompanied by a request for a provisional measure (voorlopige voorziening) in order to stay his removal pending appeal. When filing his grounds of appeal, the applicant supplemented the above-mentioned documents which he had submitted in support of his fifth asylum request with a report entitled “Assessment of Conversion” (Toetsing Bekering) of 25 February 2015 and drawn up by Dr M.V. of the Gift Foundation (Stichting Gave), an interdenominational organisation supporting churches in their contacts with refugees and asylum seekers. That report concluded that in view of, inter alia, Professor Van S.’s report (see paragraph 21 above) strong reasons for a reconsideration of the applicant’s asylum application existed. 26. A hearing took place before the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague, sitting in Haarlem, on 16 March 2015, in the presence of the applicant and counsel. 27. On 17 March 2015 the applicant asked the Court for the second time to issue an interim measure under Rule 39. 28. On 19 March 2015 the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and rejected the request for a provisional measure. Noting that the impugned decision of the Deputy Minister was substantially similar to the decisions on the applicant’s earlier asylum applications, the provisional-measures judge set out the applicable framework for his review as follows: “4.1 It follows from the ne bis in idem principle that, if after an earlier negative decision a substantially similar decision is taken, it is at the outset to be assumed that the administrative court is not allowed to review the latter decision as if it were a first rejection. That decision, its reasoning and the manner in which it came about can only be reviewed by the administrative court if the alien adduced newly emerged facts or altered circumstances in the administrative stage, or if it follows from the alien’s submissions that a change in the law, relevant to his situation, has occurred. It is only when exceptional facts and circumstances within the meaning of paragraph 45 of the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment of 19 February 1998 (Bahaddar v. the Netherlands [Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998I]) pertain, relating to the individual case, that the above does not apply. 4.2 The provisional-measures judge will examine ex officio whether the request is based on newly emerged facts or altered circumstances. These include facts and circumstances which have occurred after the previous decision was taken or which could not have been adduced prior to the taking of that decision, as well as documents supporting already previously adduced facts or circumstances which it was not possible to submit prior to the earlier decision. Such newly emerged facts or altered circumstances will not, however, justify a new judicial examination if it is from the outset excluded that that which has been adduced or submitted is incapable of detracting from the earlier decision.” The provisional-measures judge proceeded to uphold the Deputy Minister’s point of view that the applicant had failed to establish the existence of newly emerged facts or altered circumstances. He considered, inter alia, that the report of 25 February 2015 from the Gift Foundation was of too general a nature. With regard to the applicant’s alleged intensified beliefs and activities in his church, it was considered that this argument had already been submitted in previous asylum applications and that the applicant had failed to repair the lack of insight given regarding the motivational process leading to his alleged conversion. As regards Professor Van S.’s report, the provisional-measures judge observed that the Deputy Minister had conceded during the hearing before that judge that the applicant could not have submitted said report at an earlier stage. However, the availability of the report did not affect the fact that it was for the applicant himself to relate convincingly about the motives for and the process of his conversion – and the applicant had failed to do so. The provisional-measures judge further held that even though considerable weight fell to be accorded to a report drawn up by Professor Van S. that focused on the individual asylum-seeker, this did not in every situation entail that a decision in which the Deputy Minister reached a different conclusion was by definition untenable. It was considered relevant in the case at hand that the Deputy Minister had challenged the report in a germane and well-reasoned manner, and the provisional-measures judge concurred with the Deputy Minister’s criticism. Thus, it was indicated in the report that the death of the applicant’s father and brother could have caused the crisis or disorientation that constitute one of the stages of a conversion. However, it did not appear that account had been taken in the report of the fact that this part of the applicant’s asylum statement had already been disbelieved in the earlier proceedings. Moreover, no confirmation could be found in the report of the applicant’s claim that Professor Van S. included in her assessment the question to what extent certain statements were brief and vague and what weight fell to be accorded to them. While Professor Van S. mentioned the period between 2003 and 2007 and the applicant’s statements surrounding that period in her report, no attention had been given to the vague and contradictory statements which the Deputy Minister had examined in the earlier proceedings. For this reason the provisional-measures judge concluded that it was from the outset excluded that the report by Professor Van S. could detract from the decisions that had been taken on the applicant’s previous asylum requests. 29. On 20 March 2015 the Acting President of the Section decided, under Rule 39, to indicate to the Netherlands Government that it was desirable, in the interest of the parties and of the proper conduct of the proceedings before the Court, not to expel the applicant to Afghanistan for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. 30. On 17 April 2015, the applicant informed the Court that he had lodged a further appeal with the Division against the Regional Court’s decision of 19 March 2015. 31. On 28 September 2015 the applicant submitted to the Division a reply which his lawyer had received from Professor Van S. to a question from the lawyer relating to the Deputy Minister’s criticism that Professor Van S. had partly based her conclusion of the sincerity of the applicant’s conversion on events which had been disbelieved. Professor Van S. stated that her report also mentioned that the crisis which had immediately preceded the applicant’s conversion had taken place while the applicant had been in immigration detention as set out in the report of the interview held with him in 2008 (see paragraph 4 above). The crisis-stage of the conversion could therefore be considered reliable even without the death of the applicant’s father and brother. This letter of 28 September 2015 was returned to the lawyer; as the Division had concluded its preliminary examination prior to receipt of the letter, it could not be added to the file. 32. On 30 September 2015 the Division dismissed the applicant’s further appeal on summary reasoning. No further appeal lay against that decision. 33. On 27 January 2016 the applicant submitted to the Court a report of a meeting that had taken place on 8 December 2015 between himself and two members of the so-called Plaisier Commission. This commission, set up in 2013, consists of a number of theologians from various Protestant churches. It carries out independent assessments of the conversion of asylum-seekers at the request of lawyers. Following their meeting with the applicant, the two members of the Commission concluded that they had no reason to doubt the sincerity of the applicant’s faith. 34. The applicant further submitted two statements, dated 29 October and 27 November 2015, respectively, from ministers attached to a Christian Reformed Church in Hoogeveen, where the applicant was living at that time. The two authors attested to the applicant’s attendance of church services and his involvement in other church activities as well as to the sincerity of his Christian beliefs.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant in the first application, Mr Paul Lynch, is an Irish national, who was born in 1976. At the time he lodged his application he was a prisoner at Portlaoise Prison in Ireland. He was represented before the Court by Mr F. Taaffe, a lawyer practising in Co. Kildare. 2. The applicant in the second application, Mr Peter Whelan, is also an Irish national, who was born in 1982. He too is detained in Portlaoise Prison. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Cuddigan, a lawyer practising in Co. Cork. 3. The Irish Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Mr P. White of the Department of Foreign Affairs. 4. Mr Lynch was convicted of murder on 10 February 1997 and was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990. An appeal was unsuccessful. His situation was reviewed for the first time by the Parole Board in 2004. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (now the Minister for Justice and Equality, hereafter “the Minister”) decided that Mr Lynch should not be released at that time, and that his situation should not be considered again for a further three years. The Parole Board considered Mr Lynch’s situation again in 2007, 2010 and in September 2012. In its last review of his case, the Parole Board recommended to the Minister that an escalating programme of temporary release be put in place for Mr Lynch. The Minister accepted the recommendation and the programme has since commenced. According to the Government, it entails attendance five days per week at a voluntary agency that works with offenders, and four overnight releases per month. 5. Mr Whelan was convicted on 2 December 2002 of the crimes of murder and attempted murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment pursuant to section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1990 and, on the same date he was also convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to a term of 15 years to be served consecutive to the life sentence. The order of sentence was subsequently reversed by the Court of Criminal Appeal. Mr Whelan completed his first sentence in July 2013, having benefitted from the standard remission of 25% of the total duration imposed at trial (fifteen years). He then commenced his consecutive life sentence. His situation was reviewed by the Parole Board in 2010 with a second consideration due to take place in 2014. 6. The two applicants later challenged their detention as contrary to the Constitution in a number of respects and also to the Convention. Their challenge was rejected by the High Court on 5 October 2007, and their appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on 14 May 2010. 7. The Supreme Court did not accept that, by prescribing a mandatory life sentence for murder, the legislature had intruded into the domain of the judicial branch. It described murder as “the ultimate crime against society as a whole”, “a crime which may have exceptional irrevocable consequences of a devastating nature for the family of the victim” and a crime that “by its very nature has always been considered at the highest level of gravity among all forms of homicide or other crimes against the person”. It stated: “For the reasons already indicated that crime has always and legitimately been considered to be one of profound and exceptional gravity and, in the Court’s view, one for which the State is entitled to impose generally a punishment of the highest level which the law permits. Given that it is an offence which is committed when, and only when, a person is unlawfully killed and that the person so doing intended to kill or cause serious injury it is one which can therefore properly be differentiated from all other crimes including manslaughter. The Court is of the view that the learned trial judge was correct when she concluded “...there can be nothing offensive in the Oireachtas promoting respect for life by concluding that any murder even at the lowest end of the scale, is so abhorrent an offensive to society that it merits a mandatory life sentence ...”.” 8. The Supreme Court also rejected the argument that the mandatory life sentence was contrary to the principle of proportionality in sentencing. It stated: “ ......” 9. The Supreme Court then considered the argument that, in substance, a life sentence was not a determinate sanction because the actual duration of imprisonment was decided systematically by the Minister, and that in so doing he was guided by considerations of a preventive nature. It noted, firstly, that it had been affirmed many times in case law that preventative justice or detention forms no part of Irish law. A convicted person may not be sentenced by a court or detained by an executive order for a preventative or non-punitive purpose. It was a “misconception that the punitive element of the life sentence terminates on temporary release”; “even where the release is open-ended ... the released prisoner remains liable to arrest and return to imprisonment to continue serving the life sentence should he be in breach of the conditions”. Temporary release was a privilege or a concession accorded at the discretion of the executive, not a right of a prisoner. The Supreme Court stated: “In the Court’s view a life sentence imposed pursuant to s. 2 of the Act of 1990 is a sentence of a wholly punitive nature and does not incorporate any element of preventative detention. It is a sentence which subsists for the entire life of the person convicted of murder. That person may, by virtue of a discretionary power vested in the executive, be temporarily released under the provisions of the relevant legislation on humanitarian or other grounds but he or she always remains liable to imprisonment on foot of the life sentence should the period of temporary release be terminated for good and sufficient reason. It may be appropriate at this point to note that in the event of a prisoner’s privilege of temporary release being withdrawn by virtue of a breach of the conditions of that release the Minister, or any person acting on his behalf, is bound to observe fair procedures before withdrawing the privilege of temporary release ... Should the Minister fail to observe such procedures or otherwise act in an unlawful, arbitrary or capricious manner in terminating the release for a breach of his conditions or otherwise, the prisoner may seek to have that decision set aside by way of judicial review before the courts. In all these circumstances the Court does not consider that there is anything in the system of temporary release which affects the punitive nature or character of a life sentence imposed pursuant to s. 2. In particular a decision to grant discretionary temporary release does not constitute a termination let alone a determination of the sentence judicially imposed. Any release of a prisoner pursuant to the temporary release rules is, both in substance and form, the grant of a privilege in the exercise of an autonomous discretionary power vested in the executive exclusively in accordance with the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers ...” 10. The Supreme Court went on to reject the argument that because the Minister was required to have regard to, inter alia, the gravity of the offence and the risk posed by the prisoner to public safety, it made the process of temporary release akin to a sentencing exercise. Consideration of such matters did not mean that the Minister was exercising a judicial function and, in particular, it did not mean that a decision not to release because of a risk to safety converts the punitive sentence for murder into a preventative one. It stated: “It is a necessary incident to the exercise of a purely executive discretion that the decision-maker would be bound to have, before directing a person’s release on any of the possible grounds, have regard to a whole range of matters of which some twelve are specified in s. 2 subs. 2 of the Act of 1960. Inevitably two of those considerations which ought to be taken into account in the making of any such decision are the gravity of the offence and the risk which the temporary release would pose to the public. A decision to grant temporary release even for a short period such as to permit a prisoner to attend a family funeral would necessarily involve a consideration of any potential risk that that would have for the safety of members of the public. Such a consideration is incidental to the discretionary power and its purpose. ... Refusing temporary release is a decision not to grant a privilege to which the prisoner has no right.” 11. The Supreme Court next considered the applicants’ arguments, based on Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention and on certain judgments of this Court, that under Irish law a life sentence was in reality an indeterminate one, which in practice was determined by the Minister in the form of a grant of temporary release. This, it was argued, constituted executive interference in the judicial function of sentencing and was prone to arbitrariness. The court stated: “The power of the executive, in this case the Minister, to release a prisoner ... is a distinct executive function and does not constitute a determination of what punishment a person should undergo as a consequence of his crime. It is in the form of an exercise of clemency or commutation and (sic) although it may bring to an end the period of incarceration, subject to conditions in the case of temporary release. As already pointed out the life sentence imposed by the Court continues to exist notwithstanding any conditional release and he may be required to continue serving it if there are found to be good and sufficient reasons in accordance with law to withdraw the privilege of temporary release, or the period of release simply expires.” 12. The Supreme Court considered that the distinction between these two functions was recognized by this Court in its judgment in Kafkaris v. Cyprus [GC], no. 21906/04, ECHR 2008. Having cited several passages from the judgment, it stated: “In its analysis the Court of Human Rights made a clear distinction between the imposition of a mandatory and punitive life sentence by a court and the exercise of an executive discretion to commute, remit or grant conditional release which gives the prisoner a de facto and de jure prospect of release at some point. It clearly did not consider that the existence of an executive discretion to grant conditional release or commutation to constitute the determination or imposition of a sentence by the executive. ... Provided a causal connection remains between the detention and the punishment imposed by the court of trial, the sentence cannot be considered arbitrary or in breach of Article 5(1). The discretionary power of the executive to grant conditional release on humanitarian or other grounds does not affect the lawfulness of the continued detention of a person as long as that detention is punitive by reason of its nexus with the sentence imposed following conviction.” The Supreme Court held that on any objective analysis of the sentences currently being served by the two applicants, their detention remained, de jure and de facto, in accordance with the punishment provided by law and ordered by the court of trial. 13. The Supreme Court then distinguished the legal situation in Ireland from that which prevailed in the United Kingdom, the latter having been found in a number of judgments of this Court to be contrary to Article 5 of the Convention. The Supreme Court noted that the sentencing regime in the United Kingdom which was under scrutiny in the judgments relied upon by the applicants was ‘radically different’ to the sentencing regime in Ireland. The sentencing regime which was found to be incompatible with the Convention featured a dual element—a punitive element identified as the ‘the tariff’ period and the subsequent preventative element. Once the prisoner had served the punitive element of the sentence, the nexus between the crime and its punishment was terminated. In Stafford the Supreme Court noted that the prisoner had been recalled after release even though he must have been regarded as having served the punitive element for his offence of murder. That being so, his detention after recall could not be justified as ‘punishment for the original murder’ which led the Strasbourg Court to conclude that his detention on foot of the original mandatory life sentence violated Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. That was, said the Supreme Court, in stark contrast to the longstanding position in Irish law. 14. Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990 provides: “A person convicted of treason or murder shall be sentenced to imprisonment for life.” 15. The power of temporary release is regulated by Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, which provides: “2.(1) The Minister may direct that such person as is specified in the direction (being a person who is serving a sentence of imprisonment) shall be released from prison for such temporary period, and subject to such conditions, as may be specified in the direction or rules under this section applying to that person— (a) for the purpose of— (i) assessing the person’s ability to reintegrate into society upon such release, (ii) preparing him for release upon the expiration of his sentence of imprisonment, or upon his being discharged from prison before such expiration, or (iii) assisting the Garda Síochána in the prevention, detection or investigation of offences, or the apprehension of a person guilty of an offence or suspected of having committed an offence, (b) where there exist circumstances that, in the opinion of the Minister, justify his temporary release on— (i) grounds of health, or (ii) other humanitarian grounds, (c) where, in the opinion of the Minister, it is necessary or expedient in order to— (i) ensure the good government of the prison concerned, or (ii) maintain good order in, and humane and just management of, the prison concerned, or (d) where the Minister is of the opinion that the person has been rehabilitated and would, upon being released, be capable of reintegrating into society. (2) The Minister shall, before giving a direction under this section, have regard to— (a) the nature and gravity of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates. (b) the sentence of imprisonment concerned and any recommendations of the court that imposed that sentence in relation thereto, (c) the period of the sentence of imprisonment served by the person, (d) the potential threat to the safety and security of members of the public (including the victim of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by the person relates) should the person be released from prison, (e) any offence of which the person was convicted before being convicted of the offence to which the sentence of imprisonment being served by him relates, (f) the risk of the person failing to return to prison upon the expiration of any period of temporary release, (g) the conduct of the person while in custody, while previously the subject of a direction under this section, or during a period of temporary release to which rules under this section, made before the coming into operation of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, applied, (h) any report of, or recommendation made by— (i) the governor of, or person for the time being performing the functions of governor in relation to, the prison concerned, (ii) the Garda Síochána, (iii) a probation and welfare officer, or (iv) any other person whom the Minister considers would be of assistance in enabling him to make a decision as to whether to give a direction under subsection (1) that relates to the person concerned. (i) the risk of the person committing an offence during any period of temporary release, (j) the risk of the person failing to comply with any conditions attaching to his temporary release, and (k) the likelihood that any period of temporary release might accelerate the person’s reintegration into society or improve his prospects of obtaining employment.” 16. In their submissions, the Government provided information about the Parole Board. It was established on an administrative basis in April 2001. It is chaired by an independent Chairperson and includes a representative from the medical/psychiatric profession, the Probation Service, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Prison Service, a retired Prison Governor, and representatives of the wider community. 17. The Parole Board’s principal function is to advise the Minister in relation to the administration of long term prisoners. The Board reviews the cases of prisoners serving life sentences or determinate sentences of eight years or more. The Board, by way of recommendation to the Minister, advises of the prisoner’s progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence. 18. In the case of mandatory life sentences the Parole Board considers the initial application after the prisoner has served seven years. Subsequent reviews are conducted at intervals of no more than three years. The final decision regarding the recommendations of the Parole Board remains with the Minister who may accept them in their entirety (as occurs in the majority of cases) or accept them in part, or reject them. 19. In reply to a question from the Court the Government indicated that as of 31 July 2013 there were 297 persons serving a mandatory life sentence for murder, with another 18 persons serving discretionary life sentences for other very serious offences. On the same date there were 78 persons with a life sentence who were on supervised release in the community. In the period 2005 to 31 July 2013 a total of 29 persons sentenced to life imprisonment were granted temporary release. The average duration of their imprisonment was 18 years.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
159,001-171210,ENG,BIH,ADMISSIBILITY,2017,STEVANČEVIĆ v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA,4,Inadmissible,André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik Møse;Ganna Yudkivska;Síofra O’Leary,"1. The applicant, Mr Stevan Stevančević, is a Bosnian and Serbian national, who was born in 1945 and lives in Igalo, Montenegro. He was represented before the Court by Mr G. Latinović, a lawyer practising in Igalo. 2. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent at the time, Ms M. Mijić. 3. The Serbian Government, having been informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings (Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 of the Rules of Court), indicated that they did not wish to exercise that right. 4. The applicant was an officer of the JNA, the armed forces of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The present case concerns his attempt to regain possession of his pre-war flat in Sarajevo. 5. The detailed background concerning socially owned flats, military flats and the involvement of foreign armed forces in the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina is provided in Đokić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, no. 6518/04, §§ 5-17, 27 May 2010 and Mago and Others v. Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 12959/05 et al., §§ 5-8, 3 May 2012. 6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 7. In 1984 the applicant was allocated an occupancy right to a military flat in Sarajevo. 8. On 13 February 1992 he bought that flat under the terms of the Military Flats Act 1990 and paid the full purchase price in the amount of 595,066 Yugoslav dinars (approximately 7,067 German marks (DEM) at the time). 9. When the JNA formally withdrew from Bosnia and Herzegovina on 19 May 1992, the applicant continued his military career in the VJ forces and left Sarajevo. His military service was terminated in 1999. 10. During the 1992-95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina the flats of those who had fled were declared “abandoned” and allocated to new occupants (see Mago and Others, cited above, § 53). On 7 September 1998 the applicant applied for the restitution of his flat to the competent administrative authority in the Sarajevo Canton. 11. Following one remittal on procedural grounds, on 14 November 2002 his application was rejected pursuant to section 3a of the Restitution of Flats Act 1998. On 28 July 2003 the competent Ministry of the Sarajevo Canton upheld that decision. 12. On 25 September 2006 the Sarajevo Cantonal Court (“the Cantonal Court”), following an application for judicial review, upheld the second-instance decision of 28 July 2003. 13. On 10 June 2009 the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Constitutional Court”) rejected the applicant’s constitutional appeal and upheld the impugned decisions. 14. On 11 February 2001 the applicant complained to the Human Rights Chamber (a domestic human-rights body set up under Annex 6 to the Dayton Peace Agreement) about his inability to repossess his pre-war flat. He relied on Article 6 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention. 15. On 12 May 2005 the Human Rights Commission (the legal successor of the Human Rights Chamber) found a violation of Article 6 of the Convention on account of the length of the restitution proceedings and awarded the applicant 1,000 convertible marks (BAM; approximately 500 euros (EUR)) for non-pecuniary damage in this connection. As regards the complaint under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, the Commission concluded that the interference with the applicant’s right to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions had been justified. However, it ordered the Government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to secure the applicant’s right to compensation for his pre-war flat envisaged under section 39e of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997, without further delay and at the latest within three months from the delivery of that decision. 16. On 5 July 2005 the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina requested the applicant to provide his contact and bank account details in order to pay the awarded compensation. The applicant provided those details. 17. On 28 January 2006 the applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court against the decision of the Human Rights Commission of 12 May 2005. On 14 March 2006 the Constitutional Court declared that it lacked jurisdiction to examine the case. 18. On 5 July 2004 the applicant initiated proceedings before the Sarajevo Municipal Court (“the Municipal Court”) seeking to establish the validity of the purchase contract of 13 February 1992 (see paragraph 8 above) and to register his title to the flat in the land register. 19. On 19 June 2005 the Municipal Court declared the purchase contract legally valid. However, it rejected the applicant’s claim to have his title registered. Under the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997 those who served in foreign armed forces after the 1992-95 war, like the applicant, were not entitled to repossess their pre-war military flats and to register their title, but were entitled to compensation. On 19 November 2008 the Cantonal Court upheld that judgment. 20. The Government did not dispute the facts submitted by the applicant. However, they provided additional information as follows. 21. On 20 April 2007 the applicant received BAM 42,085.04 (approximately EUR 21,496.24) in compensation for his pre-war flat in accordance with section 39e of the Privatisation of Flats Act 1997 as ordered by the Human Rights Commission (see paragraph 15 above). The amount was transferred to his bank account in Montenegro. 22. The relevant domestic law and practice were outlined in Aleksić v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (no. 38233/05, §§ 16-18, 3 February 2015).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

CROATIA,4,No violation of Article 14+2 - Prohibition of discrimination (Article 14 - Discrimination) (Article 2 - Right to life;Article 2-1 - Effective investigation),Erik Møse;Julia Laffranque;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Ksenija Turković,"6. The applicants were born in 1936 and 1967. Until his death the first applicant lived in Novska, Croatia. The second applicant lives in Dieskau, Germany. 7. According to the applicants, on 18 December 1991, during the armed conflict in Croatia, a number of the first applicant’s neighbours, together with the other members of their family, gathered in the first applicant’s home in Novska, Croatia, because the town was being shelled. At about 9.45 p.m. several soldiers broke into the house and immediately started to hit and kick the first applicant. He could not see them well because the house, like the rest of the town, was without electricity. When he fell to the ground, they dragged him into the kitchen where V.M., the first applicant’s wife and the second applicant’s mother, and G.M., the first applicant’s daughter and the second applicant’s sister, and B., one of their neighbours, were sheltering. In the candlelight, the first applicant saw five men in military uniforms of the Croatian Army with balaclavas on their heads. They continued to hit and kick the first applicant and one of the men cut through the first applicant’s palm with a knife. The other man cut one of B.’s fingers off with the knife. One of the soldiers shot G.M. in the head, the other then cut B.’s throat with a knife and subsequently shot at her with a firearm. The soldiers then ordered V.M. to make coffee for them. One of the soldiers introduced himself as Grgić from a nearby village, Bročice. He asked the first applicant if he knew him and then hit him on the head with the shotgun. One soldier then cut a muscle in the first applicant’s right hand. Next, the soldiers shot V.M. dead. After that, a soldier shot the first applicant through his right cheek. The soldiers then left the kitchen. The first applicant escaped through the window and ran away, reaching a nearby medical centre. From there he was transferred to a hospital in Kutina, then to Zagreb where he lay in a coma for three days. When he came round, one of the doctors told him that three men had been looking for him and wanted him killed. His sister sent an ambulance from Germany and he was transferred from Zagreb to Germany, where he was treated from 6 January to 15 May 1992. 8. When the first applicant returned to his home in Novska on 19 July 1992, he found refugees accommodated in part of the house. In the intervening period, all of his possessions had been taken away. 9. It appears that the police were alerted of the above-described events the following day. On 30 December 1991 the Sisak County Court ordered an investigation into the events in respect of suspects Ž.B., D.L, D.M., I.G. and Z.P. 10. On 23 March 1992 the Zagreb Military Prosecutor dropped the charges against I.G. and Z.P. on the ground that there was insufficient evidence that “any projectiles had been shot from their weapons”. 11. On 23 March 1992 the Zagreb Military Prosecutor indicted the remaining three suspects, Ž.B., D.L. and D.M. before the Zagreb Military Court on three counts of murder aggravated by an exceptionally immoral purpose. 12. The Zagreb Military Court terminated the proceedings against Ž.B., D.L. and D.M. on 2 November 1992 on the basis of the General Amnesty Act. 13. D.L. died on 19 January 1997. 14. On 30 October 2008 the applicants lodged a criminal complaint against six suspects, namely, Ž.B., D.L., D.M., I.G. and Z.P., on charges of war crimes against the civilian population. 15. On 10 December 2008 the Sisak County State Attorney’s Office dismissed the complaint against D.L. since he had died in 1997. 16. On 12 January 2009 an investigating judge of the Sisak County Court heard evidence from the first applicant. On 13 January 2009 the first applicant asked that two witnesses be called and provided their addresses and telephone numbers to the County Court. 17. On 9 February 2009 the Police interviewed the potential witnesses, M.B. and P.U. 18. On 30 July 2009 the State Attorney’s Office in Sisak County submitted a request to the Sisak County Court to open an investigation into the above-mentioned criminal complaint. The request was denied on 1 October 2009. However, upon an appeal lodged by the Sisak County State Attorney’s Office of 6 October 2009, the Supreme Court of Croatia ordered on 30 March 2010 that the investigation in respect of Ž.B., D.M., I.G. and Z.P. be carried out. 19. On 20 May 2010 the investigating judge heard evidence from the four suspects. One of them confessed to some of the charges but the other three remained silent. The investigating judge ordered the detention of all four suspects. 20. The investigating judge heard evidence from the first applicant and one other witness on 11 June 2010 and from another four witnesses on 28 June 2010. She heard the first applicant again on 5 July 2010, as well as an expert witness and one of the accused. 21. On 9 July 2010 the Sisak County State Attorney’s Office indicted Ž.B., D.M., I,.G and Z.P. in the Sisak County Court on charges of war crimes against the civilian population, which included the killing of V.M. and G.M. and seriously wounding the first applicant. The accused lodged objections to the indictment which were dismissed by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Rpublike Hrvatske) on 19 August 2010. 22. Hearings were held on 23 and 24 September 2010. On the latter date the County Court commissioned a report on the autopsy of V.M. and G.M. and a psychiatric report in respect of the accused Ž.B. The report on the autopsy was submitted on 2 November 2010 and the psychiatric report on 11 November 2010. 23. Hearings were held on 15, 16 and 19 November 2010. On the last-mentioned date a judgment dismissing the charges was delivered on the ground that the accused had already been tried for the same offence before the Zagreb Military Court. The charges against I.G. and Z.P. had been dropped by the prosecutor and the proceedings against Ž.B. and D.M. had been terminated under the General Amnesty Act. 24. The Sisak State Attorney’s Office lodged an appeal on 23 February 2011 and on 21 February 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment in respect of I.G. and Z.P. and quashed the judgment in respect of Ž.B. and D.M. As regards I.G. and Z.P. the Supreme Court concluded that the prosecutor had dropped the charges against them because there had not been sufficient evidence that they had participated in the shooting of the victims. Neither had the evidence adduced in the proceedings before the Sisak County Court indicated their involvement in the killing and wounding of the victims. The relevant part of the judgment referring to the actions of I.G. and Z.P. reads: “The evidence presented [at the trial] ... did not establish any activity on the part of the accused I.G. and Z.P. so as to indicate [that they had committed] acts of violence towards Petar Mileusnić or any other person in the house, before Ž.B., D.M. and the late D.L. started to shoot at the victims. The [first-instance] court concluded that the accused I.G. had not entered the house at all and that the accused [D.]P. had quickly entered and exited the house of the victim Petar Mileusnić, without having committed any act in the house.” The Supreme Court further held as follows: “Since no new facts were established in the fresh criminal proceedings in which the impugned judgment was delivered ... save for those [facts] in respect of which the State Attorney had already dropped the charges, irrespective of their different legal qualification, the conclusion of the first-instance court that [the situation] was a matter of res judicata is correct and, contrary to the assertion of the State Attorney in the appeal, the indictment was correctly dismissed in respect of the accused I.G. and Z.P. in accordance with Article 353 point 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (1997).” 25. The case was then transferred to the Zagreb County Court. 26. Hearings before the Zagreb County Court were held on 28 November 2012 and 23 January 2013. 27. On 29 October 2013 that court found the accused Ž.B. and D.M. guilty as charged and sentenced them to ten and nine years’ imprisonment respectively. The judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 7 March 2013. 28. On 22 December 2004 the applicants brought a civil action against the State in the Novska Municipal Court (Općinski sdu u Novskoj), seeking compensation in connection with the deaths of V.M. and G.M., wounding of the first applicant as well as pecuniary damage as regards the expenses incurred for the stone erected on the grave of their relatives. In these proceedings the Croatian State was represented by the State Attorney’s Office. 29. On 29 September 2005 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicants’ claim, finding that it had become time-barred. 30. That judgment was upheld by the Sisak County Court on 31 August 2006 and by the Supreme Court of Croatia on 21 February 2007. 31. A subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicants concerning the assessment of facts and interpretation of laws was dismissed by the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 13 May 2009. 32. On 25 November 2014 the second applicant and the Republic of Croatia, Ministry of Defence, represented by the State Attorney’s Office, reached a settlement by which the State was to pay the second applicant the following amounts: 150,000 Croatian Kuna (HRK) for non-pecuniary damage for the killing of his mother; HRK 75,000 for non-pecuniary damage for the killing of his sister; HRK 12,800 for pecuniary damage concerning the expenses incurred for the stone erected on the grave of his mother and sister; and HRK 2,500 for costs he incurred in the civil proceedings. The said amounts, together with the applicable interest rates, were paid to the second applicant on 8 December 2014.",[],[],[],"['14', '2']",['2-1'],[],0
161,001-144852,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,ORIĆ v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Dmitry Dedov;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Julia Laffranque;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant, Mr Savo Orić, is a Croatian national of Serbian ethnic origin, who was born in 1952 and lives in Topolovica. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Jelić, a lawyer practising in Bjelovar. 2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 9 December 1991 the police lodged a criminal complaint with the Bjelovar County State Attorney’s Office against unknown perpetrators on charges of terrorism, alleging that on 5 November 1991 they had learned that there were two corpses in a house in Topolovica. The police had visited the said house and found two bodies, identified as Ljuban Orić and Mara Orić. The crime scene had been photographed. 5. At the request of the applicant, on 15 December 2000 the Grubišno Polje Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Grubišnom Polju) decided that Ljuban and Mara Orić, the applicant’s parents, were presumed to have died on 3 November 1991. 6. In their letter of 22 August 2005 the Bjelovar County State Attorney’s Office qualified the criminal offence as murder and asked the Grubišno Polje Police about the progress of the investigation into the deaths. The latter replied on 31 January 2006 that it had been concluded that the applicant’s parents had been killed in unknown circumstances during a military operation. 7. On 9 November 2006 the Grubišno Polje Police interviewed four people, K.M., I.M., M.S. and J.S., who all lived in Topolovica in 1991. They submitted that between August and November 1991 Toplovica had been occupied by Serbian para-military forces. At the beginning of November 1991 the Croatian forces had entered the village and taken them to another place. When they were leaving they had seen many parts of the village burning. 8. The witness I.M. had returned to the village three days later and entered the house of the Orić family, where he had seen the dead bodies of Ljuban and Mara Orić. The next time he visited the village the house had partly burned down and the roof had fallen in. 9. The witness M.S. submitted that he had been a member of the Croatian Army and on 1 November 1991 when his village, Topolovica, had been taken over by the Croatian army he had seen two copses lying on a bed in the house of the Orić family. He had recognized Ljuban and Mara Orić. Ljuban had had no visible injuries while Mara had been shot. His mother, J.S., had told him that Ljuban had died a natural death because he had not received his medication. Mara had been killed by an unknown person when she had refused to leave the village with the Croatian Army. 10. The witness J.S. submitted that the Serbian para-military forces which had controlled Topolovica had left at the end of October 1991. On the third day thereafter the Croatian army had entered the village. One T.F. had told her that Ljuban Orić, who had been suffering from leukemia, had died because he had not received his medication. 11. The police interviewed J.V. and A.P., the police officers who had carried out the on-the-scene inspection in the house of the Orić family in November 1991, on 7 and 10 March 2008 respectively. J.V. submitted that both victims had been shot with firearms. The woman had been shot in the head and chest. He was not sure about the man, but thought that he had been shot in the chest. He had found bullet cartridges and traces of blood. He had also photographed the crime scene. No other steps had been taken owing to the ongoing war. A.P. submitted that both victims had been shot with firearms and that the house had been burned down. 12. On an unspecified date the applicant sought financial assistance for the reconstruction of his parents’ house. His request was dismissed by the administrative authorities in 2003 on the ground that he had not resided in that house at the time the damage had occurred. The applicant brought the same claim again in 2005. It was dismissed on the ground that the same request had already been decided upon. 13. On 7 February 2007 the applicant, through his legal representative, brought a civil action against the State in the Grubišno Polje Municipal Court, seeking compensation in connection with the death of his parents and the destruction of their property. The claim was dismissed on 3 April 2007 and this judgment was upheld by the Bjelovar County Court and the Supreme Court on 6 September 2007 and 9 April 2008, respectively. The national courts found that the claim had been submitted after the statutory limitation period had expired. 14. The applicant’s subsequent constitutional complaint was dismissed on 9 May 2012. 15. The applicant was legally represented throughout the proceedings. 16. The relevant part of the Criminal Code (Kazneni zakon, Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 50/2000, 129/00, 51/2001, 111/2003, 190/2003, 105/2004, 84/2005, 71/2006, 110/2007, 152/2008, 57/2011, 125/2011, 143/2012 and 144/2012) reads: “(1) The criminal prosecution shall be time-barred after: - forty years if the case concerns a criminal offence punishable by long term imprisonment or imprisonment of more than fifteen years, - twenty-five years for a criminal offence punishable by more than ten years’ imprisonment, - twenty years for a criminal offence punishable by more than five years’ imprisonment, - fifteen years for a criminal offence punishable by more than three years imprisonment, - ten years for a criminal offence punishable by more than one year imprisonment, - six years for other criminal offences.

CROATIA,4,No violation of Article 6+6-3-c - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Article 6-3-c - Defence through legal assistance),Aleš Pejchal;Armen Harutyunyan;Kristina Pardalos;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Pauliine Koskelo;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1981 and lives in Dubrovnik. 6. On 21 October 2010, at 4:40 p.m. in Dubrovnik, police officers of the Criminal Police Department of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Police (Odjel kriminalističke policije Policijske uprave dubrovačko-neretvanske) (hereinafter “the police”) arrested the applicant on suspicion of drug abuse. 7. According to the Government, the applicant resisted arrest and the police had to apply force in order to be able to bring him to the police station. During this process both the applicant and one of the police officers who had arrested him, S.D., sustained minor bodily injuries. 8. According to the applicant, he did not resist arrest and did not sustain injuries during his arrest; rather, it was during his stay in the police station that the police officers ill-treated him in order to pressure him to make incriminating statements against his co-accused in the trial. 9. The applicant was taken to the police station immediately after his arrest. At 9.40 p.m. he was examined by a doctor, who found that he had sustained minor bodily injuries – excoriations on his left elbow, on the left side of his chest and behind his left ear. Minor bodily injuries were also found on the police officer, S.D., who had arrested the applicant – specifically, excoriations on his right knee and elbow. During their medical examination the applicant and the police officer S.D. stated that they had sustained their injuries by falling to the ground. The doctor’s report of the examination was forwarded to the police. 10. According to a common report issued on the same day by the three police officers who arrested the applicant, S.D., L.D. and I.R., the applicant had resisted arrest and they had had to apply force in order to bring him to the police station. In particular, it was noted that the applicant had been found in a vehicle on the road and arrested. He had refused to step out of his vehicle, so S.D. had grabbed him by his left wrist and had applied the socalled “wristlock” technique in order to get him out of his vehicle. At that point police officer L.D. had grabbed the applicant by his right hand in order to apply the so-called “elbow-lock” technique, but due to the fact that the applicant had continued to resist all three of them had fallen to the ground. The applicant had tried to stand up and L.D. had kept him on the ground by pressing his knee against his back. The applicant had then been handcuffed and placed in the back seat of a police vehicle. In the police vehicle the applicant had continued to resist and the police officer S.D. had applied the “elbow-lock” technique and leaned him forwards in order to restrain him. By the time they had parked in front of the police station, one handcuff had come loose, so L.D. and I.R. had applied the “elbow-lock” technique again. When they had entered the police station the applicant had once again fallen to the ground. Then the applicant had been seated in a room and had ceased to resist, so the police officers had stopped using force and removed his other handcuff. Lastly, it was noted that during the application of coercive measures the applicant and S.D. had sustained injuries which, according to the doctor’s report, had been minor. 11. On the same day a shift manager of the Criminal Police Department noted in a report that the applicant had actively resisted arrest and that S.D., L.D. and I.R. had applied coercive measures against him – bodily force, restraining techniques and handcuffing. It was also noted that the applicant had been examined by a doctor, who had found that he had sustained excoriations on his left elbow, on the left side of his chest and behind his left ear. The applicant signed the report and stated that he did not have any objections to the procedure that had been followed. 12. On 25 October 2010 the chief of the Dubrovnik-Neretva County Police examined the information gathered in respect of the application of coercive measures against the applicant and found that they had been necessary, justified and lawful. 13. According to a police report made on the day of the applicant’s arrest, the applicant was informed of the reasons for his arrest and his right to remain silent, to hire a lawyer of his own choosing and to have a person of his choice be informed of his arrest. The report noted that the applicant had declined to hire a lawyer and that he had asked that his father be informed of his arrest. In this connection it was noted that the applicant’s father had been contacted at 6.20 p.m. The applicant signed the report without making any objections to its contents. On the same day the police lodged a criminal complaint against the applicant under a reasonable suspicion of drug abuse. 14. On 22 October 2010 at 9.45 a.m. the applicant was questioned by the police. In the report on his questioning it was noted that the applicant had been advised of his right to remain silent and to hire a lawyer of his own choosing who could be present during the questioning. In this connection it was noted that the applicant had declined to hire a lawyer. The applicant then gave a statement, explaining that in August 2010 he had on two occasions acted as an intermediary in the selling of amphetamines. He also stated that between 2008 and 2010 he had on several occasions bought cocaine from a certain D.Š. He expressed regret for his actions. The questioning ended at 11.10 a.m. The applicant signed the report on his questioning without making any objections regarding its contents. 15. On 22 October 2010 at 12 p.m. the applicant was brought for questioning before an investigating judge of the Dubrovnik County Court. A deputy Dubrovnik County State Attorney, K.K., was also present during the questioning. According to the report on his questioning, the applicant was twice advised by the investigating judge of his right to remain silent and to hire a lawyer of his own choosing, who could be present during the questioning. The applicant replied that he understood the advice and the grounds for his being under suspicion and maintained that he did not require a lawyer for that day’s questioning and that he would give a statement to the investigating judge and answer questions. He then explained that in August 2010 he had on two occasions acted as an intermediary in the selling of amphetamines and that between 2008 and 2010 he had on several occasions bought cocaine from D.Š. Lastly, the applicant stated that he had been arrested the day before at 5 p.m. and that apart from the use of force during his arrest he did not have any objections about the police conduct during his stay in the police station. The questioning ended at 12:50 p.m. The applicant signed the report on his questioning without making any objections as to its contents. He was then released. 16. On 29 October 2010 an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant and D.Š on the reasonable suspicion of their having engaged in drug abuse. On 2 December 2010 the investigation was extended to encompass a third person, V.V. 17. On 3 December 2010 the applicant hired a lawyer, D.P., to represent him. 18. On 4 January 2011 the Dubrovnik County State Attorney’s Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Dubrovniku) indicted the applicant, D.Š., and V.V for drug abuse. 19. On 3 May 2011 a hearing was held before the Dubrovnik County Court, which the applicant and his lawyer attended. The hearing was adjourned in order for V.V.’s ability to follow the proceedings to be determined. 20. The hearing of 7 June 2011, which the applicant and his lawyer attended, was adjourned owing to the illness of the presiding judge. 21. At a hearing held on 20 June 2011, which the applicant and his lawyer attended, the Dubrovnik Country Court (“the trial court”) established the identity of the defendants and the charges brought against them. The applicant stated that he understood the charges brought against him and the warnings regarding his rights given by the presiding judge and that he would present his defence and answer questions. He pleaded not guilty. He asked to give his defence at the end of the trial. Evidence was read out aloud, whereas certain evidence was excluded from the case file at the request of the defence. The trial court heard three witnesses. 22. At a hearing held on 21 June 2011, which the applicant and his lawyer attended, the trial court heard I.G., a witness. 23. At a hearing held on 1 July 2011, which the applicant and his lawyer attended, the trial court continued to hear I.G. and examined certain other evidence. The applicant’s lawyer then proposed that the trial court examine the medical records of the applicant’s father who allegedly suffered a stroke after learning of the applicant’s arrest, as well as a medical certificate dated 27 January 2011 confirming that on 21 October 2010 the applicant had been examined by a doctor and that the doctor’s report had been forwarded to the police. He also proposed that the trial court hear the applicant’s sister and examine the power of attorney by which she had hired a lawyer to represent the applicant during the time that the investigating judge was questioning him. The applicant’s lawyer, D.P., explained that this proposed evidence was relevant for the establishing of the conduct of the police against the applicant. D.H., the lawyer allegedly hired by the applicant’s sister, who represented D.Š., the applicant’s co-accused in the trial, stated that the power of attorney in question had been signed in his office on the night when the applicant had been held in the police station. The trial court examined the applicant’s father’s medical records and rejected the other proposed evidence, considering them irrelevant for the proceedings at that point. 24. At a hearing held on 4 July 2011 the trial court heard the applicant’s co-accused, D.Š. D.Š. stated, inter alia, that he had not sold drugs to the applicant and that he had learned from his lawyer, D.H., that the police had ill-treated the applicant in the police station and had beaten him. The trial court then heard the applicant. 25. The applicant reiterated the part of his statement given to the investigating judge on 22 October 2010 concerning the criminal accusation against him, namely that he had on two occasions acted as an intermediary in the selling of amphetamines. He retracted the part of his statement concerning the buying of cocaine from D.Š. He alleged that after he had been brought to the police station he had been physically and psychologically ill-treated and had been coerced to into giving such a statement to the investigating judge. He further alleged that the following morning his father and sister had come to the police station, and when he had seen his father crying, he had agreed to give his statement to the investigating judge. He explained that once he had been brought to the police station he had immediately confessed to being an intermediary in the selling of amphetamines. However, when the police had started questioning him about D.Š. and the cocaine, he had asked for a lawyer. Later, at one point police officer L.D. had told him that D.H. had arrived at the entrance of the police station but had not been allowed to come in. He alleged that he had been beaten by police officers L.D., S.D. and I.R. 26. When asked by the prosecutor, the applicant explained that during his arrest and transportation to the police station the police officers had used force against him and had beaten him. When further asked by the presiding judge and the lawyer, D.H., the applicant explained that even though on 22 October 2010 he had been advised by the investigating judge of his right to remain silent and to hire a lawyer, he had been afraid of the police officers who had brought him before the investigating judge, given that they had been the same police officers who had beaten him. The applicant’s lawyer then asked that the applicant’s sister be heard on account of a conversation that she had had with the police officer, L.D. He also asked that D.H. be heard and that the medical documentation relating to the injuries the applicant had sustained during his questioning by the police be examined. The trial court dismissed these requests, considering such evidence to be unnecessary. 27. In a closing statement the applicant’s lawyer asked the trial court to take into account, when determining the applicant’s sentence, the fact that he had confessed to his crime. The applicant reiterated his lawyer’s statement and added that he intended to finish school and start working and would never repeat his actions. 28. On 6 July 2011 the Dubrovnik County Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to two years’ imprisonment. It also found D.Š. and V.V. guilty as charged and sentenced them to eight and two years’ imprisonment, respectively. In finding D.Š. guilty the trial court referred to, inter alia, the statement that the applicant had given to the investigating judge concerning his having purchased cocaine from D.Š. in the period between 2008 and 2010. It did not consider credible the applicant’s allegation that he had given his statement to the investigating judge under police duress. It found that during the trial the applicant himself had alleged that he had given his oral statement to the investigating judge uninterruptedly, without the police officers being present, and after being advised of his right to hire a lawyer and to remain silent. In this respect it noted that the applicant had told the investigating judge that he had been illtreated by the police only during his arrest, and not during his stay in the police station. It considered that the fact that the applicant had changed the nature of his allegation was an attempt to help his co-accused D.Š in the trial. 29. The trial court dismissed evidence proposals relating to the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment in the police station, specifically that his sister be heard in respect of this allegation, finding that his sister had not been present during his arrest and transportation to the police station, and later on had not been in the same room with the applicant and the police officers. As to the criminal accusation against the applicant, the trial court found that the applicant had confessed to being an intermediary in the sale of amphetamines and it took his confession into account as a mitigating circumstance. 30. The applicant appealed against the first-instance judgment to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske). In his appeal he stated that he had not resisted his arrest and had not sustained injuries during his arrest. He explained that once he had been brought to the police station he had immediately and voluntarily confessed to his crime. Therefore, he could have had no reason to resist the police only a few minutes beforehand. He further stated that the police had physically and psychologically pressured him into incriminating D.Š. and had denied him access to a lawyer. He alleged that he had given a statement to the investigating judge under duress applied by the police officers who had brought him before the investigating judge. He complained about the trial court’s dismissal of his proposals regarding evidence relating to those circumstances. He lastly stated that, given that the trial court had believed the statement that he had given against D.Š. and had taken it into account when convicting D.Š., he should have been given a milder sanction. 31. On 29 February 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s conviction but reduced his sentence to one year’s imprisonment. The Supreme Court found that in his appeal the applicant himself had stated that the police officers had had no reason to exert pressure on him given that he had immediately confessed his crime. As to the change of the applicant’s line of defence during the trial, the Supreme Court agreed with the trial court that this had probably been an attempt to help his co-accused, D.Š., in the trial, rather than constituting a credible reason for retracting his earlier statements. The Supreme Court lastly found that the applicant’s statement had helped to convict D.Š. and that therefore his sentence was to be reduced to one year’s imprisonment. 32. The applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). He complained that during his stay in the police station he had asked for a lawyer and that his sister and father had hired D.H. to represent him. However, he stated that the police had forced him to waive this right. He further complained that he had been ill-treated during his stay in the police station. He explained that he had not resisted arrest and had not been injured during his arrest, but during his stay in the police station when he had been forced to incriminate D.Š. 33. On 7 November 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded. The decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 18 November 2013.",[],[],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],0

CROATIA,4,No violation of Article 2 - Right to life (Article 2-1 - Effective investigation) (Procedural aspect),Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Ksenija Turković,"5. The applicant was born in 1964 and lives in Vukovar. 6. The events at issue took place in Vukovar, a Croatian town near the Serbian border which was heavily attacked by the Yugoslav People’s Army and paramilitary Serbian armed forces during the armed conflict in Croatia from August to November 1991 and was finally occupied at the end of November 1991. Between 1992 and 1996 Vukovar was a part of the United Nations Protected Area (the “UNPA”). 7. In 1996 the United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (the “UNTAES”), which included Vukovar. On 15 January 1998 the UNTAES mandate ceased and the transfer of power to the Croatian authorities began. 8. Between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. on 2 October 1991, during a general alert, two unknown uniformed men, armed with firearms, apprehended the applicant’s husband, Lj.N., in the basement or the courtyard of a building in Kudeljarska street in Vukovar, and drove him away. 9. On 24 November 1991, the body of Lj.N. was found in the River Danube at Novi Sad, Serbia. 10. On 25 November 1991 the Institute for Forensic Medicine of the Medical Faculty in Novi Sad carried out an autopsy on the body of Lj.N. which established that the cause of death was a gunshot wound caused by a bullet fired from a hand gun. 11. In 2004 the applicant brought a civil action before the Vukovar Municipal Court against the State, represented by the Vukovar Municipality State Attorney’s Office, seeking damages in connection with the death of her husband. 12. In connection with the above civil proceedings, the Vukovar Municipality State Attorney’s Office asked the Vukovar police to submit all information concerning the death of the applicant’s husband. The police thereby learned about the death of the applicant’s husband for the first time and opened an enquiry into it. 13. On 24 January 2005 the police interviewed the applicant, who stated that on 2 October 1991 her husband had been abducted from the basement of a building in Vukovar by two Croatian soldiers and driven away. She named six other persons who had been present in the basement on that occasion, B.Š., K.Š., J.T., S.P., M.P. and J.M. However, K.Š., S.P. and M.P. had died in the meantime. 14. On the same day the police interviewed J.T., who stated that the applicant’s husband had been taken from the basement of a building in Vukovar in October 1991 by two uniformed and armed men wearing masks. 15. On 3 February 2005 the police interviewed B.Š., who stated that he had joined the Croatian Army in August 1991 and had only been visiting his wife K.Š. and their children, who had sought shelter from the shelling of Vukovar in the same basement as the applicant and her husband. He said he had not been present when the applicant’s husband had been taken. 16. On 15 February 2005 the Vukovar police lodged a criminal complaint with the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office against an unknown perpetrator in connection with the killing of the applicant’s husband, classifying the offence as a war crime against the civilian population. 17. On 5 May 2009 the applicant approached the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office and told them that B.Š. had been present when her husband was taken. She also stated that after K.Š. had died around 10 November 1991, one of the men who had taken her husband had come to the basement to take J.M. On that occasion B.Š. ‒ who had also been present ‒ whispered to the applicant: ‘This is the man who took Lj.[N.]’. The applicant also stated that B.Š. lived in Zagreb. 18. On 9 July 2009 the Zagreb police interviewed B.Š. He said that he had not been present when the applicant’s husband had been taken and did not know the identity of those who had taken him. 19. On 21 July 2009 the Vukovar police interviewed J.M., who said that she had been present in the basement on the day Lj.N. had been taken but had not seen the men who had taken him. 20. On 24 March 2011 an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court heard evidence from B.Š., who repeated his prior statement. 21. On 3 May 2011 an investigating judge of the Vukovar County Court interviewed the applicant, who repeated her statement. 22. On 12 November 2011 the Vukovar police informed the Vukovar County State Attorney’s Office that they had not learned any new information. 23. As indicated above (see paragraph 11) in November 2004 the applicant brought a civil action against the State in the Vukovar Municipal Court, seeking compensation in connection with the death of her husband. The claim was dismissed on 18 September 2008 and was upheld on appeal by the Vukovar County Court and the Supreme Court on 21 April 2009 and 16 February 2011 respectively. The national courts found that the claim had been submitted after the statutory limitation period had expired. 24. A subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant was dismissed on 12 July 2011.",[],[],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],0

TURKEY,3,Remainder inadmissible (Art. 35) Admissibility criteria;No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing),Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Julia Laffranque;Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens;Robert Spano;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström,"7. The applicants were born in 1967, 1965, 1968, 1960 and 1958 respectively and live in İzmir. 8. The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. 9. The applicants have been employed in the duty-free shops at İzmir Adnan Menderes Airport since 1993. They are members of the Tekgıda Work Union, which had signed a collective labour agreement with the General Directorate of Monopolies on Spirits and Tobacco, the applicants’ employer and formerly a State-run enterprise. 10. During their employment the applicants operated in “work and rest cycles”. Accordingly, in the four months of the summer period they worked continuously for twenty-four hours and rested the next twenty-four hours. For the remaining eight months of the year, the winter period, they worked for twenty-four hours and rested for the next forty-eight hours. Their work schedule did not take account of weekends or public holidays as the dutyfree shops remained open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. As regards rest breaks and periods, section 22 of their collective labour agreement provided that such periods would be counted as working time and that they could not be subject to wage deductions. 11. On 10 October 2003 the applicants, with the assistance of their lawyer, instituted individual and separate proceedings against their employer before the İzmir Labour Court. They claimed compensation for the overtime hours they had worked beyond the legal working time for the previous five years of their employment. They referred to the Labour Code in force at the material time and to their collective agreement. Both documents defined overtime as work in excess of the regular forty-five-hour working week and provided for remuneration for such work at one and a half times the regular hourly rate. 12. On 1 November 2003 the applicants instituted new proceedings against their employer before the İzmir Labour Court and requested further remuneration for work done on weekends and public holidays and compensation for annual leave that they had not taken. 13. Having regard to the common background of the applicants’ complaints in both sets of proceedings, the İzmir Labour Court decided to join each applicant’s proceedings and to seek an expert report concerning the calculation of their claims for overtime, weekend and public holiday pay and remuneration for unused annual leave. 14. On 14 July 2004 the expert submitted a report in which he noted, inter alia, that clause 25 (c) of the collective agreement concluded between the parties provided for an entitlement to overtime pay, calculated on the basis of one and half times the hourly rate. He further referred to an official audit report by the Ministry of Labour, dated 10 September 2003, which noted that during the preceding summer period, between the months of June and September, workers at the company in question had worked overtime of 139.5 hours in months which had thirty-one calendar days and 135 hours in the remaining months. In the previous winter period, between October and May, they had worked 22.5 hours and fifteen hours of overtime respectively. The hours worked in excess of the legal working time should have been remunerated accordingly. According to the expert report, the applicants’ employer had previously been cautioned, on 25 November 1996, by the Ministry of Labour concerning its practices on working hours. 15. On the basis of his examination of the company’s timekeeping records, the expert calculated the number of hours worked as overtime in respect of each applicant, deducting three hours of rest per each day worked. 16. The expert determined that the employer did not owe anything to the applicants for weekend and public holiday work as the remuneration for those days had been in accordance with the applicable regulations. The expert also noted that the applicants could not claim any compensation for unused annual leave as they were still working at the company and such leave was only payable at the end of a contract. 17. The applicants raised a number of objections to the expert report. They stated that the timekeeping records used for the calculation did not reflect the actual hours worked as they were unofficial copies kept by the employer, which were not signed by employees. In that regard, the applicants submitted that they had worked for more hours than established by the expert. They requested that the court take other evidence into account, including the defendant employer’s shift orders, which detailed who would work when and for how long, as well as reports from the Regional Labour Inspectorate. They also submitted that the deduction of three hours of rest per day was not based on fact but was an assumption by the expert. The applicants submitted that in any event the expert’s hypothetical conclusion on rest periods could not be relied on because the collective agreement had expressly provided for the inclusion of such periods as a part of working time. The applicants raised no objections to the expert’s conclusion on the dismissal of their claims for pay for work at the weekend and on public holidays and for unused annual leave. 18. In submissions of 22 July 2004, the defendant employer raised objections to the expert report and also argued that the timekeeping documents could not be relied on as they were unofficial copies. It also maintained that it had been unable to pay overtime in full owing to a lack of funds from the State. It submitted that the applicants had in any event been aware of the working arrangements and had never requested a transfer to another unit of the General Directorate of Monopolies. 19. The İzmir Labour Court asked the expert to supplement his report with findings concerning the parties’ objections. 20. On 4 July 2005, the expert submitted a supplement to his report, in which he corrected his findings concerning the rest periods in the light of the applicants’ objection and calculated the hours they had worked as twenty-four in the course of a twenty-four-hour shift. He maintained his findings regarding the timesheets, submitting that his in situ examination of the workplace and comparisons between the official record and the employer’s copies had not revealed any inconsistencies. 21. On 12 September 2005 the İzmir Labour Court found in favour of the applicants in part and awarded them the amounts given in the expert’s report in respect of the unpaid overtime. It rejected their claims for pay for weekend and public holiday work and for unused annual leave. 22. Both parties appealed to the Court of Cassation. 23. On 17 April 2006 the Court of Cassation quashed the decision and remitted the case. It found that the Labour Court had not taken into account any time that could have been used for rest periods and that therefore the calculation of overtime could not be deemed accurate. It also stated that the overtime calculation should be based on weekly working hours rather than the monthly working time used in the expert report. 24. In the resumed proceedings, the İzmir Labour Court requested that the expert amend the report in light of the Court of Cassation’s decision. 25. On 11 September 2007 the expert revised the findings as ordered and concluded that the applicants were likely to have had a minimum of three hours for rest during a twenty-four-hour shift. The expert therefore recalculated their entitlement to overtime on the basis of twenty-one hours of actual work and compared it with the legal working week of fortyfive hours. 26. On 26 May 2008 the İzmir Labour Court awarded the applicants compensation for overtime as determined in the revised expert report. 27. The defendant employer appealed, arguing that the presumption established in the case-law of the Court of Cassation that a person could not work more than fourteen hours in the course of a twenty-four-hour shift should be applied to the facts of the dispute. The Court of Cassation then quashed the first-instance judgment on 28 October 2008 and remitted the case on the following grounds: “It can be seen from the case file that during the summer months [the applicants] worked for 24 hours and subsequently rested for 24 hours; and in the winter months they worked for 24 hours and subsequently rested for 48 hours. However, as determined by the well-established case-law of the Grand Chamber of the Court of Cassation’s Civil Division, in workplaces where there are 24-hour shifts, after the deduction of time spent on certain activities such as resting, eating and fulfilling other needs, a person can only work for 14 hours a day ... This approach must also be followed in the present case.” 28. In the resumed proceedings, the İzmir Labour Court decided to follow the decision of the Court of Cassation and another expert report was drawn up for that purpose. The report, dated 21 July 2009, calculated the applicants’ daily working time as fourteen hours, in line with the Court of Cassation’s presumption of fact. The calculation in the new report led to no overtime being found for the weeks in which the applicants had worked three days as the working time was less than the legal limit of forty-five hours. For the weeks in which the applicants had worked four days, the report calculated the total working time as fifty-six hours, leading to an assessment in the report of nine hours of overtime. On 28 December 2009 the İzmir Labour Court rendered a final judgment in the applicants’ case, based on the expert report of 21 July 2009. As a result of that interpretation, some of the applicants’ claims were dismissed entirely, while the others were awarded almost ninety percent less than the previous expert report had calculated. 29. On 25 January 2010 the applicants appealed against the decision and maintained that the fact that they had worked continuously for twenty-four hours had already been confirmed by the legal records of the Ministry of Labour, both parties’ witness statements and other evidence in the file, including the expert reports overturned by the Court of Cassation. Although they had proven that fact, the judgment had been based on the presumption that working for more than fourteen hours a day was physically impossible. 30. On 18 March 2010 the Court of Cassation upheld the İzmir Labour Court’s decision without responding to the applicants’ objections.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

The applicant, Mr Anzor Chadidovich Chentiev, is a Russian national of Chechen ethnic origin. He was born in 1983 and is detained in Leopoldov prison. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs M. Pirošíková. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicant arrived illegally in Slovakia from Ukraine in January 2006. He unsuccessfully applied for asylum. The Slovak authorities found that his extradition to the Russian Federation for the purpose of his criminal prosecution there was admissible. 4. On 14 September 2010 the Court declared inadmissible application no. 21022/08 in which the applicant complained that his extradition to the Russian Federation would amount to a breach of his rights under Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention and under Article 1 of Protocol No. 6. 5. On 12 November 2010 the applicant lodged a new application with the same subject-matter as application no. 21022/08 while relying on additional facts. In parallel the applicant filed a fresh asylum request with reference to those facts. 6. On 15 December 2010 the President of the Fourth Section to which the case had been allocated decided to indicate to the respondent Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that the applicant should not been extradited to the Russian Federation. On 23 November 2010 the Court (Fourth Section) decided to prolong under further notice that interim measure. 7. On 21 February 2012 the Court decided to give notice of the application to the Government of Slovakia and to invite the Government to submit written observations on the complaints that the applicant’s extradition to the Russian Federation would amount to a breach of his rights under Articles 3 and 6 of the Convention. The Chamber declared the remainder of the application inadmissible. 8. As regards the domestic proceedings on his fresh asylum request, the Bratislava Regional Court, in a judgment of 21 November 2013, dismissed the applicant’s action against the decision given by the Ministry of the Interior. 9. The applicant filed an appeal through his legal representative. 10. In two letters of 6 February 2014 the applicant informed the Regional Court that he had terminated the authority of his representative and withdrawn his action for review of the administrative decisions on his asylum request. 11. On 13 March 2014 the Supreme Court discontinued the proceedings on that ground without addressing the merits of the case. 12. In the meantime, on 11 February 2014, the applicant informed the Court that he no longer wished to pursue the application and that he had petitioned for the domestic proceedings to be discontinued. The respondent Government confirmed that information. 13. On 18 March 2014 the Court reconsidered the application in the light of the information submitted by the parties and decided to lift the interim measure under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court previously indicated in respect of the applicant. 14. In a letter which was delivered on 1 April 2014 the applicant informed the Court that he and his family were threatened by Russian authorities in order to make him return to Russia voluntarily.

In 2002 she had recourse to assisted reproduction techniques, undergoing in vitro fertilisation (“IVF”) treatment with her partner at the Centre for reproductive medicine at the European Hospital (“the centre”) in Rome. The five embryos obtained from the IVF treatment were placed in cryopreservation. 13. Before the embryos could be implanted the applicant’s partner died, on 12 November 2003, in a bomb attack in Nasiriya (Irak) while he was reporting on the war. 14. After deciding not to have the embryos implanted, the applicant sought to donate them to scientific research and thus contribute to promoting advances in treatment for diseases that are difficult to cure. 15. According to the information provided at the hearing before the Grand Chamber, the applicant made a number of unsuccessful verbal requests for release of the embryos at the centre where they were being stored. 16. In a letter of 14 December 2011 the applicant asked the director of the centre to release the five cryopreserved embryos so that they could be used for stem-cell research. The director refused to comply with her request on the grounds that this type of research was banned and punishable as a criminal offence in Italy under section 13 of Law no. 40 of 19 February 2004 (“Law no. 40/2004”). 17. The embryos in question are currently stored in the cryogenic storage bank at the centre where the IVF treatment was carried out.",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0

The applicant, Mr A.M., is a Syrian national of Kurdish origin, who was born in 1993 and lives in Geneva. The President granted the applicant’s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4 of the Rules of Court). The applicant was represented before the Court by Mr B. Wijkstrom, a lawyer practising in Geneva. 3. The applicant arrived in Italy on an unknown date. His fingerprints were recorded in the EURODAC system on 17 December 2012. On 29 December 2012 the applicant entered Switzerland from Italy and sought asylum the same day. Soon after reaching Geneva, the applicant started to suffer from mental illness. 4. The applicant’s sister had arrived in Switzerland on 19 December 2012, had applied for asylum and had received a temporary permit which entitled her to remain on Swiss territory for the duration of her own asylum application. She was married to a man who had been granted temporary refugee status. 5. On 17 January 2013, the Swiss Federal Migration Office (“FMO”) requested that its Italian counterparts take charge of the applicant’s asylum request, pursuant to Article 10 § 1 of Regulation no. 343/2003/EC (the “Dublin Regulation”). On 21 February 2013, the Italian immigration authorities explicitly accepted the FMO’s request. On 22 February 2013, the applicant’s asylum request was rejected by the FMO on the basis of the fact that he had entered Switzerland from another “Dublin” State. The FMO refused the application of the humanitarian clause provided for in § 15 of the Dublin Regulation. 6. On 24 April 2013, the applicant was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and back pain. He was put on a course of weekly psychiatric sessions and was given an anti-depressant (Zoloft, 50mg/day). According to the medical report, the stabilization of his psychological and social environment was a precondition for the successful outcome of the applicant’s therapy. According to a subsequent medical report, dated 6 June 2013, the applicant showed some risk of self-harm, which could go as far as suicide if he were returned to Italy, where he had been allegedly abused by the police. The report clearly stated, however, that the applicant’s death thoughts were passive and did not disclose any concrete plan (“sans projet concret”). 7. The applicant appealed against the decision of the FMO to the Federal Administrative Court. The appeal was rejected on 28 May 2013. 8. The relevant domestic law is set out in the Court’s judgment in the case of Tarakhel v. Switzerland ([GC], no. 29217/12, §§ 22-23 and 26-27, 4 November 2014). 9. The relevant instruments and principles of European Union law are set out in the same judgment (§§ 28-36). 10. In particular, the Court recalls that the Dublin Regulation is applicable to Switzerland under the terms of the association agreement of 26 October 2004 between the Swiss Confederation and the European Community regarding criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland (OJ L 53 of 27 February 2008). The Dublin Regulation was recently replaced by Regulation (EU) No. 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 (the “Dublin III Regulation”), which is designed to make the Dublin system more effective and to strengthen the legal safeguards for persons subject to the Dublin procedure. 11. The Dublin III Regulation entered into force on 1 January 2014 and was passed into law by the Swiss Federal Council on 7 March 2014. 12. A detailed description of the asylum procedure and the legal framework and organisation of the reception system for asylum seekers in Italy is also set out in the Tarakhel judgment (§§ 36-50).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano;Yonko Grozev;Ksenija Turković,"10. The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Budapest. 11. He had been employed as a police officer when, having reached an age when he was entitled to do so, he took early retirement and started receiving a “service pension” (szolgálati nyugdíj) from 1 January 2000, when he was nearly 47 years old. The applicant, however, continued to work: he was employed in the private sector between 2000 and 2012 and from 1 July 2012 until 31 March 2015 he worked, as a civil servant, as the head of the Road Maintenance Department of the Budapest XIII District Municipality. The applicant paid the statutory contributions to the State old-age pension scheme from the first day of his employment (1 August 1973) until 31 March 2015. 12. On 28 November 2011 Parliament enacted Act no. CLXVII, which entered into force on 1 January 2012. According to section 5(1) of that law, service pensions like that of the applicant were converted into a “service allowance” (szolgálati járandóság), provided that the person concerned was born in or after 1955. Pursuant to section 3(2)(b) of the same Act, for recipients of a service pension who, like the applicant, were born in or before 1954, the service pension was to be converted into an old-age pension. 13. On 1 January 2013 an amendment to Act no. LXXXI of 1997 on Social-Security Pensions (hereafter “the 1997 Pensions Act”) entered into force, according to which the disbursement of those old-age pensions whose beneficiaries were simultaneously employed in certain categories within the civil service would be suspended from 1 July 2013 onwards for the duration of their employment (see also paragraphs 23-28 below). No such restriction was put in place in respect of those who were in receipt of an old-age pension while being employed within the private sector. 14. On 18 February 2013 the National Pensions Administration (Országos Nyugdíjbiztosítási Főigazgatóság) sent a letter to the applicant in his capacity as the recipient of an old-age pension, informing him of the amended legislation and instructing him to make a declaration as to whether he was employed in the civil service, in one of the categories concerned by the amendment of 1 January 2013. By a letter of 29 April 2013 the applicant notified the National Pensions Administration of his employment situation. Subsequently, on 2 July 2013, the National Pensions Administration informed the applicant that the disbursement of his pension had been suspended as of 1 July 2013. At that time his pension amounted to 162,260 Hungarian forints (HUF; at that time approximately 550 euros (EUR)) per month. 15. On 15 July 2013 the applicant lodged an administrative appeal with the National Pensions Administration (see paragraph 21 below) against the suspension of his pension payments in which he argued that his pension constituted an acquired right and that he was being discriminated against since pensioners working in the private sector continued to receive their pensions. 16. The National Pensions Administration sought further information from the applicant on 23 July 2013. The applicant elaborated on his appeal on 1 August 2013, referring, inter alia, to an application filed by the Ombudsman with the Constitutional Court in May 2013 (AJB-726/2013). In that application the Ombudsman set out the complaints which had been made to his Office about the amendment of the 1997 Pensions Act and raised the issue of a difference in treatment between pensioners employed in the civil service and those employed in the private sector. As far as the Court is aware, this case is currently still pending before the Constitutional Court. 17. On 27 September 2013 the National Pensions Administration discontinued the proceedings concerning the applicant’s appeal, holding that the applicant had failed to provide the information sought from him on 23 July 2013. 18. The applicant’s employment with the Budapest XIII District Municipality came to an end on 31 March 2015. On 24 April 2015 the competent authority decided that the disbursement of his pension would be resumed. His pension was increased to HUF 177,705 (at that time approximately EUR 585).",[],[],[],"['14', 'P1']",['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0
169,001-163473,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,CUSACK v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Aleš Pejchal;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano,"1. The applicant, Mr Patrick Joseph Cusack, is a British national, who was born in 1938 and lives in Harrow. 2 3. In December 1969 the applicant’s parents purchased a property, including a building and a forecourt, in Harrow. Around the same time the applicant began to practise as a solicitor from that property. He, and those visiting his office, have used the forecourt for parking their cars ever since. In order to park a car there, it is necessary to cross the pavement situated between the property and the adjacent road. 4. In the late 1990s or early 2000s the local authority constructed an uncontrolled pedestrian crossing outside the property. Such a crossing consists of a raised pedestrian refuge in the middle of the road and lowered pavements, with studded surfaces, on both sides of the road. The applicant, and other individuals visiting his office, continued to park vehicles on the forecourt. 5. In April 2008 a local authority employee, accompanied by a police constable, visited the property to request the applicant to remove the cars on the forecourt. Correspondence between the applicant and the local authority ensued, in the course of which the local authority indicated that it was considering erecting bollards to prevent vehicles accessing the forecourt. 6. If the bollards were erected, the applicant and his clients would no longer be able to use the forecourt as a car park. On 17 March 2009 the applicant therefore lodged a claim for injunctive relief in the County Court seeking to prevent the local authority from erecting bollards. On 13 August 2009 the local authority informed him that it proposed to rely on section 80 of the Highways Act 1980 (“the Act” – see paragraph 29 below) which provides in relevant part that a highway authority, in the present case a function performed by the local authority, may erect fences or posts to prevent access to highways which it maintains (see paragraphs 28 to 30 below, for information about what comprises a highway). It does not require the payment of compensation to anyone who suffers damage in the exercise of the relevant powers. 7. On 9 September 2009 the local authority lodged its defence to the claim, which confirmed its reliance on section 80 of the Act. In the alternative it relied on section 66 of the Act (see paragraph 28 below), which provides that a highway authority may provide such “highway furniture” as it thinks necessary to safeguard individuals using the highway. Section 66 requires the payment of compensation to anyone who suffers damage in the exercise of the relevant powers. 8. On 4 March 2010 the County Court refused the applicant’s claim. It decided that he had been exercising a frontager’s right in order to park on his forecourt. Frontagers’ rights included a right for the owner of a property adjacent to the highway to access that highway from any part of his property. It found that the local authority was able to interfere with that right under section 80 of the Act. The court decided that it did not have jurisdiction either to “read-down” legislation so as to ensure its compatibility with the Convention, under the Human Rights Act 1998, or to make a declaration of incompatibility (see paragraph 31 below) and therefore it did not consider the applicant’s human rights arguments. 9. The applicant appealed to the High Court. On 7 March 2011 the High Court rejected the applicant’s appeal. It found that section 80 of the Act applied to his case, none of the exceptions in that section were relevant and there were no other reasons to prevent the local authority from relying on it. 10. The court accepted that the local authority could also have acted under section 66 of the Act. However, it decided, applying Ching Garage Ltd v. Chingford Corporation (see paragraph 33 below), that the local authority owed a duty to its taxpayers to select a provision not requiring compensation if one was available. The local authority could therefore not be criticised for selecting section 80 of the Act. The court rejected the applicant’s argument that section 80 of the Act should be interpreted under section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (see paragraph 31 below) either to exclude its application to private rights of access generally, or frontagers’ rights in particular, or to include a right to compensation. It was Parliament’s clear intention that private rights of access, including frontagers’ rights, were to be included and it was a necessary inference that it had intended to exclude compensation. 11. The High Court decided that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 could not have assisted the applicant in any event. It observed that the applicant would not lose his property. He would lose only one aspect of his right of access to that property, namely vehicular access. His case fell under the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, that is the control of property. It found, pursuant to Baner v. Sweden, no. 11763/85, Commission decision of 9 March 1989, Decisions and Reports 60-A, p. 128, that a property owner was not guaranteed compensation in such circumstances and observed that the Commission had decided that a measure affecting and re-defining rights of property owners would not normally be considered an expropriation even if some aspects of the right were interfered with or even taken away. The court found that a wide margin of appreciation was accorded to Parliament as regards the second paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. 12. The High Court found that Parliament had “plainly” decided that section 80 of the Act was necessary in the general interest. It would not be possible to predict the wide variety of factual situations with which a highway authority might be confronted and in which it might think it necessary to take action in the public interest. There was nothing wrong in granting highway authorities a wide power to obstruct access to highways should the need arise. Parliament would have known that actions taken by a highway authority would be amenable to judicial review if they were “Wednesbury unreasonable”, that is to say if the decision to take them was so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it. 13. It found that sections of the pavement where the kerb had been lowered so as to be at the level of the highway, and for which planning permission had been granted, were specifically excluded from the operation of section 80 of the Act. A proposal to interfere with such a crossing under section 80 would almost certainly be found to be unreasonable. 14. The High Court then considered the applicant’s circumstances, stating in relevant part: “53 ... Public safety considerations do in my view warrant the course that [the local authority] proposes to take. I have taken into account the points made by Mr Cusack in this regard, including that there have not yet been any accidents; but in my view there is a significant risk of an accident in future if access to the front of No. 66 remains as it is. Station Road is a very busy single carriageway road. In my view it would require skilled experienced driving to mount and drive over the kerb onto the forecourt, or reverse back over the pavement down the kerb and back onto the road surface while avoiding the nearby island. I am happy to accept that Mr Cusack has acquired the necessary skills, but there is no guarantee that all of his staff and clients using the forecourt will have done so. In my view there is a danger of road traffic accidents involving vehicles if things remain as they are. There is also the obvious risk of damage to the pavement, creating tripping hazards. Moreover, given the character of the road and the proximity of the pedestrian road crossing, it is reasonable to suppose that the pavement in the immediate vicinity of No. 66 is quite widely used by pedestrians, and in my view the present arrangements present a potential danger to them as well. The fact that a dropped kerb constructed specifically to allow pedestrians to walk onto and from the road crossing is being used by cars as a means of easier access to the forecourt of No.66 serves to emphasise the point. ... 55 ... In my view there is no substance in the assertion that [the local authority] had not referred to road safety issues before proceedings were commenced or that they are acting in bad faith by doing so now. 56 I turn to the argument that there is no evidence to support [the local authority’s] road safety arguments. In my view there is in fact some evidence ..., but this is principally a matter for my judgment based on the evidence which is available of the layout and traffic conditions of Station Road itself, the forecourt to no. 66, and the pedestrian crossing and dropped kerb associated with it ...” 15. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal. On 7 December 2011 the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court’s judgment. Lord Justice Lewison, with whom the other judges agreed, applied the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant, which he interpreted to mean that where there is a general provision and a more specific provision, and a course of action could potentially fall within both, the court will usually interpret the general provision as not covering matters covered by the specific provision. Lord Justice Lewison decided that the local authority should have relied on section 16. As regards the applicant’s argument that the local authority could have imposed conditions on the exercise of his right of access, Lord Justice Lewison decided that the imposition of conditions would not have resulted in a satisfactory solution because the local authority had formed the view that all vehicle movements into and out of the applicant’s forecourt posed a risk to pedestrians. Furthermore, the applicant had not raised the argument in the courts below. 17. In case he was wrong about section 66 of the Act, Lord Justice Lewison also considered the applicant’s Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 submissions. He decided that the case should be considered as a control of use. He noted that this Court afforded national legislatures a wide margin of appreciation when a case involved a control of use and would respect their decision unless it was manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable. He observed that, pursuant to J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 44302/02, ECHR 2007III, no presumption existed that compensation had to be paid and its absence did not mean that a decision was disproportionate. The transfer of a title to land from one individual to another in that case was far more draconian than the applicant being prevented from accessing his property by vehicle. He concluded that section 80 was compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. If that was the case, the local authority’s reliance on that section had also been compatible with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. 18. The local authority appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court. On 19 June 2013 the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision. 19. Lord Carnwath, with whom the other justices of the Supreme Court agreed, decided that the maxim generalia specialibus non derogant did not apply because neither section 80 nor section 66 of the Act could be regarded as more specific or less general than the other. Whilst section 66 of the Act was directed towards a specific purpose, that is “safeguarding persons using the highway”, the powers available under it were defined in relatively wide terms. Although section 80 of the Act did not explicitly mention safety as a purpose, it was implicit that the section must be used for purposes related to those of the Act, one of which was safety of the highway. The powers in that section were expressed in narrower terms and related specifically to the prevention of access to an existing or future highway. 20. Lord Carnwath found that various other provisions illustrated the wide array of overlapping powers available under the Act but otherwise were not relevant. He also noted that in Ching Garage Ltd (see paragraph 33 below) the local authority had, as in the applicant’s case, been confused as to the appropriate statutory source of its power to act but that the House of Lords had not been concerned by the overlap of statutory provisions. 21. Lord Carnwath analysed the legislative history of both section 66 and section 80 of the Act. He acknowledged that the Act was a consolidating statute, that is to say it brought under one Act of Parliament existing provisions whose origins lay in various other Acts of Parliament. In relation to section 80, he traced its history back to a provision enacted in 1935 and noted that that provision had been amended in 1947 to prohibit its use where it would obstruct any means of access for which planning permission had been granted. Accordingly, section 80 continued to provide specific protection for means of access formed since 1947 if authorised by planning permission. He also considered the relevance of planning immunity, that is to say when breaches of domestic planning controls become immune from enforcement by the domestic authorities. Whilst doing so, he noted that the applicant’s use of his property as an office and the laying out of a means of access to that property had both been breaches of planning controls but that both breaches had long since become immune from enforcement. However, Parliament had subsequently approved legislative proposals that did not give breaches which had become immune from enforcement the same status as developments for which planning permission had been granted. The protection provided in section 80 of the Act to means of access authorised by planning permission did not extend to use of accesses which had been created in violation of the planning laws but which had become immune. As regards the applicant’s concern that the powers provided under section 80 might be abused, for example to avoid protections under section 66 of the Act, an individual could bring a judicial review claim. Lord Carnwath concluded that the local authority had been entitled to rely on section 80 of the Act. 22. He then proceeded to consider the implications of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He rejected the applicant’s argument that removal of vehicular access would amount to a deprivation of a possession. He found that it was clearly a control of property. He set out the necessary steps in the assessment of compliance with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, namely: “(i) whether there was an interference with the peaceful enjoyment of ‘possessions’; (ii) whether the interference was ‘in the general interest’; (iii) whether the interference was ‘provided for by law’; and (iv) proportionality of the interference.” 23. He found that Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not impose any general requirement of compensation in cases falling within the second paragraph of that Article. He noted that in J.A. Pye (Oxford) Ltd and J.A. Pye (Oxford) Land Ltd v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 83, the Court had decided that absence of compensation might nevertheless be relevant to the issue of proportionality. 24. He decided that proportionality required a broad judgment as to what was a fair balance and was not confined to irrationality or “Wednesbury unreasonableness”. The issue was not whether the council’s action was an abuse of its powers but whether a fair balance had been struck between the competing general and individual interests. The applicant had not challenged the compatibility of section 80 with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as such. As a result, the mere fact that another statutory route with compensation was available did not lead to a conclusion that relying on section 80 of the Act was disproportionate. 25. Lord Carnwath continued: “49. The question must however be answered principally by reference to the balance drawn by section 80 itself, allowing for the wide margin of appreciation allowed to the national authorities. It is in my view significant that the legislature did not adopt my recommendation that all immune uses and operations should be treated generally as though subject to planning permission, apart from the three cases specified in the section. There may be room for argument as to where the line in section 80 should have been drawn, but the compatibility of the section is not the issue. Given the availability of the power as a legitimate means of controlling use of a private access in the public interest, its use in the present circumstances was in my view neither an abuse of the council’s powers nor outside the boundaries of the discretion allowed by the Convention.” 26. Lord Neuberger agreed with Lord Carnwath’s statement in Ching Garage Ltd (see paragraph 33 below) that if a local authority could do what they wanted to do without paying compensation they should take that approach, Lord Neuberger decided that where two separate statutory provisions applied the local authority could rely on either provision provided that it was reasonable to do so in all the circumstances. 27. In relation to Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, Lord Neuberger agreed that there had been no deprivation of property. Because the disadvantage suffered by the applicant fell within control of possessions, he could not see how the local authority’s reliance on section 80 could violate Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. He noted that there was no general right to compensation where control of possessions was in issue but accepted that that was not decisive for proportionality. It was also necessary to consider whether the exceptions to section 80, and the fact that the applicant’s case did not fall within them, were arbitrary. He decided that the distinction between cases subject to planning permission and those immune from enforcement was narrow but because it definitely existed, and had long done so, was not arbitrary. Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 did not require that where the State sought to control property and was able to do so under two different provisions it should choose the one which provided for compensation, except if special facts existed which require it. 28. Section 66 of the Highways Act 1980, which falls under the crossheading “Safety Provisions”, sets out the duties of the highway authority in relation to the provision of footways and the powers available to it to maintain in a footway such “furniture” as they consider necessary to safeguard pedestrians. In relevant part it states: “(2) A highway authority may provide and maintain in a highway maintainable at the public expense by them which consists of or comprises a carriageway, such raised paving, pillars, walls, rails or fences as they think necessary for the purpose of safeguarding persons using the highway. ... (8) A highway authority or council shall pay compensation to any person who sustains damage by reason of the execution by them of works under subsection (2) or (3) above.” 29. Section 80, which falls under cross-heading, “Fences and Boundaries”, provides that a highway authority may erect fences or posts to prevent access to a highway. In relevant part it reads: “(1) Subject to the provisions of this section, a highway authority may erect and maintain fences or posts for the purpose of preventing access to— (a) a highway maintainable at the public expense by them, ... (3) The powers conferred by this section shall not be exercised so as to— (a) interfere with a fence or gate required for the purpose of agriculture; or (b) obstruct a public right of way; or (c) obstruct any means of access for the construction, formation or laying out of which planning permission has been granted under Part III of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 ... or (d) obstruct any means of access which was constructed, formed or laid out before 1st July 1948 ...” 30. Section 329 of the Act provides inter alia that “carriageway” means a way constituting or comprised in a highway over which the public has a right of way for the passage of vehicles and that “footway” means a way comprised in a highway which also comprises a carriageway and over which the public have a right of way on foot only. 31. Section 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (“the Human Rights Act”) provides: “(1) So far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights ...” Section 4 of the Human Rights Act provides: “(1) Subsection (2) applies in any proceedings in which a court determines whether a provision of primary legislation is compatible with a Convention right. (2) If the court is satisfied that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of that incompatibility.” 32. Section 6(1) of the Human Rights Act provides that it is unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. 33. In Ching Garage Ltd v Chingford Corporation [1961] 1 All E.R. 671, the House of Lords was asked whether a highway authority had the power to obstruct a means of access from a privately owned garage to a road junction. Lord Radcliffe stated that: “If they can do what they want to without having to pay compensation, they have no business to use public funds in paying over money to an objector who is not entitled to it.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
170,001-146890,ENG,GEO,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,GORGADZE v. GEORGIA,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Mr Merab Gorgadze, is a Georgian national, who was born in 1977 and lives in Batumi. He was represented before the Court by Mr L. Mamuladze, a lawyer practising in Batumi. The Georgian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr L. Meskhoradze of the Ministry of Justice. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant and according to the case file, may be summarised as follows. 3. On 5 July 2009 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of unlawful purchase, possession and sale of drugs. According to the record of his personal search, nine sachets containing a brownish substance were found in the right back pocket of his trousers. The search was carried out on the spot by two police officers, who rejected the applicant’s request for the attendance of independent witnesses, reasoning that there was a risk of him hiding or destroying the evidence. The applicant refused to sign the search record and specified that he had had no drugs on him. 4. According to the arrest report, which was drawn up immediately after the search, the applicant had multiple injuries on his body and face. When asked about the source of the injuries, the applicant, as noted in the report, claimed that he had fallen to the ground when running away from the police officers. 5. Later, after his transfer to the police station, an ambulance was called for the applicant. A doctor on duty conducted a visual examination and noted that the applicant had a hematoma on his left eye and several bruises on his chest. 6. On 6 July 2009 in prison the applicant was seen by a prosecutor. In the presence of his lawyer, the applicant complained that he had been severely beaten by police officers immediately after his arrest and also at the police station. A special note was drawn up detailing the applicant’s allegations, including the chain of events, the time, location, duration and methods of his ill-treatment. The applicant alleged that he had been threatened with rape. 7. The next day, the police officers who had arrested the applicant conducted an examination of the place of his arrest and concluded that the surface was uneven, with lots of rocks and holes. 8. On 17 November 2009 the Batumi City Court, whilst dropping the drug-dealing charges, convicted the applicant for unlawful possession of drugs in a particularly large quantity and sentenced him to eleven years’ imprisonment and a fine. By a decision of 21 January 2010 the Kutaisi Court of Appeal upheld the applicant’s conviction in full. Like the trial court, the appeal court, based its conclusions on the statements of the two police officers who had arrested the applicant and conducted his personal search. Both instances concluded that the applicant’s injuries had been the result of him having fallen several times during his attempt to escape. 9. On 17 March 2010 the Supreme Court of Georgia rejected an appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. As it appears from the case file, despite his complaints, no criminal proceedings have been instituted into the circumstances of the applicant’s alleged ill-treatment. 10. On 11 July 2013 the application was communicated to the respondent Government. An information note, in Georgian, on the proceedings after communication of an application was forwarded at the same time to the applicant. It included the information that the nature of all friendly settlement negotiations was strictly confidential. On 29 November 2013 the Government submitted a friendly-settlement proposal within the framework of the proceedings before the Court, and on 3 December 2013 the Court sent the Government’s proposal to the applicant. 11. By their letter of 11 April 2014 the Government informed the Court that the applicant had disclosed the details of the friendly-settlement negotiations conducted between the parties to the media, in violation of the confidentiality rule as enshrined in Rule 62 § 2 of the Rules of Court. They accordingly invited the Court to declare the application inadmissible. 12. In their letter the Government referred the Court to an interview of the applicant published by the news agency Reportiori on 8 April 2014. In that interview the applicant provided a brief factual summary of his case and disclosed the specific amount proposed by the Government with a view to securing a friendly settlement. He further claimed that his refusal to accept the compensation offered had “irritated the Minister of Justice, following which they have sent to Strasbourg documents with distorted facts.” 13. It appears that even before that date, on 29 January 2014, another media source – news portal Kvira, published another interview with the applicant in which the latter likewise discussed the Government’s friendlysettlement proposal and referred to the specific amount proposed by the Government. The article was accompanied by scanned copies of the relevant letters from the Court.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
171,001-142833,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,MOHAMED HUSSEIN v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"1. The applicant, Mr Saleh Mohamed Hussein, claims that he is a Somali national, who was born in 1986 and is currently residing in the Netherlands. He was represented before the Court by Mr J.W.F. Noot, a lawyer practising in Dordrecht. 2. The Dutch Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. Böcker, and Deputy Agent, Ms L. Egmond, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant applied for asylum in the Netherlands on 27 October 2009, claiming that he hailed from Mogadishu, Somalia and belonged to the minority Reer Hamar population group and the Ashraf clan. When he was three years old, he and his family had moved to Saudi Arabia where he had resided illegally. In 2009, the Saudi Arabian authorities had expelled the applicant to Mogadishu. His mother had accompanied him because he did not know anybody in Mogadishu. They had moved in with an uncle of the applicant’s. As the applicant was unknown to most neighbours, he had been suspected of involvement in al-Shabaab. The applicant had been abducted by some neighbours. After a ransom had been paid by his family he had been released and he had fled the country. He feared that, upon return to Somalia, he would fall victim to human rights violations by one of the warring factions there. He also claimed that, as a member of a minority clan, he had a higher risk of falling victim to human rights violations. 5. By decision of 15 July 2010 the Minister of Justice (minister van Justitie) rejected the asylum application, considering that the applicant’s account lacked credibility. The Minister held that the applicant had failed to establish his nationality and identity. The applicant had been unable to describe how he had been identified as a Somali national by the Somali consular authorities in Saudi Arabia. In this respect it was noted that the applicant had stated that the only Somali words he knew were ‘hello’ and ‘good afternoon’. He had further claimed that the conversation with the consular authorities had been conducted in Arabic. It was thus considered implausible that the consular authorities had been able to determine the Somali origins of the applicant. He had further been unable to describe the airports in Jeddah and Mogadishu. 6. The Minister further disbelieved the account of the applicant’s departure from Mogadishu. The applicant had claimed that he had been on a direct flight from Mogadishu to Nairobi, Kenya. However, according to country of origin information all flights from Mogadishu to Nairobi had to make a safety stop at Wajir, Kenya. The applicant had not mentioned this stop. 7. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed by the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague sitting in Middelburg on 26 May 2011. His further and final appeal was dismissed on summary grounds by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State) on 29 August 2012. 8. On 26 September 2012, a report of a linguistic analysis of the applicant’s speech concluded that he spoke deficient Somali with a Reer Hamar accent; that Somali was not his first or dominant language; and that he had grown up in a diaspora community where (Reer Hamar) Somali was spoken.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

LITHUANIA,4,No violation of Article 6+6-2 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Fair hearing) (Article 6 - Right to a fair trial;Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Iulia Motoc;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Marko Bošnjak;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Skuodas. He worked as a traffic police officer in the Skuodas Region. 6. On 7 November 2007, at around 2 p.m., three ten-year-old children were hit by a car in the village of Aleksandrija in the Skuodas Region. Two of the children died at the scene and the third died later that day in hospital. The car left the scene of the crash immediately. A criminal investigation was opened the same day. 7. The following morning, at around 7 a.m., the applicant turned himself in to the police and confessed that he had been driving the car. The applicant submitted that he had not drunk any alcohol before the accident and that he was unable to give the exact speed he had been going. He stated that he had seen a group of children walking in front of him and “had briefly lost control of the car”, the car had gone off the road and “hit something”. The applicant submitted that he did not remember hitting the children “because everything had happened very fast”. Nor did he remember anything that had happened after the accident because he “had been in shock”. He stated that the only thing he remembered was waking up in a summer house the morning after the accident, after which he had gone to the police to confess. 8. On the same day the applicant was served with an official notice that he was suspected of a breach of road traffic safety regulations which had resulted in the death of other persons (Article 281 § 5 of the Criminal Code) and of a failure to provide assistance to persons in a life-threatening situation (Article 144 of the Criminal Code). He was detained on remand and suspended from his post as a police officer. 9. The accident attracted considerable media attention. On 8 November 2007 one of the biggest national newspapers, Lietuvos rytas, published an article entitled “A police officer’s BMW crushed fourthgraders” (Policijos patrulio BMW traiškė ketvirtokus). The article stated that it was “suspected that the car was being driven by the police officer S. Paulikas” because the car belonged to his mother. It published interviews with several of the village’s residents, who described the details of the accident and alleged that the applicant may have been drunk. The article also mentioned that two years previously another police officer had caused a traffic accident in the Skuodas Region in which two children had received fatal injuries, but that the criminal proceedings against the officer had been discontinued. 10. On the same day the website of Lietuvos rytas carried an article headlined “After horrific accident in Skuodas Region [the Minister of the Interior] suggests [the Police Commissioner General] should resign”. It quoted a statement made by the Minister: “Apologies will not suffice. The chief of the police must assume personal responsibility for this terrible incident. Especially as this was not the first time that police officers, who are supposed to stop traffic violations, have themselves caused terrible accidents. If I do not receive any reaction from the police chief, I believe that further efforts to improve the work of the police will be impossible and I will be ready to step down myself.” The Police Commissioner General told journalists that he “accepted responsibility” because “the chief is responsible for what happens in the police organisation”. However, he expressed doubts whether “every such incident” should lead to the resignation of senior police officers. The article also quoted the President’s spokesperson as questioning “how many more victims of the war on the roads will it take for politicians and State officials to finally notice and start solving the problems on the roads”. The article stated that the President was awaiting a response from the Ministry of the Interior and from the police on whether they had been making sufficient efforts to create “an atmosphere of absolute intolerance” for officers and public officials who abused intoxicating substances. 11. On 9 November 2007 Lietuvos rytas published a photograph of the applicant on its front page, with a caption reading “the man who caused the horrific accident (kraupios avarijos kaltininkas), S. Paulikas, turned himself in only after it was no longer possible to detect if he had been driving while drunk”. It also published an article entitled “Both [the Police Commissioner General] and [the Minister of the Interior] must resign”, providing comments from the leaders of the main political parties about who should take political responsibility for the accident and for the “ineffective road traffic safety policy”. That day and the day after Lietuvos rytas published details of over a dozen traffic accidents which had been caused by police officers since 2000, where it had been suspected that the officers had driven while being drunk and where people had been killed or seriously injured but the officers had received mild sentences or had escaped criminal liability altogether. 12. On 12 November 2007 the Police Commissioner General and the Minister of the Interior resigned. In an official statement issued on the same day, the President of Lithuania stated: “Over the past few days the whole of Lithuania has shared the pain of [the three families] who lost their children in an accident caused by a police officer. The seventh of November was not only the day of their tragedy but also reflected a serious crisis within the police force. The tragedy in the Skuodas Region emphasised the problems ingrained in the system of interior affairs and further diminished public trust in the police. The loss of children’s lives, the crime committed by an officer and its circumstances require clear answers why that happened, and determined solutions. It is intolerable that crimes committed by officers are justified or punished by relatively mild sentences. A police officer must feel a higher degree of responsibility than an ordinary citizen and he must by his actions set an example to society because he has been obliged by the State to protect public order and thus ensure the safety of society. A crime committed by an officer cannot be a simple statistical fact. It must be thoroughly examined and especially strictly evaluated (kruopščiai ištirtas ir itin griežtai įvertintas). ...” The rest of the statement discussed problems within the police force, such as a lack of qualified personnel, inadequate training and low pay. It also urged all police officers to act in accordance with their mandate and asked the general public not to judge all officers on the basis of offences committed by a few. 13. Many more articles in the press reported on the accident, the suspicion that the applicant had driven while being drunk, the funerals of the three children, reactions within the village, public protests in front of Skuodas police station, previous traffic accidents caused by police officers, and the resignations of the Minister of the Interior and the Police Commissioner General. 14. On 29 December 2007 the applicant was charged with a breach of road traffic safety regulations while being under the influence of alcohol which resulted in the death of other persons (Article 281 § 6 of the Criminal Code) and with a failure to provide assistance to persons in a life-threatening situation (Article 144 of the Criminal Code). 15. According to the rules of territorial jurisdiction, the case against the applicant should have been examined by the Skuodas District Court. However, it was transferred to the Klaipėda District Court because two of the Skuodas District Court judges had participated in the pre-trial investigation and the chairperson of the court had previously worked with the applicant’s father. 16. On 31 January 2008 the Klaipėda District Court began its examination of the applicant’s case. The court heard testimony from the applicant, his colleague M.K., who had been in the car with the applicant at the time of the accident, and another colleague V.J., who had been driving in a different car and had helped the applicant to leave the scene of the accident. It also heard other workmates who had seen the applicant before or soon after the accident, as well as the waitress from the restaurant where the applicant and M.K. had had lunch before the accident, the parents of the three children who had died, residents of the village who had witnessed the accident, and several court-appointed experts. The applicant admitted that he had been driving the car and that the three children had died as a result of the accident. However, he stated that he had not been drunk and had not exceeded the speed limit. He also argued that the accident had been caused by the weather and the reckless actions of some of the children. 17. All the hearings were held in public as none of the parties had asked for them to be closed, and several newspapers reported on the witness evidence. In a number of publications the applicant was called “a killer of children” (vaikų žudikas) and mocked for “suddenly losing his memory” (staiga sutriko atmintis) when testifying in court. The colleagues who testified in favour of the applicant were collectively called “defenders of the killer of children” (vaikų žudiko užtarėjai) who were “trying to get him off” (bando išsukti). The newspapers also expressed sympathy to the children’s families for having to “relive those cruel events”. Excerpts of the testimony of many of the witnesses, both in favour of and against the applicant, as well as the applicant’s final statement, were reprinted word-for-word. 18. On 17 March 2008 the Klaipėda District Court found the applicant guilty of both charges. The court established that the accident had occurred when the applicant had been under the influence of alcohol. It examined a video-recording from the restaurant where the applicant and M.K. had had lunch before the accident, showing that the two men had each drunk half a bottle of vodka. Another video-recording from the petrol station in which the applicant and M.K. had stopped after lunch showed the applicant buying two more bottles of vodka. Several witnesses – the waitress from the restaurant, some of the applicant’s colleagues, and people who had been present when the accident had happened – stated that the applicant had looked and sounded drunk. On the basis of that evidence, the court found that before the accident the applicant had consumed between 200 and 250 grams of alcohol. A court-appointed expert stated that after consuming so much alcohol the alcohol level in the applicant’s blood must definitely have been above the legally permitted threshold of 0.4 per mille (see paragraph 29 below). The court also noted that even though tests of the applicant’s blood and urine had not detected any traces of alcohol, they had not been reliable because they had been taken more than seventeen hours after the accident. The court held that since the applicant had deliberately hidden from the authorities during that period and had only given himself up the morning after the accident (see paragraph 7 above), he could not use the negative blood and urine tests to his advantage. 19. The Klaipėda District Court also established that at the time of the accident the applicant’s car must have been going at a speed of at least 105 km/h. A court-appointed expert examined the tyre marks at the scene of the accident, the damage done to nearby objects and the positions in which the three children had been found, and reconstructed the course of events of the accident. The applicant’s colleague V.J., who had been driving in the car behind the applicant, testified that he himself had been going at around 100 km/h but had been unable to keep up with the applicant. Several people who had been present at the accident also stated that the noise made by the applicant’s car had indicated a very high speed. The court noted that the speed limit in the village was 50 km/h and that this must have been known to the applicant, who had worked as a police officer in the area. The court concluded that the accident had been caused by the excessive speed of the applicant’s car and not by the weather or the actions of the children. 20. The Klaipėda District Court also found the applicant guilty of failing to provide assistance to persons in a life-threatening situation. The court noted that the applicant had not shown any interest in the condition of the three children or called an ambulance but had immediately fled the scene of the accident. The court observed that the obligation to help people in lifethreatening situations was enshrined in the Law on Police Activity, with which the applicant had had to comply. By failing to do so, he had breached Article 144 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 29-30 below). 21. The court found no mitigating circumstances in the applicant’s favour. However, the fact that the victims had been minors was considered as an aggravating circumstance. The court also took the applicant’s character and his behaviour during and after the accident into account: he had been under the influence of alcohol, three people had died as a result of his actions, he had fled from the scene of the accident, had not expressed any remorse, had attempted to mislead the court by providing contradictory testimony, and his actions had discredited the authority of the police. As a result, the Klaipėda District Court held that the applicant’s punishment should be close to the maximum provided by law (see paragraph 29 below). He was given a consolidated sentence of ten years’ imprisonment, prohibited from driving a vehicle for three years, and ordered to pay a total of 3,000,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 870,000 euros (EUR)) in non-pecuniary damages to the families of the three children. 22. Reporting on the sentence, Lietuvos rytas quoted excerpts from the judgment and published a brief statement by the mother of one of the children, who expressed her overall satisfaction with the judgment but stated that criminal laws should be changed to provide for stricter punishments. 23. The applicant appealed against the judgment. Among other things, he argued that he had not received a fair trial because of a media campaign against him. He argued that the media had ridiculed and discouraged the witnesses who had testified in his favour and that journalists and high-level State officials had urged the court to order the strictest sentence possible. The applicant stated that this had prevented the first-instance court from examining his case objectively. The applicant also argued that he had been given a stricter punishment because he was a police officer, which had constituted discrimination on the grounds of social status. 24. On 5 December 2008 the Klaipėda Regional Court partly amended the first-instance judgment. It upheld the lower court’s findings concerning the applicant’s drunkenness and the speed of his car, and dismissed the applicant’s complaint concerning discrimination. However, the Klaipėda Regional Court accepted the applicant’s argument that the age of the victims should not have been considered as an aggravating circumstance because the criminal offence had not been premeditated. Accordingly, the court reduced the consolidated sentence to nine years’ imprisonment. It also considered that the amount of non-pecuniary damages awarded by the first-instance court had been excessive and not reasonably related to the applicant’s means. Instead, the court awarded a total of LTL 900,000 (approximately EUR 261,000) to the three families. The prohibition on driving a vehicle for three years was upheld. 25. In response to the applicant’s complaints concerning the lack of a fair trial, the Klaipėda Regional Court stated that the media interest in the case had been understandable owing to its sensitive nature and that the media could not be prevented from reporting on public hearings. However, the court held that the first-instance judgment had been well-reasoned and based on reliable evidence, so there were no grounds to find that the judges had been influenced by the media or the statements of any of the officials. 26. On 8 May 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed a cassation appeal by the applicant and upheld the judgment of the Klaipėda Regional Court. It stated that the appellate court had provided an adequate examination of the applicant’s complaints concerning the fairness of his trial and that there was no need to re-examine them. 27. In January 2015 the applicant was released on probation. According to the Government’s observations submitted to the Court on 21 June 2016, the applicant had up to that date paid a total of LTL 2,268 (approximately EUR 657) in non-pecuniary damages to the victims’ families.",[],[],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-2']",[],0
173,001-163317,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,N. AND M. v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Alena Poláčková;Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Luis López Guerra;Pere Pastor Vilanova,"1. The case originated in two applications (nos. 39496/14 and 39727/14) against the Russian Federation lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”) by Ms Ye. V. Gribanova, on 27 May 2014, on behalf of two Uzbek nationals, N. and M. 2. Ms Gribanova did not provide any written authority to act on behalf of N. and M. 3. N. and M. were born in 1972 and 1975 respectively and prior to their alleged disappearance lived in Kaliningrad. 4. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights. 5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 6. Prior to 2008 N. lived in Uzbekistan. In December 2008 he left Uzbekistan for Russia, and settled in Kaliningrad. 7. Prior to 2009 M. lived in Uzbekistan. In November 2009 he left Uzbekistan for Russia and settled in Kaliningrad. 8. Both N. and M. are practising Muslims. 9. In 2010 the Uzbek authorities charged N. and M. in absentia with being members of banned religious organisations, issued international warrants for their arrest, and ordered that they be placed in detention once arrested. During those criminal proceedings, on two occasions (in December 2008 and August 2010) the Uzbek authorities questioned N.’s relatives about his whereabouts. 10. In 2011 and 2012 the Russian police arrested N. and M. in Kaliningrad under an international warrant. The Kaliningrad Tsentralnyy District prosecutor’s office ordered their detention pending extradition. This was subsequently extended by the Kaliningrad Tsentralnyy District Court. 11. N. and M. retained Ms Gribanova to represent them in the extradition proceedings. She applied to the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia (“the GPO”) with a request for their extradition to Uzbekistan to be refused. 12. The GPO refused to extradite N. and M. on the grounds that the acts imputed to them by the Uzbek authorities were not regarded as criminal under Russian law. 13. On 13 March and 12 July 2012 respectively the Kaliningrad regional prosecutor ordered N. and M.’s release. The Government submitted that since their release N. and M. had not informed the relevant authorities of their place of residence on the territory of the Russian Federation. 14. In April 2012 N. and M. addressed the following statements to Ms Gribanova: Statement by N.: “In the event I give any written or oral submissions to the mass media to the effect that I have voluntarily decided to return to Uzbekistan, this should be regarded as a forced return to the Republic of Uzbekistan.” Statement by M.: “In the event I give any written or oral submissions to the mass media to the effect that I have voluntarily decided to return to Uzbekistan, this should be regarded as a statement made under pressure and my return to my country of origin, Uzbekistan, should be regarded as a forced return.” 15. In March 2012 and May 2013 respectively N. and M.’s names were removed from the international wanted list following the prosecutor’s decision not to extradite them to Uzbekistan. 16. N. and M. applied for refugee status and temporary asylum in Russia. They lodged their applications with the Kaliningrad regional branch of the Russian Federal Migration Service (“the FMS”). They submitted that they had been persecuted in Uzbekistan on the basis of their religious beliefs, and would be subjected to ill-treatment if they returned. They indicated that Ms Gribanova was their point of contact. 17. In July 2012 and April 2013 respectively the FMS dismissed their requests for refugee status. In 2013 the Russian courts upheld those decisions. M. was represented in the proceedings by Ms Ye. Ryabinina, a lawyer practising in Moscow. 18. In October 2013 and April 2014 respectively the FMS dismissed their applications for temporary asylum. They lodged appeals against those decisions. The outcome of those proceedings is unknown. 19. On 11 February 2014 N. was arrested for violating residence regulations for foreign nationals. On 13 February 2014 the court refused to expel him and terminated the administrative proceedings for lack of corpus delicti. N. was represented by Ms Gribanova in those proceedings. 20. On 22 May 2014 N. was summoned to the FMS and questioned about his place of residence. After being questioned he telephoned Ms Gribanova. According to her, he seemed very scared. 21. According to Ms Gribanova, on 23 May 2014 N. received a call from the Uzbek security service, which insisted that he return to Uzbekistan. 22. On the morning of 26 May 2014 N. was again summoned to the FMS and was asked to bring copies of all the appeals he had lodged with the FMS and the courts in connection with the asylum proceedings. Ms Gribanova stated that he seemed scared, and asked her to attend in his place. 23. At 8 p.m. on 26 May 2014 N. telephoned Ms Gribanova to ask for help. He said that unknown persons had forced him into a car and taken him to the airport. Immediately after this call his mobile telephone was switched off. 24. That evening Ms Gribanova informed M. that N. had been abducted, and asked him to be extremely careful. 25. Around 3 p.m. on 27 May 2014 Ms Gribanova received a call from a man who introduced himself as one of M.’s friends. According to him, at around 9 a.m. that day three unidentified men had approached M. in the street. Two of them were wearing camouflage uniforms, while one was in civilian clothes. They forced M. into a yellow minibus and drove him away to an unknown destination. 26. Ms Gribanova submitted that prior to their abduction N. and M. had given her their passports, which she still held. 27. On 27 May 2014 Ms Gribanova sought the application of Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. She asked the Court to indicate to the Russian Government that N. and M.’s removal to Uzbekistan should be suspended. 28. On the same date the Court granted that request, indicating to the Russian Government that N. and M. should not be extradited, expelled or otherwise involuntarily removed from Russia to Uzbekistan or any other country for the duration of the proceedings before the Court. It also asked the Government for information as to N. and M.’s whereabouts. 29. On 17 June 2014 the Government informed the Court that N. and M. had not been arrested by the Russian authorities on 26 and 27 May, and that since 25 May 2014 they had not passed through any border crossing points in the Kaliningrad region. Their whereabouts were unknown. 30. On 28 May 2014 Ms Gribanova received a telephone call from N.’s wife, who told her that she and N.’s father had been summoned by the Uzbek security service several times. The Uzbek authorities had insisted that N. return to Uzbekistan voluntarily or else he would be forcibly returned. 31. On 25 July 2014 Ms Gribanova submitted to the Court that there were grounds to believe that N. and M. had been transferred to Uzbekistan on one of the two direct flights from Kaliningrad which had been scheduled after the Court’s indication of interim measures. She also submitted that at the time of their abduction N. and M. had not been in possession of their passports, so they could not have crossed the border without the knowledge and passive or active involvement of the Russian authorities. 32. On an unspecified date Ms Gribanova was visited by a man who introduced himself as N.’s “mate”. He said that N.’s father had informed him that N. was in Uzbekistan. 33. On an unspecified date M.’s relatives informed Ms Gribanova that he had been transported to Uzbekistan on 2 June 2014. 34. In mid-October 2014 Ms Gribanova was contacted by some people who introduced themselves as N. and M.’s relatives. They asked her to return N. and M.’s passports. They explained that N. and M. were standing trial in Uzbekistan and therefore needed them. She refused to hand them over unless they made a written statement confirming that the passports had been taken by them and why. The people disappeared and never contacted her again. 35. At the end of June 2014 the Kaliningrad regional department of the interior informed Ms Gribanova that enquiries had been made after she had reported that N. and M. had been abducted, but that their abduction by unknown persons and transportation to Uzbekistan had not been confirmed. In particular, N.’s relatives in Uzbekistan had submitted that he had been living in Kaliningrad, and there had been no information regarding N. and M.’s possible arrest by Russian law-enforcement bodies or their departure from the Kaliningrad region. Nor were their names on the list of deceased persons. 36. Between July 2014 and January 2015 the investigating authorities on several occasions refused to initiate criminal proceedings into N. and M.’s disappearance, for lack of corpus delicti. However, the decisions were overruled each time by the head of the Investigation Committee, and the matter was sent for additional investigation. 37. In one of the refusals to initiate criminal proceedings, namely a decision taken on 20 November 2014, the investigator referred to information provided by the information centre of the Kaliningrad department of the interior, to the effect that N. had been arrested in Uzbekistan on 11 June 2014. 38. On 31 March 2015 an investigator from the local investigation committee initiated criminal proceedings into N. and M.’s abduction by unknown persons. The Government did not inform the Court of the outcome of those proceedings. 39. Ms Gribanova submitted that on 16 June 2015 she had been summoned by the investigator in charge of the case to give evidence as a witness. 40. On 17 June 2015 she appeared before the Investigation Committee and claimed that she could not be questioned as a witness. She applied to be acknowledged as representing N. and M. She was allegedly told that the investigator possessed information to the effect that M. had been detained by the Uzbek authorities in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, shortly after his disappearance from Kaliningrad. 41. In various proceedings in Russia N. and M. were questioned about their family situation, among other things. 42. N. submitted that all his relatives lived in Uzbekistan. He had been married but was divorced. He had a son from his marriage. He was not in contact with his former wife or their son. Since 2003 he had been living with his female partner B., an Uzbek national, with whom he had two daughters. Between 2011 and 2013 B. and their daughters had lived in Kaliningrad. In August 2013 B. and the children had returned to Uzbekistan, because one of their daughters needed to undergo an operation there. N. was in regular telephone contact with his parents, sisters and brothers. He submitted that he was not aware of any persecution of his family members in Uzbekistan. 43. M. submitted that all his relatives lived in Uzbekistan. He was married to Kh., an Uzbek national, and they had two sons. In 2011 his wife came to Russia to visit him and stayed with him. Their children stayed in Uzbekistan with their grandparents. In March 2013 his wife returned to Uzbekistan. He was in regular telephone contact with his wife and their two young children, as well as his father and brothers and sisters.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
174,001-158946,ENG,HUN,CHAMBER,2015,CASE OF KÁROLY NAGY v. HUNGARY,3,Remainder inadmissible;No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Civil proceedings;Article 6-1 - Access to court),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Jon Fridrik Kjølbro;Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens,"6. The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Gödöllő. 7. In November 1991 the applicant took up the position of pastor in the Hungarian Calvinist Church (Magyar Református Egyház). As of December 2003, he served in the parish of Gödöllő. His rights and obligations as well as his remuneration were set out in an appointment letter (lelkészi díjlevél) issued by the parish presbyters. 8. On 22 June 2005 the applicant was informed that disciplinary proceedings had been instituted against him for stating in a local newspaper that State subsidies had been paid unlawfully to a Calvinist boarding school. Meanwhile, on 21 June 2005 the first-instance ecclesiastical court had suspended the applicant’s service with immediate effect until a decision on the merits, for a maximum of sixty days. The applicant received a letter stating that he was entitled, under section 82(1) of Statute no. I of 2000 of the Hungarian Calvinist Church, to 50% of his service allowance during the period of his suspension. 9. On 27 September 2005 the first-instance ecclesiastical court removed the applicant from service, as a disciplinary measure. On an unspecified date, the second-instance ecclesiastical court upheld that decision and terminated the applicant’s service with effect from 1 May 2006. 10. On 26 June 2006 the applicant took his case to the Pest County Labour Court, seeking the payment of 50% of his service allowance and other benefits to which, in his view, he should have been entitled during the period of his suspension. Arguing that his suspension had reached its statutory maximum duration on 21 October 2005, he also sought the payment of the whole service allowance from that date until the termination of his service, that is, 30 April 2006. He argued in substance that his ecclesiastical service was analogous to employment, referring to tax rules to that effect (see paragraph 20 below). 11. On 22 December 2006 the Labour Court discontinued (megszüntette) the proceedings, holding that it had no jurisdiction to adjudicate on the applicant’s claim. It considered that under section 2(3) of Statute no. I of 2000 of the Hungarian Calvinist Church, pastors’ service with the Church was regulated by ecclesiastical rules, whereas laymen’s employment with the Church was governed by the State’s Labour Code. Accordingly, since the dispute before it concerned the applicant’s service as a pastor, the provisions of the Labour Code were not applicable in the case, and there existed no judicial avenue before the State courts to decide on his claims. The Pest County Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal on 27 April 2007. The applicant did not apply for a review to the Supreme Court. 12. On 10 September 2007 the applicant lodged a civil-law claim against the Hungarian Calvinist Church. His claim was based in the first place on sections 277(1) and 478(1) of the [old] Civil Code and on the agency contract he had allegedly concluded with the Church. He maintained that for the period from 21 October 2005 (that is, the date when the suspension allegedly became unlawful) until 30 April 2006 (that is, the date of termination of his appointment) he was entitled to a fee for his services, which corresponded to the service allowance set out in his appointment letter. He thus sought enforcement of the contract. Alternatively, he based his claim on sections 318(1) and 339(1) of the [old] Civil Code and on the breach by the Church of its contractual obligations under the agency contract. He argued that by not paying him the allowance due for the period between 21 October 2005 and 30 April 2006, the Church had failed to fulfil its contractual obligations. He thus claimed damages, amounting to the loss of service allowances to which he would have been entitled under the contract for the above-mentioned period. 13. The Pest Central District Court dismissed the applicant’s claim on the grounds that no contractual relationship had been established between the parties under civil law. In the court’s view, the claim had no basis in civil law. It therefore did not embark on an assessment of the applicant’s secondary claims, such as liability for breach of contract or recognition of debt. 14. The Budapest Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision on appeal, reasoning that the Hungarian Calvinist Church had no standing in the proceedings, since the applicant had been appointed by the parish of Gödöllő, a separate legal entity. 15. The applicant lodged a petition for review with the Supreme Court. By its decision of 28 May 2009, the Supreme Court quashed the final decision and discontinued (megszüntette) the proceedings. It stated as follows: “... In order to determine the rules applicable to the agreement (megállapodás) in question and to the implementation of the rights and obligations arising from it, it is necessary to have regard to the very purpose of the agreement underlying the plaintiff’s actual claim as well as the elements thereof defining the parties’ rights and obligations. The first-instance court rightly stated in its assessment that the agreement serving as the basis of the applicant’s claim was not an agency contract regulated by civil law or concluded by and between parties enjoying personal autonomy in the marketing of [goods and services]. The plaintiff was appointed as a pastor in an ecclesiastical procedure, and the obligations of the respondent were defined in an appointment letter by the assembly of presbyters. The parties established between themselves a pastoral service relationship, regulated by ecclesiastical law. Under section 15(1) of Act no. IV of 1990 on Freedom of Conscience and Religion and on Churches, the Church is separated from the State. Under sub-section (2), no State coercion can be used to enforce the internal laws and regulations of Churches. Relying on the above provisions, the applicant can make a claim under the ecclesiastical law before the relevant bodies of the Calvinist Church. The fact that the agreement concluded under ecclesiastical law resembles a contractual agreement under the Civil Code does not prompt State jurisdiction or the enforceability of the claim in a judicial procedure within the meaning of section 7 of the Civil Code. (In the given case the basic elements of an agency contract and the conclusion of such a contract could not be established either.) The labour court reached the same conclusion in the earlier proceedings when assessing the claim under the State labour law and dismissing its enforcement in judicial proceedings. The first-instance court was right to point out that as the impugned agreement lacked a civil-law legal basis, the court could not examine the applicant’s secondary claim (compensation for breach of contract). On the basis of the reasoning above, there were no grounds to adjudicate on the claim on the merits. The Supreme Court accordingly quashes the final judgment, including the firstinstance judgment, and discontinues the proceedings under sections 130(1) (a) and 157 (a) of the Code of Civil Procedure...” This decision was served on the applicant at some point in time after 9 July 2009.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0
175,001-154993,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,PEREZ LIZASO v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"1. The applicant, Mr Hugo Cristian Perez Lizaso, is a Swedish and Uruguayan national, who was born in 1976 and lives in Solna. He was represented before the Court by Mr Jussi Sarvikivi, a lawyer practising in Helsinki. 2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant is a Swedish national who has certain family ties to Uruguay and also has Uruguayan citizenship. The applicant was wanted in Uruguay from at least 2010 as he was suspected of aggravated extortion committed in February 2009. Three other persons, including the applicant’s brother, were convicted in Uruguay on 28 September 2010 for having participated in the same crime of which the applicant was suspected. A prison sentence of 5 years and 8 months was imposed on the brother and a sentence of 5 years and 4 months on the two other perpetrators. The Uruguayan authorities tried to locate the applicant through Interpol, issuing a Red Notice alert about him. 5. On 11 December 2010 the applicant was arrested in Finland. 6. On 14 December 2010 the Vantaa District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) ordered the applicant to be detained with a view to his extradition. The applicant complained about this decision to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) which rejected his complaint on 14 January 2011. 7. On 8 February 2011 the Vantaa District Court rejected the applicant’s request for release from detention. The applicant complained about this decision to the Supreme Court which, on 5 April 2011, rejected his complaint. 8. On 11 April 2011 the Vantaa District Court rejected the applicant’s second request for release from detention. The applicant did not lodge a complaint against this decision with the Supreme Court. 9. By letter dated 17 January 2011 the Uruguayan authorities filed a request with the Finnish Ministry of Justice, asking them to extradite the applicant to Uruguay. 10. On 15 April 2011 the applicant was interrogated by the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation (keskusrikospoliisi, centralkriminalpolisen). The applicant opposed the extradition. 11. On 2 May 2011, in accordance with the Extradition Act, the Ministry of Justice asked the Supreme Court to give a statement on whether the possible extradition would be in conformity with domestic legislation and the applicable international extradition treaties. 12. By letter dated 19 May 2011 the applicant submitted his comments to the Supreme Court on the possible extradition. He claimed that, as a Swedish citizen, he should be treated as a Finnish citizen because Finnish citizens could not be extradited according to the domestic law. He also claimed that he could not be extradited to Uruguay because the conditions in Uruguayan detention facilities and prisons were contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. He would not have a fair and public trial there within a reasonable time, he would not be presumed innocent and he would be kept in pre-trial detention for a long time. 13. On 3 June 2011 the Supreme Court submitted its statement to the Ministry of Justice. It found that the request for extradition could be granted. The applicant was suspected of aggravated extortion committed together with three other persons. These three persons had been convicted in Uruguay and sentenced to imprisonment on 28 September 2010. The crime of which the applicant was suspected was such that, according to domestic law, the applicant could be extradited. The extradition was based on a detention order issued by a court. The fact that the applicant was a Swedish citizen did not prevent the extradition. No such grounds were thus shown to exist on the basis of which the applicant’s extradition to Uruguay, due to personal circumstances or special humanitarian reasons, could be considered unreasonable. 14. On 7 June 2011 the Ministry of Justice decided that the applicant could be extradited to Uruguay for trial. The decision stated that, after the decision had been served to the Uruguayan authorities, they had 30 days to come and collect the applicant and transfer him to Uruguay. 15. On 13 June 2011 the applicant lodged his application with the Court, requesting also that Rule 39 be applied. 16. On 15 June 2011 the Court refused to apply Rule 39 to prevent the applicant’s extradition from Finland. The applicant was requested to inform the Court whether he wished to maintain his application. 17. On 11 July 2011 the applicant informed the Court that he wished to maintain his application with the Court. 18. On 14 July 2011 the applicant was extradited to Montevideo, Uruguay where he arrived on the following day. He was then taken to Maldonado, brought before a judge and detained on suspicion of attempted extortion. From 16 July 2011 onwards he was detained in isolation in prison for one year. Thereafter he was moved to another prison for half a year, where he shared a cell with five other inmates. In September 2012 the applicant was transferred to an open department and again in February 2013 to a labour facility. In October 2013 the applicant was released by virtue of an amnesty granted by the Uruguayan Supreme Court. 19. After his release, the applicant returned to Sweden. 20. Extradition to and from Finland takes place in accordance with the Extradition Act (laki rikoksen johdosta tapahtuvasta luovuttamisesta, lagen om utlämning för brott, Act no. 456/1970, as in force at the relevant time). According to sections 16 and 17 of the Act, the Ministry of Justice decides on extradition. If the person to be extradited opposes it, the Ministry must ask the Supreme Court to give a statement on whether the possible extradition is in conformity with domestic legislation and the applicable international extradition treaties which are binding on Finland. If the Supreme Court finds that there is an obstacle to the extradition, it cannot be carried out. 21. The US Department of State’s Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2010 in Uruguay of 8 April 2011 provided the following: “Principal human rights abuses included severe overcrowding, inhuman conditions, and disrepair in the prison system; violence against women; and trafficking in persons. ... Prison conditions continued to be poor, as the government did not adequately maintain aging facilities and provided insufficient resources for the prison system. Overcrowding was a significant problem despite the government’s efforts to build more prison facilities. According to government figures, the total prisoner population as of August 31 exceeded design capacity by 1,976 prisoners, or 29 percent (the prison ombudsman’s 2009 report defined 20 percent overcrowding as ""critical""). Additionally, many necessities were lacking and many prisoners depended on visitors for enough food to reach the daily minimum caloric intake. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence continued to be a daily problem, partially due to the lack of a separate, high-security prison for violent criminals. A high percentage of prisoners reportedly used drugs. Fire hazards and violence continued to plague the prison system. In 2009 there were 39 deaths due to violence, and fires in prisons were reported. In July a cell fire killed 12 prisoners in Rocha Province. In August 5 prisoners perished in a cell fire in Comcar Prison in Montevideo. The fires started due to handcrafted heaters that set makeshift partitions on fire. Initial investigations revealed that fire extinguishers were not adequately maintained in both facilities. In general overcrowding and understaffing in some facilities resulted in problems related to sanitation, ventilation, temperature, lighting, access to potable water, and health. Supervision of medical care moved to the Ministry of Public Health, which implemented a pilot system in July to provide basic and emergency medical care to a prison in rural Montevideo that housed 3,000 inmates. An Anti-Tuberculosis Commission report confirmed 81 cases of tuberculosis in the prison population in 2009.” 22. According to the Report of the UN Special Rapporteur Manfred Nowak on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in Uruguay of 21 December 2009 (A/HRC/13/39/Add.2): “Although some efforts have been made to improve overall conditions in prisons and prevent overcrowding, the conditions in some detention facilities, particularly Libertad Penitentiary and the Santiago Vázquez Prison Complex (Complejo Carcelario Santiago Vázquez, known as COMCAR), amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. The overcrowding, the non-separation of pre-trial and convicted detainees as well as the limited access to medical services is of concern in practically all of the places visited. A comprehensive reform of the whole administration of justice system, aimed at the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders, should be a high priority.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
176,001-156007,ENG,HRV,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,M.B. v. CROATIA,4,Inadmissible,Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Julia Laffranque;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant is a Croatian national, who was born in 1974. The President granted the applicant’s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). He was represented before the Court by Ms M. Sršić, a lawyer practising in Zagreb. 2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant works as a police inspector in the S. Police Department (Policijska uprava s.) 5. On 15 January 2007, at around 6.00 p.m., the applicant’s wife requested the assistance of the police alleging that she had been beaten by the applicant in their flat in Z. 6. Two police officers from one of the local police stations of the Z. Police Department (Policijska uprava z.) A.H. and M.M., intervened at the scene where they found the applicant and his wife, who had a visible nose injury. She was immediately taken to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a dislocation of septum and superficial nose hematoma. 7. The applicant was requested to undergo an alcohol intoxication test which he refused. The police officers also found in his flat several pieces of hunting firearms which were, together with the applicant’s police handgun, seized from him. The applicant refused to sign the seizure records. 8. At around 6.45 p.m. the applicant was arrested and taken to the police station. 9. According to the applicant, inside the police station he was knocked to the ground and beaten by several police officers for refusing to sign the seizure records. He was in particular ill-treated by the police officers A.H., M.M. and M.D. 10. According to a report of the police officer M.D. of 15 January 2007, at around 7.35 p.m., while he was held in the police station, the applicant started shouting and disobeying the orders to calm down. M.D. therefore approached him and twisted his arm behind his back after which he was handcuffed. 11. On the same day, at around 8.40 p.m., the applicant was examined by a doctor at the police station. The medical examination indicated signs of alcohol intoxication but did not disclose any injuries. 12. On 16 January 2007, at 2.20 p.m., the applicant was again examined by a doctor who found no injuries but indicated that the applicant had low blood sugar. 13. Following the applicant’s release from detention (see paragraph 31 below), on 22 January 2007 he underwent another medical examination in a hospital in S. The examination indicated spinal and abdominal contusions which could, as alleged, relate to a beating dating back one week before. 14. On 15 January 2007 the police officer M.D. reported on the use of force against the applicant to his superiors (see paragraph 10 above). 15. On the same day the Chief of the police station accepted the report finding no irregularities in the use of force. These findings were forwarded to the Chief of the Z. Police Department. 16. On 18 January 2007 the Chief of the Z. Police Department found that the use of force against the applicant had been lawful and justified. 17. This finding was confirmed by the Internal Control Unit of the Ministry of the Interior (Odjel za unutarnju kontrolu Ministarstva unutarnjih poslova) on 8 March 2007. 18. On 18 May 2007 the First-instance Disciplinary Court of the Ministry of the Interior (Odsjek prvostupanjskog disciplinskog suda Z.; hereinafter: the “First-instance Disciplinary Court”) found the applicant guilty on disciplinary charges of inappropriate behaviour and sentenced him to dismissal from service suspended for three months and a twenty percent reduction of salary in the period of two months. This decision was upheld by the Second-instance Disciplinary Court of the Ministry of the Interior (Odsjek drugostupanjskog disciplinskog sudovanja; hereinafter: the “Second-instance Disciplinary Court”) on 13 July 2007. 19. On 18 April 2007 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M. and M.D. alleging that they had ill-treated him during his arrest on 15 January 2007. In particular, he submitted that he had been knocked to the ground and then beaten. The applicant also alleged that M.Mi., an on-duty police officer in the police station at the time of the events, had attempted to cover up the ill-treatment by unlawfully instituting minor offences proceedings against him on charges of domestic violence (see paragraph 29 below). 20. On 25 May 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office requested the Z. Police Department to conduct an investigation into the applicant’s allegations. 21. The Z. Police Department submitted a report on 6 July 2007 indicating that they had interviewed the suspects and two witnesses and obtained the relevant documentation concerning the use of force against the applicant. The suspects denied any ill-treatment and one of the witnesses, also a police officer, stated that she had seen the applicant handcuffed and kneeled on the ground. 22. On 12 July 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office rejected the applicant’s criminal complaint on the grounds that there was no evidence that he had been ill-treated as alleged in his criminal complaint. The applicant was instructed that he could take over the criminal prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor by lodging an indictment before the competent criminal court. 23. Meanwhile, the applicant submitted another criminal complaint before the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office against the police officers M.M., A.H., S.G., P.S., M.Mi. and M.P. alleging unlawful search of his flat and their unlawful conduct in the processing of his case related to the alleged domestic violence. 24. On 31 October 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office rejected this criminal complaint as unfounded on the grounds that there was nothing disclosing any unlawfulness in the conduct of the police officers. 25. On 11 December 2007 the applicant lodged an indictment in the Z. Municipal Criminal Court (Općinski kazneni sud u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M., M.D. and M.Mi. in connection with his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 22 above). 26. On 28 November 2008 the applicant sent a letter to the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office expressing his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the circumstances of his criminal complaint had been assessed and with the decision of 12 July 2007 (see paragraph 22 above). 27. The Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office replied on 5 March 2009 indicating that all the applicant’s objections should be addressed in the criminal proceedings which he had instituted as a subsidiary prosecutor. 28. On 6 April 2010 the Z. Municipal Criminal Court declared the applicant’s indictment inadmissible as he had failed to inform that court of the change of his whereabouts for which reason he could not be summoned to amend the indictment in accordance with the formal requirements of the relevant domestic law. This decision was placed on the Z. Municipal Criminal Court’s public notice board from which it was taken on 26 April 2010. It was thereby considered to be served on the applicant (see paragraph 59 below). 29. On 15 January 2007 the police instituted minor offences proceedings against the applicant in the Z. Minor Offences Court (Prekršajni sud u Z.) on charges of domestic violence, abusive conduct towards the police officers, improper storage of firearms and failure to report the change of his whereabouts. 30. On 16 January 2007 the Z. Minor Offences Court ordered the applicant’s detention. 31. On 22 January 2007 the Z. Minor Offences Court found the applicant guilty on charges of abusive conduct towards the police officers, improper storage of firearms and failure to report the change of his whereabouts. The applicant was fined in total with 5,754 Croatian kunas (HRK) and the seized firearms were confiscated. The proceedings were discontinued in respect of the charges of domestic violence on the grounds of lack of evidence. The applicant was released from detention. 32. On 5 October 2007 the Higher Minor Offences Court (Visoki prekršajni sud Republike Hrvatske), acting as the court of appeal, quashed the part of the first-instance decision by which the proceedings in respect of the charges of domestic violence were discontinued and ordered a retrial, while it upheld the remainder of the first-instance decision. 33. On 16 January 2009 the resumed minor offences proceedings concerning the charges of domestic violence were discontinued on the grounds that they had become time-barred. 34. According to the applicant, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., while celebrating his wedding anniversary with friends, he was attacked and injured by A.H., the same police officer who had been involved in his alleged ill-treatment on 15 January 2007 (see paragraphs 9, 19 and 25 above). He sustained injuries to his head and arms. Thereafter he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital from which he was released on 27 May 2008. 35. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., the police received an anonymous call informing them that a person was lying on the ground in front of a residential building in Z. The police officers I.Z. and A.H. immediately drove to the address. 36. A report signed by the police officers I.Z. and A.H., dated 25 May 2008, indicates that upon their intervention at the scene they established that the person lying on the ground was the applicant, who was severely intoxicated. He also had visible injuries on his head and arms. Soon afterwards an emergency team joined them and they decided that the applicant should be taken to a hospital for further treatment. During the transfer to the hospital the applicant became aggressive and the police officer A.H. and one of the members of the medical team tried to calm him down. At the hospital, the applicant continued his aggressive behaviour and threatened to kill them all once released. The police officers thus used physical force and the measures of restraint to calm him down. It was decided that he should be taken to another hospital. 37. A medical report of the emergency service of 25 May 2008 indicates contusion of the applicant’s head and superficial injuries on both arms. 38. A medical report prepared on the applicant’s release from the hospital on 27 May 2008 indicates that the applicant sustained his injuries during a fall caused by his intoxication. 39. Following his release the applicant contacted another doctor on 28 May 2008. His report of the same date indicates that the applicant had contusions to the head, and hematomas on the right upper arm and left forearm which could have been caused by blows three days before, as alleged by the applicant. 40. On 25 May 2008 the police officers I.Z. and A.H. reported on the use of force against the applicant to their superiors. They explained that the applicant had been aggressive during his medical treatment in the hospital and that therefore I.Z. grabbed him by the left arm and twisted it behind his back while A.H. did the same thing with his right arm. He was then handcuffed. 41. On the same day the Chief of the police station accepted the report finding no irregularities in the use of force. These findings were forwarded to the Chief of the Z. Police Department. 42. On 28 May 2008 the Chief of the Z. Police Department found that the use of force against the applicant had been lawful and justified. 43. On 25 May 2008 the applicant was indicted in the Z. Minor Offences Court on charges of breach of public peace and order and violent behaviour during his medical examination. 44. The applicant was questioned on the same day and he denied having breached the public peace and order. He stressed that he had only refused to undergo the medical examination to which the police officer A.H. had been forcing him. 45. At a hearing on 7 April 2009 doctor N.L., who received the applicant in the hospital on 25 May 2008 (see paragraph 36 above), stated that the applicant had arrived at the hospital with a head injury and under the influence of alcohol. He also explained that he had not seen any violent behaviour on the part of the applicant. 46. At a hearing on 23 September 2010 the Z. Minor Offences Court questioned the police officer I.Z. who could not remember any details of the event at issue. 47. On the same day the Z. Minor Offences Court acquitted the applicant on the grounds of lack of evidence of his alleged violent behaviour and breach of public peace and order. 48. On 10 June 2008 the S. Police Department instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant in the First-instance Disciplinary Court on charges of inappropriate behaviour related to the events of 25 May 2008. 49. At a hearing on 13 November 2008 the applicant submitted that on the critical day he had been with his friends Ž.K., I.B. and M.V., drinking and celebrating his wedding anniversary. When they approached the building where he lived, they came across two police officers one of whom was A.H., who approached him and asked him whether they had settled their dispute. The applicant answered that the competent court would decide about that and at that point A.H. pulled him by the hand as a result of which he fell to the ground and then he lost his conscience. 50. On 22 December 2008 the First-instance Disciplinary Court questioned the applicant’s friends Ž.K., I.B. and M.V. and the police officers I.Z. and A.H. 51. Ž.K. stated that he had seen the applicant in front of the building talking with two police officers and that at one moment one of the police officers, without any particular reason, pulled the applicant by the hand after which he fell to the ground and hurt his head. I.B. and M.V. confirmed this version of the events. 52. In their statements the police officers I.Z. and A.H. denied any ill-treatment reiterating that they had only used force as a result of the applicant’s aggressive behaviour during his medical treatment. 53. On 3 March 2009 the First-instance Disciplinary Court found the applicant guilty on charges of inappropriate behaviour and sentenced him to dismissal from service suspended for twelve months. It considered that the statements of Ž.K., I.B. and M.V. were inconsistent in particular given that an analysis of I.B.’s mobile phone at about the time of the events showed that he had been in another city. It therefore rejected the applicant’s allegations that he had been ill-treated by the police officers I.Z. and A.H. 54. On 23 April 2009 the Second-instance Disciplinary Court upheld the first-instance decision. 55. The applicant then challenged the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) and on 19 May 2010 the Administrative Court dismissed his complaints as ill-founded endorsing the reasoning of the disciplinary bodies. 56. The applicant further challenged the findings of the disciplinary bodies and the Administrative Court before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). On 13 September 2012 the Constitutional Court upheld the decisions of the lower bodies dismissing the applicant’s complaints as ill-founded. 57. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000, 28/2001, 41/2001, 55/2001, 76/2010 and 85/2010) read as follows: Article 23 “No one shall be subjected to any form of ill-treatment ...” 58. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Zakon o kaznenom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 110/1997, 27/1998, 58/1999, 112/1999, 58/2002 and 62/2003) provided: “(1) Criminal proceedings shall only be instituted and conducted upon the order of a qualified prosecutor. ... (2) In respect of criminal offences subject to public prosecution the qualified prosecutor shall be the State Attorney and in respect of criminal offences that may be prosecuted privately the qualified prosecutor shall be a private prosecutor. (3) Unless otherwise provided by law, the State Attorney shall undertake a criminal prosecution where there is a reasonable suspicion that an identified person has committed a criminal offence subject to public prosecution and where there are no legal impediments to the prosecution of that person. (4) Where the State Attorney finds that there are no grounds to institute or conduct criminal proceedings, the injured party may take his place as a subsidiary prosecutor under the conditions prescribed by this Act.” 59. With regard to the service of the court decisions, the relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided: “... (6) If a party has not reported a change of address to a court or if the party cannot be reached at the address that was previously given to the court or it is evident that he is evading receipt of a decision that is subject to appellate review other than a judgment imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the court shall put the decision on the court’s public notice board. After the lapse of the term of appeal the decision shall become final.” “ ... (2) If ... a decision cannot be served on [a subsidiary prosecutor] to his or her current address, the court shall put ... the decision on the public notice board and, after the laps of eight days from the moment when it was put [on the public notice board] it shall be considered as duly served.” 60. Relevant procedures concerning the submission of and decisions on criminal complaints were provided in Articles 171 to 174, the relevant parts of which read: “(1) All state bodies and legal entities are obliged to report any criminal offence subject to automatic prosecution about which they have been informed or about which they have otherwise learned. ...” “(1) Criminal complaints shall be submitted to the competent State Attorney in writing or orally. ... (3) If a criminal complaint was submitted before a court, the police or a State Attorney who was not competent in the matter, they shall forward the criminal complaint to the competent State Attorney.” “(1) The State Attorney shall reject a criminal complaint by a reasoned decision if the offence in question is not an offence subject to automatic prosecution, if the prosecution is time-barred or an amnesty or pardon have been granted, or other circumstances excluding criminal liability or prosecution exist, or there is no reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed the offence. The State Attorney shall inform the victim about his decision ... within eight days (Article 55) and if the criminal complaint was submitted by the police, he shall also inform the police. (2) If the State Attorney is not able to ascertain the reliability of the submissions from the criminal complaint, or if he does not have sufficient information to ask for a judicial investigation, or if he has been otherwise informed that an offence has been committed, and particularly if the perpetrator is unknown, the State Attorney shall, if he is not able to do it himself, ask the police to collect all relevant information and to take other measures concerning the offence (Articles 177 and 179).”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
177,001-163462,ENG,UKR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,RYMSKO-KATOLYTSKA GROMADA SVYATOGO KLYMENTIYA V MISTI SEVASTOPOLI v. UKRAINE,4,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Erik Møse;Ganna Yudkivska;Mārtiņš Mits;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"1. The applicant association, Rymsko-Katolytska Gromada Svyatogo Klymentiya v Misti Sevastopoli (Римсько-Католицька громада Святого Климента в місті Севастополі), is part of the OdesaSimferopil Eparchy of the Roman Catholic Church and belongs to the Crimean Deanery (Decanat). It was registered as a religious organisation on 5 January 1995. It is currently composed of about 400 parishioners of various nationalities, residents of Sevastopol and the surrounding area, and was headed by a prior of the parish Mr Yuriy Ziminsky and vicar Jan Biletsky. The applicant association operates a Sunday school. It was represented by Mr I.F. Tkach, a lawyer practising in Sevastopol. 2. The Ukrainian Government (“the Government”) were represented, most recently by their Acting Agent, Ms O. Davydchuk, of the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The Roman Catholic community in Sevastopol was founded in 1876 and consisted of about 4,500 members. After receiving permission from the authorities and approval from the Russian Emperor on 13 May 1904, the community built a Catholic church (костьол), which was named after Saint Clement (Собор Святого Климента). The construction of this church was financed by the Catholic community in Sevastopol, was authorised in 1900 and completed in 1911. The church was owned and managed by the community until early 1936, after the arrest of the prior of the community by the People’s Commissariat of Internal Affairs (НКВС) on 26 December 1935. A formal decision on “liquidation of the Catholic church” or dissolution of the Catholic religious community had been taken by the Presidium of the Sevastopol City Council and subsequently by the Central Executive Committee of Crimea in 1936 as the religious community had insufficient membership. 5. In late 1936 the Sevastopol City Council of Deputies decided to transfer the church building to the Sevastopol electricity company Transelectro for use as an electricity substation (трансформаторна підстанція). 6. The premises were partially damaged in the Second World War and then rebuilt in 1958-1960 using the foundations and walls of the old church, which had largely remained undamaged, at the expense of the City Council. In accordance with a redevelopment project in 1958 they were to be used as a cinema for 300-360 persons, with a screen measuring 11.5 metres. However, the existing architectural constructions had to be retained to the maximum possible extent. According to the architectural plans, the cathedral premises had to be rebuilt in such a way as not to reflect their religious origin and also in order to provide office premises for the Department of Cinemas of the City Council. The rebuilding also led to the destruction of the bell-tower, the internal reorganisation of the premises and the addition of an entrance hall for the cinema. After reconstruction, as from 1960, the premises were used as a cinema, which was eventually transformed into the “Druzhba” cinema for children. The lower part of the cathedral’s altar was transformed into a public toilet. The premises were also used to house a currency exchange bureau. The applicant association conducts religious ceremonies during the religious holidays near the entrance to the church, as it does not have permission to use it. It also conducts religious ceremonies at a rented apartment close to the premises in question. 7. On 1 July 1998 the First Deputy Chairman of the Sevastopol City State Administration provided the Cabinet of Ministers with a list of religious premises which had previously been nationalised and could be transferred to religious communities for permanent use. The church was included on the list of such premises, provided that funds be made available for the construction of a children’s cinema. 8. On 16 June 1998 the applicant association requested the Sevastopol City State Administration to transfer to it title to the premises of the former Catholic Church. On 26 June 1998 the Administration referred the applicant association’s request to the Sevastopol City Council (hereinafter – “the Council”) for a decision. 9. On 26 August 1998 the Department of Religions of the Sevastopol State Administration, acting on the basis of a resolution of 7 May 1998 of the Cabinet of Ministers authorising the transfer of religious premises to religious communities, included the former Catholic church building in the list of premises that were to be transferred to the applicant association, the only Catholic religious community in Sevastopol. The transfer was to take place on condition that a new children’s cinema was built by certain State authorities. 10. On 24 December 1998 the Sevastopol City Council, by decision no. 139, came to the conclusion that the transfer of the premises for use by the applicant association was “not advisable”. The applicant association sought to institute restitution proceedings before various judicial and administrative authorities. These proceedings are described below (see paragraphs 12-23 below). 11. On 7 April 1999 the Sevastopol City Department of Property issued order no. 100 requiring the city authorities to include the cinema in the register of State communal property. Following that, on 7 September 1999, the Sevastopol City State Administration rejected the applicant association’s request for transfer of the premises for its use, based on the provisions of Section 17 of the Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations Act of 23 April 1991 (see paragraph 29 below). 12. On 24 March 1999 the applicant association instituted proceedings against the Sevastopol City Council before the Sevastopol City Court seeking to quash Council decision no. 139 of 24 December 1998. It also sought to obtain title to the premises, referring to Section 17 of the Act. 13. On 21 April 1999 the Sevastopol City Court rejected the applicant association’s claim, holding that it was not competent to hear a dispute between two legal entities as to title over property. On 4 May 1999 the applicant association appealed against that judgment to the Supreme Court. 14. On 9 June 1999 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of 21 April 1999 and terminated the proceedings. In particular, it held that disputes between legal entities (in this case the applicant association and the Council), except in certain specified circumstances, were subject to examination by the State arbitration courts. The Supreme Court held that the applicant association was a religious community and had become a legal entity as from the moment of its registration on 5 January 1995. The claims had been lodged against the Sevastopol City State Administration and the Sevastopol City Council, which were also legal entities. The court ruled that the applicant association had to institute proceedings before the commercial (former arbitration) courts as the courts of general jurisdiction were, according to the court, not competent to deal with the matter. 15. In November 1999 the applicant association instituted proceedings in the Sevastopol City Court seeking the invalidation of the decision of the Sevastopol City State Administration of 7 September 1999 rejecting its request for transfer of the premises (see paragraph 11 above). 16. On 12 November 1999 the Sevastopol City Court refused to examine the applicant association’s request as it fell outside its jurisdiction. The court stated that the dispute related not to the decision of 7 September 1999, but to a controversy over the right to own particular premises between two legal entities, and had therefore to be examined by the commercial (former arbitration) courts. 17. On 22 December 1999 the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and remitted the case to the same court for fresh examination. In particular, it ruled that the issue under examination did not just concern a dispute between two legal entities as to the ownership of premises. The court stated that the applicant association’s claims concerned restitution of a religious building and thus had to be examined on their merits, in accordance with the provisions of Article 248-11 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 18. On 25 February 2000 the Sevastopol City Court rejected the applicant association’s request to transfer the title to premises to it and allow it their use. Without referring to any specific legal provision, it considered that the premises were not owned or administered by the Sevastopol City State Administration, but were “communal property” administered by the City Council according to the Local Government Act. The court also rejected the applicant association’s arguments that the original Catholic cathedral building had been constructed by the Roman Catholic religious community of Sevastopol and confiscated by the State authorities in 1936. It ruled that these claims concerned title to the premises, which had become “communal property” and the transfer of the premises into “communal property” was not challenged by the applicant. It established, having reviewed the evidence before it, that the cathedral had been damaged during the Second World War, rebuilt afterwards in 1960, and had been used as a cinema ever since. The court referred to Articles 15 (adversarial nature of proceedings), 30 (burden of proof), 62 (evaluation of evidence) and 248 (decisions with regard to administrative offences) of the Code of Civil Procedure, and in general terms to the Freedom of Consciousness and Religious Organisations Act (“the Act”), without referring to specific provisions of that law. 19. The applicant association appealed in cassation. It challenged inter alia the first instance court’s failure to apply the law that was applicable to the proceedings in the present case (Section 17 of the Act) and its erroneous application of legal provisions which were of no relevance to the legal relations at issue. In particular, the applicant association stated that: - the courts had not examined its complaints as to the lawfulness of the refusal of the Sevastopol City State Administration to transfer the religious premises at issue into its ownership and use; - the first instance court had established that the premises at issue were “communal property”, administered by the Sevastopol City Council, even though the proceedings concerned property owned by the State; - the property at issue had been unlawfully confiscated from a Roman Catholic religious community in Sevastopol and the State had undertaken to return this property back; - the “communal status of property” and the association’s failure to challenge transfer of property into “communal administration” were irrelevant to the determination of whether nationalised religious property should be returned or not. 20. On 17 May 2000 the Supreme Court examined the applicant’s appeal in cassation and upheld the ruling of 25 February 2000, finding no grounds for quashing it. In particular, it held that the premises had become communal property on 7 April 1999 and thus the Sevastopol City Council was the competent body to transfer title to property owned by it. Therefore, it was only within the competence of the Sevastopol City Council to decide and order return of such premises. It further stated that the first-instance court had lawfully refused to examine complaints about the right to claim property restitution as such complaints were to be examined in a different procedure. The court referred in its reasoning to the Local Self-Government Act and Articles 310 and 312 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 21. In September 2000 the applicant association instituted new proceedings before the Sevastopol City Arbitration Court, seeking a declaration that order no. 100 issued on 7 April 1999 was null and void. On 21 September 2000 the court, referring to the judgment of 25 February 2000 as being res judicata, ruled that the applicant association’s complaints were unsubstantiated. 22. On 13 December 2000 the First Deputy President of the Sevastopol City Arbitration Court upheld the judgment of 21 September 2000 in supervisory-review proceedings. In particular, it held that the applicant community had not raised any claims concerning the return of property to it before the first-instance court, and that the claims as to the unlawfulness of order no. 100 were unsubstantiated. 23. On 24 April 2001 the division responsible for review of decisions, rulings and resolutions of the Higher Arbitration Court examined the applicant association’s request for supervisory review of the aforementioned arbitration-court decisions and ruled that they were lawful and substantiated. It found that the premises at issue were communal property, had been damaged during Second World War and rebuilt in 1960s. The court also cited the findings made in the judgment of the Sevastopol City Court of 25 February 2000 as to the origin of the premises at issue. 24. From April 2001 the applicant association made repeated requests, both separately and jointly with religious groups of other denominations, for the transfer of the premises for use for religious purposes. In particular, they claimed that other larger religious denominations had received premises whereas their requests had been unsuccessful. These requests were heard by the Sevastopol City Council, at the request of the Sevastopol City State Administration, on 10 February 2004 and 10 November 2005. However, according to a letter from the Chairman of the Sevastopol City State Administration of 13 January 2006, a proposal by the City Administration to permit the use of the premises by the Catholic religious community of Sevastopol was not supported by the majority of the members of the City Council and so was not adopted. 25. On 30 September 2004 the then Prime Minister of Ukraine, Mr Yanukovych, instructed the Chairman of the Sevastopol City State Administration to organise, in cooperation with the City Council, the transfer of the premises to the applicant association. 26. On 24 January 2006 the Chairman of the Sevastopol City Council informed the applicant association that the cinema was part of a communal enterprise known as Kinoobyednannia “Kinosvit” (Кінооб’єднання “Кіносвіт”). He also stated that a transfer of the cinema for use by the religious community would be contrary to Article 21 of the Foundations of Legislation on Culture, so that there was no further need for the Sevastopol City Council to review the issue anew. 27. The most recent refusals to examine the issue of transfer of premises to the religious community date from August and September 2011. It appears from information in the case file, provided by the applicant association that the premises, which were cultural and historical monuments, were not being used as a cinema due to the poor state of the building and the need for significant renovation works. 28. The relevant domestic law and practice with regard to the activities of religious associations is summarised in Svyato-Mykhaylivska Parafiya v. Ukraine (no. 77703/01, 14 June 2007), and Tserkva Sela Sosulivka v. Ukraine (no. 37878/02, §§ 21-32, 28 February 2008). Other relevant domestic regulations and administrative and judicial practice are briefly summarised below. 29. Under section 17 § 2 of the Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations Act of 23 April 1991, the State undertook to transfer title to or possession of religious premises and property belonging to the State to religious organisations. The transfer of property had to be done free of charges, on the basis of decisions of the Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations, regional administrations or the Government of the Crimea. 30. The relevant extracts from the text of section 17 of the Act (in force at the material time) read as follows: “Religious organisations shall be entitled to use buildings and property placed at their disposal by the State, by organisations and by private individuals, on a contractual basis. Religious buildings and property which constitute State-owned property shall be transferred by the organisations administering them to the religious associations for their unpaid use or shall be returned into their ownership without payment, in accordance with decisions by the regional, Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations, and in the Republic of the Crimea, by the Government of the Republic of the Crimea ... ... Religious buildings and other property of historical, artistic and other cultural value shall be transferred into the use of the religious organisations and shall be used by them in compliance with the rules on protection and use of historical and cultural monuments ... ... Requests made by religious organisations for transfer of religious buildings and property into ownership or unpaid use shall be considered within a period of one month, and information in writing sent to the petitioners. ... Decisions by the State bodies with regard to ownership or use of religious buildings and property may be appealed against to a court in compliance with the procedure envisaged by the Code of Civil Procedure ...” 31. The relevant extracts from the Resolution of the Verkhovna Rada (Parliament) of Ukraine “On the Procedure for Entry into Force of the Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organisations Act”, as amended on 23 December 1993, read as follows: “... 6. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Government of the Crimea and the regional, Kyiv and Sevastopol State Administrations shall ensure in accordance with the Act the return to the ownership of or free use of religious buildings and property by religious groups, taking into account the following: - the rights of the religious organisations which owned these buildings and property when they were nationalised; - the rights of the religious organisations which use these buildings and property in accordance with the procedure established by law; - investments made by the religious organisations in the property, rebuilding of the religious premises and length of use of such premises; - existence in the same residential area of other religious premises and their use by other religious organisations ...; - other important matters in their entirety. The decision of the relevant State body shall be reasoned ...” 32. Under the Presidential Decree of 4 March 1992 “On Measures Relating to the Return of Religious Property to Religious Organisations” it was established that all religious premises and property owned by the State and used “contrary to their mission” should be returned to the religious associations within the period 1992-1993. This period was further extended until 1 December 1997 by a Presidential Executive Order of 22 June 1994. On 21 March 2002 the President issued another decree “On Urgent Measures Relating to the Final Overcoming of the Negative Impact of the Totalitarian Policy of the Former Soviet Union with regard to Religion and on Restoration of the Breached Rights of Churches and Religious Organisations”, in which he recommended that regional bodies of local selfgovernment finalise the transfer of church premises that were being used “contrary to their designation”, and other buildings, to religious organisations. 33. Resolution No. 83 of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine of 5 April 1991 (in force until 5 February 2002) “On the List of Historical Architectural Monuments which shall not be subject to Transfer to Permanent Use by Religious Organisations”, provided that the following cathedrals in Sevastopol were not to be returned to religious organisations: Volodymyrsky Cathedral (XIX century), Petropavlivsky Cathedral and Mykhaylivsky Cathedral (XIX century). 34. By Resolution No. 137 “On the Conditions of Transfer of Religious Premises which are Architectural Monuments to Religious Organisations” , adopted on 14 February 2002 by the Cabinet of Ministers, it was decided that such religious premises could be given to religious organisations for permanent use if the relevant educational institutions, archives or cultural institutions were moved to other premises. 35. On 14 July 1997 the Constitutional Court rejected a request for interpretation of section 17 § 3 of the Act, stating, inter alia, that complaints concerning the use of religious buildings and property were to be examined by courts of general jurisdiction. It also referred to the recommendations of the Presidium of the Higher Commercial (former Arbitration) Court in that regard. 36. On 21 October 1997 the Constitutional Court rejected a request for interpretation of the provisions of section 17 § 2 of the Act, lodged by the Greek-Catholic community “Preobrazhenska”, finding, inter alia, that there was no proof of inconsistent application of its provisions by the domestic courts. 37. According to paragraph 7 of the Practice Recommendation, the religious premises and property that belonged to State property were to be transferred into unpaid use or ownership of the religious organisations on the basis of the decisions taken by the regional, Kyiv and Sevastopol city state administrations and the Government of Crimea. The above-mentioned authorities were under an obligation to return such property, not used for religious purposes, within a period from 1992-1993. The return of property included transfer into unpaid use or ownership. The property could be returned to religious associations, which proved that they had owned the property before nationalisation. Thus, the Recommendation, with reference to Presidential Decree of 22 June 1996, mentioned that the transfer of ownership of the religious premises was one of the measures envisaged by law. Moreover, religious premises or property could be transferred to another religious association if there was no “legal successor” (правонаступник) religious association found in the vicinity where the religious premises or property were situated. 38. Paragraph 9.3 of the Practice Recommendation provided that property was to be returned to the same religious confessions which had owned the religious buildings before nationalization (orthodox church to be returned to orthodox community, Roman-Catholic church to RomanCatholic community, etc.). Information or written evidence as to the previous ownership of religious premises was to be sought from the parties, State archives, or State Religions Committee (paragraph 9.4 of the Recommendation). Claims for the return of religious premises to their original ownership could be lodged under the provisions of the Property Act with the commercial courts, and the lodging of complaints with the courts of general jurisdiction did not impede the examination of such claims (paragraphs 9.4-9.6 of the Recommendation). 39. Paragraph 9.8 of the Practice Recommendation stated that all property belonging to religious organisations before the entry into force of the Act was deemed to belong to the State and the State was to be regarded as the proper owner of such property. In particular, this ensued from the provisions of Article 366 of the Administrative Code of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic of 1927. Therefore, in accordance with section 4 of the Property Act, State bodies, which are mentioned in Section 17 of the law, could perform any lawful acts with respect to such property and the courts were to reject any claims against such lawful acts, unless these acts contravened the law. 40. The applicant association submitted two decisions of the Sevastopol City Council dated 29 December 1999 and 4 July 2006, by which title to former religious premises that were in communal ownership and used for cultural purposes had been transferred to Christian Orthodox communities in Sevastopol. By the decision of 29 December 1999 the Sevastopol City State Administration transferred title to the religious premises of the former St. Peter and Paul Cathedral, which had been used by the City Palace of Culture, to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. According to the decision of 4 July 2006, the Sevastopol Centre of Culture and Arts was to be moved to different premises. 41. Article 2 of the 1991 Property Act (repealed by the Act of 27 April 2007), hereafter – the Property Act, established three forms of property ownership in Ukraine, which included private, collective and State property, with all three forms receiving equal protection from the State. Article 31 of the Property Act provides that the State property includes the State property itself and the property of administrative-territorial units (municipal or communal property). According to Article 32 of the Property Act, the subjects of the State property administration were the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine (in relation to national property) and regional, district, town and village councils (in relation to communal property). Under Article 33 of the Property Act the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the local council were responsible for administration of State property. Article 35 of the Property Act provides that communal property consisted of inter alia property necessary for ensuring economic and social development of a particular territory. 42. Paragraphs 3-5 of Article 16 of the Local Self-Government Act, in line with Article 142 of the Constitution of Ukraine, provide that the bodies of local self-government that represent local territorial communities, including the regional councils, shall be responsible for administration of “communal property”. 43. According to paragraphs 1-3 of the Cabinet of Ministers Resolution No. 311 of 5 November 1991 “On Separation of State Property of Ukraine into State-owned (Republican) Property and Property of the Administrative-territorial entities”, the “cultural property” had to be transferred into communal property and administered by the local territorial community of Sevastopol from the State property. 44. According to Article 248-11 of the Code, the courts had jurisdiction to hear complaints concerning decisions of State bodies with regard to the registration of religious associations and the ownership and use of religious property. Under Article 248-12 such complaints were to be lodged with the regional courts, the Kyiv and Sevastopol City Courts and, exceptionally, with the Supreme Court if the complaint concerned the State Religions Committee. A complaint could be lodged within a period of a month from the date of the decision. According to Article 248-13 of the Code, the complaint had to be examined within a period of ten days, if necessary with the participation of the complainant and the respondent State body. Under Article 248-13 of the Code, the court could order the State body to rectify its previous decisions so as to ensure that they complied with the law. The courts were to reject the claims if the State bodies’ decisions were lawful. 45. In accordance with Article 1 of the Code of Arbitration Procedure, in force at the material time, that is to say, before 21 June 2001, legal entities and private entrepreneurs engaged in business activities were entitled to apply to the arbitration courts, in accordance with the relevant jurisdictional rules, for the protection of their legal rights and interests. 46. Article 14 of the Code established that the Higher Arbitration Court had jurisdiction over complaints against the Regional State Administrations. In accordance with the rules on exclusive jurisdiction, under Article 16 of the Code cases concerning the enjoyment of possessions were to be examined in the arbitration court with jurisdiction for the area in which the property was situated. Under Article 17 of the Code, the court which had been wrongly seised was required to transfer the case file to another court that had jurisdiction in the case.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"1. The applicant, Mr Daniel Molga, is a Polish national who was born in 1998 and lives in Radom. He was initially represented before the Court by his mother, and subsequently by Mr T. Rowiński, a lawyer practising in Lublin. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 3. The applicant’s father, Mr Włodzimierz Molga (“W.M.”), lived with the applicant’s mother, Ms R.L. 4. The applicant’s father sold clothes at a local market. On 31 August 1998 the Radom District Court convicted him in summary proceedings of the unauthorised use of a registered trademark. It fined him 700 Polish zlotys (PLN, approximately 175 euros (EUR)), convertible to 35 days’ imprisonment in case of default. 5. On 22 December 1998 the court decided that W.M. could pay the fine in seven monthly instalments, starting from December 1998. According to the court’s records, W.M. paid PLN 600 of his fine. A court bailiff instituted enforcement proceedings to recover the outstanding PLN 100, but to no avail. 6. On 8 June 2004 the Radom District Court ordered that W.M. serve a term of five days’ imprisonment in respect of the unpaid fine. It appears that W.M. had been summoned to the hearing but did not appear. 7. W.M. was unsuccessfully summoned to surrender himself to a remand centre. On 19 October 2004 the Radom District Court ordered that he be arrested and taken to the remand centre. On 16 November 2004 at about 5 p.m. the police arrested W.M. outside his home. On 17 November 2004 at about 9 a.m. he was taken to Radom Remand Centre to serve his fiveday sentence. 8. At the remand centre W.M. refused a routine examination by a nurse. He was then examined by a doctor, who cleared his admission. Subsequently, W.M. was placed in a transit cell no. 4. At about 12 noon a prison guard, M.D., noticed that W.M. was lying on the floor with his belt tied around his neck. The other end of the belt was tied to a chair. The guards, M.D. and A.R., and later the nurse tried to resuscitate W.M. He was declared dead at about 12.30 p.m. W.M. was 52 at the time. A prosecutor and the police arrived at the scene later. 9. On 22 November 2004 the Radom police opened an investigation under the heading of involuntary homicide (Article 155 of the Criminal Code, hereinafter “the CC”). The investigation was later taken over by the Radom District Prosecutor. 10. On an unspecified date a post-mortem was carried out. In his report, the forensic expert concluded that the direct cause of death had been hanging and that it could be assumed that it had been an act of suicide. 11. The prosecutor found no evidence pointing to the involvement of third parties in the incident. With regard to a possible failure to act by the prison guards, the prosecutor questioned M.D., the guard who had been supervising W.M. at the relevant time (see paragraph 8 above). Having regard to the evidence, the prosecutor found that the prison guards responsible for W.M.’s safety had acted beyond reproach. The guards had not breached the applicable regulations by letting W.M. keep his belt. Furthermore, the prosecutor found no shortcomings in the prison guards’ reaction after seeing W.M. lying on the ground. She concluded that the prison guards had not committed an offence. 12. On 28 February 2005 the Radom District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation after establishing that the actions of the prison guards had not constituted a criminal offence. 13. On 12 August 2008 the applicant’s mother complained to the Ministry of Justice that she had not been served with the Radom District Prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the investigation. 14. On 6 October 2008 the Radom District Prosecutor ordered that the applicant’s mother be served with a copy of the decision. 15. By a letter dated 9 October 2008 the applicant’s mother was informed by the Radom District Prosecutor that she had been formally notified of the opening of the investigation into her partner’s death on 30 November 2004. The letter said that the applicant’s mother had twice been summoned to the Radom police headquarters for an interview, which she had not attended. Subsequently, a police officer had visited her flat but had not been allowed to enter. Further summonses sent to the applicant’s mother had not been answered. On 28 December 2004 the applicant’s mother had gone to police headquarters and had insisted that she did not wish to be contacted in connection with W.M.’s death. Accordingly, the district prosecutor had served the decision to discontinue the investigation on R.L., W.M.’s adult son and the applicant’s half-brother. 16. On 9 January 2009 the applicant’s mother was served with the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the investigation. She lodged an appeal against that decision dated 13 January 2009. Her appeal was rejected as submitted out of time. On an unspecified date the applicant’s mother requested the district prosecutor to grant her leave to appeal out of time. On 5 February 2009 the prosecutor refused that request. The applicant appealed. On 7 April 2009 the Radom District Court upheld the prosecutor’s decision. No further appeal lay against this decision. In consequence, the decision to discontinue the investigation of 28 February 2005 became final. 17. On 12 June 2012 the applicant, represented by his mother, relying on Article 327 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (hereinafter, “the CCP”), requested that the Radom-Wschód District Prosecutor open de novo (podjęcie na nowo) the investigation into his father’s death. He requested that the prosecutor obtain the file of the civil proceedings against the State Treasury in which the courts had determined that there existed a causal link between the failures of the prison guards and his father’s suicide (see paragraphs 36-43 below). He pointed out the discrepancy between the findings of the district prosecutor and the civil courts. The applicant’s mother also produced proof of payment of all seven instalments of the fine imposed on W.M. 18. The investigation was opened de novo on 15 February 2013. 19. On 28 June 2013 the Radom-Wschód District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation into the alleged failure by the prison guards to fulfil their duties. The allegation was related to their failure to keep the applicant’s father under constant surveillance and to seize his belt, which he had used to commit suicide (Article 231 § 1 in conjunction with Article 155 of the CC, see paragraph 44 below). The prosecutor established that those acts did not constitute a criminal offence. 20. The prosecutor also discontinued the investigation into alleged negligence by Ms E.W., a clerk at the Radom District Court who had incorrectly credited a payment of PLN 100 by W.M. to another debtor. The prosecutor established that prosecution of the impugned offence had become time-barred. 21. With regard to the facts, the prosecutor established that during W.M.’s admission to the remand centre on 17 November 2004, the prison guard S.S. had noticed that W.M. had been anxious and tearful. W.M. had contested his imprisonment as unjust. Consequently, the guards S.S. and R.D. had decided to check with Radom District Court as to whether the fine had been paid and were told that that was not the case. Next, W.M. was to be examined by a male nurse, M.S. The male nurse noticed that W.M. had been agitated and tearful and had declared that he would go on a hunger strike. Having regard to those circumstances, the male nurse had requested that W.M. be taken to a medical room for examination by a doctor. At about 11 a.m. W.M. had been taken to a medical room where he was to be examined by a doctor, D.C. W.M. had been anxious, tearful and convinced that he had been wronged by the court and the police. W.M. had refused to be examined or take any medication. He had also declared that he would refuse any food and drink in protest at his imprisonment. W.M. had not revealed any suicidal thoughts. Doctor D.C. had agreed to W.M.’s incarceration but had recommended that he be seen by a psychiatrist at a later date. 22. At about 11.40 a.m. W.M. had been taken to transit cell no. 4 where he was to wait for his prison underwear and hygiene products. At about 12 noon the prison guard M.D. had seen through the peephole that W.M. was lying on the floor. M.D. had entered the cell and noticed that a belt was tied around W.M.’s neck. He had taken the belt off W.M.’s neck and, together with another guard, A.R., had begun resuscitation procedures. At about 12.30 p.m. an emergency services doctor had declared W.M. dead. 23. The prosecutor also had regard to the findings of the forensic expert. The expert, having carried out a post-mortem, established the presence of a slight strangulation mark on W.M.’s neck and a number of injuries which had likely resulted from his hitting objects while in convulsion. The expert further established that the direct cause of death had been hanging. The result of his examination allowed it to be established that it had been a suicide. 24. The prosecutor found no evidence pointing to the involvement of third parties in the impugned incident. 25. The prosecutor took a number of investigative measures aimed at determining whether the prison guards had failed to fulfil their duties. She interviewed the prison guard M.D. He testified that certain objects, such as mobile telephones, penknives and screwdrivers, were taken from prisoners. However, the applicable regulations did not require that belts or laces should also be seized. The prosecutor analysed the applicable regulations and concluded that belts and laces were not regarded as dangerous objects. 26. With regard to alleged negligence on the part of the prison, the prosecutor established that the actions of the prison guards had not disclosed any failure to fulfil their duties. The prison guards had acted with appropriate diligence in supervising W.M. Not seizing W.M.’s belt in the process of his admission to the remand centre had been in compliance with the relevant regulations. There had been no grounds to suspect that W.M. would make an attempt on his own life despite his strong emotional reaction to his incarceration. The doctor interviewing W.M. had not identified any suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, after seeing W.M. lying unconscious on the floor, the prison guards had reacted appropriately to the situation. In conclusion, the prosecutor found that the actions of the prison guards had not constituted any of the criminal offences prescribed in Articles 231 and 155 of the CC. 27. On 11 July 2013 the applicant’s mother appealed against the prosecutor’s decision. She argued, inter alia, that the prison guards had failed in their duties by not seizing W.M.’s belt. That, in consequence, had led to his suicide and death. 28. On 10 October 2013 the Radom District Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the prosecutor’s decision. 29. The court noted that the applicant’s mother had sought to have the investigation continued and for charges to be brought against specific individuals, eventually leading to their trial and conviction. However, the evidence secured in the investigation had not provided any grounds to accept such a demand. 30. The court found that the prosecutor had correctly established the facts and had properly assessed the comprehensive evidence obtained in the case. It noted that the prosecutor had carried out a number of investigative measures aimed at determining if there had possibly been negligence on the part of the prison guards. However, no such negligence had been established. 31. The court found nothing untoward in the manner in which the prison guards had carried out their duties vis-à-vis the applicant’s father. They had ensured, inter alia, that the applicant’s father had been seen by a doctor. There had been no grounds to believe that the applicant’s father would commit suicide, despite his strong emotional reaction to imprisonment. In accordance with the applicable regulations, the prison guards had not been required to seize the applicant’s father’s belt. Furthermore, they had attempted to resuscitate the applicant’s father. In conclusion, the court accepted the prosecutor’s finding that the actions of the prison guards had not amounted to any of the offences prescribed in Articles 231 and 155 of the CC. It noted that the findings of the civil court could not alter that conclusion and lead to attributing criminal responsibility to the prison guards. The court found that the applicant’s mother had not indicated any relevant circumstances which could lead to the prosecutor’s decision being overturned. 32. The court also accepted the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the investigation with regard to the court clerk. 33. On 11 January 2010 the applicant brought a claim against the State Treasury with the Radom Regional Court. His mother acted on his behalf since the applicant was a minor. He sought PLN 1,000,000 (approximately EUR 250,000) in compensation and a monthly allowance of PLN 3,000 (approximately EUR 750) in connection with his father’s death. The applicant argued that the State Treasury was liable for his father’s death on account of gross negligence by the prison guards who had failed to ensure his father’s safety. In his view, the belt had been a dangerous object and should definitely have been seized by the prison guards. 34. On 30 September 2010 the Radom Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s claim. It held that the prison guards had acted lawfully and in accordance with the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences and that therefore the State Treasury could not be held liable. In addition, the court held that there had been no causal link between W.M.’s death and the actions of the prison guards. 35. The Regional Court established that W.M. had been agitated during his admission to the remand centre but considered that to be a standard reaction. The prison guards had checked with Radom District Court and, despite W.M.’s claims to the contrary, it had confirmed that one instalment of W.M.’s fine had not been paid. During his medical examination, W.M. had informed the doctor that he had left children at home unsupervised but he had not revealed any suicidal thoughts. The doctor had concluded that W.M. could be admitted to the remand centre and that there was no need for an immediate psychiatric consultation. Having regard to the above, the court found that there was nothing in W.M.’s medical history or circumstances related to the offence which would have indicated that he needed to be put under particularly close supervision or that his belt should have been seized. 36. The applicant appealed. On 8 February 2011 the Lublin Court of Appeal partly allowed his claim. It found the State Treasury liable under Article 417 § 1 of the Civil Code and awarded the applicant PLN 70,000 (approximately EUR 18,000) in compensation and a monthly allowance of PLN 500 (approximately EUR 125). The court dismissed the remainder of the applicant’s appeal. 37. The Court of Appeal noted that under Article 108 § 1 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences, the administration of a penal institution had a duty to ensure prisoners’’s behaviour could not be considered as simple agitation. His behaviour had suggested a nervous breakdown caused by a feeling of injustice as W.M. had been convinced that he had paid the fine in full. For example, the prison guard M.S. had stated in his report that W.M. had displayed disturbing behaviour (hitting the bed with his fist), had been tearful, anxious and agitated, and had declared that he would go on a hunger strike. 38. The Court of Appeal found that since W.M.’s behaviour had been very different from the norm and that a psychiatric consultation had been recommended for him, then the prison guards should have taken all the necessary steps to ensure his safety. They should have seized any object presenting a risk to his life or health, including his belt or, alternatively, should have put him under constant supervision. Such actions would have prevented W.M.’s death. The court thus held that there was a causal link between the omissions of the prison guards and W.M.’s death. 39. With regard to the claim for compensation, the Court of Appeal noted that under Article 446 § 3 of the Civil Code it could award an appropriate level of compensation to relatives of a deceased if their situation significantly deteriorated as a result of the person’s death. A significant deterioration in a claimant’s situation depended on the degree of adverse material and immaterial consequences resulting from the death of a relative. The Court of Appeal found that the amount of compensation sought was grossly excessive and that the claimant (the applicant) had not established that his situation had deteriorated to such a degree. For the claimant, the death of his father when he was six years old had certainly been a particularly acute loss which had limited his prospects in life and had amounted to a loss of natural support. Having regard to those and other relevant factors, the court found that the appropriate level of compensation was PLN 70,000 (approximately EUR 18,000). 40. The amount of monthly allowance sought by the applicant was also inflated, the court found. The size should not be higher than the amount W.M. would have contributed as a father. Having regard to W.M.’s financial situation prior to his death, the court found that a monthly allowance of PLN 500 (approximately EUR 125) was reasonable and commensurate with the applicant’s justified needs. 41. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal, contesting the amounts of compensation and monthly allowance as too low. The State Treasury also lodged a cassation appeal. On 22 November 2011 the Supreme Court accepted the defendant’s cassation appeal for examination and refused to admit that of the applicant. 42. On 22 February 2012 the Supreme Court quashed the Court of Appeal’s judgment in part and remitted the case. It held that the lower court had failed to examine the defendant’s plea that the claim was time-barred. However, it upheld the Court of Appeal’s findings in respect of the prison guards’ failure to ensure the safety of the applicant’s father (see paragraphs 37-38 above). 43. On 31 May 2012 the Lublin Court of Appeal gave a judgment awarding the same level of compensation and monthly allowance to the applicant and dismissing the remainder of the defendant’s appeal. The court examined the defendant’s plea based on the limitation period. To that end the court heard the applicant’s mother. It established that in April 2012 the applicant’s mother had found proof of payment of all seven instalments of the fine imposed on her partner made between December 1998 and June 1999. It further established that the prosecutor had refused to consider her a party to the investigation and to grant her access to the file. It had only been after the applicant’s mother had complained to the Ministry of Justice that she had been served with the decision to discontinue the investigation on 9 January 2009 (see paragraph 16 above). Accordingly, the three-year limitation period should start to run on the latter date. As the claim had been brought on 11 January 2010 (see paragraph 33 above), the defendant’s plea had to be dismissed. 44. Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution refers to the State’s civil liability in the following way: “Everyone shall have the right to compensation for any harm done to him by any act of a public authority in breach of the law.” 45. In a judgment (no. SK 18/00) of 4 December 2001, the Constitutional Court examined the compatibility of Article 417 of the Civil Code with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution. It held, inter alia, that: “In accordance with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution, the sole basis for [State civil] liability is an unlawful act by a public authority, it is of no significance whether such an act was subjectively culpable (subiektywnie zawinione). ... Having regard to the conditions for [State] liability laid down in Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution previously analysed, there is no doubt that ‘the personal culpability of a state official’ does not form part of the list of conditions necessary for liability on the part of the public authorities.” 46. Article 417 § 1 of the Civil Code, as applicable from 1 September 2004, provides as follows: “The State Treasury or [,as the case may be,] a local self-government entity or other legal person responsible for exercising public authority, shall be liable for any damage (szkoda) caused by an unlawful act or omission [committed] in connection with the exercise of public authority.” 47. Article 155 of the Criminal Code provides as follows: “Anyone who unintentionally causes the death of another person shall be subject to the penalty of deprivation of liberty for a term of between 3 months and 5 years.” Article 231 § 1 of the Criminal Code reads as follows: “A public official who, by overstepping his powers or not fulfilling his duties, acts to the detriment of public or private interests shall be liable to a sentence of imprisonment of up to three years.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

BULGARIA (No. 2),4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect),André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Erik Møse;Mārtiņš Mits;Pavlina Panova;Síofra O’Leary;Yonko Grozev,"6. The applicant was born in 1968 and is currently detained in Vratsa Prison. 7. In 2012 the applicant was detained in Varna Prison, serving a combined sentence of eighteen years’ imprisonment for aggravated murder, lewd acts, aggravated theft and car theft. 8. He suffers from many chronic medical conditions and a personality disorder which manifested itself in, inter alia, several attempts at self-harm and some suicide threats. 9. In 2007 the applicant was treated on the psychiatric ward of Lovech Prison Hospital. 10. Following his placement in an isolation cell in April 2008, he again threatened to harm himself and for eight days was kept almost constantly immobile by having his hands and feet handcuffed to a bed (see Dimcho Dimov v. Bulgaria, no. 57123/08, 16 December 2014, where the Court found violations of the substantive and procedural limbs of Article 3 of the Convention in that regard). 11. In early 2012 the applicant was part of a prisoner group that included Mr K.I. The latter was serving a combined sentence of six and a half years for aggravated racketeering and numerous instances of threats of murder and aggravated hooliganism. According to a later psychological report, Mr K.I. had previously been admitted many times to the psychiatric ward of Lovech Prison Hospital and he suffered from a mixed personality disorder with elements of dissocial behaviour, paranoia and emotional instability. 12. On the morning of 15 February 2012 the applicant went to the wing for prisoners who were being transferred to fetch a mattress he had allegedly lent to another inmate. When he entered the cell, Mr K.I., with whom he had had a conflict since January that year, began arguing with him, telling him that he had no right to come in and remove items. A guard intervened and took the applicant out of the wing, leaving him in the prison barbershop. According to statements made by the applicant later, Mr K.I. followed him, grabbed him by the collar through the bars separating the barbershop from the corridor, and hit him on the head and nose. In a report drawn up several days later, the social worker in charge of the applicant’s group said that there was no evidence of such an incident as no other inmate had confirmed the applicant’s allegations, and the applicant had not requested a medical examination. 13. Alerted by the guard, the social worker came and talked with the applicant, repeating that he could not go back into that wing. According to her report about the incident, her words upset him and he began arguing with her in a loud voice. That in turn irritated Mr K.I., who began to shout at the applicant. The social worker took Mr K.I. and two other inmates to a cell, where she reminded them of their duties and warned them that any violence would be in breach of prison rules and entail disciplinary measures. They agreed that they had overreacted and undertook to make efforts to put relations in the group right. After that, the social worker had a talk with the applicant, who was in a highly emotional state. She told him of Mr K.I.’s undertaking to calm the conflict. The applicant began shouting and insulting Mr K.I., who heard him and shouted back. To calm things down, the social worker had the applicant isolated in a cell. 14. The next day, the social worker received complaints from five other inmates from the group. They protested against the applicant’s return to the group, saying that he had systematically bullied and assaulted them. The applicant also filed a complaint, saying that he could no longer remain in the same group as Mr K.I. 15. As a result, on 21 February 2012 the social worker recommended that the prison governor move the applicant to another group. She was of the view that his remaining in his old group would worsen relations within it because he would take on inmates who had not taken his side in the conflict with Mr K.I., which would also be bad for his emotional well-being and security. In the meantime, the applicant was provisionally held in a cell on another floor. 16. Six days after the first incident, on 21 February 2012, a guard took the applicant back to his old corridor so that he could fetch his belongings from his locker. According to the guard’s report, filed the same day, the applicant swore at and threatened Mr K.I. when passing him by. The latter, upset, punched the applicant on the jaw. The social worker carried out an enquiry over the following days at the request of the prison governor and obtained statements from eight other inmates, confirming the events. She proposed that Mr K.I. be given a disciplinary warning and that the applicant be kept in his new group to avoid further altercations between the two. As a result of the blow he had received the applicant suffered a fractured jaw, but this was not detected immediately (see paragraphs 18, 25 and 28 below). Three weeks after the incident, on 13 March 2012, the prison governor issued Mr K.I. with a disciplinary warning. 17. The applicant expressed no wish to be given a medical examination after the incident which allegedly took place on 15 February 2012. 18. After the incident on 21 February 2012 he was brought to Varna Prison’s medical centre, where he was seen by the feldsher as the prison’s only doctor was on long-term sick leave at the time (see paragraph 40 below). The applicant told the feldsher that he had been punched next to his right ear and had pain in the ear and the lower jaw. The feldsher noted some redness in his ear, but reported nothing more serious. She also noted that the applicant had no signs of other traumatic injuries to his body. She wrote a note to the prison administration, detailing her findings. According to a statement which he made in the course of the ensuing criminal proceedings against Mr K.I. (see paragraph 35 below), the applicant asked the feldsher to send him for an X-ray, but she refused. 19. On 22 February 2012 the applicant went to the medical centre again and was given vitamins, an anti-inflammatory drug, a muscle relaxant and antibiotics. 20. He visited the centre once more on 24 February 2012 and was given a painkiller. 21. According to a statement by the applicant in the criminal proceedings against Mr K.I. (see paragraph 35 below), he repeatedly asked to be sent to an external medical specialist for an examination. 22. His next visit to the centre was on 7 March 2012, when he complained of a loss of hearing in his right ear. The feldsher decided to refer him to an external specialist. The consultation took place seven weeks later, on 26 April 2012 (see paragraph 25 below). The Government said the delay was because the applicant’s symptoms had not suggested that he had a medical condition that required urgent attention and because it took time to organise a medical examination outside the prison. 23. The applicant went to the prison’s medical centre again on 13 March 2012 and threatened to go on a hunger strike. According to a statement which he made in the course of the criminal proceedings against Mr K.I. (see paragraph 35 below), he made that threat to pressure the prison authorities to send him for a medical examination by an outside specialist. 24. His next visit to the centre was on 23 April 2012, when he obtained a painkiller but apparently did not complain further about his health. 25. On 26 April 2012 the applicant was seen by an external otolaryngologist, who noted that he was experiencing pain in his right temporomandibular joint and ears and had poor hearing. He also noted that the applicant had some redness on his eardrums. He prescribed painkillers and antibiotics, and suggested that the applicant be seen by a maxillofacial surgeon. The prison paid for the consultation. 26. On 27 April and 7 and 10 May 2012 the applicant again visited the prison’s medical centre and obtained antibiotics and analgesics. On 12 May 2012 he was taken out of prison for a consultation with a psychiatrist. 27. On 14 May 2012 the prison’s feldsher told the applicant that she would ask the prison administration to pay for a consultation with a maxillofacial surgeon. The Government explained that that had been necessary because such consultations were not covered by Bulgaria’s health insurance scheme and the prison had to make a special payment for such a consultation. 28. On 19 May 2012 the applicant was examined by a maxillofacial surgeon and given a panoramic X-ray. The surgeon noted that the applicant had a fracture of the right condyloid process that had not healed properly and post-traumatic arthritis of the right temporomandibular joint. He recommended that the applicant have physiotherapy for that joint. The consultation and the X-ray were paid for by the prison administration. 29. On 21 May 2012 the prison feldsher offered to send the applicant to Sofia Prison Hospital for physiotherapy. He refused. 30. On 15 June 2012 the applicant agreed to be sent to Sofia Prison Hospital, and was admitted on 18 July 2012. He was examined and given an X-ray of the skull. It was noted that he had a fracture of the jaw that had already healed and could no longer be operated on, and a deviated nasal septum. He was treated with antipsychotic, anticonvulsant and moodstabilising drugs, and had physiotherapy for his temporomandibular joints. He was in the hospital until 1 August 2012, when he returned to Varna Prison. 31. Between June and October 2012 the applicant visited the prison medical centre on several occasions. He was generally given pain medication and further on request external medical consultations were discussed. 32. The second consultation with an otolaryngologist took place on 27 December 2012. She noted that the applicant complained of poor hearing and pain in the right ear. She found that he had normal eardrums but poor teeth, which caused luxation of the temporomandibular joint, and also had a dysfunction of that joint. She prescribed painkillers. 33. In a medical report drawn up on 11 February 2013, the Varna Prison doctor noted that the applicant had no money to pay for surgery on his jawbone and that the national health insurance scheme did not cover it. In November 2013 the applicant had surgery for the deviated nasal septum in a hospital in Varna. 34. On an unknown date in 2012 the applicant complained to the Varna district prosecutor’s office about the incidents on 15 and 21 February 2012. In June 2012 the prosecutor’s office refused to open criminal proceedings. It found that no prison staff had committed any offences during the incidents. On appeal by the applicant, the Varna regional prosecutor’s office upheld that decision in August 2012. The applicant appealed further and, on 10 October 2012, the Varna appellate prosecutor’s office quashed the refusal to open criminal proceedings against Mr K.I., but upheld the refusal to open proceedings against prison staff. It noted that the internal inquiry had established that the incident involving the two inmates had been promptly dealt with and that there had been no culpable omissions by prison staff. It referred the case back with instructions to the lower prosecutor’s offices to check whether Mr K.I.’s actions had amounted to causing moderate bodily harm. 35. Following a criminal investigation and delays in the resulting trial due to Mr K.I.’s mental health, in February 2015 the Varna District Court found Mr K.I. guilty of causing moderate bodily harm to the applicant by breaking his jaw. It sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment and ordered him to pay the applicant 2,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN) in respect of nonpecuniary damage. The court noted that the fracture had impaired the applicant’s chewing and speech functions for at least four months and had caused him considerable pain and suffering (see прис. № 68 от 12.02.2015 г. по н. о. х. д. № 3419/2013 г., РС-Варна). 36. In March 2016, following an appeal by Mr K.I., the Varna Regional Court fully upheld the lower court’s judgment (see реш. № 61 от 07.03.2016 г. по в. н. о. х. д. № 301/2015 г., ОС-Варна). 37. In September 2014 the applicant brought a claim for damages against the Chief Directorate for the Execution of Punishments at the Ministry of Justice. He alleged that over the previous two months the authorities at Varna Prison had failed to provide him with adequate medical care for pain in the right ear, his fractured jaw and numbness in his left arm. 38. The Varna Administrative Court heard the case on 1 December 2014 and 2 February 2015, when the applicant unexpectedly withdrew his claim and the court discontinued the proceedings.",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0

AUSTRIA,4,Inadmissible,Dmitry Dedov;Elisabeth Steiner;Erik Møse;Isabelle Berro-Lefèvre;Khanlar Hajiyev;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Ksenija Turković,"1. The applicant, Mr Stefan Lichtenstrasser, is an Austrian national, who was born in 1977 and lives in Pfaffstätten. He was represented before the Court by Mr R. Kilches, a lawyer practising in Vienna. 2. The applicant was employed by the C. company from 1999 to 2004. On 9 November 2004 he attended a trade show for young entrepreneurs and gave an interview to a journalist. In this interview, he stated that in his opinion it was only possible to develop ideas in one’s own company, whereas this was difficult when working for an enterprise. He further declared that he intended to set up his own company together with a partner. He explained that they were not discouraged by the fact that a loan and a lot of work input was required. This statement was quoted on 10 November 2004 in the daily newspaper “Wirtschaftsblatt” in a report on the topic why young people dared to become self-employed, under the headline “We simply want more freedom”. One of the applicant’s superiors read the newspaper article and confronted the applicant with it on 16 November 2004. 3. The next day the applicant was told that the company wished to end the working contract. In order not to harm his future career, his superior advised him to either give notice out of his own motion, or end the contract in mutual consent (einvernehmliche Auflösung). If he did not choose one of the two options, the company would dismiss him. 4. After having reflected on the options, the applicant ended the contract in mutual consent with the company by a signed agreement dated 17 November 2004. The parties agreed that the contract ended on 30 November 2004 and that the applicant received the statutory dismissal pay (gesetzliche Abfertigung) of three months’ salary. They agreed that the applicant was off duty from that day on. The parties however did not agree on the payment of a compensation for the dismissal of the applicant. 5. On 24 November 2004 the applicant, represented by counsel, filed an action against his former employer challenging the mutual agreement at the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht). He claimed that he had been under duress when signing the agreement. By terminating the employment agreement mutually he had waived several entitlements which he had not been informed about. 6. The applicant set the value of the dispute at 4,500 euros (EUR). The opponent company objected to this value and argued that the action rather concerned a declaratory judgment that the contract was still in force. According to the law the value should thus be set at EUR 462,000 (i.e. ten years’ salary), but at least EUR 138,600 (i.e. three years’ salary). The court set the value at EUR 138,600. 7. In its judgment of 18 July 2006 the Vienna Labour and Social Court (Arbeits- und Sozialgericht) dismissed the applicant’s claim. In its reasoning the court noted that the applicant had had time to reflect on the possibilities offered to him by his employer and read the agreement before signing it. The court found that the applicant was under no pressure when signing the agreement and his superior had not misused the special emotional situation of the applicant. The court also noted that the applicant obviously regretted having agreed on the termination without receiving a compensation for the dismissal. 8. The applicant appealed and argued, inter alia, that the value was set too high and that the legal reasoning was wrong. He also argued that not only the State but also the employer were held to observe his rights under Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”). 9. On 25 July 2007 the Vienna Court of Appeal upheld the decision on the merits and the value at issue, holding that the value as set by the first instance court was not against the law. It noted that the value determined by the court of first instance was only challengeable if it was contrary to the law, but apart from that there was a margin of discretion afforded to the first instance. The Court of Appeal pointed out that the first instance had set the value at a fairly low rate. 10. The applicant lodged an extraordinary appeal with the Supreme Court and again argued that the employer had disregarded the applicant’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention. 11. On 28 November 2007 the Supreme Court refused to deal with the merits of the case for lack of an important question of law; it held that it had no jurisdiction to alter the set value at issue. The applicant was obliged to pay the costs of the court proceedings and of the opponent’s lawyer. This decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 23 January 2008. 12. According to Austrian labour law, an employee can in principle be dismissed without the employer being obliged to give any reason. The employer only has to respect the period for giving notice (Kündigungsfrist) and the dismissal date (Kündigungstermin). Only in case of a dismissal without notice (Entlassung) the employer would be obliged to rely on an important reason prescribed by law. 13. Section 29 of the Private Employees Act (Angestelltengesetz) stipulates that in case the employee is sent off-duty after a dismissal or in case of a dismissal without notice without an important reason, he or she is entitled to compensation for the dismissal (Kündigungsentschädigung). The employee is hence entitled to the full salary until the end of the period of notice and the aliquot part of the Christmas bonus (Weihnachtsgeld) and holiday pay (Urlaubsgeld). Furthermore the employee is entitled to a compensation for any vacation he did not consume (Urlaubsentschädigung). 14. In addition to the compensation for dismissal an employee is entitled to dismissal pay (Abfertigung) according to Section 23 of the Private Employees Act. This dismissal pay is paid out if the contract was concluded before 1 January 2003 and the employee had worked for the company for more than three years. The amount of the dismissal pay depends on the years of service. 15. In case an employment contract is terminated by mutual agreement, the parties are free to agree on the payment or the amount of the compensation for the dismissal. However, the payment of the dismissal pay is compulsory. 16. According to Article 879 and 1385 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) an agreement (Vergleich) can only be challenged in case the parties were mistaken about an essential fact of the agreement, in case of an error of expression or in case of extortion (Wucher). 17. According to Section 58 of the Act on Exercise of Jurisdiction (Jurisdiktionsnorm), in a court case regarding an action for a declaratory judgment that an employment contract is still in force, the value should be set at ten years’ salary of the employee. 18. In general, when a party challenges the fixing of the value of the claim, the court of first instance has to do so in accordance with Article 7 of the Lawyer’s Fees Act (Rechtsanwaltstarifgesetz). This decision is contestable only if it is contrary to mandatory rules. The value of the claim is the basis for the court costs and the lawyer’s fees.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
181,001-167180,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,GAUNT v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,Aleš Pejchal;Ledi Bianku;Linos-Alexandre Sicilianos;Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska;Paul Mahoney;Pauliine Koskelo;Robert Spano,"1. The applicant, Mr Jon Gaunt, is a British national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Leamington. He was represented by Mr K. O’Rourke of Howe & Co Solicitors, a lawyer practising in Brentford. 2. The United Kingdom Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms A. McLeod of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant was a presenter with Talksport, a speech-based radio station. He presented a programme which covered a range of news issues and he was well-known for his “combative and hard-hitting” style with interviewees. 5. On 7 November 2008 the applicant conducted a live interview with M.S., the Cabinet Member for Children’s Services for Redbridge London Borough Council. The interview concerned the council’s proposal to ban smokers from becoming foster parents on the ground that passive smoking could harm foster children. The applicant had spent some of his childhood in the care system and on the morning of the interview an article written by him on the subject was published in The Sun newspaper. The article was headlined “Fags didn’t stop my foster mum caring for me”. The following extract is relevant to the present proceedings: “Tonight in Britain more than 60,000 children won’t have a special person to tuck them in at night, read them a story or take an interest in what happened during their day at school. Meanwhile, the zealots who dreamed up this policy will sleep easy on their futons because they are putting the ‘health needs’ of kids in care first. This is the same warped logic that condemns black children to a life in care rather than let them be fostered by white couples. The same master race philosophy that forbids fat couples from adopting. The SS – that is social services by the way – think that the risk from passive smoking is more dangerous to a child than them being left to rot in a children’s home. They should understand that most parents realise the dangers and wouldn’t smoke in an enclosed space with children around. Foster parents are no different. The woman who rescued me from care, and undoubtedly turned me around as a child, smoked like a chimney but she was also a hospital matron. She lavished love, care and, most importantly, discipline on me. Without her I wouldn’t be where I am today... Today it’s Redbridge but, unless we all make a noise now, tomorrow it will be a national policy and thousands more children will fall victim to the health and safety Nazis and be left alone in a care home.” 6. Prior to the applicant’s interview with M.S., he was warned by Talksport that the subject might be emotive for him. In fact, in the hours before the interview programming staff advised him on three occasions to remain calm and allow M.S. to put his point of view across. 7. The applicant’s radio interview with M.S. lasted just over ten minutes. In the proceedings which followed, the President of the Queen’s Bench Division summarised the interview in the terms set out below: “The first part of the interview was reasonably controlled, giving [M.S.] a reasonable opportunity to explain his council’s policy. The claimant then asked him about existing foster parents who only ever smoke in the open air. [M.S.] explained that the council would not drag children away from existing foster parents, but that such smokers would not be used in the future. The trouble was that such people do smoke in the house. Asked by the claimant how he knew this, [M.S.] explained that there were Redbridge councillors who say they never smoke in the building, but in fact do so. To which the claimant said ‘so you are a Nazi then?’ When [M.S.] began to protest, the claimant again said ‘no you are, you’re a Nazi’. [M.S.] protested vehemently that this was an offensive and insulting remark, and the interview then degenerated into an unseemly slanging match. When [M.S.] protested that the insult, as he saw it, was probably actionable, the claimant challenged him to ‘take action if you wish’, but then said ‘you’re a health Nazi’. The slanging match continued with the claimant asking [M.S.] if he wanted to carry on with the interview, and [M.S.] replying that he would love to if the claimant would just shut up for a minute. It emerged that the claimant had himself been in care. He referred to his column in The Sun that day and again called [M.S.] a ‘health Nazi’ and then ‘a Nazi’. The heated shouting continued with the claimant doing much of the talking. [M.S.] asked him just to shut up for a moment, and said in effect that the conditions of those in care were better than they had been. The claimant regarded this as an offensive insult to his own upbringing and called [M.S.] ‘you ignorant pig’. He later referred to him as a ‘health fascist’ and an ‘ignorant idiot’, and shortly after this he ended an interview that by then had got completely out of control. It is scarcely possible to convey the general and particular tone of this interview in a short written summary, and the full transcript is in this respect incomplete. You have to hear it for its full impact. As we have said, it degenerated into a shouting match from the point when the claimant first called [M.S.] ‘a Nazi’. That first insult was not said with particular vehemence, but ‘you ignorant pig’ was said with considerable venom and was we think gratuitously offensive. The interview as a whole can fairly be described as a rant.” 8. Within ten minutes of the end of the interview, the applicant apologised to the listeners, accepting that he did not “hold it together”, that he had been “unprofessional” and that he had “lost the rag”. One hour after the end of the broadcast, he made a further apology in the following terms: “The Councillor wants me to apologise for calling him a Nazi. I’m sorry for calling you a Nazi.” 9. The applicant was suspended from his programme by Talksport the same day and an internal investigation was launched. Talksport subsequently terminated his contract without notice by letter dated 17 November 2008. 10. Following the broadcast, Ofcom, the independent regulator and competition authority for the United Kingdom communications industries, received fifty-three complaints about the applicant’s conduct. Some of the complaints concerned the manner in which the interview had been conducted, as the complainants believed that it was an “unprovoked personal attack”, and that the applicant was “oppressive”, “intimidating”, and “shouting like a playground bully”. Other complainants were offended by the word “Nazi”. 11. Ofcom launched an investigation into the matter under the Broadcasting Code. In its response to Ofcom, Talksport stated that it regretted what had happened and accepted that the interview “fell way below the acceptable broadcasting standards which it expected and demanded”. It totally accepted and regretted that the applicant’s language had been offensive and that the manner in which the interview was conducted had been indefensible. 12. In a report published on 8 June 2009, Ofcom concluded that the broadcast had breached Rules 2.1 and 2.3 of the Broadcasting Code (see paragraph 30 below) as it fell short of the generally accepted standards applied to broadcast content and included offensive material which was not justified by the context. In reaching this conclusion, Ofcom took into account the right of broadcasters to hold opinions and impart information without interference; the fact that Talksport specialised in a genre of hardhitting talk radio which could at times prove uncomfortable and challenging listening; the fact that the broadcast of “offensive” material was not in itself a breach of Ofcom’s code as the Code did not prohibit the broadcasting of offensive material; the extremely aggressive tone of the applicant’s interview style on this occasion; and the seriousness which the broadcaster attached to the incident, as demonstrated by its prompt investigation and the applicant’s two on-air apologies. Nevertheless, it found that Talksport’s compliance procedures did not appear robust enough to deal with problematic material being broadcast live. Moreover: “the language used by Jon Gaunt, and the manner in which he treated [M.S.], had the potential to cause offence to many listeners” and “the offensive language used to describe [M.S.], and what would be considered to be a persistently bullying and hectoring approach taken by Jon Gaunt towards his guest, exceeded the expectations of the audience for this programme, despite listeners being accustomed to a robust level of debate from this particular presenter. Even taking into account the context of this programme such as the nature of the service, the audience expectations and the editorial content, Ofcom did not consider that this was sufficient justification for the offensive material. The broadcaster therefore failed to comply with generally accepted standards in breach of Rules 2.1 and 2.3 of the Code.” 13. No sanction or penalty was imposed either on Talksport or the applicant other than the publication of the decision. 14. The applicant was granted leave to judicially review Ofcom’s decision on the ground that it disproportionately interfered with his freedom of expression and infringed his rights under Article 10 of the Convention. Liberty intervened in the proceedings to support the applicant’s claim. 15. Although Ofcom’s decision was against the broadcaster, which had acknowledged that there had been a breach of the Code, the Divisional Court judge noted that the parties had (in his view, rightly) accepted that the applicant had standing to challenge it because it “enunciates an inhibition capable of affecting his unrestrained freedom to conduct radio interviews in the way in which he did on this occasion”. 16. As the applicant did not contend that the Broadcasting Code itself violated Article 10, the narrow question for the court to address was whether Ofcom’s findings had disproportionately interfered with the applicant’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention. The judge noted at the outset that the unchallenged statutory basis for Ofcom’s finding meant that it was prescribed by law and pursued the legitimate aim of the protection of others. With regard to the question of necessity, the judge accepted that as the broadcast was live the applicant had had no opportunity to edit or correct what he said once he had said it. Moreover, the subject of the interview was political and controversial and the person being interviewed was an elected politician who would expect to receive and tolerate a “rough ride”. It was therefore an interview where the applicant’s freedom of expression should be accorded a high degree of protection. Nevertheless, his freedom of expression did not extend to gratuitous, offensive insult or abuse without contextual content or justification. Applying these principles and giving due weight to Ofcom’s judgment, the judge considered that to call someone a “Nazi” was capable of being highly insulting. It accepted, however, that in the present case the first use of the word could have had some contextual justification, especially in light of the applicant’s use of it in his newspaper article, and could therefore be seen as an emphatic and pejorative assertion that M.S. was, in the matter of smoking and fostering children, one who imposes his views on others. Nevertheless, the court noted that after the applicant used the word, the interview degenerated and the applicant’s conduct of it became increasingly abusive, hectoring and out of control. His subsequent use of the word “Nazi” undoubtedly assumed the nature of undirected abuse and the expression “ignorant pig” was said “with such venom as to constitute gratuitous offensive abuse”. As a consequence the later part of the interview became abusive shouting which served to convey to listeners no real content at all. 17. The judge therefore concluded that, taking full account of the applicant’s Article 10 rights, Ofcom was justified in its conclusion. The broadcast was highly offensive to M.S and well capable of offending the broadcasting public. Moreover, its offensive and abusive nature was gratuitous, having no factual content or justification. As a consequence, the judge accepted that Ofcom’s finding constituted no material interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression at all. In this regard, he found it relevant, but not decisive, that no sanction or penalty was imposed on the broadcaster, let alone the applicant. 18. The applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal. With regard to the applicant’s standing, the court reiterated that it was “accepted that he had locus standi to [challenge Ofcom’s finding], unsurprisingly since it is obviously possible that the finding may have had an adverse impact on him and on his reputation as a journalist”. 19. The Court of Appeal accepted that there were a number of facts which supported the proposition that a tribunal should be slow to hold that what was said in an interview offended the provisions of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 of the Code: first, the interview in question was concerned with an issue of general public interest; secondly, the interview was a live discussion and was not pre-recorded; thirdly, the applicant was well known to be a hard-hitting and robust interviewer; and fourthly, the interviewee was a politician and he made no subsequent complaint. However, these factors did not mean that the interview could not be susceptible to a finding that it fell foul of paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 of the Code. 20. In considering whether or not the interview offended paragraphs 2.1 and/or 2.3 the court considered it as a whole and in its context. It accepted that it would be wrong to focus too hard individually, let alone exclusively, on specific insults such as “health Nazi” and “ignorant pig”, the applicant’s hectoring tone and bullying manner, his persistent interruptions, his failure to let M.S. answer questions, or his treating one or more innocuous comments by M.S. as an insult. All those points had to be considered, together with the fact that the interview was permitted to run on for many minutes after it had become clear that it had got out of hand. 21. Nevertheless, the court concluded that the combination of the five concerns identified in the preceding paragraph rendered it impossible to accept that Ofcom’s finding, which contained no sanction other than the publication of the decision, represented an interference with the applicant’s rights under Article 10 of the Convention. Although the topic covered was of public interest, this point was of limited force in the context of an interview where the interviewee was not permitted to express his views or reasons. Moreover, while the interview was broadcast live, the applicant was not an inexperienced interviewee being provoked in the heat of the moment; rather, he was an experienced interviewer who had plainly decided to embark on a particularly aggressive assault on M.S. and his opinions. The fact that his style of interviewing was well known did not render the interview acceptable; nor did M.S.’s failure to complain. The court therefore concluded that Ofcom was right to find that Talksport had infringed paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 of the Code. 22. Finally, with regard to the severity of the sanction, the court noted that Ofcom could have decided that the complaint had been resolved instead of finding that there had been a breach of the Code. However, it had rejected this option since this was not a case of inadvertent error, as Talksport had allowed the interview to continue for many minutes after it plainly got out of control, and there had been two previous findings against Talksport where producers had lost control of an interview or discussion. 23. That being said, having concluded that Ofcom rightly found that Talksport had infringed paragraphs 2.1 and 2.3 of the Code, the court found it impossible to contend that Ofcom’s decision to impose no other sanction than the publication of the report “even got near being disproportionate”. Furthermore, the court noted that from the point of view of the applicant, he had been dismissed before Ofcom’s finding was published and there was no suggestion that he had lost work or that his reputation as a journalist had been damaged. 24. The Court of Appeal therefore dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 25. The applicant applied for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court refused permission in a decision dated 1 November 2011, sent to the applicant under cover of a letter dated 2 November 2011. 26. Broadcasting standards are governed by the Communications Act 2003 (“the 2003 Act”), which requires them to be implemented, supervised and enforced by Ofcom. 27. Section 3(2)(e) of the 2003 Act places a duty on Ofcom to secure the application by all television and radio stations of standards that “provide adequate protection to members of the public from the inclusion of offensive and harmful material” in broadcast programmes. 28. Section 319 of the 2003 Act obliges Ofcom to set up a “standards code” for radio and television services which is “calculated to secure” the so-called “standards objectives”. These objectives include, at section 319(2)(f), that “generally accepted standards are applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of offensive and harmful material”. Ofcom is also obliged by section 324 of the 2003 Act to “establish procedures for handling and resolution of complaints about the observance of [those] standards”. 29. This code, known as the Broadcasting Code (“the Code”), states in terms that it has been drafted in the light of the right to freedom of expression as expressed in Article 10 of the Convention, which encompasses a broadcaster’s right to disseminate, and an audience’s right to receive, creative material, information and ideas without interference, but subject to restrictions prescribed by law and necessary in a democratic society. 30. Paragraph 2.1 of the Code provides that generally accepted standards must be applied to the contents of television and radio services so as to provide adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion in such services of harmful and/or offensive materials. Paragraph 2.3 of the Code states that, in applying generally accepted standards, broadcasters must ensure that material which may cause offence is justified by the context. Such material may include, among other material, offensive language. 31. Section 111 of the Broadcasting Act 1996 precludes Ofcom from entertaining a complaint of unfair treatment unless made by the person affected or by a person authorised by him to make the complaint for him. 32. Pursuant to sections 109 – 111 of the Broadcasting Act 1990, where there has been a breach of the Code Ofcom could take a range of possible measures: publish its finding indicating that a breach of the Code has taken place; direct that the broadcaster transmits a correction or a statement of Ofcom’s finding; impose a financial penalty on the broadcaster; or shorten, suspend or revoke the broadcaster’s licence.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
182,001-153772,ENG,ALB,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,QESKA v. ALBANIA,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"1. The applicant, Mr Pëllumb Qeska, is an Albanian national, who was born in 1945 and lives in Korça. He was represented before the Court by Mr A. Tabaku, a lawyer practising in Korça. 2. The Albanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their then Agents, Ms S. Mëneri and Ms E. Hajro of the State Advocate’s Office. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant was one of the co-owners of two plots of land situated in the city of Korça. The first plot of land (“plot A”) measured approximately 182.7 sq. m and the second plot of land (“plot B”) approximately 84 sq. m. 5. On an unspecified date the applicant initiated civil proceedings with the Korça District Court (“District Court”) seeking the partition of both plots of land in order to determine the shares of each of the co-owners. The co-owners agreed to the request. 6. On 27 July 2001 the District Court ruled in favour of the partition of both plots of land. It found that the applicant’s share consisted of thirty-three thirty-sixths of plot A and eleven twenty-fourths of plot B. That decision became final on an unspecified date in August 2001, no appeal having been lodged against it. 7. On an unspecified date in 2002 the applicant instituted a second set of proceedings for the partition of both plots of land, requesting allocation of both plots of land to him in view of the fact that he was the owner of the majority of shares. The co-owners contested the applicant’s request to have both plots of land allocated to him. 8. On 15 July 2002, having regard to the fact that the applicant was the owner of the largest portion of both combined plots of land upon which a multi-storey building could be erected in accordance with the urban study plans, the District Court allocated him both plots of land. The District Court rejected the other co-owners’ request to have plot B awarded to them. Moreover, the court ordered that the applicant pay compensation to all co-owners, in respect of their property shares, in accordance with an expert’s report. 9. On an unspecified date, V.Q., one of the fifteen co-owners of plot B, lodged an appeal with the Korça Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”) challenging the amount of the compensation paid to him as well as the part of the decision which awarded the applicant plot B. He alleged that since the other co-defendants owned thirteen twenty-fourths of plot B, they should have been awarded plot B. No appeal was lodged by the three co-owners of plot A. 10. On an unspecified date the Court of Appeal gave notice of the proceedings to the other fourteen co-owners of plot B who were involved as parties to the proceedings before the District Court. 11. On 9 October 2012 the court adjourned the hearing, none of the parties having shown up. Only the representative of three co-owners, who also had shares in plot A, was present. 12. On 22 October 2002 the court adjourned the hearing, V.Q. being absent on the strength of a (medical) report. According to the record, three co-owners as well as the representative of three co-owners, who also had shares in plot A, were present at the hearing. 13. On 1 November 2002 the court decided to continue the proceedings. Five co-owners as well as the representative of three co-owners, who also had shares in plot A, were present. The court decided to hear the expert and the parties’ lawyers at the next hearing. 14. On 6 November 2002 almost all parties, save one co-owner, were present. The court fined the expert for non-appearance at the hearing. 15. On 10 December 2002 five co-owners as well as the representative of three co-owners, who also had shares in plot A, were present at the hearing. The expert, who was questioned by the parties, stated that the two plots of land were not connected to each other. 16. On the same day the Court of Appeal, having heard the co-owners, dismissed the grounds of appeal of V.Q. in respect of plot B and upheld the District Court’s decision as regards both plots. According to the Court of Appeal V.Q.’s share was so small (2.60 sq. m.) that the award of that property to him would be against its purpose. It pointed to the fact that he had lodged an appeal alone, without being joined by the other co-owners who were parties to the proceedings before the District Court. The relevant parts of the decision read as follows: “All parties consented, on the whole, to the [District Court’s] decision, with the exception of V.Q., who appealed against it only in so far as the first part of the decision is concerned [that is plot B], to which he is a party and has a [legitimate] interest (me këtë vendim të gjykatës, përgjithësisht kanë qenë dakort të gjithë palët përjashto të paditurin V.Q., i cili ka ankimuar vendimin vetëm për pjesën e parë të tij, ku është pale dhe ka interes). ... The remaining defendants did not join their forces to claim the plot of land jointly, not least that the remaining defendants, 14 of them, lodged no appeal (të paditurit nuk i bashkuan pjesët dhe ta kërkonin këtë sipërfaqe të përbashkët, për më tepër të paditurit e tjerë që në numër janë 14 persona, nuk kanë bërë ankim). Out of all defendants, only V.Q. who owns 2.60 sq. m, lodged an appeal (prej tyre është ankuar vetëm i padituri V.Q. që si person ka ... dy metra dhe gjashtëdhjetë centimetra katrorë).” 17. In compliance with the Court of Appeal’s decision, on 26 March 2003 the applicant paid all fifteen co-owners compensation corresponding to their respective shares in plots A and B. He entered his property titles over both plots in the Land Registry on 31 July 2003. 18. On 7 January 2003 V.Q., joined by thirteen co-owners of plot B, appealed to the Supreme Court. One co-owner did not sign the appeal. The appellants argued that, even though they had attended the hearings before the Court of Appeal, this had not been reflected in that court’s judgment. That the appeal was signed only by V.Q. was to be attributed to the lawyer who had lodged the appeal. No appeal was lodged by the three co-owners, in respect of plot A, with the Supreme Court. 19. On 18 March 2004 the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of five judges, by majority, quashed the Court of Appeal decision in respect of plot B and found, inter alia, as follows: “It follows, as also accepted by the courts, that the defendants have sought to retain this plot of land. Their appeal to the Court of Appeal states that they have the same interest and they jointly claim the plot of land. The appellants own the majority of the plot (thirteen twenty-fourths). Under these circumstances, contrary to the Court of Appeal’s finding, the appellants own the majority of the plot and share the same interest. As they do not seek the partition of that plot, on the basis of the foregoing provision [referring to Article 207 of the Civil Code], the plot should be awarded to the [fifteen] appellants (siç ka rezultuar dhe siç pranojnë dhe vetë gjykatat, të paditurit e kanë kërkuar ta mbajnë këtë sipërfaqe. Edhe në kërkesën ankimore, Gjykatës së Apelit i është parashtruar se ata i kanë interest e njëjta dhe e duan pjesën bashkarisht. Gjithashtu, të gjithë të paditurit zotërojnë në këtë sipërfaqe pjesën më të madhe (13/24 pjesë). Në këto rrethana, kur ndryshe nga sa pranon gjykata e Apelit, të paditurit kanë pjesën më të madhe dhe interest e njëjta si dhe nuk kërkojnë t’u pjesëtohet trualli ... pjesa u duhet lënë këtyrë të fundit).” The Court of Appeal’s reasoning that, since Pëllumb [the applicant] owns the majority of the plot of land measuring 182.7 sq. m, the other plot of land measuring 84 sq. m should be awarded to him for the purpose of constructing a multi-storey building, is erroneous. These plots of land, irrespective of their neighbouring position and of the fact that they have the same owners, should be treated as two separate objects which have been subject to the partition proceedings for the sake of judicial economy (Arsyetimi i gjykatës se paditësi Pëllumb ka në pronësi pjesën më të madhe të truallit me sipërfaqe 182.7 m2 prandaj dhe trualli me siperfaqe 84 m2I duhet lënë atij për t’u përdorur me qëllim ndërtimin e pallateve shumëkatëshe është i gabuar. Këto troje, pavarësisht nga pozicioni kufi me njëri-tjetrin dhe nga fakti se kanë pjesërisht të njëjtët bashkëpronarë, duhen trajtuar si dy sende te veçanta që janë pjesëtuar në të njëjtin gjykim vetëm për ekonomik gjyqësore.)” 20. As regards plot A, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal decision and found that, “In respect of the other plot [referring to plot A], the court’s decision is just and should be upheld. The applicant obviously owns the majority of the plot, thirty-three thirty-sixths. Even if matters stood differently, any appeal by the other three co-owners [to the Supreme Court] would be time-barred (rënë në dekadencë) as they had not lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal. In light of the above, plot [A] should be allocated to the applicant.” 21. The Supreme Court held that the appellants in whose favour plot B was allocated were to compensate the applicant in cash for his share. There was no dissenting opinion. 22. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court. He complained that he had been deprived of his right to a fair trial, referring to the incoherent reasoning in the Supreme Court’s decision. While the Supreme Court had ruled that any possible action by the three co-owners in respect of plot A would be considered time-barred as they had failed to avail themselves of the appeal to the Court of Appeal, it had not adopted the same approach with respect to the fourteen co-owners as regards plot B, who had not lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal, but whose appeal before the Supreme Court had been declared admissible and decided in their favour. 23. On 21 December 2004 the Constitutional Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, declared the applicant’s complaint inadmissible. It found that: “the [applicant’s] claims do not concern violations that would render the process unfair. They relate to aspects of proof and the determination of the merits of the case, which fall within the jurisdiction of the lower courts.” 24. On 24 June 2005, the Supreme Court refused a request by the applicant for a review of the same court’s decision of 18 March 2004. 25. Article 161 states that a civil action may be jointly brought by co-claimants against co-defendants provided that they have joint rights and obligations, which have the same basis on points of fact or law. 26. Article 162 reads, in so far as relevant, as follows: “Each party acts on his/her own against the opposing party provided that his/her procedural actions or omissions result in neither damage nor profit to the other parties. If, owing to the nature of the legal relationship in dispute or because of a legal provision, the effect of the decision to be adopted is to be extended onto all parties, the procedural actions which were carried out by one party shall have effect also on other parties who did not appear before the court or did not undertake such actions within the prescribed time-period.” 27. Articles 369-374 of the Code of Civil Procedure regulate the partition of common or inherited property by virtue of a court decision. The first phase of the partition proceedings consists of a court interim decision which determines the identity of the joint owners, the object to be partitioned and the corresponding parts belonging to each owner. In the second phase of the partition proceedings, the court determines the value of the various objects to be partitioned, after having received a prior opinion of experts. Any inequality in the value of the objects included in the shares is to be compensated in money. The court decides on the financial relationship of the parties arising from their joint ownership. 28. The relevant provision of the Civil Code reads as follows: Article 207 “The partition of the co-owned object shall be effected by the agreement of all of the co-owners... When the object is real property, the partition shall be effected by a notarial deed. The partition of the co-owned object corresponds to its division in kind, proportionate to the shares of each co-owner, provided that the partition is possible and does not damage the relevant purpose of the object... ...When some of the co-owners make a request [that the object be allotted exclusively to them], the court may so order, obliging those co-owners to reimburse other co-owners in relation with the partitioned property the cash amount equivalent to the value of their shares. ...” 29. In unifying decision no. 628 of 15 May 2000 the Supreme Court Joint Benches clarified the nature of the interim decision given at the conclusion of the first phase of the partition proceedings. It ruled that, given its sui generis nature, the interim decision concerning the first phase of the partition proceedings was final and could not be revisited by the court deciding on the second phase of the partition proceedings. 30. In decision no. 18 of 18 July 2009 (18/09), relying on Article 162 of the CCP, the Constitutional Court ruled that a civil action contesting the amount of compensation in an expropriation case, lodged by only one co-owner, had effect on all co-owners who did not initially join the co-owner in the first-instance court proceedings or did not carry out procedural acts within prescribed time-limits. In that case, the Court of Appeal accepted a co-owner’s civil action, but rejected the appellants’ action on the ground that it had been lodged out of time. The Constitutional Court, relying on Article 162 of the CCP, found a breach of the appellants’ right to a fair hearing and reasoned, inter alia, that the co-owner’s action should have been regarded as carried out by the appellants, who were the remaining co-owners.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
183,001-179568,ENG,MLT,CHAMBER,2017,CASE OF YANEZ PINON AND OTHERS v. MALTA,4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect),Carlo Ranzoni;Ganna Yudkivska;Marko Bošnjak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano,"8. The applicants were born in 1963, 1976 and 1961 respectively and at the time the applications were lodged were detained in the Corradino Correctional Facility, Paola. 9. The first applicant is serving a sentence of thirteen years’ imprisonment in the Corradino Correctional Facility. The sentence was imposed on him by the Criminal Court on 24 May 2010 for drugrelated offences. The Criminal Court also ordered the applicant to pay a fine of 30,000 euros (EUR) as well as EUR 1,898.21 in fees payable to the court experts, which were to be converted into a further eighteen months’ imprisonment if not paid. Pending proceedings before this Court, the first applicant − having served his sentence − was released from detention in September 2016. 10. The applicant alleged that he had been detained in Division 6, a highsecurity division, from 12 September 2006 until 23 August 2008. He claimed that during this period he had been unable to use any electronic equipment, to work, study or go to church, and that he had been subjected to psychological torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. He argued that he was neither aggressive nor an addict and there was no reason why he should have been placed in Division 6, which was intended to house very dangerous, problematic, aggressive and addicted prisoners. The Government submitted that the first applicant had been placed in Division 6 following an order from the head of security at the prison, and that, according to documents submitted to the Court, on 1 August 2007 the applicant had been given the option to move to a less secure Division, but had refused. In Division 6 he had had access to the main library of the prison. English lessons and mass were also provided in the Division. He could make phone calls and had had access to the communal TV and DVD player, and TV sets were also allowed in the cells. During that time he had also carried out paid work assembling plastic toys. 11. Since 23 August 2008 the first applicant has been detained in Division 3, specifically in cell 139 since 19 August 2013. 12. He complained that the cell windows were very small and that there was inadequate ventilation and no natural light. The water supply was inadequate and he had to use a bucket to flush the toilet. 13. He claimed to be suffering from symptoms that were the aftereffects of physical and psychological stress. In this regard, the first applicant stated that he had been examined by the prison psychologist, who had prescribed medicine to help him sleep in addition to painkillers. According to the applicant the psychologist had also suggested that he be referred to the psychiatric hospital, but no such transfer had taken place. 14. The Government submitted that the cells in which the first applicant had been housed in both Division 6 and 3 had measured 365cm x 265cm. They noted that the first applicant had been asked (on an unspecified date) whether he wanted to be transferred from Division 3 but he had replied in the negative. He had also been asked, following communication of the complaint to the respondent Government, whether he had a problem with the window in his cell and the reply had been in the negative. They submitted that the applicant had chosen to paint over the glass shade covering the ceiling light in his cell, and when asked about this, he had stated that he had no need for a ceiling light and for that reason had painted over it. According to the Government, the first applicant had a secondary light that he used and he had stated that it provided plenty of light for him. Moreover, the cell had two vents on opposite sides and the cell door had an aperture which was always left open for ventilation purposes. Relying on an indistinct photo submitted to the Court, the Government submitted that the applicant had covered the ventilation grilles on the wall with masking tape, thereby restricting the ventilation. 15. The Government submitted that the cell was equipped with a washbasin with running water and an additional wall-mounted tap. According to the Government, when the applicant was asked whether he had an issue with the provision of water, he stated that he no longer had any issues. As far as the use of the toilet was concerned, the Government admitted that Division 3 did not have a combined flushing and WC system and that the inmates had to flush the toilets manually using buckets that were provided in all cells and could be filled from the wall-mounted taps. 16. The Government submitted that the prison psychologist was not in a position to prescribe medicine or to refer inmates to the psychiatric hospital. They stated that when the first applicant was interviewed by the prison psychologist on 18 October 2006, he had stated that he was sleeping three to four hours per night but that he did not want to take medication. According to the medical records kept by the prison medical unit, none of the doctors who had examined the applicant had found it necessary to refer him to a psychiatrist. The in-house doctor at the prison confirmed that the first applicant was never referred for psychiatric treatment as he was not mentally unstable and had not expressed a desire to be referred. The doctor also confirmed that he could not see that there had ever been such a referral by any doctor in the past. The applicant had met the doctor on four occasions and the latter had treated him for his medical needs but no psychiatric concerns had been observed or reported or expressed. On 1 May 2016 the applicant had refused all treatment, which is the right of any patient and must be respected. The Government submitted that the doctor had also confirmed that the medical notes showed that, whilst in Division 6, the first applicant had also been examined by medical doctors and treatment had been provided as needed. 17. The second applicant is currently serving a term of imprisonment of eleven years for drug-related offences in the Corradino Correctional Facility. The Criminal Court, which sentenced him on 26 September 2012, had also imposed a fine of EUR 30,000, which the applicant was to pay within two months and which would be converted to a further term of one year’s imprisonment if not paid. The Criminal Court also ordered the second applicant to pay EUR 1,032.71 in respect of costs arising from the appointment of experts. Likewise, if not paid within fifteen days, this sum would be converted into a term of imprisonment. The judgment was confirmed on appeal on 12 December 2013. The applicant has been held in cell 102 in Division 3 since 9 February 2012. 18. The applicant claimed that he was forced to buy bottled drinking water, as the available water was undrinkable. Since there is no laundry service in prison, he was dependent on donated clothes − which did not always fit him – in order to have access to clean clothing. 19. The applicant alleged that his cell was old and that he was living in squalor. The cell walls contained asbestos and the old paint was peeling off the walls and the ceiling. Moreover, according to the applicant, the building was infested by rats and cockroaches. 20. During summer, the cell was too hot and since the cell window was too small, the ventilation was inadequate. On the other hand, during winter the cell was freezing cold. No heating was provided in the cells and the blankets were not adequate. The applicant stated that he had to wear his jacket in order to be able to sleep in winter. 21. The applicant, a non-smoker, complained that he was not separated from inmates who smoke. He was thus a victim of passive smoking every hour of the day. 22. According to the applicant he was frequently not given any breakfast and more than 95% of the food served in prison consisted of bread and pasta. He also stated that, although tobacco was easily accessible, fresh fruit was mostly restricted. Occasionally, apples that were past their sell-by date and could not be sold in local supermarkets were brought to the inmates. 23. The Government submitted that, when specifically asked by the prison authorities whether he had ever lodged a request to be transferred to a newer part of the prison, the second applicant replied that he had never made such a request and that he did not want to be transferred. 24. They further submitted that the tap water in the cell was fit for human consumption. The water in all parts of the prison facility had been certified by the Public Health Laboratory as being potable (certification submitted to the Court is dated 2015). The water is tested and certified approximately every six months. Division 3 had access to water directly from the mains, that is to say, drinking water. In addition to the availability of the running tap water supply, the inmates had the right to obtain bottled water from the residents’ tuck-shop. 25. In 2015 the second applicant received EUR 40.79 every four weeks in so-called “Work & Pay” remuneration and gratuity money, as well as EUR 169.49 every four weeks for work he carried out assembling plastic dolls. They stated that at the tuck-shop a six-pack of water cost EUR 2.24 and an individual bottle EUR 0.38. 26. The Government submitted that inmates were provided with washing powder − at no cost – so that they could wash their clothes. All cells were equipped with a wall-mounted tap and a sink with running water in which to wash their clothes. It was the duty of the inmates to wash their clothing and to be clean at all times. 27. The Government submitted that the walls did not contain asbestos but were built from Maltese limestone. They stated that the applicant had never painted his cell, nor had he ever requested any materials to do so, even though such material was free of charge. The Government claimed that the applicant had stated that he would never paint his cell himself because he felt that this was the responsibility of the prison officials. 28. The Government denied that the building was infested by rats and cockroaches, pointing out that pest control treatment had been carried out sixteen times at the prison since 2013 (certificates confirming the application of pest control in specific areas of the prison, including Division 3, were submitted to the Court). 29. The Government also submitted that, apart from the window, there were also three vents in the cell, along with an aperture in the cell door which was always left open. However, the applicant had fixed a sheet over the window and had covered one of the ventilation grilles on the wall with a piece of paper, thereby restricting the amount of ventilation. 30. The Government submitted that the second applicant had asked for an extra blanket in January 2012 (while in Division 12) but had then rejected the extra blanket he was given, saying that it was too old. Since the applicant had been in Division 3, he had not asked for any additional blankets. 31. As to the second applicant’s claim concerning passive smoking, the Government submitted that the second applicant resided in a single cell and had access to fresh air in the adjoining yard for most of the day. The learning zones were all smoke-free. 32. The Government contested the applicant’s allegation concerning breakfast and the quality of food, stating that breakfast was served as follows: on weekdays all inmates were served with a ham or cheese sandwich and at weekends and on public holidays sandwiches were served with boiled eggs. The inmates had access to unlimited tea and coffee. The Government submitted to the Court the 15 daily menus constituting the lunch and dinner choices over a six month period – the menus showed a variety of meat and fish dishes, as well as pasta dishes and pies. Apart from the menu of the day, inmates could opt for tuna salad, eggs and chips with corned beef, eggs and chips with ham or cheese, omelette with ham or cheese and soup, or both. According to the Government, in cases where an inmate had been ordered to go on a diet by the doctor, pasta with ricotta or steamed fish would be provided at lunchtime and steamed chicken for dinner. Should a special diet be prescribed by the medical doctor, the food thereby indicated would be provided by the prison authorities. According to the Government, fresh fruit was delivered to the prison every Monday and Thursday − approximately eleven boxes of bananas and fourteen boxes of oranges were delivered to the prison and distributed to the inmates weekly. 33. On 28 April 2015 the second applicant instituted proceedings complaining about his conditions of detention. In particular he noted that, cumulatively, he had been held in the correctional facility since 13 July 2009 and, since that date, had been forced to live in a cell subject to the following hardships: without adequate drinking water; without clothing to keep him warm throughout winter; being dependent on charitable institutions to obtain clothing; the cell contained a significant quantity of asbestos that was causing him physical harm; the cell was infested with rats and cockroaches; the Corradino Correctional Facility lacked adequate sanitary facilities; the cell only had one small window which could not be opened as it was too high up; during winter he was only given one thin blanket although the facility was cold and it was therefore difficult to sleep; all detainees were allowed to smoke wherever and whenever they wanted and, as a consequence, inmates who, like the applicant, are non-smokers, were being subjected to passive smoking; these conditions amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and Article 36 of the Constitution of Malta. 34. On 10 November 2015 the second applicant gave oral testimony and submitted that in prison he generally felt hot and had been advised by a prison guard to buy a fan; after asking for water he had been advised to either buy it or drink the water supplied by the correctional facility. Nothing further was submitted in his oral testimony. 35. The respondent denied the above allegations. According to the medical doctor there were no mental or physical issues, nor had the applicant ever sought medical assistance. As regards the structural complaints submitted by the second applicant, the maintenance official submitted the following evidence in summarised form: 36. The Division in which the complainant was held consists of sixty cells, one of which is not currently in use; complainant is housed in a cell on his own; his particular cell is a normal one with a standard window and adequate light – being built the way it is for security reasons – and the lighting in the cell is appropriate; when the cells are open, inmates may freely walk in and out of them whenever they want, except when “under report” (that is to say confined to quarters); the complainant had access to open spaces from 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m. just like all other inmates and when so authorised; the Correctional Facility conducts a yearly analysis of the water supply to check that it is fit for human consumption, and the most recent report (that of 2015), conducted by a private laboratory, concluded that the water supply is good for drinking and meets the standard for human consumption; the Facility provides potable water from the mains for the inmates and that water is supplied free of charge; inmates are allowed to buy bottled water; when inmates enter the Facility they are given blankets, sheets, pillows and a mattress; upon request, they are also given extra blankets, however, the complainant had never registered any such request; as regards any infestation of rats and cockroaches, the maintenance official presented a report submitted by a private company on these issues (such inspection is carried out yearly) stating that three rodent control visits were carried out in 2014 and the last visit showed that “everything was under control”. As regards smoking: inmates are allowed to smoke in cells; if some inmates within a particular cell are nonsmokers, then the other inmates are not allowed to smoke in that particular cell; the complainant does not smoke, although the prison doctor affirms that he stated upon admission into the Correctional Facility that he was a smoker. 37. By a judgment of 28 June 2016 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence dismissed the second applicant’s complaint. It considered that he had failed to submit the evidence that was deemed legally necessary to prove his case − the complainant had merely alleged the existence of the various shortcomings referred to above, but had failed to submit the relevant evidence to substantiate his allegations. By contrast, the evidence submitted in the proceedings by the doctor and the maintenance official satisfactorily showed that the allegations were unfounded. 38. On the specific issues raised, the court found as follows: Water supply: the Water Services Corporation submitted adequate proof that the water supply used in the Correctional Facility was potable, fit for human consumption and conformed to the Legal Notice on Water intended for Human Consumption Regulation, 2009, after being microbiologically analysed to this end. However, reference is made to the Chemistry (PHL) Water Analysis Test Report, which stated that the “chloride content exceeds the indicator parameter value in LN 17 of 2009”. Even given the above breach of the statutory limit, the complainant’s allegation is not substantiated as he could make use of viable alternatives to overcome the issue, either consuming warm potable water or buying bottled water from the gratuity money given to him by the facility’s authorities; 39. Blankets and clothing: it sufficiently results that, upon entering the Correctional Facility, inmates are issued with a residential kit consisting of blankets, sheets, pillows and a mattress; if required, inmates may ask their Division officer for more blankets. As regards clothing, the Facility is supported by charities which are allowed to distribute suitable clothing as required. It is apparent that the complainant never submitted a complaint on these issues. 40. Asbestos: The complaint submitted by the complainant alleging that there is asbestos in his cell is not borne out by fact; There is therefore no such danger to the complainant’s health and in fact, no such complaint has been submitted by the complainant at any time during his stay in the facility since 2009. 41. Rodents and cockroaches: pest control by a private company that specialises in this particular activity is constantly and periodically (yearly) undertaken by the Facility’s authorities. According to the treatment report released by the private company involved (dated 4 July 2014) the situation was certified as being under control. 42. Smoking: the complainant is housed in a cell on his own. However, inmates are allowed to smoke in particular areas and at particular times. In the particular division where the complainant is housed, there is no area where smoking is prohibited, and the complainant is therefore being subjected to passive smoking. Ideally, non-smokers should be segregated from smokers in order to avoid unnecessary hardship but, despite this resulting in an unsavoury situation, it is understood that because of the particular circumstances such obvious segregation might not be practically possible. As a result it cannot be held that this situation reaches the level of severity and intensity required by Article 3 of the Convention or Article 36 of the local Constitution. Furthermore, upon examining the medical records presented in the case file of the proceedings, no medical or physical deterioration was recorded in the health of the complainant as a result of the passive smoking analysed herein 43. Cell window and consequent availability of adequate light: the cell at issue is a normal Division cell furnished with a standard window and occupied only by the complainant. The window provides enough light in the cell to serve its purpose. The complainant is allowed to leave his cell at the appointed times, and on the basis of the medical reports that were accumulated throughout the years of confinement, no medical conditions have been reported as arising as a result thereof. 44. No appeal appears to have been lodged against this judgment. 45. The third applicant is currently detained in the Corradino Correctional Facility. By a judgment of the Criminal Court of 22 June 2010 he was found guilty and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment and a fine of EUR 30,000, which was to be converted into a term of eighteen months’ imprisonment if not paid, along with EUR 1,289.50 in respect of expert fees. The applicant has been detained in Division 3 since 2010; for the first two and a half years he was held in cell 120, which was a little worse than cell 147 in which he has been housed ever since. 46. He stated that his cell window was positioned at a height of more than two metres; he therefore had to climb onto something to open it. It had three metal bars which hampered the entry of natural light. 47. According to the third applicant, the temperature in his cell may be as low as 10 oC during winter, and yet he is not allowed to have a heater in his cell. In winter, the applicant allegedly suffers from arthritis, which causes him unbearable pain. However, he is not able to use Voltaren (which is the only medicine provided by the prison authorities) because he suffers from Hepatitis C. 48. The applicant alleged that during the summer the cells were infested with cockroaches. Furthermore, his cell became very hot and there was inadequate ventilation. However, prison regulations restricted the number of fans per cell to one. Although the applicant had two fans in his cell, he stated that in summer they merely circulated the hot air and the steel door of the cell prevented any fresh air circulation. By contrast, he noted that the offices of the prison personnel (who were exposed to the same temperatures) were equipped with air conditioning and heating facilities. 49. The applicant claimed that in winter the hot water supply was not sufficient to cater for the approximately sixty inmates in his Division. Furthermore, the water was not drinkable and he therefore had to purchase bottled water, which was only possible when he had money. He claimed that when he did not have any money, he was obliged to drink the undrinkable water, which caused him skin blemishes. He stated that drinking water was only distributed to the prison personnel, but did not reach the detainees. 50. The applicant also claimed that inmates did not have access to a laundry and foreign inmates were not given detergents with which to wash their clothes and clean their cells and toilets. 51. According to the applicant, the building was a hundred years old and its condition was inadequate. Dust fell from the applicant’s cell’s ceiling and walls, which he then breathed in. 52. The applicant also stated that since the prison did not provide him with tablets for his migraine, he had been obliged to buy such tablets for six years. 53. According to the Government, the applicant has resided in cell 147 in Division 3 since 8 January 2015, and when asked by the prison authorities if he would like to be transferred to another part of the prison, he declined. 54. In reply to the second and third applicants’ claims, the Government submitted that the window in the cell could be opened using a tool provided by the authorities or by standing on the bed or on a chair or stool. Moreover, the metal bars at the window were a security feature and did not prevent natural light from entering the cell. 55. As to the claim concerning heaters, the Government referred to their submissions below (see paragraph 100). They further noted that – due to the climate in the Maltese islands – such requests were not frequent; however, they submitted that due consideration would be given to the matter if a medical reason was found to be at the root of such request. 56. The Government submitted that the applicant had been diagnosed with right dupuytrens contracture, which is a hand deformity affecting the fingers, so that they cannot be straightened completely. The applicant underwent surgery on the 27 August 2014 which did not result in any complications. The applicant was discharged and prescribed paracetamol and diclofenac. Although the applicant alleged that he suffered from arthritis, he did not visit the medical unit complaining of pain in the joints. 57. The Government also referred to the submissions made in paragraphs 26 and 29 above). They noted that the window in cell 147 could be opened and closed by the occupant. There were also two vents as well as the aperture in the cell door which was always left open. According to the Government the third applicant had covered one of the wall vents with a sheet of paper, thereby restricting the amount of ventilation, and the aperture in the cell door had been covered with a piece of cardboard from inside the cell. Furthermore, the Government submitted that it was permissible for inmates to have more than one fan in their cell. In fact, most of the inmates had two fans, as did the third applicant. 58. As to the quality and provision of water, the Government referred to their submissions in paragraph 86 below. They noted that in 2015, the [third] applicant received EUR 36.45 every four weeks in “Work & Pay” remuneration and gratuity money, as well as EUR 207.50 every four weeks for work he carried out assembling plastic dolls, thereby enabling him to buy bottled water at tuck-shop prices. 59. According to the Government there are no medical records referring to skin blemishes at the Medical Unit. They acknowledged that Division 3 was located within the older part of the facility however they stated that all cells were equipped with the necessary facilities and paint was provided on request so that the inmates could keep their cells in good condition. Relying on photos submitted, the Government considered that the ceiling and walls appeared to be in good condition and there was no flaking. 60. Lastly, the Government acknowledged that the applicant had had to buy migraine tablets, namely Zolmiles 2.5mg. Purchasing these tablets was standard policy for all inmates who suffer from migraine since inmates are eligible for medicine which is supplied by the Government to all citizens for free, but Zolmiles is not on the free medication list. Nevertheless, as can be seen from documentation submitted to the Court, the Secretary of the Malta Community Chest Fund (MCCF) informed the applicant that the MCCF Board had decided to grant him the full cost of treatment upon presentation of the original receipts. They noted that the third applicant had been referred to the State hospital in December 2011 for a common migraine and medication was prescribed as stated above. On 27 August 2014 he was admitted to the Day care unit at the State hospital, where he underwent surgery, and he was discharged the same day, with a follow-up appointment being scheduled for 11 September 2014.",[],[],[],['3'],[],[],0
184,001-156570,ENG,LVA,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,ZIKOVS v. LATVIA,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney;Yonko Grozev,"1. The applicant, Mr Nikolajs Zikovs, is a Latvian national who was born in 1983 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Riga Central Prison. He is represented before the Court by Mr V. Sruoģis, a lawyer practising in Riga. 2. The Latvian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs K. Līce. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. On 19 February 2011 the applicant went to the cinema. He got into an argument with another man. A fight ensued and the applicant fired several shots, killing the other man. The police arrived immediately and took the applicant into custody. 5. On 21 February 2011 a judge remanded him in custody. 6. On 24 February 2011 a search of the applicant’s car was conducted by the State Police without a judge’s authorisation. Several objects and documents were seized: a laptop, a thesis written by the applicant, sporting equipment, and several objects the applicant described as being of an intimate nature. 7. On 18 May 2011 the applicant was charged with aggravated murder. 8. On 26 October 2011 the prosecution announced the end of the pre-trial investigation and decided to transfer the case to court (lēmums par kriminālprocesa nodošanu tiesai). The case file was sent to the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa). 9. On 22 May 2012 the Riga Regional Court convicted the applicant of aggravated murder and sentenced him to seventeen years’ imprisonment, three years’ police supervision, and confiscation of property. 10. On 31 May 2013 the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Krimināllietu tiesu palāta) upheld the judgment of the first-instance court. However, upon repeated requests by the applicant, the following objects and documents were excluded from the evidence relied on by the first-instance court for the purposes of the applicant’s conviction: the record of the inspection of the applicant’s car (automašīnas apskates protokols), the objects and documents seized therein (apskates laikā izņemtie priekšmeti un dokumenti), and their inspection record (mantu apskates protokols). The Criminal Cases Chamber relied on sections 159 (1) and (2), 160 (3), 179 (1) and 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law and found that, in actual fact, during the inspection of the applicant’s car a search, not a (visual) inspection, had been carried out, in breach of the relevant domestic provisions pertaining to inspections. Moreover, the search of the applicant’s car was carried out in breach of section 180 of the Criminal Procedure Law pertaining to searches. The evidence obtained therefrom was accordingly declared inadmissible. 11. On 20 September 2013 the applicant asked the prosecuting authorities to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who were involved in the search of his car. He did not ask that the unlawfully seized material be returned to him, but he relied on Article 8 of the Convention and Article 96 of the Constitution. His complaint was forwarded to the Internal Security Bureau of the State Police (Valsts policijas Iekšējās drošības birojs) and he was informed about it. 12. On 2 October 2013 the Internal Security Bureau replied that no ancillary decision under the section 533 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Law had been made by the court. Accordingly, the State Police had no legal grounds to examine investigative activities undertaken by its officers during the pre-trial investigation. The applicant was informed that he could enquire with the Chairperson of the Criminal Cases Chamber of the Supreme Court. The applicant did not do so. 13. On 22 November 2013 the Senate of the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court’s ruling of 31 May 2013 and adopted a final decision in the applicant’s criminal case. 14. Article 92 provides, inter alia, that “everyone whose rights are violated without justification has a right to commensurate compensation”. 15. Article 96 guarantees “inviolability of private life, home and correspondence”. 16. However, Article 116 permits restrictions on the exercise of rights set out in, inter alia, Article 96 in circumstances provided for by law in order to “protect the rights of other persons, the democratic structure of the State, public safety, welfare and morals”. 17. Section 1635 defines a delict as any wrongful act as a result of which damage (which may include non-pecuniary damage) has been caused to a third person. The person who has suffered the damage has the right to claim satisfaction from the person who caused it. 18. Section 1779 provides that everyone is under an obligation to make good damage caused by his or her act or failure to act. 19. These provisions as well as sections 2347-2351 relating to compensation for bodily injury (before and after the amendments that were effective from 1 March 2006) are quoted in full in Zavoloka v. Latvia (no. 58447/00, § 19, 7 July 2009). 20. The relevant provision relating to searches can be found in Nagla v. Latvia (no. 73469/10, § 36, 16 July 2013). 21. In addition, section 533 (1) provides that a court may adopt an ancillary decision by which violations of law are notified to the competent authority or official and they are requested to remedy the situation.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

LITHUANIA,4,No violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions),András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Iulia Motoc;Marko Bošnjak;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"5. The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Kaunas. 6. In 1991 the applicant asked the authorities to return to her some buildings and a plot of land owned by her father before nationalisation in 1940. In November 1995 the applicant wrote to the authorities to ask why the buildings and the land had been sold to other persons in 1992. The authorities replied in December 1995 that the applicant had given an incorrect address for the buildings when submitting her request for her property rights to be restored and the buildings in question had already been privatised. 7. On 22 October 1996, upon their own initiative, the authorities suggested to the applicant that she submit a request to be paid monetary compensation for the buildings, if she did not have any objections to such a form of restitution. On 4 November 1996 the authorities indicated that the documents submitted by the applicant did not prove that her father had owned the buildings in question and asked her to provide additional documents or – if she did not have those documents in her possession – to ask the domestic courts to establish as a legal fact that her father had owned those buildings. 8. On 27 April 1999 the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas District Court, asking it to establish as a legal fact that before the 1940 nationalisation her father had owned the buildings and a plot of land. On 18 August 1999 the Kaunas District Court stated that there was a dispute about the applicable law and left the applicant’s claim unexamined. The court also suggested to the applicant that she submit her claim in accordance with the rules governing contentious proceedings (as opposed to the rules applicable to the procedure for the establishment of a legal fact). 9. On 28 May 2003 the Kaunas District Court established as a legal fact that the applicant’s father had owned the buildings before the 1940 nationalisation. 10. On 4 July 2003 the applicant indicated that she wanted to receive compensation in the form of securities. The authorities asked the Centre of Registers (a State enterprise) to assess the value of the buildings, which was set on 14 July 2003 at 36,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 10,426 euros (EUR)). On 18 September 2003 the authorities recommended that applicant’s and her sister’s property rights to their father’s property be restored by paying them compensation in securities. 11. On 9 October 2003 the authorities adopted a decision to restore the applicant’s and her sister’s property rights by paying them LTL 36,000 (approximately EUR 10,426) in total in securities. 12. On 10 June 2004, the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas District Court, requesting the annulment of the valuation of the buildings made by the Centre of Registers on 14 July 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the appointment of independent experts to assess the market value of the buildings because she considered that the value set for the buildings was too low. The applicant’s claim contained deficiencies, which she failed to eliminate within the time-limit set by the Kaunas District Court; accordingly, on 13 July 2004, the court decided to rule that the applicant’s claim had not been lodged. 13. The applicant lodged a separate complaint, where she claimed that the authorities assessed the value of the buildings incorrectly, and complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken. On 23 August 2004 the Kaunas Regional Court held that the Kaunas District Court had made procedural mistakes and returned the case for fresh examination to the Kaunas District Court. 14. The applicant lodged a modified claim with the Kaunas District Court, complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made three or four months before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken. On 2 February 2005 the Kaunas District Court held that although there were no provisions in the domestic law indicating how soon after the assessment of value the decision to restore property rights had to be taken, in the present case the time between the assessment and the decision had not been excessively long. The court therefore dismissed the applicant’s complaint. 15. The applicant appealed raising the same complaints as she did before the Kaunas District Court (see paragraph 14 above), and on 13 June 2005 the Kaunas Regional Court held that the assessment of value of the buildings had been based on several methods of calculation and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law. It therefore dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 16. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, and on 14 December 2005 the Supreme Court decided that the case had to be examined before the administrative rather than civil courts and referred the case for examination to the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court. 17. On 23 March 2006, during the hearing before the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, the applicant asked for the examination of the case to be postponed that she might have time to eliminate deficiencies in her claim. She also claimed that she was not aware of the fact that she had to submit a request to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint separately, and asked the court to provide her with an opportunity to do that. Her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until 9 May 2006. On 19 April 2006 the applicant lodged a modified claim in which, inter alia, she asked the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court to (i) annul the assessment of the value of the buildings made by the Centre of Registers, (ii) to annul that part of the order of the authorities for her property rights to be restored in which the value of the buildings was indicated and (iii) to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint. On 9 May 2006, during the hearing at the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, the applicant asked for the appointment of an expert to determine the market value of the buildings. On 6 June 2006 the court suspended the proceedings, appointed an expert and asked the expert (i) what the market value of the buildings had been on 14 July 2003 and (ii) what the market value of the buildings had been today, i. e. when the expert had been appointed. In April 2007 the expert stated that on 14 July 2003 the market value of the buildings had been LTL 56,850 (approximately EUR 16,465) and that the market value of the buildings at the time that the examination of the case had started had been LTL 164,900 (approximately EUR 47,758). Subsequently the court proceedings were resumed, and on 21 September 2007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of 14 July 2003 by the Centre of Registers and that part of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at LTL 36,000 (approximately EUR 10,426) (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). The applicant did not appeal and the decision became final on 5 October 2007. 18. On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, asking, inter alia, for the authorities to be obliged to urgently re-issue the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 (see paragraph 11 above). On 12 December 2007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court allowed the applicant’s claim. 19. On 18 May 2009 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court examined and then rejected a claim by the applicant seeking for the Kaunas Municipality to be obliged to pay her LTL 82,450 (approximately EUR 23,879) for the buildings and to award her LTL 96,370 (approximately EUR 27,911) in damages. The court held that the assessment of value in itself did not give rise to any legal consequences for the applicant. The court concluded that the decision of the authorities of 9 October 2003 was still in force and that the question of the amount of the compensation was a matter for the public authorities and that it was not within the court’s power to give instructions to them. 20. The applicant appealed, but on 26 July 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed her appeal. The court held that the applicant’s request had been for the value of the buildings to be set at what their value had been at the moment when the expert valuation had been carried out in 2007 (see paragraph 17 above). The court also observed that the amendment of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights had not yet been adopted and it was not clear how the applicant’s rights were being breached. The court also held that the applicant had repeatedly raised the issue of the assessment of the value of the buildings, which had already been resolved. The court upheld the conclusion of the court of first instance that public authorities’ functions did not fall within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above). 21. The applicant requested that the proceedings be reopened. On 17 December 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court refused her request. 22. In October 2007 the relevant authorities were informed that an additional assessment of the value of the buildings had to be made and then the Kaunas Municipality Administration asked the Centre of Registers to urgently assess their value. As no response was received, in February 2008 the Kaunas Municipality Administration again asked the Centre of Registers to assess the value of the buildings. The assessment was made on 17 March 2008 and the value of the buildings was set at LTL 57,000 (approximately EUR 16,508) in total, of which the applicant’s part was LTL 28,500 (approximately EUR 8,254). This valuation was officially approved by the authorities on 5 June 2009, when they amended the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s and her sister’s property rights. 23. On 16 August 2010 the applicant submitted a request to be compensated in securities of a State-owned enterprise. On 27 January 2011 the applicant was sent a document of acceptance in respect of 11,875 units of securities, the nominal value of each unit being LTL 1 (approximately EUR 0.29). The State Property Fund asked the applicant to sign the document of acceptance and indicated that the nominal value of one security was LTL 1 (approximately EUR 0.29) but that the real value was LTL 2.4 (approximately EUR 0.7). It meant that the real total value of the shares was LTL 28,500 (approximately EUR 8,254), which was the applicant’s part of the compensation (see paragraph 22 above). The transfer of the securities was finalised on 1 February 2011. 24. On 12 December 2012 the applicant asked the authorities to set the value of the buildings at the value that they had as of January 2011 and to pay her additional compensation. In February 2013 the authorities replied that there were no grounds for re-examining and deciding on questions regarding the restoration of property rights to the applicant because the procedure had already been finalised. 25. The applicant lodged a claim with the domestic courts, asking, inter alia, that the decision of the authorities of 5 June 2009 by which the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 had been amended (see paragraph 22 above) be quashed. She also requested the annulment of the assessment of value of the buildings at LTL 57,000 (approximately EUR 16,508) made by the Centre of Registers on 17 March 2008. The applicant’s claim had several deficiencies and she was asked several times to eliminate them. However, the applicant failed to do so in an acceptable manner and on 25 October 2010 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court declined to examine her claim. The court stated that the applicant had asked it to oblige the authorities to provide one of the original copies of the decision of 5 June 2009; however, it observed that the applicant already had an original copy. It was suggested by the court that the applicant contest the order of 5 June 2009, because it was that document which had legal consequences for her. This, according to the information in the Court’s possession, she never did.",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0
186,001-146824,ENG,BIH,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,ZUBAN AND HAMIDOVIC v. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant in the first case, Ms Samka Zuban, is a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who was born in 1957 and lives in Sarajevo. She was represented before the Court by Ms A. Imamović, a lawyer practising in Sarajevo. The applicant in the second case, Mr Jasmin Hamidović, is also a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He was born in 1964 and lives in Ilidža. He was represented before the Court by Mr N. Mulalić, a lawyer practising in Sarajevo. 2. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the Government”) were represented by their Deputy Agent, Ms Z. Ibrahimović. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. After its declaration of independence on 6 March 1992, a brutal war started in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It would appear that more than 100,000 people lost their lives and more than 2,000,000 people were displaced in the course of the war. It is estimated that around 30,000 people went missing and that around one quarter of them is still missing. The conflict came to an end on 14 December 1995 when the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina entered into force. In accordance with that Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two Entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska. 5. In response to atrocities then taking place in Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 25 May 1993 the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 827 establishing the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (“the ICTY”), headquartered in The Hague. More than 70 individuals have already been convicted and proceedings are ongoing for 20 accused. In the period from February 1996 until October 2004, local prosecutors in Bosnia and Herzegovina were required to submit case files to the ICTY for review; no person could be arrested on suspicion of war crimes unless the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor had received the case file beforehand and found it to contain credible charges (the “Rules of the Road” procedure). Moreover, the ICTY had primacy over national courts and could take over national investigations and proceedings at any stage in the interest of international justice. As part of the ICTY’s completion strategy, in early 2005 war crimes chambers were set up within the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (“the State Court”) with primacy over other courts in Bosnia and Herzegovina as regards war crimes. More than 100 persons have been finally convicted by the State Court. Many others have been convicted by the competent Entity courts (see paragraphs 21-22 below). 6. Furthermore, the International Commission on Missing Persons (“the ICMP”) was established at the initiative of United States President Clinton in 1996. It is currently headquartered in Sarajevo. Reportedly, the ICMP has so far identified by DNA more than 14,000 missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whereas local authorities have identified more than 8,000 missing persons by other methods. In 2005 the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the ICMP established a Missing Persons Institute, also headquartered in Sarajevo (see paragraph 15 below). It became operational on 1 January 2008. 7. In June 1992, after having been captured by the VRS forces in Ilidža, Fikret Zuban, the husband of Samka Zuban, and Nedžib Hamidović, Jasmin Hamidović’s father, disappeared. 8. On 2 October 2002 Ms Biljana Plavšić, one of the war-time leading political figures of the Republika Srpska, pleaded guilty before the ICTY to having participated in the persecution of Bosniacs and Croats from, among other municipalities, Ilidža. She was sentenced to 11 years’ imprisonment. 9. Cases against Radovan Karadžić, the war-time civilian leader of the Republika Srpska, Ratko Mladić, the war-time military leader of that Entity, and Vojislav Šešelj, a leading political figure of Serbia in the 1990s, are also pending before the ICTY. They are charged with the participation in a joint criminal enterprise to permanently remove Bosniacs and Croats from, inter alia, Ilidža. 10. Domestic authorities have taken statements from the applicants and a number of other persons about these two cases. However, no formal charges have been brought yet. At the same time, domestic authorities have finalised investigations into several other crimes committed in Ilidža during the war; one person has thus far been convicted – R.B. 11. On 6 April 1998 Samka Zuban sought and obtained a declaration of presumed death with respect to her husband. 12. Nedžib Hamidović, the father of Jasmin Hamidović, was identified by DNA on 7 November 2006. Fikret Zuban, Samka Zuban’s husband, has not yet been identified. 13. On 3 November 2004 the Human Rights Commission held that there had been a violation of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention. It ordered the Republika Srpska to release any and all information in its custody pertaining to the fate or whereabouts of the applicants’ relatives and to conduct a full, meaningful, thorough and detailed investigation aimed at making known the fate or whereabouts of the applicants’ relatives and bringing the responsible to justice. Lastly, it awarded the applicants 5,000 convertible marks (BAM) each for non-pecuniary damage. 14. The Missing Persons Act 2004 entered into force on 17 November 2004 (Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 50/04). In accordance with section 3 of the Act, families have the right to know the fate of missing persons (that is, their whereabouts if they are still alive, or the circumstances of death and their place of burial, if they are dead) and to obtain their mortal remains. Under section 4 of the Act, the relevant domestic authorities have the obligation to provide any and all such information in their keeping. 15. Section 7 of that Act provides for the setting up of a Missing Persons Institute. In 2005 the ICMP and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina founded the Institute, headquartered in Sarajevo, pursuant to that provision and the Agreement on Assuming the Role of Co-founders of the Missing Persons Institute of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Official Gazette of Bosnia and Herzegovina, International Treaty Series, no. 13/05). It became operational on 1 January 2008. One of the organs of that Institute is an Advisory Board, comprised of six representatives of families of missing persons (see Article 10 of the Agreement mentioned above). 16. In accordance with section 9 of the Act, the status of missing person comes to an end on the date of identification. Therefore, if a missing person is declared dead but the mortal remains have not been found and identified, the process of tracing continues. 17. Pursuant to section 11 of the Act, the families of missing persons are entitled to monthly financial support under some conditions, notably if they were supported by the missing family member until his or her disappearance and if they are still in need of support (in other words, if they are not in paid employment and do not receive welfare benefits beyond 25% of the average salary paid in Bosnia and Herzegovina). Section 15 of the Act provides for the setting up of a Missing Persons Fund for that purpose. However, as the Fund has not yet been established, no payment has been made so far. 18. Families of missing persons are also entitled to, inter alia, temporary administration of the property of missing persons, burial of mortal remains at public expense and priority in access to education and employment for the children of missing persons (section 18 of the Act). 19. Section 21 of the Act provides for the setting up of Central Records with the aim of verifying information about missing persons from different sources (government agencies, associations of families of missing persons, the ICMP and the International Committee of the Red Cross) and creating a single database. While Central Records were founded on 3 February 2011, it would appear that the verification process is still ongoing. Once that process is completed, all those recorded as missing will be declared dead (section 27 of the Act), but the tracing process will nevertheless continue (see paragraph 16 above). 20. Despite the fact that the verification process outlined in paragraph 19 above is pending, any person may request that a declaration of presumed death be issued with respect to a missing person (see the Non-Contentious Procedure Act 1998, Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, nos. 2/98, 39/04, 73/05; and the Non-Contentious Procedure Act 2009, Official Gazette of the Republika Srpska, no. 36/09). 21. War crimes cases fall, as a general rule, under the jurisdiction of the State Court, but the State Court may transfer any such case to the competent Entity court in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraph 22 below (see Article 27 of the 2003 Code of Criminal Procedure). For example, only in 2012 the State Court transferred 217 cases to 15 Entity courts. 22. In accordance with the Book of Rules on the Review of War Crimes Cases of December 2004 the following types of cases were, as a rule, to be heard before the State Court: (a) cases concerning genocide, extermination, multiple murders, rape and other serious sexual assaults as part of a system (such as in camps), enslavement, torture, persecution on a widespread and systematic scale, mass forced detention in camps; (b) cases against past or present military commanders, past or present political leaders, past or present members of the judiciary, past or present police chiefs, camp commanders, persons with a past or present notorious reputation, multiple rapists; (c) cases with insider or suspect witnesses; (d) if there was a risk of witness intimidation; and (e) cases involving perpetrators in an area which is sympathetic to them or where the authorities have a vested interest in preventing public scrutiny of the crimes. All other war crimes cases were, as a rule, to be heard before the Entity courts. 23. In December 2008 the authorities adopted the National War Crimes Strategy, providing a new set of criteria. However, they are almost identical to those outlined in paragraph 22 above. In addition, the Strategy defines the time-frames, capacities, criteria and mechanisms for managing those cases, standardisation of court practices, issues of regional cooperation, protection and support to victims and witnesses, as well as financial aspects, and supervision over the implementation of the Strategy. One of its objectives is to process the most complex and top priority cases within seven years (thatis, by the end of 2015) and other war crimes cases within fifteen years (that is, by the end of 2023). In order to comply with that time-frame, the local authorities have, inter alia, almost doubled the number of State prosecutors in charge of war crimes (from 19 to 37) in the last 12 months.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
187,001-154544,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,SCHREURS v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra,"1. The applicant, Mr Hubertus Wilhelminus Petronella Schreurs, is a Netherlands national, who was born in 1976 and lives in Tegelen. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Boksem, a lawyer practising in Leeuwarden. 2 Between January 2008 and March 2008 the applicant published a number of advertisements on internet web sites offering goods for sale. He obtained payment in advance by bank transfer into bank accounts of accomplices. He withdrew the sums thus received in cash but never delivered the goods purportedly sold. 3. The applicant was arrested and taken into police custody (inverzekeringstelling). Subsequently he was taken into detention on remand (voorlopige hechtenis). In all, the applicant spent 188 days in pre-trial detention. 4. On 21 October 2011 the Roermond Regional Court (rechtbank) found the applicant guilty of “making a habit of complicity in money laundering” (witwassen; Articles 420bis and 420ter of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht)). It sentenced him to 210 days’ imprisonment, 22 days of which was suspended for one year, and ordered him to compensate his victims. 5. The applicant appealed. 6. On 26 February 2013 the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) gave judgment acquitting the applicant of all involvement in money laundering. Its reasoning included the following: “It is apparent from the information contained in the case file and the investigation at the hearing that the suspect has, by publishing advertisements on the internet and making use of bank accounts of third parties, induced the persons named in the indictment to part with sums of money (by bank transfer) without delivering what was promised in return. Such a course of action may, in the circumstances of the present case, be qualified as fraud (oplichting).” 7. On 11 April 2013 the applicant submitted a request to the Court of Appeal for compensation for the damage he claimed to have suffered as a result of his pre-trial detention (Articles 89 and 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering; see below)). 8. Having held a hearing in camera on 14 June 2013, the Court of Appeal gave a decision on 28 June 2013 dismissing the request. Its reasoning included the following: “It appears from the case file that the former suspect was charged with (complicity in) habitual money laundering, or in the alternative, a number of counts of (culpable) money laundering. The former suspect was acquitted on the charges by the judgment of 26 February 2013. In addition, the Court of Appeal, in its said judgment, found the following: ‘It is apparent from the information contained in the case file and the investigation at the hearing that the suspect has, by publishing advertisements on the internet and making use of bank accounts of third parties, induced the persons named in the indictment to part with sums of money (by bank transfer) without delivering what was promised in return. Such a course of action may, in the circumstances of the present case, be qualified as fraud.’ The Court of Appeal takes the view that, considering the content of the said judgment, there are no reasons in equity to award any compensation.” 9. Provisions of the Criminal Code relevant to the case are the following: “1. He who, with intent unlawfully to gain for himself or for someone else an advantage, induces someone to part with goods of any description, deliver a service, make available information, contract a debt or annul a claim, whether by assuming a false name or a false quality or by cunning tricks or a web of lies, shall be guilty of fraud and shall be punished with a term of imprisonment not exceeding four years or a fifth-category fine [i.e. up to a maximum of 78,000 euros]. ...” “1. The following shall be guilty of money laundering and punished with a term of imprisonment not exceeding four years or a fifth-category fine: a. he who conceals or dissimulates the true nature, origin, location, transfer or relocation of an object, or conceals or dissimulates the identity of the person who is entitled to an object or has it in his possession, knowing that the object constitutes the proceedings of an indictable offence (misdrijf) directly or indirectly; b. he who obtains, has in his possession, transfers, transforms or uses an object, knowing that the object constitutes the proceedings of an indictable offence directly or indirectly. 2. The expression ‘object’ shall be understood to mean all goods and all pecuniary rights.” “He who makes a habit of money laundering shall be punished with a term of imprisonment not exceeding six years or a fifth-category fine 10. Provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure relevant to the case are the following: “1. If a case ends without the imposition of a punishment or measure, or when such punishment or measure is imposed but on the basis of a fact for which detention on remand is not allowed, the court may, at the request of the former suspect, grant him compensation at the expense of the State for the damage which he has suffered as a result of police custody, clinical observation or detention on remand (voorlopige hechtenis). Such damage may include non-pecuniary damage. ...” “1. Compensation shall be awarded in each case if and to the extent that the court, taking all circumstances into account, is of the opinion that there are reasons in equity to do so. 2. In the determination of the amount, the personal circumstances (levensomstandigheden) of the former suspect shall also be taken into account. ...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano,"5. The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Helsinki. 6. The applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti. On 9 September 2006 he was sent by his employer to take photographs of the demonstration which was being held in protest against the on-going Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) in Helsinki. The demonstration was an exceptionally large one in the Finnish context and all media followed it closely. 7. Before the demonstration took place, on 30 August 2006, the Helsinki Police Department was alerted by the Finnish Security Intelligence that the upcoming “Smash ASEM” demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message. The Police Department did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration. 8. The demonstration was to start at 6 p.m. on 9 September 2006. A separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place. 9. At the start of the demonstration, bottles, stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen. Some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers. The police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching. The crowd tried to break through the police defence line. Relying on all the information in their possession, the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent. The police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene. This announcement was repeated several times. Hundreds of people then left voluntarily. 10. After the escalation of violence, the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area. First only a few people were allowed to leave the area. Then the police established several exit routes and people were allowed to leave. When leaving, they were asked to show ID and their belongings were checked. 11. However, the core group of around 20 people remained in one of the demonstration spots, including the applicant and a former Member of Parliament, all of whom had been asked to leave the scene, failing which they would be arrested. According to the applicant, he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrators. He claims that sometime later he indicated to the police that he was a representative of the media. He further claims that he was wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this. After having called his colleague, the applicant decided to stay until the situation was over. A short time later the police arrested the demonstrators. When leaving the scene the applicant was also arrested. The police arrested altogether 121 persons in the context of the demonstration. 12. The applicant was detained from 9 September at 9.26 p.m. until 10 September at 3.05 p.m., that is, 17.5 hours. 13. On 23 May 2007 the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for disobeying the police (niskoittelu poliisia vastaan, tredska mot polis) under Chapter 16, section 4, subsection 1, of the Penal Code. 14. On 17 December 2007 the Helsinki District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) found the applicant guilty of disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him. The court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them. It appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist. According to the arresting officer, this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared. It appeared also from the witness statements that two other photographers, who had been in the sealed-off area, had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested. The court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody. The court balanced the Article 10 right against other interests, finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant, among others, including the former Member of Parliament, to leave the scene. The interference with the applicant’s right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law, and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder. The interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation. However, relying on Chapter 6, section 12, of the Penal Code, no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable. The court found that the applicant who, as a journalist, was confronted with contradictory expectations, stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer. 15. By letter dated 23 January 2008 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), claiming that the District Court should have dismissed the charges against him. He argued that his arrest and the fact that he was found guilty were against the Constitution and Article 10 of the Convention. The applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder. The District Court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were “necessary in a democratic society” and had thereby failed to justify the interference. 16. On 30 April 2009 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal without giving any further reasons. 17. By letter dated 24 June 2009 the applicant further appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal. 18. On 1 September 2009 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0

SLOVAKIA,4,No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading punishment;Inhuman punishment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 13+3 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 3 - Prohibition of torture;Degrading punishment;Inhuman punishment),Alvina Gyulumyan;Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Luis López Guerra,"5. The applicant was born in 1970. He is serving a life sentence in the Leopoldov prison. 6. On 7 September 2005, at about 10 p.m., the applicant was taken to a police station. In the course of the night he was questioned about the violent death of his stepfather. He was tested for alcohol in his blood and biological samples were taken from him. A police investigator accused the applicant of murder. The applicant was suspected of having stabbed his stepfather fourteen times on 7 September 2005, as a result of which the latter had died. At the request of the public prosecutor the applicant was formally arrested at 12.30 a.m. on 8 September 2005. 7. By a decision of 12 September 2005 a judge of the Košice I District Court remanded the applicant in custody with effect from 8 September 2005. On 28 September 2005 the Košice Regional Court dismissed a complaint by the applicant against that decision. 8. In the context of the investigation the applicant, repeatedly and in the presence of his lawyer, admitted having stabbed his stepfather and described the circumstances. He later requested that his action be qualified as causing bodily harm as he had not intended to kill the victim. 9. On 5 December 2005 the public prosecutor indicted the applicant before the Košice Regional Court. 10. On 13 July 2007 the Košice Regional Court convicted the applicant of murder. With reference to Article 219 § 2, Article 29 §§ 1 and 3, Article 30 § 1(c), Article 43 § 1 and Article 35 § 3 of the Criminal Code of 1961, the first-instance court sentenced the applicant to life imprisonment without the possibility of release on parole. 11. On the basis of statements by twenty-two witnesses, the opinions of five medical experts and a forensic institute, and the documentary evidence available, the court established that the applicant had deliberately stabbed his stepfather fourteen times with a knife with the intention of killing him. That action had been prompted by the applicant’s aggressive behaviour while in a state of intoxication and his abnormally antisocial personality. 12. The Regional Court noted that at the pre-trial stage the applicant had admitted, several times and in the presence of his lawyer, the offence imputed to him and had described the relevant facts in detail. However, at the main hearing he denied having killed the victim. The court held, for the reasons which were set out in detail in its judgment, that the evidence available clearly indicated that he had committed the offence. He had done so in a particularly contemptible manner as he had attacked the victim unexpectedly and had taken advantage of the latter’s incapacity to defend himself as a result of heavy intoxication. 13. According to the expert opinion on which the court relied, the applicant was pathologically aggressive. He lacked any self-control and there were practically no prospects of his re-socialisation at that time. The probability that he would re-offend in the future was extremely high. 14. The applicant had been convicted of different offences five times previously. Those convictions included a rape and a murder. He had committed the second murder only several months after his conditional release from prison, where he had been serving a sentence imposed for a similar offence. The Regional Court concluded that the statutory conditions for imposing a life sentence without the right to be released on parole were therefore met. 15. At the same time, the Regional Court quashed the six-month prison sentence which the Michalovce District Court had imposed on the applicant on 24 October 2005, as well as all consecutive decisions concerning that punishment. 16. The applicant appealed. He submitted that he had made the initial statements admitting the offence while in a state of a shock and fatigue resulting from his intoxication, and that the police had exposed him to psychological pressure prior to the interrogation. There existed no direct evidence proving that he had committed the offence. The applicant further argued that the first-instance court had not established all the relevant facts and had committed errors of law. The evidence obtained did not suffice for his conviction. No reconstruction of the crime had been carried out, the reference in the expert opinion as to an injury to the victim’s hand and the applicant’s social and psychological profile were confusing. The applicant further argued that the Regional Court had failed to hear the children who had found the blood-stained knife. 17. On 27 February 2008 the Supreme Court quashed the first-instance judgment to the extent that it concerned the sentence imposed. It then imposed a term of life imprisonment on the applicant and held, with reference to Article 30 § 1(d) of the Criminal Code, that the possibility of his release on parole was to be excluded. It did so because the Regional Court had incorrectly referred, in the operative part of its judgment, to the subparagraph of Article 30 § 1 of the Criminal Code which allowed for such a penalty. 18. In all other respects the Supreme Court endorsed the conclusions reached at first instance. It considered the applicant’s arguments irrelevant. In particular, in September and October 2005 the applicant had admitted three times, in the presence of his lawyer, to have committed the offence. In that context he had indicated manifold details which could only have been known to the perpetrator, for example that he had taken the knife from the flat where he and his mother lived, and where he had hidden it after the incident. The applicant had also described the T-shirt he had worn and such a T-shirt had been found hidden in the applicant’s flat stained with the victim’s blood. That blood could not have stemmed from an injury on the victim’s hand, as claimed by the applicant, as the experts had excluded such an injury. The applicant had also indicated a motive for his actions. 19. The Supreme Court held that the Regional Court had gathered all relevant evidence with a view to establishing the facts of the case and had correctly applied the law when convicting the applicant. The statutory prerequisites for imposing a life sentence without the possibility of release on parole were met. 20. The appeal court also quashed the six-month prison sentence which the Michalovce District Court had imposed on the applicant on 24 October 2005, as well as all relevant consecutive decisions relating to that punishment. 21. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law. As in the appeal proceedings, he challenged the establishment of the facts and the conclusions reached in the first-instance and appeal proceedings. 22. On 2 March 2009 the Supreme Court (cassation chamber) dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. The decision stated that in proceedings in an appeal on points of law courts could only examine errors of law allegedly committed at lower levels of jurisdiction. However, no such arguments had been put forward by the applicant. The interrogations at the pre-trial stage in the course of which the applicant had admitted the offence had been carried out in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure and in the presence of his lawyer. The Regional Court had therefore been entitled to read out those statements at the main hearing before it. 23. As to the sentence imposed, the applicant had not raised any specific arguments in his appeal on points of law. In any event, the lower courts had correctly concluded that, given his earlier convictions, the three-strike rule set out in Article 43 § 1 of the Criminal Code was applicable to his case. Similarly, the lower courts had correctly exercised their discretionary power under Article 30 § 1(d) of the Criminal Code when excluding the possibility of his release on parole. 24. On 7 May 2009 the applicant submitted a complaint to the Constitutional Court. He indicated that it was directed against the abovementioned ordinary courts at three levels which had dealt with his case, and at the prosecuting authorities involved. In the summary of his complaint the applicant indicated that it concerned his conviction and the sentence imposed. He alleged a breach of his rights under the Constitution and the Convention. He complained, inter alia, that he had been detained unlawfully and that the criminal proceedings against him had been flawed. He explicitly alleged a breach of Article 3, Article 5 § 1(a) and (c) and § 3, Article 6 §§ 1, 2 and 3(d), and Articles 8, 13 and 14 of the Convention, as well as Article 2 § 1 of Protocol No. 7. 25. The applicant joined to his appeal the three ordinary courts’ decisions in his case and requested that the Constitutional Court quash them. He indicated that he was indigent and asked the Constitutional Court to appoint a lawyer to represent him in the constitutional proceedings. 26. In a letter dated 21 September 2009 a Constitutional Court judge informed the applicant that in his complaint he had not specified an outcome he sought to obtain from the Constitutional Court which would be enforceable given the powers of that court. As the Constitutional Court could not deal with such a submission, it had to be set aside pursuant to section 23(a) of the Constitutional Court Act 1993. 27. On 21 December 2005 the Košice I District Court ordered that the applicant be released from pre-trial detention and start serving a six-month prison term which had been imposed by a penal order issued by the Michalovce District Court on 24 October 2005 in a different set of proceedings. 28. In a decision of 14 July 2006 the Košice Regional Court ordered that the applicant be released from pre-trial detention and start serving a thirty-seven month prison term which had been imposed in a different set of proceedings by the Banská Bystrica District Court. 29. A decision issued by a higher judicial officer of the Košice Regional Court on 31 March 2008 stated that the period of the applicant’s detention from 8 September 2005 to 14 July 2006 was to be incorporated into the term of life imprisonment imposed on him. The applicant was further ordered to reimburse to the State the costs of his detention during the above period, pursuant to Article 555 § 1 (a) of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 2005. On 12 May 2008 the presiding judge of the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint against that decision. On that basis the Košice prison administration ordered the applicant, on 4 June 2008, to pay the equivalent of approximately 800 euros (EUR) in respect of the 310 days he had spent in pre-trial detention. 30. In the course of the criminal proceedings, newspapers published several articles about the case in which they implied that the applicant was a brutal offender. The applicant considered that those articles were based on information which the media had obtained from the prosecuting authorities dealing with his case. 31. On 14 November 2013 the applicant filed a fresh appeal on points of law in respect of the proceedings leading to his conviction. The proceedings are pending.",[],[],[],"['13', '3']",[],[],0
190,001-150604,ENG,NLD,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,V. AND OTHERS v. THE NETHERLANDS,4,Inadmissible,Ján Šikuta;Johannes Silvis;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra,"1. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows. 2. Mr V. is a Netherlands national who was born in 1987. He is currently detained in a custodial clinic in Utrecht. He is represented before the Court by Mr L. van Vliet, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam. 3. On 4 January 2007 Mr V., who was then resident in an institution for persons with developmental problems, sexually assaulted a female member of institution staff, fondling or touching her breasts and lower body against her will. On 22 July 2007, while detained as a suspect in a custodial institution for juveniles, he sexually assaulted a fellow inmate, a fourteenyear-old boy, inter alia by rubbing his crotch. 4. In the course of the criminal proceedings, Mr V. was examined by a psychiatrist and a psychologist. The psychiatrist found the applicant to be suffering from a disorder in the autistic spectrum and mild mental deficiency. The psychologist also found indications of mild mental deficiency, in addition to pervasive development disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neither the psychiatrist nor the psychologist came to the conclusion that criminal responsibility was entirely absent. 5. On 16 December 2008 the Roermond Regional Court (rechtbank) convicted Mr V. of “indecent assault” (feitelijke aanranding van de eerbaarheid, Article 246 of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht)) and “committing lewd acts out of wedlock with a person below the age of sixteen” (met iemand beneden de leeftijd van zestien jaren buiten echt ontuchtige handelingen plegen, Article 247 of the Criminal Code). It ordered him to be placed at the disposal of the Government (terbeschikkingstelling, hereafter “TBS order”) with confinement in a custodial clinic (bevel tot verpleging van overheidswege). The judgment included the following reasoning: “The acts committed by [Mr V.], namely indecent assault and lewd acts with a child, are crimes which according to their statutory definition, carry maximum prison terms of eight years and six years respectively and for which a TBS order may be imposed. In view of the findings of the experts, the nature and seriousness of the acts found proven and the person of [Mr V.], as apparent from the examination of the case at the hearing, the Regional Court considers that a TBS order is justified in this case. [Mr V.] is after all afflicted with a serious disturbance on the basis of which it can be said that the safety of others or the general safety of persons requires the imposition of the measure. Moreover, [Mr V.] has committed criminal acts which admit of the imposition of such a measure. In addition, the Regional Court considers that these grounds justify confinement in a custodial clinic. In view of the above, the Regional Court will follow the advice of the experts and will impose a TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic. The Regional Court agrees with the public prosecutor and counsel for the defence that it would serve no purpose at all to impose a punitive sentence on [Mr V.] in addition to the TBS order. ...” 6. Neither the prosecution nor the defence appealed against this judgment, which thus became final fourteen days later. The TBS order, which was valid for an initial period of two years, accordingly entered into force on 31 December 2008. 7. On 5 January 2011 the Roermond Regional Court extended the TBS order for a further two years. The decision stated that the crimes committed by Mr V. were indictable offences directed against, or endangering, the physical integrity of one or more persons. No appeal was lodged against it. 8. The TBS order next came up for review two years later, in December 2012. The public prosecutor sought a further extension. Having held a hearing on 13 December 2012, the Roermond Regional Court gave a decision on 27 December 2012 refusing to extend the order further. Its reasoning was as follows: “In order to answer the question whether or not the TBS order is limited in duration, in which event the possibility of indefinite extension does not exist, it is necessary to consider the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Van der Velden v. the Netherlands, no. 21203/10, 31 July 2012, and the decision of the Arnhem Court of Appeal of 1 October 2012 (LJN (Landelijk Jurisprudentie Nummer, National CaseLaw Database Number) BX8788). In the present case the TBS order with confinement in a custodial institution was ordered by a judgment of this court of 16 December 2008 in relation to the indictable offences (misdrijven) ‘indecent assault’ and ‘committing lewd acts with a person below the age of sixteen’. This judgment lacks reasoning as referred to in Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering). As the European Court of Human Rights held in that judgment, it is not for the court ruling on the extension of the TBS order to determine retrospectively, by interpretation of the judgment of the trial court, whether or not the TBS order was imposed in connection with an indictable offence that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons (‘a crime of violence’), and accordingly whether or not the TBS order is limited in duration. If the prescribed reasoning is absent, then the TBS order cannot be unlimited in duration and it must, according to the European Court of Human Rights, be assumed that the TBS order is limited to a maximum duration. The Arnhem Court of Appeal has held in its aforementioned decision that there is no such interpretation if on the basis of the conviction, the qualification and the reasoning of the measure, considered in context (in onderling verband en samenhang bezien), it is self-evident to anyone that the crime in issue is a crime of violence. In view of the latter decision of the Court of Appeal the Regional Court must answer the question whether in this case it is self-evident that the facts for which the TBS order was imposed constitute ‘crimes of violence’. In the present case it is not self-evident from the conviction, the qualification and/or the reasoning that the crimes in issue are ‘crimes of violence’. Since such a conclusion could be reached only by way of interpretation of the judgment of 16 December 2008 and – in view of the further circumstances – it cannot be ruled out that the trial court intended to limit the TBS order in duration to a four-year maximum, the Regional Court considers that in this case the TBS order is limited in duration, so that there is no longer any possibility of extending the order further. The public prosecutor’s request for an extension of the TBS order will therefore be refused. The above findings do not alter the Regional Court’s understanding, which is shared by all concerned, including Mr V. himself, that Mr V. will nonetheless need further treatment and/or assistance.” 9. The public prosecutor appealed to the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal (by this time the successor to the Arnhem Court of Appeal). 10. Having held a hearing on 14 March 2013, the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal, sitting in Arnhem, gave a decision on 28 March 2013 extending the TBS order by a further two years. Its reasoning was as follows: “TBS order limited in duration? In the judgment of the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad) of 12 February 2013, LJN BY8434, the view was taken that the sole fact that the sentencing court in its reasoning has not stated in so many words that the TBS order was imposed in connection with a crime of violence does not entail that the measure can no longer be extended if its total duration exceeds a period of four years. The only condition set by Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code for the extension of the TBS order is that the measure be imposed in connection with a crime of violence. Whether such is the case can also be deduced from the other content of the final judgment of the sentencing court – whether it be read in context or not – such as the conviction, the evidence relied on, the qualification, the reasoning of the rejection of any defence put forward and the reasoning of the sanction or sanctions imposed. If, on that basis, it is evident that the crime is one of violence, then at the very least it cannot be said that the possibility of extension of the measure beyond four years was not foreseeable for the person subject to the TBS order. The Court of Appeal finds that [Mr V.] – given the conviction and the qualification – was convicted of: indecent assault; committing lewd acts out of wedlock with a person below the age of sixteen. The Court of Appeal has had regard in this connection to the Regional Court’s considerations in imposing the sentence and the measure. On the above grounds, the Court of Appeal considers that it is implicit in the judgment of the Roermond Regional Court of 16 December 2008 that the TBS order was imposed in connection with crimes of violence and that accordingly it cannot be said that the possibility of extension of the measure after four years was not reasonably foreseeable for [Mr V.]. The defence made by counsel is therefore dismissed. Mental disturbance and danger of reoffending It appears from the case file that [Mr V.] is a mentally deficient man with an autism spectrum disorder. The danger of reoffending is estimated to be high absent present levels of security and care. There has lately been a clearly positive development. The clinic indicates that it has been possible to make follow-up arrangements with P., a work and residential institution for young adults with mild intellectual impairment and serious behavioural disorders. The clinic indicates that it is important to prepare the transfer to the successor institution properly and carry it out painstakingly and gradually, in order to limit as far as possible the loss of structure and control. Extension In view of the danger of reoffending, which still exists, and [Mr V.’s] pathology the Court of Appeal considers that the safety of others or the general safety of persons requires the TBS order to be extended. In view of the expected duration of further treatment and resocialisation work the Court of Appeal considers that a two-year extension is indicated. The Court of Appeal assumes that the resocialisation work now begun will be pursued diligently.” 11. Mr Mohamed Elgouille was born in 1978 and has both Netherlands and Moroccan nationality. He is currently detained in a custodial clinic in Nijmegen. He is represented before the Court by Mr F. Holthuis, a lawyer practicing in The Hague. 12. On 17 January 2004 Mr Elgouille punched his girlfriend in the face. When he was arrested later that day, cocaine was found on his body. On 6 February 2004 Mr Elgouille robbed an acquaintance of his bank card and his bunch of keys, assaulted him and cut him with a razor, and then left him in a helpless condition. The acquaintance was later found dead. On 11 February 2004 Mr Elgouille violently forced another acquaintance to hand him cocaine and money. 13. On 4 November 2004 the Regional Court of The Hague convicted Mr Elgouille of “causing bodily harm” (mishandeling, Article 300 of the Criminal Code), “robbery with violence” (diefstal met geweldpleging, Articles 311 and 312 of the Criminal Code), “manslaughter” (doodslag, Articles 287 and 288 of the Criminal Code) and “attempted extortion” (poging tot afpersing, Articles 45 and 317 of the Criminal Code). It sentenced him to 14 years’ imprisonment. 14. Mr Elgouille appealed against this judgment. On 28 September 2006 the Court of Appeal of The Hague quashed the decision of the Regional Court and acquitted Mr Elgouille of the manslaughter in the absence of a proven causal link. It convicted him of the other offences, sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment and imposed a TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic. The judgment included the following reasoning: “[Mr Elgouille] has committed a property offence, in which he did not recoil from using brute force against the victim by beating and kicking him, in order to deprive him of his bunch of keys and bank card. Furthermore, some days later, [Mr Elgouille] attempted to extort cocaine and money from a person by beating, kicking and threatening the victim. Acts such as these are generally experienced by the victims as exceedingly threatening and moreover these acts also cause anxiety and feelings of insecurity in society. In addition, [Mr Elgouille] assaulted another person and held cocaine in his possession. Besides, it has been established that, according to an extract from the Criminal Records Register dated 16 August 2006 relating to him, [Mr Elgouille] has been convicted of property offences and violent offences before, which apparently did not deter him from committing the present offences.” 15. Mr Elgouille appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court. On 17 June 2008 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment of the Court of Appeal for technical reasons and reduced the term of imprisonment to four years and seven months in view of the excessive length of the proceedings; for the remainder it endorsed the judgment of the Court of Appeal. 16. The TBS order entered into force on 7 August 2008. 17. The Regional Court of The Hague extended the TBS order by two more years by decision of 28 September 2010. The decision stated that the crimes committed by Mr Elgouille were indictable offences directed against, or endangering, the physical integrity of one or more persons. Appealing against this decision, the applicant asked for a new diagnosis; in the alternative, for a conditional suspension of his compulsory confinement; in the further alternative, for an extension of only one year not two. His appeal was dismissed and the Regional Court’s decision was confirmed by the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal on 2 May 2011. 18. The Regional Court of The Hague extended the TBS order by a further two years on 9 October 2012. The Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal confirmed this decision on 25 April 2013. 19. On 9 October 2012 the Regional Court of The Hague reviewed if further extension for two more years was allowed. The court answered this question in the affirmative. Its reasoning was as follows: “The measure of placement in a custodial clinic has been applied in respect of: - theft, preceded and accompanied by violence against persons, committed with the intention of preparing and facilitating this theft; - attempted extortion; - assault; - deliberately acting in breach of the prohibition contained in Article 2, paragraph 1, under C of the Opium Act. Accordingly, crimes (of violence) that are directed against and endanger (the physical integrity of) persons. Pursuant to the foregoing, the court considers that the safety of others and the general security of persons or property demand the extension. Since it appears from the advice and the deliberations in chamber that the treatment involving learning new behaviour is still in the early stages and no start has yet been made with the rehabilitation, the court is of the opinion that the TBS order should be extended for two more years. The court sees no reason to give the clinic indications concerning the way in which the treatment should take place.” 20. The Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal confirmed this decision on 25 April 2013. The court considered the following: “Custodial placement not limited in duration The Court of Appeal finds that the judgment of the Court of Appeal of The Hague of 28 September 2006 convicted [Mr Elgouille] of, inter alia: - theft, preceded and accompanied by violence against persons, committed with the intention of preparing and facilitating this theft; and - attempted extortion. In accordance with the judicial findings of fact, the qualification and the reasons given for the imposition of the penalty and measure, considered in their interrelationship, that judgment implies that the TBS order has been imposed in connection with crimes of violence within the meaning of Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code and that on that account it cannot be said that the possibility of extension of the measure after four years has not been reasonably foreseeable for [Mr Elgouille]. Moreover, the Court of Appeal takes into consideration that both offences involved physical violence against the victim by among other things beating and kicking the body. Counsel’s defence was rejected.” 21. Mr Edward Cornelis Willem Leonardus Kuiters is a Netherlands national who was born in 1968. He is currently detained in a custodial clinic in Poortugaal. He is represented before the Court by Mr P. Scholte, a lawyer practising in Amsterdam. 22. On 20 June 2007 Mr Kuiters smashed the windows of the house of his neighbour, one Mr de V., with a baseball bat. At the relevant time, Mr de V. was present on the first floor of his house. It is noted that apart from this incident, Mr Kuiters had on an earlier occasion shot through the windows of Mr de V.’s car with a crossbow. 23. The Breda Regional Court convicted Mr Kuiters on 15 October 2007 of “threatening grievous bodily harm” (bedreiging met zware mishandeling, Article 285 of the Criminal Code) and “carrying a weapon” (een wapen dragen, section 27(1) of the Arms and Ammunition Act (Wet wapens en munitie)). As relevant to the case before the Court, it imposed a TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic. 24. Mr Kuiters appealed against this judgment to the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal. On 20 January 2009 the Court of Appeal quashed the judgment of the Regional Court on a technicality and gave a new judgment. As had the Regional Court, it convicted Mr Kuiters of threatening grievous bodily harm and carrying a weapon. Finding that Mr Kuiters could not be held criminally responsible, it excused him punishment but imposed a TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic. The judgment included the following reasoning: “The Court of Appeal finds, in view of the circumstances set out above and also taking earlier events into account: that the suspect’s violent behaviour was highly threatening for Mr de V.; that Mr V. had good reason to conclude that if he did not give in to the suspect’s wishes, he ran a serious risk of incurring grievous bodily harm that the suspect’s intent was directed to this end, at any rate inasmuch as he understood that such would be the necessary consequence of his behaviour.” and “Having regard to the foregoing, particularly having regard to [Mr Kuiters’s] fascination with weapons in combination with his long-term mental disorder, the Court considers that the likelihood of reoffending should be estimated high and that, to reduce this chance, clinical psychiatric treatment is required.” and “In the view of the Court of Appeal, [the safety of others and/or the general safety of persons or goods] necessitates a TBS order and also requires [Mr Kuiters] to be confined in a custodial clinic. In so finding, the Court of Appeal has also considered the content of [the various reports] that have been prepared on the subject of [Mr Kuiters’s] personality, in addition to the seriousness of the first criminal act found proven [i.e. threatening grievous bodily harm]. That act is an indictable offence (misdrijf) that, according to its statutory definition, carries a prison sentence of more than four years.” 25. The TBS order entered into force on 4 February 2009. 26. After an initial period of two years, the Breda Regional Court extended the TBS order with two more years on 11 February 2011. Mr Kuiters did not object to such an extension. It is reflected in the decision that the institution in which Mr Kuiters was being held did not expect that it would be possible to terminate the TBS order after the end of that term. 27. The TBS order came up for review again in early 2013. The public prosecutor sought a further two-year extension. 28. Having held a hearing on 12 February 2013, the Zeeland-West-Brabant Regional Court (by this time the successor to the Breda Regional Court) gave a decision extending the TBS order by one year. Its reasoning included the following: “Is the TBS order limited in duration? First of all, the Regional Court must ascertain whether or not the TBS order in the present case is limited in duration. Therefore, the question must be answered whether the TBS order was imposed in connection with a crime of violence within the meaning of Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code. The Regional Court will first determine the framework for review on the basis of which this question should be answered. In this respect, recent developments in case-law are of particular importance. Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code provides that the total duration of a TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic shall not exceed a period of four years, unless the TBS order is imposed in connection with a crime that is directed against, or endangers the physical integrity of one or more persons. Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that, if the confinement in a custodial clinic has been imposed in connection with a crime that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons, the judgment shall state the reasons for so doing. The Court of Appeal of Arnhem, referring to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) of 31 July 2012 [Van der Velden v. the Netherlands], has held in its decision of 1 October 2012 [see below] that it is not for the court ruling on the extension of the TBS order, in the event that the judgment or decision in which the imposition of the TBS order has been given does not contain the reasoning as referred to in Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to determine retrospectively, by interpretation of the judgment of the trial court, whether or not the TBS order was imposed in connection with an indictable offence that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons, and accordingly whether or not the TBS order is limited in duration. The Court of Appeal has furthermore considered that it is not a matter of interpretation of the judgment of the court which imposes the TBS order if, on the basis of the judicial finding of facts, the qualification and the reasons given for the imposition of the penalty or measure, it is self-evident that the crime in issue is such as referred to in Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code. In its judgment of 12 February 2013, the Supreme Court held that the aforementioned judgment of the Court of Appeal of Arnhem is partly incorrect. The Supreme Court considers, first and foremost, that it is the court which imposes the TBS order that decides whether or not this order is limited in duration. The Supreme Court furthermore considers that it will be relatively simple to establish whether the order has been imposed in connection with a crime of violence if the court which imposed the TBS order, in giving reasons for so doing, has stated that the measure was imposed in relation to a crime of violence. If such explicit reasoning is missing, this does not mean that the measure cannot be extended, if this means that the TBS will last longer than four years. What is important is whether the TBS order has been imposed for a crime of violence. Whether or not this is so can also be deduced from the other contents of the final judgment of the court that imposed the TBS order – considered in context if need be –, such as the judicial findings of fact, evidence, qualification, reasoning of the rejection of defences put forward and reasons given for the sanctions imposed. If on that basis it is evident that the crime was one of violence, it cannot be said in any event that the possibility of extension of the measure after four years was not foreseeable for the person subject to the TBS order. If explicit reasoning is absent and it is not evident from the judgment of the court that imposed the TBS order that it concerns a crime of violence, the court that decides on the request for extension of the TBS order will have to form an opinion about the question whether – having regard to all the facts and circumstances that were known at the relevant time – the crime can be regarded as such a crime of violence. In so doing the court that decides on the request for extension has to take into account all relevant circumstances; in addition, information besides that mentioned in the final judgment can also be taken into account. In the case of a threat the court that decides on the request for extension can take into consideration whether the threat was preceded, accompanied or followed by non-verbal aggressive behaviour towards the threatened person, or was in any (other) way reinforced, and also whether it was plausible at the relevant time that the threat would be carried out. According to the Supreme Court, the point is that the finding of the court that decides on the request for extension that the TBS order was originally imposed for a crime of violence should be reasonably foreseeable and thus should not come as a surprise for the person subject to the TBS order. ... Agreeing on this point with defense counsel, the Regional Court is of the opinion that it is not self-evident from the judgment of the Court of Appeal that the crime in issue was a crime of violence. The Regional Court will interpret the judgment of the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal on the basis of the relevant facts and circumstances. The Regional Court deems the following of importance. The ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal, in its special considerations regarding the evidence, held that on 20 June 2007 in Prinsenbeek Kuiters had smashed the windows of the house of Mr de V. with a baseball bat. He had, given the parked car in front of the door, drawn the conclusion that V. was at home and wanted to make a statement. A reporting officer observed that the glass was scattered over a distance of 10 metres. The Court of Appeal has furthermore taken notice of the history between Kuiters and Mr de V. On 16 May 2003 Mr de V. reported attempted manslaughter and destruction. One night a brick had been thrown through his bedroom window, which brick landed next to him on his bed. On 4 February 2007 he furthermore reported destruction and threat, after Kuiters had shot through the windows of Mr de V’s car with a crossbow. Furthermore, the ‘s-Hertogenbosch Court of Appeal has found, inter alia, that [Mr Kuiters’s] violent actions had been highly threatening for Mr de V. and that for him there were good grounds to conclude that, if he did not yield to the desires of [Mr Kuiters], he would run a serious risk of sustaining serious bodily injury. The Regional Court concludes from the foregoing that the Court of Appeal was of the opinion that there was a justified fear that at some point Kuiters would direct his aggression directly against Mr de V. and that the latter would run a risk of sustaining serious bodily injury. In view of that, and the circumstances cited by the Court of Appeal, the history and the terms used, the Regional Court is of the opinion that the Court of Appeal meant to impose the TBS order in connection with an indictable offence directed against, or endangering, the physical integrity of a person as referred to in Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code. Having regard to the foregoing, in the view of the Regional Court it cannot be said that, in the light of the judgment of the Supreme Court, it was not reasonably foreseeable that the TBS order was imposed in connection with such a crime of violence. This means that the TBS order with compulsory treatment in the present case is not limited in duration.” 29. Mr Kuiters appealed to the Arnhem-Leeuwarden Court of Appeal. Having held a hearing on 6 June 2013, the Court of Appeal gave a decision on 20 June 2013 endorsing the Regional Court’s decision, including its reasoning, in its entirety. 30. As relevant to the case, the Criminal Code provides as follows: Article 37a “1. The court may impose a TBS order on a suspect whose mental faculties were inadequately developed or pathologically disturbed at the time of the commission of the offence if: 1º the offence he has committed is one which, according to its statutory definition, renders offenders liable to a term of imprisonment of four years or more, ... and 2º the said measure is necessary in the interests of the safety of others or the general safety of persons or goods. ... 4. In giving an order under paragraph 1, the court shall take account of the statements contained in the other opinions and reports made concerning the suspect’s personality, and shall take account of the seriousness of the offence committed and the number of previous convictions for indictable offences.” 31. The offences of which the applicants were variously found guilty include, in each case, at least one indictable offence carrying a maximum sentence of four years or more. Article 37b “1. The court may order that a person who is subject to a TBS order shall be confined in a custodial clinic if this is necessary in the interests of the safety of others or the general safety of persons or goods. ...” Article 38d “1. A TBS order shall remain in force for a period of two years, counting from the day on which the judgment imposing it has become final. 2. Except as provided in Article 38e ..., the duration of the TBS order can be extended, on the application of the public prosecution service (openbaar ministerie), for either one year or two years at a time, if the safety of others or the general safety of persons or goods requires such extension. A second extension is possible only when an order as mentioned in Article 37b ... has been given.” Article 38e “1. The total duration of the TBS order shall not exceed a four-year period, unless the TBS order is imposed in connection with an indictable offence that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons. 2. If the total duration of the TBS order is not limited in time, the duration of the TBS order can be extended periodically, if the safety of others or the general safety of persons requires such extension.” 32. As relevant to the cases, the Code of Criminal Procedure provides as follows: Article 359 “1. The judgment shall state the charges and the public prosecutor’s sentence request (vordering). 2. The decisions referred to in Articles 349 § 1 [preliminary issues] and 358 §§ 2 and 3 [substantive issues] shall be reasoned. If the decision deviates from positions explicitly argued by the suspect or the public prosecutor, the judgment shall indicate, in particular, the reasons (geeft ... in het bijzonder de redenen op) for so doing. ... 4. If Article 9a of the Criminal Code [the decision not to impose a sentence or non-punitive measure] or Article 44a of the Criminal Code [reduction of sentence in exchange for giving evidence against another suspect] is applied, the judgment shall state the special reasons (geeft.... in het bijzonder redenen op) that have led to that decision. 5. The judgment shall state, in particular, the reasons (geeft in het bijzonder de redenen op) that have determined the sentence or led to the non-punitive measure. 6. In imposing a sentence or non-punitive measure involving deprivation of liberty, the judgment shall state, in particular, the reasons (geeft ... in het bijzonder de redenen op) which have led to the choice of this type of sentence or non-punitive measure. In addition, the judgment shall indicate, as far as possible, the circumstances taken into account in setting the length of the sentence. 7. If a TBS order with an order for confinement in a custodial clinic has been imposed in connection with an indictable offence directed against, or endangering, the physical integrity of one or more persons, the judgment shall so indicate, giving reasons (geeft het vonnis dit onder opgave van redenen aan). 8. All on pain of nullity.” 33. The following passages are excerpts from the drafting history of Article 38e of the Criminal Code and Article 359 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Wetboek van Strafvordering): “... I [i.e. the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie)] propose to let the court which imposes the TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic decide whether that order is subject to a maximum or not. That court knows the case file well and is best placed to get an idea of the interaction between the act and the actor (daad-dadercomplex). It will then be determined from the outset whether it is subject to a maximum or not. Moreover, it is desirable both from the perspective of treatment and from that of the legal position of the person subject to the order that it be foreseeable at the time when the TBS order is imposed whether the TBS order is subject to a maximum or not. The treatment plan can be drawn up accordingly. The person subject to the TBS order will then know, if the order is subject to a maximum, what its maximum duration will be. ... The court which imposes the TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic will have to decide, giving reasons, whether the crime in issue is one that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons. ... In opting for this solution it will have to be taken as part of the deal that in a number of cases the question whether the TBS order is subject to a maximum or not will be the object of an appeal or an appeal on points of law.” (page 9) and “The proposed amendment of Article 359 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure] can be seen as a logical consequence (pendant) of the proposed amendment of Article 38e of the Criminal Code. The court which imposes the TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic must indicate in its judgment, giving reasons, whether it considers that the crime in issue is one that is directed against, or endangers, the physical integrity of one or more persons. It is thus clear from the start whether the TBS order is subject to a maximum or not. As a rule, it will be enough for the court to point to the nature of the indictable offence as found proven and qualified. The prescribed reasoning will therefore not normally be subject to such stringent requirements. However, in certain circumstances the court will have to give reasoning setting out the specific facts or circumstances.” (page 13) “The court which imposes the [TBS order with confinement in a custodial clinic] at the same time decides whether it shall be limited in time or not. The court to which it falls to consider whether the order should be extended or not is dispensed from making that choice.” (pages 1-2) and “The current maximisation arrangement [i.e. the arrangement existing until the entry into force of the legislation here in issue] differs from that proposed as regards the moment at which it is decided whether the duration of the TBS order shall be determined in advance or not. The decision on the question whether the TBS order is subject to a maximum will be taken, pursuant to the proposed Article 38e of the Criminal Code, when the order is imposed and is to be based on the trial court’s view of the nature of the crime. In considering the request to extend the TBS order it is no longer an issue whether the crime belongs to the exceptions enumerated in the first paragraph of Article 38e; the court which imposed the order will already have determined that, giving reasons in accordance with the additional requirements set out in Article 359 [of the Code of Criminal Procedure]. The current arrangement allows the court [which decides on the extension of the TBS order] to express its views on the seriousness of the crime for which the order was imposed in its decision.” (page 5) 34. The Explanatory Memorandum gives a non-exhaustive enumeration of indictable offences for which the maximum four-year term is not intended to apply. Offences listed include, amongst others, rape (Article 242 of the Criminal Code), indecent assault (Article 246 of the Criminal Code); committing lewd acts out of wedlock with a person below the age of sixteen (Article 247 of the Criminal Code); manslaughter (Article 287 of the Criminal Code); murder (Article 289); causing grievous bodily harm (Article 302 of the Criminal Code); and robbery with violence (Article 312 of the Criminal Code). 35. In a decision of 1 October 2012, LJN BX8788, the Arnhem Court of Appeal, reversing its earlier case-law in response to the Van der Velden judgment of this Court, held that it was not for the court called upon to decide on the extension of a TBS measure (on appeal) to supplement the judgment of the trial court by interpretation and decide, retrospectively, whether or not a TBS order had originally been imposed in connection with a crime of violence. 36. However, it was not “interpretation” to find that in view of the conviction, the qualification and the reasoning on which the sentence and/or the TBS order was grounded, considered in context, it was self-evident to anyone that the crime in issue was one of violence. 37. The case itself concerned a person convicted of threatening to kill someone with a knife. 38. The Procurator General (procureur-generaal) to the Supreme Court lodged an appeal on points of law “in the interests of the law” (cassatie in het belang der wet) against the Court of Appeal’s decision of 1 October 2012. 39. The Supreme Court gave judgment on 12 February 2013 (LJN BY8434). As relevant to the case before the Court, it held as follows: “4.1. The points of law argue essentially that the Court of Appeal erred in refusing the request to extend the TBS order or did so on inadequate grounds. 4.2. The Supreme Court notes that the [Van der Velden judgment] concerned a case in which the court which imposed the TBS order (opleggingsrechter) had not expressed a view on the question whether the indictable offence in issue had been one directed against, or endangering, the physical integrity of one or more persons (referred to hereafter, for the sake of brevity, as a ‘crime of violence’), and in which the court which had initially decided on the request for extension of that measure (verlengingsrechter) had found that the crime in issue was not a crime of violence in that sense. It was only the court which was called upon on appeal to consider the extension of the TBS order which came to a different conclusion and found the criminal act in connection with which the measure had been imposed to be a crime of violence. The Supreme Court understands this decision of the European Court of Human Rights, in which the interest of legal certainty is stressed where it concerns deprivation of liberty, in the sense that the conditions which must be met for a deprivation of liberty to be considered ‘lawful’/’régulière’ within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention must be clearly circumscribed and that the way in which they are applied must be reasonably foreseeable. This means, in cases such as the present, that the view taken by the court which imposes the TBS order concerning the question whether the TBS order is imposed in connection with a crime of violence is decisive for the question whether the measure is amenable to extension by the court which decides on extension of the measure, as provided for by Articles 38d and 38e of the Criminal Code. It is thus the court which imposes the TBS order which decides – in brief – whether the TBS order imposed by it is limited in duration or not. 4.3. It will, as a rule, be relatively simple to establish that decision if the court which imposed the TBS order, in giving reasons for so doing – preferably in the words of Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure –, has stated that the measure was imposed in relation to a crime of violence, or not as the case may be. That is of particular importance if the crime in relation to which the TBS order was imposed cannot without further explanation be characterised as a crime of violence – i.e. as an indictable offence that was directed against, or endangered, the physical integrity of one or more persons – as in the case of threatening (bedreiging, Article 285 of the Criminal Code), or stalking (belaging, Article 285b of the Criminal Code), in relation to which the measure here in issue can be imposed pursuant to Article 37a § 1 (a) of the Criminal Code. 4.4. The sole fact that the sentencing court in its reasoning has not stated in so many words that the TBS order was imposed in connection with a crime of violence does not entail that the measure can no longer be extended if its total duration exceeds a period of four years. The only condition set by Article 38e § 1 of the Criminal Code for the extension of the TBS order is that the measure be imposed in connection with a crime of violence. Whether such is the case can also be deduced from the other content of the final judgment of the sentencing court – whether it be read in context or not – such as the conviction, the evidence relied on, the qualification, the reasoning of the rejection of any defences put forward and the reasoning of the sanction or sanctions imposed. If, on that basis, it is evident that the crime is one of violence, then at the very least it cannot be said that the possibility of extension of the measure beyond four years was not foreseeable for the person subject to the TBS order. 4.5. The opinion of the Court of Appeal that, except in cases as referred to above, it is not for the court that decides on the extension of the measure to determine retroactively ‘by interpretation of the judgment of the court which imposed the TBS order’ whether or not the TBS order was imposed in relation to a crime of violence is not, however, borne out by the said judgment of the European Court of Human Rights and moreover cannot be accepted as correct. There is no rule of law that prevents the court which decides on the extension of the TBS order from coming to the conclusion, based also on other information than that contained in the final judgment [of the trial court] – such as the proceedings of the hearing of the court which imposed the TBS order, as apparent from the official record made of that hearing – that the TBS order was imposed in relation to a crime of violence; it cannot, moreover, be ruled out that other documents available to the court which imposed the TBS order are conclusive on this point. 4.6. Consultation of these documents will be indicated especially if the final judgment does not contain sufficiently clear reasoning as referred to in Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or otherwise does not give sufficient pointers (aanknopingspunten) to conclude that the fact for which the TBS order was imposed must be characterised ipso facto as a crime of violence, like the threat of lethal violence held proven in the instant case. In such a situation the court that decides on the extension of the TBS order will have to arrive at a conclusion as to whether – in view of all the facts and circumstances that were known at the time – the threat constituted such a crime of violence. In this connection, it is worth noting that – contrary to the point of departure that seems to have been chosen by the Court of Appeal – the court which decides on the extension of the TBS order must take into consideration all relevant circumstances. In so doing it will be in a position to consider, among other things, whether the threat was preceded, accompanied, or followed by non-verbal aggressive behaviour against the person threatened or in some (other) way reinforced, and whether at the time it was likely that the threat might be carried out. There is no rule of law that prevents the court which decides on the extension of the TBS order from considering the finding that the crime in issue was one of violence implicit in the final judgment of the court which imposed the TBS order. In this way, it can be avoided that in those cases in which the court which imposed the TBS order failed to provide adequate clarity, either as prescribed by Article 359 § 7 of the Code of Criminal procedure or in some other way, as to whether the TBS order was limited in duration, this oversight (verzuim) by itself should prevent the measure from being extended, even if it is clear to all concerned that the TBS order was imposed for a crime of violence and it therefore merely concerns an oversight by the court which imposed the TBS order. What is decisive in cases such as the present is that the finding of the court which decides on the extension of the TBS order that the TBS order was at the time imposed in relation to an indictable offence that was directed against, or endangered, the physical integrity of one or more persons should be reasonably foreseeable and therefore should not come as a surprise to the person on whom the order was imposed.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
191,001-150819,ENG,FIN,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,VP-KULJETUS OY AND OTHERS v. FINLAND,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant company, VP-Kuljetus Oy, is a Finnish limited liability company which has its seat in Rauha. The second and third applicants, Mr Kyösti Juhani Hynninen and Mr Arto Sakari Piiparinen, are Finnish nationals who live in Ruokolahti and Helsinki respectively. The applicants are represented before the Court by Mr Kari Uoti, a lawyer practising in Helsinki. 2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The second and third applicants are the owners and the only board members of the applicant company. The applicant company was in the transport business in Russia. Before returning from Russia, the tanks of the company trucks were normally filled with diesel and legally imported into Finland. Such diesel was tax and customs free and there was no obligation to inform the authorities about it. However, such diesel could not be used in any other vehicles unless customs and excise duties were paid. 5. Between December 2000 and December 2006 some of the diesel brought to Finland in the applicant company’s trucks was removed from the tanks and transferred to a container situated on the company premises. From there the diesel was further transferred to other company cars, as well as to the personal cars of the second and third applicants. No customs and excise duties or other fees were paid. 6. On 15 May 2007 the Customs Office ordered the applicant company, jointly with the second and third applicants, to pay customs duties, valueadded tax and excise in the amount of 61,520.24 euros (EUR) for the years 2004, 2005 and 2006. These import taxes were levied because the diesel imported from Russia had been removed from the tanks of the trucks and transferred to a container for purposes other than the repair of the vehicles in question. Apparently this decision was not appealed against. 7. On 19 March 2008 the public prosecutor brought charges against the second and third applicants for aggravated tax fraud (törkeä veropetos, grovt skattebedrägeri) concerning the time between December 2000 and December 2006. They were accused of aggravated tax fraud because, as board members of the applicant company together with a third person and in their personal capacity, they had participated in tax evasion by transferring 234,138 litres of diesel imported from Russia to other cars without paying any import taxes, namely customs duties, value-added tax and excise. The amount of evaded taxes had totalled EUR 115,839.10. 8. On 3 October 2008 the Lappeenranta District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) convicted the second and third applicants as charged and sentenced both of them to an 8-month suspended prison sentence. They were ordered to pay jointly to the customs authorities EUR 54,318.29 plus interest as compensation for different taxes evaded during the years 2001, 2002 and 2003. 9. By letter dated 30 October 2008 the second and third applicants appealed to the Kouvola Appeal Court (hovioikeus, hovrätten), requesting that the District Court judgment be quashed. 10. On 4 June 2009 the Kouvola Appeal Court upheld the District Court judgment. 11. By letter dated 25 June 2009 the second and third applicants appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), requesting that the charges be dismissed and the compensation claims be rejected. 12. By letter dated 3 July 2009 the second and third applicants referred to a recent case of the Court concerning ne bis in idem and requested the Supreme Court to take it into account as an alternative to their primary claims. 13. On 22 December 2009 the Supreme Court refused the second and third applicants leave to appeal. 14. On 5 September 2007 the Vehicle Administration (Ajoneuvohallintokeskus, Fordonsförvaltningscentralen), the current Finnish Transport Safety Agency (Liikenteen turvallisuusvirasto, Trafiksäkerhetsverket), imposed on the applicants a fuel fee (polttoainemaksu, bränsleavgift) and an additional tax (lisävero, tilläggsskatt) concerning the years from 2002 to 2006 for having used more leniently taxed diesel than diesel oil in their vehicles without giving any prior notification to the authorities. The fee and the additional tax for the applicant company amounted to EUR 1,827,570. The second applicant was ordered to pay EUR 51,381 and the third applicant EUR 99,045 respectively in fuel fees and additional tax for having used untaxed diesel in their private cars. 15. By letter dated 14 September 2007 the applicants appealed to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen), claiming that the taxes and fees should be quashed as they had no legal basis. 16. On 24 September 2007 the Vehicle Administration decided to stay the order to pay the above fuel fees and additional taxes until the Administrative Court could decide on the enforcement of the taxes in question. 17. On 16 October 2007 the Administrative Court stayed the attachment of the above fees and taxes by allowing a seizure but prohibiting their sale. This stay on enforcement was to remain in force until the final decision in the case. 18. On 2 July 2008 the Administrative Court rejected the applicants’ appeals. 19. By letter dated 30 August 2008 the applicants appealed further to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltningsdomstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Administrative Court. 20. During the written phase, the Supreme Administrative Court asked the parties ex officio to comment on the Court’s recent judgment Ruotsalainen v. Finland in the context of the present case. The tax authorities affirmed in their statement of 6 May 2010 that the subject of the tax fraud proceedings and the obligation to pay fuel fees did not concern the same set of events but events which were distinct in time and place. The applicants argued in their submission of 11 September 2010 that all sanctions imposed in the case (taxes, fees, order to pay compensation and criminal sanctions) were based on the same set of facts. 21. On 16 September 2011 the Supreme Administrative Court granted the applicants leave to appeal but rejected their appeals. It thus upheld the Administrative Court’s decisions. It found that the fuel fees concerning the years 2002 and 2003 had been imposed threefold and those concerning the years 2004 to 2006 had been increased by 50%. The second and third applicants had been convicted of aggravated tax fraud for failure to pay import taxes on diesel imported between 2000 and 2006 by a judgment that had become final on 22 December 2009. As the criminal proceedings concerned failure to pay import taxes on the imported diesel and the fuel fees concerned the use of such diesel after the importation into Finland, it was not a question of the same matter. The ne bis in idem principle had thus not been violated. 22. According to Chapter 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen; as amended by Acts no. 1228/1997 and no. 769/1990), a person who (1) gives a taxation authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (2) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (3) for the purpose of avoiding tax, fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation, influencing the assessment of tax, or (4) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed, or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded, shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of up to two years. If by the tax fraud (1) considerable financial benefit is sought or (2) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period between four months and four years. 23. If a more leniently taxed oil than diesel oil is used as motor fuel, prior notice of such intended use must be given and additional tax and/or a fuel fee shall be paid. According to the Fuel Fee Act (laki polttoainemaksusta, lagen om bränsleavgift, Act no. 337/1993), which was in force until 31 December 2003, the fuel fee was not collected on the fuel contained in the tank of a vehicle when the vehicle was imported. If the use of a more leniently taxed fuel than diesel oil was discovered in a vehicle during a time in respect of which no prior notification had been given, the fuel fee collected was to be three times the normal amount. The current Fuel Fee Act (Act no. 1280/2003), which entered into force on 1 January 2004, contains the same provisions except for the increased amount of the fee. The fee shall be increased by a maximum of 30% if no prior notification has been made, by a maximum of 50% if the use is repetitive and at most it can be doubled in aggravated cases.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
192,001-157445,ENG,ITA,ADMISSIBILITY,2015,GIORGINI v. ITALY,4,Inadmissible,Guido Raimondi;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Ledi Bianku;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"1. The applicant, Ms Ebe Gigliola Giorgini, is an Italian national, who was born in 1933 and is under house arrest in Marina di Pietrasanta. She was represented before the Court by Mr D. Ammannato, a lawyer practising in Florence. 2. summarised as follows. 3. On 8 April 2008 the applicant was convicted of a number of criminal offences by the Forlì District Court. Such offences included criminal association, aggravated fraud, and ill-treatment. 4. On an unspecified date she lodged an appeal with the Bologna Court of Appeal. 5. On 22 June 2010 the Bologna Court of Appeal partly upheld and partly reversed the District Court’s judgment. The conviction for the offence of criminal association was upheld. 6. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation. 7. She states that on 4 July 2011 the President of Second Criminal Section of the Court of Cassation set the hearing for 15 November 2011. 8. On 24 October 2011 the National Criminal Lawyers’ Association (Unione Camere Penali italiane) called a five-day strike, scheduled to run from 14 to 18 November 2011. 9. On 28 October 2011 the applicant filed additional written submissions with the court. 10. On 7 November 2011 the applicant’s counsel formally adhered to the strike and filed a notice to that effect with the Court of Cassation, having obtained the applicant’s consent in writing. For this reason, he was not present at the hearing of 15 November 2011. 11. It appears from the hearing record that the Prosecutor General requested that the Court of Cassation refrain from adjourning the hearing on account of the counsel’s absence. The court granted the prosecutor’s request and the hearing was held as scheduled. 12. In a judgment of 15 November 2011 the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal. 13. On 9 June 2010 the Pistoia preliminary investigations judge ordered that the applicant be placed in pre-trial detention on suspicion that she had committed further offences. These included the offence of criminal association, of which the applicant was suspected of being the leader, promoter and organizer. The applicant was also suspected of having committed the offence of unauthorized practice of medicine. Specifically, she was suspected of providing medical advice and treatment, as well as prescribing drugs to adults and minors, and using her home as an unauthorized medical clinic. She was further suspected of fraud, aggravated by a number of factors including the exploitation of vulnerable individuals’ pain and suffering, and the generation of ill-founded fears from which she profited. The preliminary investigations judge emphasised that the applicant had been previously convicted of similar offences. 14. It appears from the material in the case file that pre-trial detention had been requested on a number of grounds, namely the strong evidence against her, the seriousness of the suspected offences, and the significant risk that she might reoffend. 15. The applicant states that she was transferred to the Sollicciano correctional facility in Florence on 11 June 2010. 16. On 21 July 2010 the applicant’s counsel lodged a request with the Pistoia preliminary investigations judge, seeking the replacement of the applicant’s detention with a more lenient custodial measure, such as house arrest. He argued that both her advanced age and allegedly critical state of health were incompatible with detention in prison. 17. On an unspecified date the judge ordered that she be examined by an independent medical expert with a view to determining whether this was the case. 18. In an order of 30 July 2010 the judge confirmed that the applicant would remain in custody, as the independent medical expert’s report had stated that her state of health was compatible with detention. 19. On 7 August 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal with the Florence District Court on two main grounds. She contended that while under Article 275 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 37 below) the detention on remand of persons aged over seventy was only allowed if exceptional reasons warranting such a measure existed, in her case no such reasons could be detected. She further reiterated the argument that her advanced age and critical state of health were incompatible with detention in prison, contending that she suffered from life-threatening medical conditions she identified as cardiovascular disease, acute osteoporosis and diabetes. She also highlighted that she had undergone major surgical procedures in the past, including a gastrectomy, mastectomy, and hysterectomy, and suffered from anxiety disorder and glucose intolerance. 20. The Florence District Court, sitting as the authority with jurisdiction to decide on measures involving deprivation of liberty (tribunale della libertà e del riesame), dismissed the applicant’s appeal on 1 October 2010. It found that the exceptional grounds for her to be detained on remand, as listed in the preliminary investigation judge’s order of 9 June 2010, still existed. It further pointed out that she had in the past been convicted of analogous offences and had, as soon as she had been released, resumed her criminal activity. As to the applicant’s health, the court drew on the expert medical report requested by the preliminary investigations judge to conclude that there was no incompatibility between it and her detention in a correctional facility. Referring to extracts from the report, the court observed that there was no evidence of an imminent risk of congestive heart failure or other life-threatening conditions, contrary to her contentions. It went on to acknowledge the expert’s finding that she had undergone several major surgical procedures in the past, but that these had allowed for the treatment of serious medical conditions, thus leading to an improvement in her clinical situation. Drawing on the report, it further concluded that the provision of special meals to meet her nutritional needs and the necessary drug therapy could be adequately taken care of in a correctional facility. It appears from the order that the court also examined medical reports submitted by the prosecutor and applicant’s counsel and took the latter into account when reaching its conclusions. 21. On 10 October 2010 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation. 22. On 1 December 2010 she was committed for trial and the first hearing before the Pistoia District Court was scheduled for 22 March 2011. She was formally charged with all the suspected offences including criminal association, the unlawful practice of medicine, and aggravated fraud (see paragraph 7 above). 23. On 16 February 2011 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible. 24. On 4 May 2011 the applicant’s counsel submitted a further request seeking the replacement of the applicant’s detention with house arrest, reiterating the argument that both her advanced age and state of health were incompatible with detention in prison. He relied, inter alia, on a medical certificate issued by the prison doctor on 5 April 2011, in which her clinical condition was described as “complex and multifaceted” and “difficult to manage” in a regular correctional facility. 25. On an unspecified date the Pistoia District Court ordered a new medical examination with a view to assessing the compatibility of her state of health with detention. 26. On 5 May 2011 it dismissed the request for house arrest, having regard to the persistent danger that the applicant might reoffend. However, the court ordered that she be transferred to a correctional hospital (centro clinico penitenziario) in Pisa with a view to ensuring increased medical supervision and the provision of any necessary treatment, and preventing a further deterioration in her health. The court reached its conclusions by relying on a number of findings by the expert, who found that the gastrectomy performed in 1967 had left her with some long-term side effects, including insufficient absorption of calcium and vitamin D. He also noted with some concern that she had experienced height and weight loss and that her osteoporosis had worsened during the months spent in detention. In order to manage her condition effectively and prevent its deterioration, the expert noted that she would require small, frequent meals, a special diet enriched by dietary supplements, and some form of exercise. Finally, he pointed out a slight cerebral atrophy, coupled with a mild anxiety-depressive disorder. 27. On 10 May 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal, reiterating the incompatibility of her age and state of health with any form of detention, even in a correctional hospital. 28. On 20 June 2011 the Florence District Court, sitting as the authority with jurisdiction to decide on measures involving deprivation of liberty, placed the applicant under house arrest. It relied on the medical report submitted by the expert to the Pistoia District Court to conclude that an “incompatibility in substance” with detention existed in her case and that a less restrictive measure, such as house arrest, was preferable under the circumstances. 29. It ordered the applicant’s immediate release and set out the specific conditions of her house arrest, including the requirement that she stay in her home at all times, leave only with the authorities’ prior permission, and refrain from contacting or interacting with anyone except her authorised cohabitees and medical staff. 30. On 23 June 2011 the public prosecutor lodged an appeal on points of law with the Court of Cassation. 31. On 19 October 2011 the Court of Cassation declared the appeal inadmissible. 32. On 4 June 2012 the public prosecutor requested that the house arrest be substituted with detention on remand, as the applicant had breached its conditions. He provided evidence that, amongst other things, she had been in contact with several unauthorised individuals including co-defendants in the ongoing criminal proceedings and a number of her “followers” and “admirers”. 33. On an unspecified date the Pistoia District Court ordered a new medical examination with a view to determining whether her state of health was compatible with detention. 34. On 6 July 2012 the Pistoia District Court granted the prosecutor’s request and remanded the applicant in custody, ordering that she be transferred at once to the correctional hospital in Pisa. It found that she had violated the terms of her house arrest, and that the situation which had arisen was conducive to her re-establishing the network which had supported her criminal activity. As to her health, the court drew on the medical report it had requested which stated that adequate monitoring and treatment of her medical conditions, as well as the provision of adequate nutrition in compliance with her special dietary needs, could be carried out in a correctional hospital. In particular, the expert noted that treatment of the applicant’s osteoporosis to prevent future damage to her bone structure would not in any way be hindered by her detention in such a facility. He added that while under house arrest, she had experienced three fractures, suggesting that the monitoring of her condition in a correctional hospital could be in no way considered inferior. 35. On 22 October 2012 the Pisa correctional hospital issued a medical certificate concerning the applicant’s state of health. It described her medical history and the outcome of various specialist consultations she had undergone in the facility in previous months. An orthopaedic specialist had confirmed her advanced osteoporosis and prescribed treatment, a cardiologist had reported good cardiac function, while an ophthalmologist had recommended that she undergo surgery for a cataract in her left eye. The report further contained a recommendation that the applicant undergo a colonoscopy. Concerns were raised regarding the difficulties encountered in the management of treatment and diagnostic tests which had required transporting her to external facilities. Both her cataract surgery and the colonoscopy had to be rescheduled due to the unavailability of police officers who should have escorted her to the external facilities. The doctors concluded that the continued detention of the applicant, albeit in a correctional hospital, could have resulted in the deterioration in her health. 36. On 18 December 2012 the applicant’s counsel submitted a request to the Florence Court of Appeal, seeking the substitution of the detention on remand with house arrest. He reiterated all the arguments raised at first instance and referred to extracts from the report issued by the correctional hospital on 22 October 2012. 37. The request was granted on the same day and the applicant was placed under house arrest. 38. According to the material in the case file, she is currently under house arrest, as the criminal proceedings against her are pending before the Court of Cassation. 39. Article 274 provides that a person may be detained pending trial: “(a) if detention is demanded by special and unavoidable requirements of the inquiry into the facts under investigation concerning a genuine and present danger for the production or authenticity of evidence and based on matters of fact which must, on pain of nullity, be expressly set out in the decision, which the judicial authority may take of its own motion...; (b) if the accused has absconded or there is a real danger of his absconding, provided that the court considers that, if convicted, he will be liable to a prison sentence of more than two years; (c) where, given the specific nature and circumstances of the offence and having regard to the character of the suspect or the accused as shown by his conduct, acts or criminal record, there is a genuine risk that he will commit a serious offence involving the use of weapons or other violent means against the person or an offence against the constitutional order or an offence relating to organised crime or a further offence of the same kind as that of which he is suspected or accused...”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
193,001-140942,ENG,SRB,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,VIDIĆ AND OTHERS v. SERBIA,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Guido Raimondi;Helen Keller;Nebojša Vučinić;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"The cases originated in three separate applications against Serbia (see list appended), lodged with the Court under Article 34 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“the Convention”). The persons stated as the applicants in the application forms were Mr Milomir Vidić (application no. 60/10), Mr Radomir Aleksić (application no. 77/10), and Mr Petronije Perić (application no. 110/10). They were all Serbian nationals, born in 1960, 1935 and 1953, respectively. Mr M. Jevtović, a lawyer practising in Užice, claimed to represent the applicants before the Court. The Serbian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr S. Carić. The applications were lodged on 6 November 2009 and concerned the non-enforcement of four final court judgments rendered against a socially/State-owned company (see, for example, R. Kačapor and Others v. Serbia, nos. 2269/06, 3041/06, 3042/06, 3043/06, 3045/06 and 3046/06, 15 January 2008). Enclosed with the application forms were the powersofattorney dated 15 October 2009 and signed “Vidić Milomir”, “Radomir Aleksić” and “Perić Petronije”. The powers-of-attorney were also signed by Mr Jevtović and stamped with his stamp. On the basis of signed declarations according to which the Government undertook to pay to each applicant 2,100 euros in respect of non-pecuniary damage and legal costs plus the sums awarded in the final domestic decisions, on 13 November 2012 the Court decided to strike the applications out of its list of cases. By letter of 20 February 2013 the Government notified the Court that Mr Milomir Vidić, Mr Radomir Aleksić, and Mr Petronije Perić had actually died on 1 June 2003, 16 December 2004 and 21 August 2004 respectively, that is before the applications had been lodged. In his reply of 30 April 2013 Mr Jevtović did not contest that Mr Milomir Vidić, Mr Radomir Aleksić, and Mr Petronije Perić had died before the applications were lodged, but stated that he had been unaware of this fact at that time, because he had represented those applicants, along with many of their colleagues. Since his clients performed construction work in the field, he was unable to meet them all, but asked some of them to have powers-of-attorney signed by their colleagues and to bring those forms to him. He also stated that he had no reason or interest in lodging applications on behalf of dead persons, when he could have lodged the application on behalf of their heirs. In this respect, Mr Jevtović produced powerofattorney forms signed by the heirs of Mr Milomir Vidić, Mr Radomir Aleksić and Mr Petronije Perić authorising him to receive the amounts agreed in the friendly settlement declarations. On 1 October 2013 the Court decided to restore the applications to its list of cases.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
194,001-167733,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,CORETCHI v. BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik Møse;Khanlar Hajiyev;Mārtiņš Mits;Yonko Grozev,"1. The applicant, Mr Fiodor Dumitru Coretchi, is a Moldovan national who was born in 1960 and lives in Ialoveni, Moldova. He was represented before the Court by Ms A. Dadu, a lawyer practising in Ialoveni. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice. 2. The applicant complained, in particular, about having been unlawfully detained in Bulgaria pending extradition to Moldova. 3. On 8 February 2010 the application was communicated to the Government. Later the same month the Moldovan Government was informed of their right to intervene in the proceedings in accordance with Article 36 § 1 of the Convention and Rule 44 § 1 of the Rules of Court. They chose not to avail themselves of this right. 4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 5. In 2001 the Moldovan investigating authorities came upon information leading them to suspect that in 1998 the applicant had been involved in a car theft. However, they were unable to question him as he had left Moldova earlier the same year to work in Greece. In 2002 they issued an international warrant for his arrest through Interpol. 6. On 31 July 2004, when crossing into Bulgaria from Greece, the applicant was arrested by the Bulgarian border police on the basis of the warrant issued by the Moldovan authorities. He was informed in the presence of an interpreter that he was being arrested in connection with that warrant. The same day the police ordered that he be held under arrest for twenty-four hours under section 70(1)(6) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act (see paragraph 36 below). The applicant was given a copy of the order. He surrendered his car to the border police. 7. On the same day, 31 July 2004, the Moldovan authorities confirmed their intention to their Bulgarian counterparts to submit an official request for the applicant’s extradition to Moldova. Later that day the National Interpol Office within the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior informed the Sofia city prosecutor about the applicant’s arrest. 8. The prosecutor then issued an order for the applicant’s detention for seventy-two hours, counting from the expiry of the twenty-four-hour police arrest. The order referred to Article 16 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition (“the Extradition Convention”), as well as Article 440 of the Bulgarian Code of Criminal Procedure of 1974 (“the 1974 Code”) in conjunction with Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code. The order also stated that the regional prosecutor of Blagoevgrad should be immediately put on notice in order to ask the Blagoevgrad Regional Court to authorise the applicant’s further detention. 9. On 4 August 2004 the Blagoevgrad Regional Court ordered the applicant’s detention for forty days, pending receipt of the Moldovan extradition request. On 5 August 2004 he was transferred to Bobov Dol Prison on the basis of that court’s decision. On 11 August 2004 the Bulgarian Prosecution Service informed the Moldovan authorities that the applicant had been detained pending the official Moldovan request for his extradition. Such a request had to reach Bulgaria by 8 September 2004 when the applicant’s forty-day detention would expire. 10. On 7 September 2004 the Bulgarian Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office received the extradition request. The next day that Office extended the applicant’s detention for seventy-two hours following the end of the forty-day detention period ordered by the court. The prosecutor relied on Articles 440 and 440a of the 1974 Code (see paragraphs 28-29 below) and Article 22 of the Extradition Convention (see paragraph 26 below). The Bulgarian Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office additionally instructed the Blagoevgrad regional prosecutor’s office immediately to seek a court order extending the applicant’s detention and to submit the extradition request to the court for examination. 11. On 9 September 2004 the Blagoevgrad Regional Court, in proceedings in which the applicant was assisted by an interpreter and a court-appointed lawyer, refused to authorise the applicant’s extradition to Moldova or his detention for that purpose. The court found in particular that there had been no order in Moldova for the applicant’s detention with a view to his serving a sentence, one of the conditions of the Extradition Convention. On 10 September 2004 the applicant was released from Bobov Dol Prison on the basis of that decision. 12. On 9 September 2004, seeing that the proceedings for the applicant’s extradition were still pending, the regional prosecutor of Blagoevgrad imposed a ban on the applicant leaving the country. The ban was valid until the end of the extradition proceedings and was based on a provision in the 1974 Code which stated that individuals could be banned from leaving the country if criminal proceedings were pending against them (see paragraph 34 below). 13. On 16 September 2004 the applicant registered with the authorities in Blagoevgrad where he took up his residence on a provisional basis. On 20 September 2004 the border police returned the applicant’s car to him. He signed a form confirming that the car was not damaged and that nothing was missing from it. 14. The Bulgarian border police placed the applicant under arrest for twenty-four hours at 12.30 a.m. on 25 September 2004 when he tried to leave Bulgaria by crossing the border with Greece. The order for his arrest was based on section 70(1)(7) of the 1997 Ministry of Internal Affairs Act (see paragraph 36 below) and referred to the arrest warrant issued by the Moldovan authorities in connection with the applicant’s extradition. The applicant was informed of the essence of the order in the presence of a Russian interpreter. He surrendered his car to the border police and signed a form where he wrote in Russian that he objected to his arrest. 15. Having verified that a valid ban on the applicant’s leaving the country was in force and that there were no grounds for his detention, the police released him at midday on 25 September 2004, which was twelve and a half hours before the expiry of the order for his arrest. It is unclear what happened to the applicant’s car. He did not ask for its return. 16. In a decision delivered on 27 September 2004, following a public hearing that had been held the previous week in response to an appeal by the prosecutor against the ruling of the Blagoevgrad Regional Court of 9 September 2004 (see paragraph 11 above), the Sofia Court of Appeal allowed the applicant’s extradition to Moldova. It found that the lower court had wrongly assessed the Moldovan authorities’ request. In particular, the applicant had not been wanted in Moldova to serve a sentence, as the firstinstance court had found, but to be tried in connection with an offence. That meant that a different provision of the Extradition Convention had applied and all the material and procedural requirements to grant that request had been met. 17. The Sofia Court of Appeal held in a separate decision of 27 September 2004, issued following a closed hearing the same day, that it could not rule on the applicant’s detention pending extradition. It said that it had already adopted a final and enforceable decision allowing the applicant’s extradition and that that decision had put an end to the extradition proceedings. Given that those proceedings had been concluded, the applicant could thereafter only be detained for the purposes of being handed over to the requesting authorities. 18. In a letter of 7 October 2004, the Blagoevgrad regional prosecutor’s office advised the Supreme Prosecution Office that the applicant was not in detention but that there was a valid ban on his leaving the country. It noted that he was also registered at the address of his court-appointed lawyer and that his passport and car had been returned to him. 19. On 14 October 2004 the Bulgarian Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office ordered the applicant’s detention for the purposes of his extradition to Moldova. The prosecutor’s order, written over five pages, comprised an overview of the procedural steps carried out up to that point. The order specified that the extradition proceedings were in their final phase and that the applicant was not in detention. Given that his extradition had been agreed with the Moldovan authorities and a concrete date and time for it had been set – 18 October 2004 at 11 a.m. local time – it was necessary to apprehend him for the purposes of his actual transfer into the custody of the Moldovan authorities. 20. The prosecutor then instructed the police to place the applicant under arrest on 15 October 2004 for twenty-four hours in order to extradite him. In the same order the prosecutor authorised keeping the applicant in detention for the same purpose for seventy-two hours, starting from 16 October 2004. The order referred to section 119(2)(4) of the Judicial Power Act 1994 (see paragraph 33 below, last sentence), as well as to Article 152a § 3 of the 1974 Code of Criminal procedure (see paragraph 32 below) and Articles 18 and 22 of the Extradition Convention (see paragraphs 24 and 26 below). It also stated that personal possessions taken from the applicant by the Bulgarian authorities when he had been arrested should be handed over to the Moldovan authorities at the same time as his transfer. 21. The applicant was detained on 15 October 2004 and handed over to the Moldovan authorities on 18 October 2004 as agreed. The report on his transfer stated that personal possessions held by the Bulgarian authorities were handed over to the Moldovan authorities at the same time. 22. On 23 December 2004 the Moldovan authorities discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant. On 1 July 2005 the applicant asked the Bulgarian authorities to take him off their database of wanted persons so that he could transit Bulgaria without fearing arrest. On 4 July 2005 the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office allowed that request and informed him accordingly. The border police recorded on 4 July 2005 that the applicant left Bulgaria with his car on that day. 23. The Extradition Convention entered into force in respect of Bulgaria on 15 September 1994 and in respect of Moldova on 31 December 1997. Article 16 of the Convention, which governs provisional arrest, provides as follows: “1. In case of urgency the competent authorities of the requesting Party may request the provisional arrest of the person sought. The competent authorities of the requested Party shall decide the matter in accordance with its law. 2. The request for provisional arrest shall state that one of the documents mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 2.a, exists and that it is intended to send a request for extradition. It shall also state for what offence extradition will be requested and when and where such offence was committed and shall so far as possible give a description of the person sought. 3. A request for provisional arrest shall be sent to the competent authorities of the requested Party either through the diplomatic channel or direct by post or telegraph or through the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) or by any other means affording evidence in writing or accepted by the requested Party. The requesting authority shall be informed without delay of the result of its request. 4. Provisional arrest may be terminated if, within a period of 18 days after arrest, the requested Party has not received the request for extradition and the documents mentioned in Article 12. It shall not, in any event, exceed 40 days from the date of such arrest. The possibility of provisional release at any time is not excluded, but the requested Party shall take any measures which it considers necessary to prevent the escape of the person sought. 5. Release shall not prejudice rearrest and extradition if a request for extradition is received subsequently.” 24. Article 18 governs the surrender of the person to be extradited and provides that: “1. The requested Party shall inform the requesting Party by the means mentioned in Article 12, paragraph 1, of its decision with regard to the extradition. 2. Reasons shall be given for any complete or partial rejection. 3. If the request is agreed to, the requesting Party shall be informed of the place and date of surrender and of the length of time for which the person claimed was detained with a view to surrender. 4. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 5 of this article, if the person claimed has not been taken over on the appointed date, he may be released after the expiry of 15 days and shall in any case be released after the expiry of 30 days. The requested Party may refuse to extradite him for the same offence. 5. If circumstances beyond its control prevent a Party from surrendering or taking over the person to be extradited, it shall notify the other Party. The two Parties shall agree a new date for surrender and the provisions of paragraph 4 of this article shall apply.” 25. Article 20, which governs the handing over of property, provides as follows: “1. The requested Party shall, in so far as its law permits and at the request of the requesting Party, seize and hand over property: a) which may be required as evidence, or b) which has been acquired as a result of the offence and which, at the time of the arrest, is found in the possession of the person claimed or is discovered subsequently. 2. The property mentioned in paragraph 1 of this article shall be handed over even if extradition, having been agreed to, cannot be carried out owing to the death or escape of the person claimed. 3. When the said property is liable to seizure or confiscation in the territory of the requested Party, the latter may, in connection with pending criminal proceedings, temporarily retain it or hand it over on condition that it is returned.” 26. Article 22, which specifies the applicable procedure, provides as follows: “Except where this Convention otherwise provides, the procedure with regard to extradition and provisional arrest shall be governed solely by the law of the requested Party.” 27. The Explanatory Report defines the scope of application of Article 1 of Protocol No. 7 and clarifies the notion of “expulsion” as follows: “9. The word “resident” is intended to exclude from the application of the article any alien who has arrived at a port or other point of entry but has not yet passed through the immigration control or who has been admitted to the territory for the purpose only of transit or for a limited period for a non-residential purpose ... The word lawfully refers to the domestic law of the State concerned. It is therefore for domestic law to determine the conditions which must be fulfilled for a person’s presence in the territory to be considered “lawful”. [A]n alien whose admission and stay were subject to certain conditions, for example a fixed period, and who no longer complies with these conditions cannot be regarded as being still “lawfully” present. 10. The concept of expulsion is used in a generic sense as meaning any measure compelling the departure of an alien from the territory but does not include extradition. Expulsion in this sense is an autonomous concept which is independent of any definition contained in domestic legislation.” 28. At the relevant time the extradition of persons accused of criminal offences was governed by Articles 439a-41 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure. Articles 440-440c governed the procedure for processing an extradition request made by another State. 29. Once received, the extradition request had to be sent to the competent regional prosecutor (Article 440 §§ 1 and 2). That prosecutor then had to take the statement of the person whose extradition was being sought, implement any measure taken to secure his or her appearance, and transmit the extradition request to the competent regional court (Article 440 § 3). The request was then to be examined by three judges at a public hearing. The person whose extradition was being sought had to be provided with counsel and an interpreter (Article 440a § 1). The court had to hear the public prosecutor, the person and his or her counsel, and then either allow or refuse the extradition. In its ruling it additionally had to specify whether personal items, documents and money found on the individual and having a connection with his or her offence should be handed over to the requesting State as well (Article 440a § 2). The court’s ruling was subject to appeal before the court of appeal whose decision was final (Article 440c). The prosecutor was responsible for implementing judicial decisions authorising extradition (Article 440b § 3 and Article 440c § 2). 30. At present the procedure for detention in the context of extradition proceedings requested by a third State is laid down in considerable detail in the 2005 Extradition and European Arrest Warrant Act (section 13), which entered into force on 4 July 2005 and repealed Articles 435-41 of the 1974 Code. 31. Article 152a of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, which governs the procedure for imposing pre-trial detention, was changed entirely – with effect from 1 January 2000 – in a bid to bring Bulgarian law into line with Article 5 the Convention (тълк. реш. № 1 от 25 юни 2002 г. по н.д. № 1/2002 г., ОСНК на ВКС). 32. The amended paragraph 3 of Article 152a provided at the time of the facts that the investigation and prosecution authorities had to ensure the prompt appearance of the accused before the competent first-instance court and, if necessary, detain him or her for that purpose before bringing him or her before the court. Such detention could not exceed twenty-four hours if ordered by an investigator or seventy-two hours if ordered by a prosecutor. No judicial review was available in respect of such detention. 33. At the relevant time the bodies responsible for the investigation at the pre-trial stage were investigators (Article 172 of the 1974 Code) and the prosecutors who supervised the activities of the former (Article 176 of the 1974 Code). The prerogatives of the prosecutor included the issuing of mandatory instructions to the police (section 119(2)(4) of the Judicial Power Act 1994). 34. Under Article 153a § 1 of the 1974 Code of Criminal Procedure, as applicable at the relevant time, the prosecutor could prohibit an individual accused of a criminal offence from leaving Bulgaria without permission. The prohibition order was subject to judicial review (Article 153a § 3). The court had to rule immediately by means of a final decision (Article 153a § 4). 35. At the relevant time and until 2012, individuals could seek damages for unlawful detention under the SMRDA provided that such detention had been set aside in prior proceedings for lack of lawful grounds. Following amendments introduced in the SMRDA in 2012, in particular in section 2(1)(1), individuals can seek damages for all cases of detention in breach of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention. Civil courts examine the issue of lawfulness and compensation in the same set of proceedings. 36. Under the 1997 Act, as in force at the relevant time, the police could, on the basis of a written order, arrest individuals who were on international wanted lists owing to extradition requests from other States (section 70(1)(7)). An individual taken into police custody was entitled to be assisted by counsel and seek judicial review of his detention (section 70(3) and (4)). The application had to be examined immediately (section 70(3) in fine). Police detention under section 70 could not exceed twenty-four hours (section 71 in fine). 37. Arrest orders under section 70 were administrative decisions and any subsequent judicial review of them was carried out in accordance with the standard rules of administrative procedure, meaning that such an order could be appealed against within fourteen days of the arrestee’s being apprised of the order. According to the case-law of the Supreme Administrative Court (опр. № 1793 от 17 февруари 2006 г. по адм. д. № 1390/2006, ВАС, V отд.; реш. № 894 от 31 януари 2005 г. по адм. д. № 5783/2004 г., ВАС, V отд.), persons affected by police arrests could challenge their lawfulness before a court and, if the orders were set aside, the individuals concerned could seek damages under section 1 of the SMRDA.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

At the time of the expropriation of the applicants’ land, the cadastral value of real estate within the perimeter of a town or city was determined in accordance with regulation no. 94 of 12 April 1994 concerning the valuation of urban land (Noteikumi “Par pilsētu zemes vērtēšanu”), which was in force until 12 June 1998. To the extent that it is pertinent in the present case, the preamble to the text contained the following definitions: “... Cadastral value of a plot of land – the urban-planning and economic value of a plot of land, formulated in pecuniary terms. ... Model value of a plot of land [zemes paraugvērtība] – maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a value zone [vērtību zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim. De facto model value of a plot of land [zemes faktiskā paraugvērtība] – maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a specific territory of a value zone [vērtību zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim. ... Value zone – a portion of urban territory corresponding to a constant set of data characterising the value of real estate. ...” 7. Article 5 stipulated that the regulation was inapplicable to the determination of the market value of urban land. For the purposes of valuation, urban territory was to be divided into value zones based on the general land-use plan. The capital, Riga, was to be divided into seven or more zones (Article 7). Under Article 8, the main zoning criteria were as follows: “... 1. position [of land] in relation to the city centre; 2. level of development of public-works infrastructure and social services; 3. attractiveness of territory; 4. ecological conditions and consequences of negative factors; 5. local geological conditions; ...” 8. Article 24 of the regulation laid down the methodology for the calculation of the model value (paraugvērtība) of a plot of land. For cities such as Riga, the model value did not have to be specially calculated because it corresponded to a scale in annex no. 2 to the regulation. In order to establish the de facto model value (faktiskā paraugvērtība), it was necessary to calculate the difference between the model value of the zone in question and the adjacent zone, multiply it by the distance from the next zone, then divide the result by the width of the zone in question, and, lastly, add the corresponding model value from the fixed scale (Article 25). The de facto model value then had to be adjusted to take account of any buildings erected on the land (Article 26). 9. The de facto model value had to be multiplied by the surface area of the plot of land for its cadastral value to be obtained. It was then subject to adjustment within a limit of 20% to take account of certain positive or negative factors (Articles 30-34). The calculation of the cadastral value of land was the responsibility of the State Land Authority (Valsts Zemes dienests). 10. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Civillikums) read as follows: “Where the contract provides for the payment of interest, its percentage shall be fixed, failing which it shall be presumed that the statutory rate (see Article 1765) has been tacitly agreed.” “The interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where the payment of statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum. Interest may be calculated only on the capital itself. However, should the interest not be paid within the allotted time in respect of one year or more, from that time onwards, at the creditor’s request, statutory interest shall be calculated on the interest then accruing”. “The interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum. The interest rate for late payment of a pecuniary debt provided for under a contract as consideration for the delivery or purchase of a good or service, shall be eight per cent [“seven per cent” before 26 June 2013] above the base rate (Article 1765, third paragraph) per annum; as to contractual relations to which a consumer is party, [the base rate shall be] six per cent per annum. The interest base rate shall be four per cent. The said rate shall be modified on 1 January and 1 July every year by the percentage corresponding to the increase or decrease in the most recent rate fixed for refinancing operations by the Bank of Latvia before the first day of the half-year in question. After 1 January and 1 July every year, the Bank of Latvia shall immediately publish in the [Official Gazette] information on the applicable interest rate for the coming half-year. Interest may be calculated only on the capital itself. However, should the interest not be paid within the allotted time in respect of one year or more, from that time onwards, at the creditor’s request, statutory interest shall be calculated on the interest then accruing.” “The interest shall cease to increase: 1. when the amount of the interest still unpaid reaches the amount of the capital; ...” 11. According to the calculator of inflation rates of the Latvian Central Bureau for Statistics (Centrālā Statistikas pārvalde), the rate of inflation between 25 November 1997 (date of the entry into force of the relevant law on expropriation; see paragraphs 23 and 54 of the principal judgment) and 25 October 2012 (date of the principal judgment) was 94.3%.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
196,001-161193,ENG,POL,ADMISSIBILITY,2016,DOBRZAŃSKA AND DOBRZAŃSKI v. POLAND,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Vincent A. De Gaetano;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"1. The applicants, Ms Danuta Dobrzańska and Mr Wiktor Dobrzański, are Polish nationals, who were born in 1928 and 1941 respectively and live in Sosnowiec. They were represented before the Court by Mr Z. Cichoń, a lawyer practising in Cracow. 2. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicants are the legal successors of former owners of land situated in Niwka, Poland. In 1951 the applicants’ legal predecessors were obliged to transfer their property to the State Treasury without compensation. The transfer was confirmed by a protocol dated 8 February 1951 issued by the Ministry of Mining. 5. On 19 September 2002, at the applicants’ request, the Minister of Economy declared the 1951 protocol null and void. This decision entitled the applicants to seek compensation on the basis of the relevant provisions of the Code of Administrative Proceedings. 6. The applicants applied to the Ministry of Economy for compensation for the loss of profit they could have made had they had the property at their disposal. Their request concerned the period between 17 October 1997 (the date of entry into force of the 1997 Constitution) and 19 September 2002 (the date on which the property in question was returned to the applicants). 7. On 9 July 2008 the Ministry of Economy refused to grant the applicants compensation for lost profit, finding that the rights to the property in question had been restored to the applicants and that they had not proved that they had sustained any further damage. It also found that according to the case-law of the Polish Supreme Court and Constitutional Court, the applicants could not seek compensation for the loss of expected profit which they had allegedly sustained before the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution. 8. The applicants then applied to the civil courts seeking compensation for the loss of expected profit. On 18 December 2008 they lodged a claim with the Warsaw Regional Court. Subsequently, they limited their claim to the period from the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution until 2008; they maintained that the conduct of the authorities had prevented them from using their property even after its return. They claimed 126,726.75 zlotys (PLN) and requested exemption from the court fees. 9. On 12 January 2009 the applicants’ request was granted and they were exempted from court fees in excess of PLN 300 (approximately 75 euros (EUR)). 10. On 9 July 2009 the applicants further limited their claim to compensation for the period between 1997 and 2002. 11. On 22 July 2010 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed the applicants’ claim. The court admitted that the Supreme Court’s case-law had gone in two opposite directions; the first line of case-law accepted that in situations similar to that of the applicants they could seek both actual loss (damnum emergens) and loss of expected profit (lucrum caessans), whereas the second line limited the compensation to actual loss only. The court decided to base its judgment on the latter case-law of the Supreme Court and held that it could not grant the applicants compensation for loss of expected profit because the right to full compensation had not been inserted in the Polish Constitution until 17 October 1997, when the Constitution entered into force, whereas the damage in question had occurred before that date. 12. Taking into consideration the incoherent case-law of the Supreme Court, the Regional Court applied Article 102 of the Code of Civil Proceedings and decided not to impose the costs of the proceedings on the applicants. 13. The applicants appealed against the first-instance judgment. 14. On 20 January 2011 the applicants’ lawyer requested that the court stay the proceedings pending a decision by the Supreme Court on the legal issue in question. 15. On 21 January 2011 the Warsaw Court of Appeal granted the request and stayed the proceedings. 16. On 31 March 2011 the Supreme Court, sitting as a full bench, adopted a resolution (III CZP 112/10) in which it acknowledged that the respective provisions of civil and administrative law had given rise to serious difficulties and to divergent interpretation in judicial practice. It held that in situations similar to that of the applicants, if a final decision had been given in breach of the law before the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution, compensation on the basis of Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings would not include lucrum caessans even if the loss of expected profit had happened after the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution. 17. On 31 January 2012 the proceedings before the Warsaw Court of Appeal were resumed. 18. On 15 March 2012 the Court of Appeal referred to the abovementioned Supreme Court resolution of 31 March 2011 and held that compensation for loss of expected profit could be granted only if the wrongful decision had been issued after the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution. Finding that the loss in the applicants’ case had occurred before that date, it dismissed the applicants’ appeal. 19. The court did not impose the costs of the proceedings on the applicants. 20. The applicants did not lodge a cassation appeal, since it would not have had any prospects of success; the Supreme Court would have had to follow the resolution adopted in 2011 by the Supreme Court plenary. 21. Article 77 of the Polish Constitution, which entered into force on 17 October 1997, provides: “1. Everyone is entitled to compensation for damage caused by the unlawful acts of a public authority. 2. A statute shall not bar access to court to persons seeking redress for any breach of their freedoms or rights.” 22. Article 155 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings permits the amendment or revocation of any final administrative decision whenever necessary in the general or individual interest, if this is not prohibited by specific legal provisions. In particular, pursuant to Article 156, a final administrative decision is subject to revocation if it has been issued by an authority which had no jurisdiction to do so, or if it has no legal basis or is contrary to the applicable laws. 23. The relevant part of Article 156 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure reads as follows: “A decision shall not be revoked ... if more than ten years has passed since the date on which it was delivered or if the decision had irreversible legal consequences.” 24. Article 158 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings reads as follows: “If it is impossible to set aside a decision for reasons referred to in Article 156 § 2, the administrative authority shall only declare that the challenged decision has been issued in flagrant breach of the law and shall give reasons for refusing to set it aside.” 25. The relevant part of Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings, as applicable to the applicants’ case, reads: “Anyone who has suffered loss on account of the issuing of a decision in a manner contrary to Article 156 § 1 or on account of the revocation of such a decision may claim compensation for actual damage, unless he has been responsible for the circumstances mentioned in this provision.” 26. By a judgment of 23 September 2003 (K 20/02) the Constitutional Court declared Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings unconstitutional in so far as it limited the scope of compensation to actual damage only. The Constitutional Court held that its judgment applied only to losses which had occurred after the entry into force of the 1997 Constitution, that is, after 17 October 1997. 27. On 1 September 2004 the Law of 17 June 2004 on amendments to the Civil Code and other statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy – Kodeks cywilny oraz niektórych innych ustaw) (“the 2004 Amendment”) entered into force. The relevant amendments were in essence aimed at enlarging the scope of the State Treasury’s liability in tort under Article 417 of the Civil Code, including the addition of a new Article 4171. New Article 417 1 § 2 of the Civil Code provides that compensation can be claimed for damage caused by way of an unlawful and final decision, after the unlawfulness of such a decision has been declared in separate administrative proceedings. The 2004 Amendment abrogated Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure. However, under the transitional provisions of section 5 of the 2004 Amendment, Article 417 of the Civil Code as applicable before 1 September 2004 and Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure apply to all events and legal situations that subsisted before that date. 28. An administrative decision in respect of a compensation claim was amenable to appeal before a civil court. Article 417 § 1 of the Civil Code, as applicable after 1 September 2004, provides: “The State Treasury, or [as the case may be] a self-government entity or other legal person responsible for exercising public authority, shall be liable for any damage (szkoda) caused by an unlawful act or omission [committed] in connection with the exercise of public authority.” 29. Following the judgment of the Constitutional Court, the domestic courts, including the Supreme Court, took two different approaches in interpreting the term “time in which loss occurred”. 30. According to the first approach, which could be observed from 2006 onwards, the decisive date was that on which the original decision had been issued. This, in turn, meant that if the decision in question had been issued before the entry into force of the Constitution, only actual damage could be compensated for. The first approach was adopted by the Supreme Court in its judgments of 25 January 2006 (I CK 273/05), 26 April 2006 (III CZP 125/05), 12 September 2007 (I CSK 220/07), 5 December 2007 (I CSK 301/07), 16 April 2009 (CSK 524/08), 18 June 2009 (II CSK 26/09) and 15 October 2009 (I CSK 66/09). 31. According to the second approach adopted for the first time in 2008, loss could occur after the entry into force of the Constitution even if the decision constituting the source of the loss had been issued long before that date. In such circumstances, a claimant could effectively seek full compensation for both: actual loss and expected profit. This approach was adopted by the Supreme Court in the judgments of 22 January 2008 (case no. 376/07), 8 February 2008 (I CSK 477/07), 12 March 2008 (I CSK 435/07), 9 January 2009 (I CSK 272/08), 14 May 2009 (I CSK 306/08) and 14 May 2009 (I CSK 485/08). 32. On 8 January 2010 the President of the Supreme Court requested that a bench of the Civil Chamber composed of seven judges convene to clarify a legal question and adopt a resolution. The issue concerned the substantive law governing compensation claims in respect of damage caused by administrative decisions issued before 1 September 2004 where the unlawfulness of the decisions had been declared by way of an administrative decision given after that date. The President noted, inter alia, that two strands had developed in the case-law of the Supreme Court and other courts, against a background of serious difficulties concerning the temporal scope and consequences of the Law of 17 June 2004 as to the applicable substantive law (see paragraphs 11 and 16 above). These divergences decisively affected the compensation rights of individuals in respect of whom unlawful administrative decisions had been made prior to 1 September 2004. 33. On 24 August 2010 the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, sitting as a bench of seven judges, requested the full composition of that Chamber to adopt a resolution clarifying the issues raised by the President (III CZP 4/10). The Chamber noted that the issue had given rise to serious discrepancies in judicial practice, including that of the Supreme Court itself. Considering the importance of the issues involved and the fact that previous decisions and resolutions of the Supreme Court had failed to bring uniformity to judicial practice, a resolution by the Civil Chamber of the Court sitting as a full bench was called for. 34. On 31 March 2011 the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court, sitting as a full bench, adopted a resolution (III CZP 112/10). It acknowledged that the applicable provisions had given rise to serious difficulties and to divergent interpretations in judicial practice. The Supreme Court held that former Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure was applicable. It further held that: “If a final administrative decision which was deficient (wadliwa) was issued before the date of entry into force of the Constitution, compensation due on the basis of Article 160 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings shall not encompass lost profits, even if the damage occurred after the entry into force of the Constitution.” 35. On 24 April 2014 the Constitutional Court gave judgment (SK 56/12) holding as follows: “Article160 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Proceedings in conjunction with Article 5 of the Act of 17 June 2004 amending the Civil Code, as far as it limits compensation for damaged caused by an unlawful act of a public authority to actual loss in cases where the deficient final decision was issued before 17 October 1997: a. is consistent with Article 2 [rule of law in a democratic state] and with Article 32 § 1 [equality before the law] of the Constitution; b. is not inconsistent with Article 77 § 1 of the Constitution.”",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
197,001-142434,ENG,BGR,ADMISSIBILITY,2014,ATEV v. BULGARIA,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"1. The applicant, Mr Krasimir Milchev Atev, is a Bulgarian national, who was born in 1962 and lives in Troyan. 2. The Bulgarian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs N. Nikolova, of the Ministry of Justice. 3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows. 4. The applicant was born in 1962 and lives in Troyan. He is a sole trader, registered on an unspecified date under the name ET Atev – Krasimir Atev, with an office in Letnitsa. He is engaged in various commercial activities. Under Bulgarian law his business does not have a distinct legal personality. 5. In 1994 the applicant registered his business for value-added tax (“VAT”). 6. In December 1998 and December 1999 the applicant purchased electrical devices from another sole trader (“the supplier”). The supplier issued the relevant invoices and, as it appears, indicated on them the VAT charged. In 2000 the tax authorities conducted a VAT audit of the supplier. On 15 May 2000 he was issued with a tax assessment which made no mention of the goods supplied in December 1998 and December 1999. 7. In June 2003 the Lovech Territorial Tax Directorate conducted a VAT audit of the applicant for the periods, in particular, from 1 to 31 December 1998 and from 1 to 31 December 1999. On 18 July 2003 it issued him with a tax assessment whereby it refused him the right to deduct the VAT of 19,570.78 Bulgarian levs (BGN), (9,980 euros (EUR)), which the supplier had charged him in December 1998 and December 1999. It also ordered that interest be paid in the amount of BGN 12,312.02 (EUR 6,278). 8. The applicant appealed against the 2003 tax assessment. On 17 September 2003 the director of the Veliko Turnovo Territorial Tax Directorate upheld the 2003 tax assessment in its entirety. The authorities stated that in order to recognise the applicant’s entitlement to have the input VAT deducted, the VAT had to be entered in the accounting records of the supplier (see paragraph 13 below). Therefore, they would have to crosscheck those records and verify that the VAT had been properly reflected as an obligation to the State budget. When the cross-check was carried out, however, the supplier declared that the relevant accounting records had been lost. Since the authorities could not verify whether the VAT had been reflected accordingly, they refused to deduct it. As for the applicant’s argument that his supplier’s 2000 tax assessment did not contain any irregularities regarding the said supplies, the authorities dismissed it as being irrelevant for the proceedings at issue. 9. The applicant sought judicial review. During the proceedings and following a request on the part of the applicant, the Veliko Turnovo Regional Court ordered an expert report. The applicant put questions to the expert. In a judgment of 30 July 2004 the court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the 2003 tax assessment. The court found that the tax authorities’ refusal to recognise the applicant’s right to have the VAT he had paid deducted was correct because the supplier’s accounting records had been lost, making it objectively impossible to verify whether the VAT had been properly charged and reflected as an obligation to the State budget. The court also noted that although the applicant had had an opportunity to do so, he had not questioned the expert about those supplies and had failed to rebut the statements of the tax authorities in the tax assessment. 10. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal, and in a final judgment of 10 May 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the tax assessment. The court found that during the proceedings the applicant had submitted only documents originating from his own accounting records. Those documents, however, could not have served as evidence given the subject matter of the case. The court further noted that the applicant had failed to question the expert about the contested supplies. Having regard to the applicant’s failure to rebut the authorities’ findings and in the absence of the supplier’s accounting records, the court concluded that it had been impossible to establish whether the VAT had been entered in them, which was one of the pre-conditions sine qua non for allowing the applicant to have the input VAT deducted. 11. It is unclear whether the supplier was penalised for his failure to keep his accounting records diligently and in line with the relevant domestic provisions (see paragraph 16 below). 12. On an unspecified date the applicant paid part of the debt under the 2003 tax assessment, namely BGN 5,132.63 (EUR 2,624). In 2005 enforcement proceedings were instituted against the applicant for the collection of the remaining debt. It is unclear how the proceedings unfolded until 2010, when they were apparently resumed. The proceedings were still pending at the time of the latest information from the applicant. 13. Under the VAT Act 1993, input VAT, referred to as “tax credit” in domestic legislation, was the amount of VAT which a taxable person had been charged on goods or services received under a chargeable transaction or from the importing of goods or services (section 24(1)). The VAT was to be charged by the supplier (section 24(2)(2)). The recipient should have been in possession of a VAT invoice which met the statutory requirements (section 24(2)(6)). In order for the recipient to have the right to deduction of VAT, it was mandatory for the supplier to have reflected the VAT charged to the recipient in his accounting records as an obligation to the State budget (section 24(2)(2) with reference to paragraph 3(e) of the Additional Provisions of the VAT Act 1993). 14. The relevant provisions of the VAT Act 1999, which replaced the 1993 Act, are summarised in the case of Bulves AD v. Bulgaria (no. 3991/03, §§ 20-28, 22 January 2009). In particular, the supplier’s obligation to reflect the VAT that he has charged in his accounting records remained unchanged (section 64(1)(2) in relation to section 55(6) of the 1993 Act). 15. The VAT Act 2007 replaced the 1994 Act to include in national legislation the latest EU legislation in the sphere of VAT. The explicit requirement that, in order for the right to have input VAT deducted to arise, the supplier had to have reflected it in his accounting records, was abandoned. 16. Pursuant to the Accountancy Act 2001, accounting documents relating to tax obligations must be maintained by the trader for a period of up to five years after the expiry of the statutory time-limit for the relevant obligation (section 42(1)(3)). Failure to observe that obligation is sanctioned by an administrative penalty (section 47(4)). 17. The general rules of the law of tort are set out in sections 45 to 54 of the Obligations and Contracts Act 1951 (“the 1951 Act”). Section 45(1) provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have, through their fault, caused to another. Under section 45(2), fault is presumed until proved otherwise. 18. In that connection, a recipient may successfully seek pecuniary damages from a supplier when the latter has acted in violation of the relevant VAT provisions, resulting in the authorities’ refusal to deduct the input VAT (for example, if the supplier has failed to issue an invoice and to enter the tax in its accounting records, issued invoices but failed to enter the tax in its monthly declaration to the authorities, or failed to submit the relevant documents proving that he has discharged his VAT reporting obligations to the authorities) (реш. № 1158 от 5 ноември 2008 г. на ВКС по гр. д. № 3225/2007 г., IV г. о.; опр. № 55 от 3 февруари 2009 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 742/2008 г., II т. о.; опр. № 170 от 30 декември 2008 г. на ВКС по т. д. № 480/2008 г., II т. о.; реш. № 304 от 20 октомври 2005 г. на АС-Велико Търново по гр. д. № 151/2005 г.; реш. № 110 от 9 юли 2010 г. по в. т. д. № 41/2009 г. на АС-Варна; реш. от 10 юни 2010 г. на ОС-Стара Загора по гр. д. № 1164/2009 г.; реш. № 476 от 9 май 2011 г. на РС-Велико Търново по гр. д. № 4230/2010 г.).

Section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act 1988 (Закон за отговорността на държавата и общините за вреди – “the 1988 Act”) provides that the State and municipalities are liable for damage suffered by individuals (and since 1 January 2006 also legal persons) as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by their organs and officials committed in the course of, or in connection with, the carrying out of administrative action.",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant in the first case, Mr Markus Mintken, is a German national who was born in 1967 and lives in Mülheim/Ruhr. He was represented before the Court by Mr N. Noch, a lawyer practising in Duisburg. The applicant in the second case, Mr Oktay Aydin, is a Turkish national who was born in 1973 and lives in Bielefeld. He was represented before the Court by Mr E. Ceylan, a lawyer practising in Duisburg. 3. The applicants and another coaccused were involved in call centre businesses. They were arrested on 13 April 2010 and remained in detention until 27 October 2011 when their detention was suspended. On 6 August 2010 both applicants and the other accused were indicted on 47,713 counts of commercial fraud as members of a gang. The Essen Regional Court allowed the charges in a modified form and heard the applicants’ case over 116 days as from 4 October 2010, hearing over 40 witnesses and experts. During the trial, the first applicant filed 82 and the second applicant 24 requests concerning the taking of evidence. 4. In July 2011 the first applicant and his counsel requested the appointment of another counsel. However, the domestic courts dismissed the request and upheld the appointment of counsel for the first applicant. 5. On 18 July 2013 the applicants were convicted. The first applicant was sentenced to three years and nine months’ imprisonment; the second applicant received a five-year prison sentence. All three accused lodged an appeal on points of law. 6. The minutes of the hearing comprised over 3,521 pages. 7. On 12 February 2014 the judgment, which ran to more than 1,243 pages, including 1,019 pages specifying the details of the victims of the alleged fraud, was served on the defence. The Regional Court held that it had been impossible to speed up the proceedings as the three accused and counsel for the accused had made numerous applications, inter alia, 368 requests to hear additional evidence, including applications to call several thousand witnesses. More frequent hearings had not been possible because the court had been confronted on almost every single day of the trial by new applications from the defence requesting termination and adjournment of proceedings, rectification of the transcript, consideration of new documents or other objections to the court’s handling of the case. As a result, the Regional Court saw no unreasonable delay attributable to the court, and no reason to reduce the sentences on that ground. However, in the sentencing of the applicants it took into account, in their favour, that the proceedings had been long. 8. On 12 March 2014 counsel for the three accused submitted their joint grounds for appeal on points of law to the Federal Court of Justice, comprising 411 pages, thus observing the onemonth timelimit prescribed by Article 345 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedures (CCP) (Strafprozessordnung) (see domestic law, paragraph 12 below). Their submission included, among others, a complaint that the time to supply the reasons for their appeals on points of law was insufficient. 9. On 14 July 2014 the Federal Prosecutor General made observations on the first applicant’s appeal on points of law to which the first applicant responded on 6 August 2014. The relevant dates in the second applicant’s case were not submitted. 10. On 6 November 2014 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicants’ appeals on points of law as far as conviction and sentencing were concerned, finding them manifestly illfounded without providing further reasons. 11. On 5 February 2015 and 18 February 2015 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicants’ constitutional complaints without providing reasons (file nos. 2 BvR 3069/14 and 2 BvR 10/15). 12. The relevant provisions of the CCP concerning reinstatement of proceedings and appeals on points of law, as in force at the relevant time provided: “If a person was prevented from observing a timelimit through no fault of his own, he shall be granted a reinstatement of the proceedings upon application.” “(1) The complainant shall make a statement concerning the extent to which he contests the judgment and is applying for it to be quashed (notices of appeal on law) and shall specify the grounds. (2) The grounds must show whether the judgment is being contested because of violation of a legal norm concerning the proceedings or because of violation of another legal norm. In the former case the facts containing the defect must be indicated.” “Notices of appeal on points of law including the grounds for the appeal shall be submitted to the court whose judgment is being contested no later than one month after expiry of the timelimit for seeking the appellate remedy. If the judgment has not been served by expiry of that timelimit, the timelimit shall start to run upon service thereof.” “The notice of appeal on points of law including the grounds therefor shall be served on the complainant’s opponent if the appeal on points of law and the notices of appeal on points of law were submitted in time and in the prescribed form. The opponent may submit a written response within one week. ...” It is well-established case-law of the criminal courts that the timelimit pursuant to Article 345 § 1 CCP is nonextendable, with the exception of cases in which an admissible request to rectify the judgment is lodged before the end of the timelimit (compare judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 14 November 1990, file no. 3 StR 310/90). 13. Section 198 of the Court Organisation Act (Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz) provides a remedy for unreasonably long proceedings and reads, as far as relevant, as follows: “(1) Whoever as the result of the unreasonable length of a set of court proceedings experiences a disadvantage as a participant in those proceedings shall be given reasonable compensation. The reasonableness of the length of proceedings shall be assessed in the light of the circumstances of the particular case concerned, in particular the complexity thereof, the importance of what was at stake in the case, and the conduct of the participants and of third persons therein. ... (3) A participant in proceedings shall obtain compensation only if he has complained about the length of the proceedings to the court seized of the case (censure of delay). ... (5) A court action to enforce a claim under subsection (1) can be brought at the earliest six months after the filing of the censure of delay. The court action must be brought no later than six months following entry into final and binding force of the decision ending the proceedings, or following another manner of disposal of the proceedings. ...” Section 199 § 3, second sentence, of the Court Organisation Act, however, limits the leeway for the compensation court regarding unreasonably long criminal proceedings and reads, as far as relevant, as follows: “(3) ... Where the accused in criminal proceedings seeks compensation for excessive length of proceedings, the court of compensation shall be bound, in respect of the assessment of the reasonableness of the length of the proceedings, by a decision given by the criminal court.” 14. On 19 February 1998 the Federal Constitutional Court, in the case of an accused who had unsuccessfully requested the extension of the timelimit under Article 345 § 1 CCP, decided by a panel of three judges not to accept the constitutional complaint for adjudication (file no. 2 BvR 1888/97). It held that, in general, the statutory onemonth timelimit laid down in Article 345 § 1 of the CCP allowed ample time to supply the reasons for an appeal on points of law, even in difficult cases involving economic offences or Nazi crimes. The complainant in that case had not substantiated why, in his individual case, the time available had not been sufficient. The Federal Constitutional Court further found that the complainant had not sufficiently discussed in his complaint whether, in a case in which the reasons for the appeal cannot be drawn up within the statutory timelimit for reasons not attributable to the accused, redress might be found under the provisions governing the reinstatement of proceedings (see Article 44 CCP, paragraph 12 above).",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

MALTA,3,Preliminary objection dismissed (Article 35-3 - Ratione materiae);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence),Geoffrey Valenzia;George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Ledi Bianku;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"6. The applicant was born in 1939 and lives in Paola. 7. On an unspecified date the applicant was charged with multiple counts of theft (burglaries dating from 1976 to 1983) and/or receiving stolen goods. 8. By a judgment of 26 October 1992 the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature) found the applicant guilty of a series of offences of receiving stolen goods, but acquitted him of the theft of those goods, holding that it was clear that he had had nothing to do with the thefts. The court found it curious that the applicant had given a detailed explanation as to the origin of each item, and yet a number of the victims of the thefts had identified the objects as belonging to them. During the investigation stage the applicant had admitted to the police that because of his fascination with antiques, he would purchase items even though he would have been aware that they had been stolen. During the proceedings, other than declaring that such statements were false, the applicant did not contest the statements or explain why he had made them in such detail and precision, and why he eventually showed the police where the items were kept. The police also confirmed that such statements had been made. Moreover, the court observed that, even though the applicant was a coin collector, the fact that he had been found in possession of tools for melting down metals such as silver and of a number of pieces of silver bullion did not favour his credibility. Furthermore, although not all the items stolen had been found in the applicant’s possession, in the court’s view it was curious that all the items found had been connected with specific, well-organised thefts, where it was clear that the robbers knew what they were looking for and were well aware of where they would place the merchandise. Indeed, the court had no doubt that the applicant had been aware of the illicit origins of the items in his possession. It sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. 9. On 3 November 1992 the applicant appealed on various grounds and complained that he had not been able to prove the origins of all the items because the police had raided his house, seizing all the relevant documents and receipts, which had then gone missing in their custody. 10. By a judgment of 30 October 2001, the Criminal Court of Appeal modified the judgment in part. It affirmed the applicant’s innocence in respect of the theft charges, as there had not been a shred of evidence in that respect, and it reversed the part of the judgment concerning the majority of the remaining charges of receiving stolen goods (see below for detail). It disagreed with the first-instance court’s conclusion that the applicant could not but have been a receiver of stolen goods on the ground that since a number of people had recognised the items they could not all have been lying, and therefore it must have been the applicant who was wrong and was therefore responsible. The Criminal Court of Appeal observed that the applicant was a collector of and dealer in antiques, who appeared to purchase any item of interest without enquiring in detail into its legitimate origins. It appeared, from both the case file and the fact that certain items had been hidden, that the applicant was aware that some items had previously been stolen. However, the appeal court considered that the applicant should not suffer prejudice as a result of his inability to prove the origins of certain items, since this was a result of negligence on the part of the police, who had lost the relevant documentation (and some of the items). Moreover, no inferences could be drawn from the fact that he possessed certain tools, as it was normal for a coin collector to melt down coins which had become worthless. Examining the records of the proceedings, the court concluded that the crime of receiving stolen goods had only been proved in respect of objects of antiquarian value stolen from three specific venues, A., B., and C., (during two burglaries) and found in the applicant’s possession. His sentence was in consequence reduced to a two-year suspended sentence. 11. Pending the criminal proceedings against the applicant, a number of individuals alleging that they owned the items referred to in the list of charges against the applicant (also alleged victims of the relevant thefts) instituted civil proceedings to vindicate their ownership of the items. They requested that the items be returned to them and, where necessary, in the event that they could not be returned, that the applicant be held liable for damages. The relevant decisions on appeal were delivered subsequent to the Criminal Court of Appeal’s judgment finding the applicant innocent of the charges of receiving stolen goods in relation to a majority of the items. 12. Proceedings were instituted against the applicant on 4 May 1997 in relation to items stolen in 1983 from venue P. The items had been found in his possession and seized by the police. The claimants asked the court to find that they were the owners and to order their return. All were items in relation to which the applicant had eventually been acquitted of charges of theft and receiving stolen goods. The applicant argued that he had acquired the items in accordance with the law and in good faith. 13. By a judgment of 26 January 2001, having heard the parties’ addresses and having assessed the evidence, the Civil Court found that the claimants were the owners of the items at issue in the case (except for five items, the ownership of which had been claimed by other third parties). Costs were to be divided accordingly. The court found, however, without prejudice to any further action, that it would be premature to order the return of the said items. 14. The court observed that the applicant had declared that he did not know the claimant, but that she had recognised the applicant as a person who had gate-crashed a party she had once given at venue P. Moreover, G., a police officer, had testified that during the criminal investigations the applicant had admitted that “a number of items seized by the police had not been purchased honestly (bis-sewwa)”. Thus, contrary to the applicant’s testimony, it could be inferred that certain objects had not come into the applicant’s possession by proper means. Although the court was convinced that the applicant had been involved in the antiques trade for a number of years, he had not been able to put forward any evidence in relation to the items at issue or any detail as to his trade. By contrast, the claimants had identified as theirs the items which had previously been stolen. The court thus, having to choose between the two versions, opted for that of the claimants. The court considered that the fact that numerous people had been to the police station and identified various objects of which they claimed to be the owners and which had been seized from the applicant’s house was enough evidence to discredit the applicant’s testimony. 15. By a judgment of 16 April 2004 the Court of Appeal (civil jurisdiction) upheld the first-instance judgment. From the evidence submitted it appeared that the claimants had suffered two burglaries at venue P. and that the police had seized some of the stolen items from the applicant, amongst many other items identified by various third parties as theirs. While the applicant was able to show that he had been a collector since his youth, he had not managed to prove ownership of the relevant items. As to their origin, he vaguely mentioned names of individuals, some of whom were deceased. He referred to receipts which were currently with the police and which could not be exhibited to the court. The applicant submitted declarations by individuals with whom he had traded. As to his trading, however, it appeared that the applicant had not hesitated to purchase items with dubious or suspicious, if not illicit, origins. Indeed, the applicant had been investigated and various items found in his possession had been seized. The origins of the items gave rise to more than a simple suspicion that they had not been acquired legitimately. According to police officer G., the applicant had even admitted this. During the criminal proceedings G. had been asked whether the applicant had admitted to the theft and the police officer had replied “yes”. G. further stated that the applicant had referred to the dishonest purchase of a sofa (“Dan mhux bis-sewwa”) and had only shown receipts in respect of certain items in connection with which the applicant had been charged, but not all of them. In that light, the court was not satisfied that the applicant had submitted sufficient proof to show that he was the owner of the said items. Moreover, the fact that numerous people, apart from the applicant, had claimed to be the owners of the items did not suffice to support the view that the applicant was the owner. 16. Proceedings were instituted against the applicant on 26 May 1994 in relation to items stolen in 1983 from venue BC, which had been found in his possession and seized by the police. The claimants asked the court to find that they were the owners of the items and to order their return. All were items in relation to which the applicant had eventually been acquitted of charges of theft and receiving stolen goods. The applicant argued that he had acquired the items in accordance with the law and in good faith. 17. By a judgment of 29 January 2001 the Civil Court found in favour of the claimants. It held, however, without prejudice to any further action, that an order for the return of the said items would be premature. 18. The Civil Court noted that there was a certain disagreement in respect of the list of objects identified by the original claimant (the deceased ancestor of the current claimants), in that certain items had been added later. However, the claimant had produced a number of witnesses who had confirmed his declarations as to which items had been stolen. The applicant declared under oath that all the items referred to by the claimants, as well as all the other items seized, were owned by him, as he had bought them over the years. In his testimony he gave the names of people from whom he had purchased each item. He also submitted a receipt dated 1983, the year of the burglary, which indicated that he had bought a number of objects for the sum of 8,800 Maltese liri (MTL, approximately 20,500 euros (EUR)) from a certain S.A. Nevertheless, the court considered the claimants’ version to be more reliable, as it was corroborated by photos and other witnesses. Moreover, police officer G. had testified that the applicant had stated that various items seized from his house “had not been purchased honestly” and this could not but weaken the applicant’s testimony. Therefore the court had no other option but to find in favour of the claimants, at least in respect of those items that were not being claimed by other third persons. 19. By a judgment of 16 April 2004, the Court of Appeal (civil jurisdiction) upheld the first-instance judgment. It considered that the Civil Court had properly assessed the evidence and delivered a reasoned judgment. In any case, the Court of Appeal considered that the applicant had not provided a reliable explanation in respect of the origin and purchase of the relevant items. Indeed, during the criminal proceedings G. had testified, inter alia, that “at no time had the applicant stated that he had stolen the items from here or there, but he had mentioned that he had bought certain items from T., and that he knew about their dubious origins (kienu ġejjin bil-ħazin)”. The Court of Appeal considered that had the Civil Court based its decision solely on that testimony and stopped there, the relevant burden of proof might not have been satisfied. However, all the evidence advanced indicated the probability that the relevant items belonged to the claimant’s heirs – they had been stolen from venue BC, and had been identified by the claimants, even though third parties had also claimed ownership of some of the items. Although the applicant had testified under oath that he had purchased the items legally, his testimony had not been consistent and had lacked veracity. In particular, he had given the impression that he was a trader in antiques and that he had traded with various lawyers, but when questioned in respect of each of them, it transpired that he had not bought any of the items relevant to the case. The other people mentioned by the applicant were deceased and could not testify. Neither could the applicant submit receipts for those purchases, giving as the reason for this that they had been seized by the police and were being held as evidence in the criminal proceedings against him. Even if that were so, the applicant had not provided proof. By contrast, the claimants had submitted photographs of the relevant items taken before they had been stolen. 20. Proceedings were instituted against the applicant on 4 September 1992 in relation to items stolen from venue B. (including items allegedly transformed into silver bullion), which had been found in his possession and seized by the police. All were items in relation to which the applicant had eventually been acquitted of theft but found guilty of receiving stolen goods. The claimants requested that the applicant be found responsible for the theft or receiving of the stolen goods and therefore liable for damages. They asked the court to quantify such damages and to order the applicant to pay them. The applicant argued that he had acquired the items in accordance with the law and in good faith. 21. By a judgment of 22 June 2001 the court found that the claimants were the owners of the relevant items, ordered the applicant to return the said items, and held the applicant liable for damages for holding the relevant items in bad faith. 22. The court noted the expert evidence, which found that there was sufficient proof that the items were owned by the claimants. Indeed, the applicant had not denied that the items could have been previously owned by the claimants. During the criminal investigations the applicant had admitted that he had previously purchased stolen items. The declarations used in the criminal proceedings were exhibited before the court and the applicant only contended that police officer G. had invented certain things. Having re-read the witness statements, the experts took the view that the applicant rarely acquired items lawfully and in good faith. He actually was perfectly well aware of their dubious origins, as he was told by the sellers that the items had been stolen. This could not be ignored, especially as the applicant never stated that he had sale receipts for the relevant items. The items were found in his possession, he did not remember from whom he had bought them and he had no receipts. In consequence, it could not be said that he had purchased them in good faith. The court held that the applicant’s statements used in the criminal proceedings were admissible evidence (Article 632 (1) of the Code of Organisation and Criminal Procedure (“the COCP” – see Relevant Domestic Law below)). Officer G. presented five statements made by the applicant during the investigation, and the applicant explained which parts of those statements he agreed with and which parts he contested. The court considered that in doing so the applicant was picking and choosing, and yet there existed contradictions. For example, in one statement the applicant said that he had purchased two chalices from a taxi driver, and he subsequently confirmed that statement. In another statement he repeated this in more detail and subsequently stated that he had never made such a statement. At a later date he repeated the story, but differently, saying that he had bought more items. The court noted that the taxi driver had not been called as a witness to corroborate the applicant’s version. While the applicant stated that he had purchased the items from various persons, only one of those persons had been called as a witness and the latter only testified to the effect that the applicant had an interest in antiques. Another witness confirmed that the applicant was also a moneylender. Indeed, the applicant submitted a number of documents in evidence of this, but did not submit any evidence in relation to the origins of the items at issue. The court therefore concluded from the totality of the evidence that the claimants had been burgled, that they had identified the stolen items, and that the applicant had not proved that he had acquired the items in good faith. The court found it of particular relevance that in one of the applicant’s statements, which he did not contradict, he had said “when I see an antique, whatever it may be ... I go blind. I want it for myself in order to be able to take pleasure in looking at it”. Thus, the court considered that any other comment would be superfluous. The court found in the applicant the very image of a receiver of stolen goods (ricettatur). 23. As to the claim for damages, the court accepted and shared the expert’s conclusions: as had emerged from the evidence, not all the stolen items were found in the applicant’s possession, but a quantity of silver bullion was found which the claimants argued was the product of melted-down silver statues which had been stolen from them. Indeed, it had been shown that the bullion seized from the applicant was home-made and not pure. Thus, although there was no proof that the applicant had stolen the items, there was sufficient proof to hold that the claimants were indeed the owners of the relevant items, that those items had been in the applicant’s possession in bad faith and that the applicant had previously melted down silver. Indeed, both the bullion and the tools for making it had been found in his possession. The applicant gave an explanation about the bullion, but it was not corroborated by any witness statement. The applicant gave no credible explanation for the clearly home-made bullion. It was therefore very probable that objects stolen from the claimants and acquired in bad faith had, together with other items, been melted down to hide their identity. The court further highlighted, of its own accord, the absence of corroboration as regards the bullion, and the presence of tools used to melt down silver. Thus, the claimants’ case had been made out on the balance of probabilities. The applicant was therefore liable for damages because he had been in possession of stolen goods and because of the damage he had caused by melting down such items. The amount of damages was fixed at MTL 64,870 (approximately EUR 151,100). 24. The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the legal expert whose conclusions had been endorsed by the court had relied on evidence (the applicant’s statements during the criminal investigation) which should not be given any weight in civil proceedings, and that the first-instance court had erred in finding him guilty in respect of items which were never found by the police, referring to the items that had allegedly been melted down. 25. By a judgment of 9 November 2004 the Court of Appeal (civil jurisdiction) upheld the first-instance judgment (in so far as relevant). It held, however, that the applicant could not be ordered to return items which were no longer in his possession. It further considered that Article 632 (1) of the COCP (see Relevant Domestic Law below) applied to the statements made by the applicant during the criminal investigation, even though they had not been signed by him. It sufficed that officer G. had witnessed those statements being made by the applicant for them to be admissible in evidence. It was for the first-instance court to assess them and reach its conclusions. Moreover, Article 6 of the Criminal Code (see Relevant Domestic Law below) did not imply that evidence used in criminal proceedings could not be used in analogous civil proceedings. Furthermore, the applicant had not objected to the use of that evidence before the firstinstance court. Having examined in detail the evidence produced, the Court of Appeal further considered that the first-instance court had not made an incorrect assessment and that it would therefore not interfere with its finding. It found it pertinent to point out that the fact that only eleven silver bars had been found in the applicant’s possession, despite the fact that the items melted down should have amounted to many more bars, was not a thesis favourable to the applicant. Indeed, the applicant could easily have disposed of the other bars resulting from the melted-down items before the police found the bars. He was, thus, responsible for the damage caused by the melting down of the items, in accordance with the estimates provided by the expert. Any difficulties in evaluating the original items were of the applicant’s own making, as it had been his choice to melt them down. 26. On 22 January 2008 the applicant instituted constitutional redress proceedings, complaining that the three judgments of the Court of Appeal (civil jurisdiction) referred to above and another still pending set of proceedings had violated, inter alia, his right to be presumed innocent. 27. By a judgment of 29 September 2009, the Civil Court (First Hall), in its constitutional jurisdiction, rejected claims lodged by the applicant. In the context of the applicant’s various complaints, it held that the civil proceedings against the applicant had not amounted to a repetition of the criminal proceedings, as the intention of the civil proceedings had not been to find whether the applicant was guilty of any charge, but solely to secure the return of the property to its owners and, where that was not possible, to determine the level of compensation due. Moreover, the different proceedings were not comparable in relation to the burden of proof required. Indeed, each of the proceedings was capable of resulting in different findings of responsibility, including findings which conflicted with each other. The court noted that in the civil proceedings the applicant had not been found guilty of any crime. The civil courts had assessed the evidence in relation to the complainants’ ownership rights to the property against the applicant’s explanation as to how the items had been found in his possession, within the relevant parameters of civil proceedings of that nature. Considering the applicant’s complaint under Article 6 § 2 of the Convention, it held that the provision could not be applicable, since the applicant was no longer accused of a criminal offence, and his complaints were directed against civil proceedings which, save for one, had also been concluded. At a later stage, in relation to Article 6 § 2, the court also considered that the conclusions reached by the civil courts were based on a proper assessment of evidence which did not violate the applicant’s presumption of innocence. Those conclusions were based on the principle of juxta allegata et probata (delivering a judgment on the basis of what has been alleged and proved), as expected in this type of proceedings. The court considered that the applicant’s case could not be compared to any of the cases cited by him under Article 6 § 2 concerning the request of acquitted applicants for compensation for detention, and therefore the principles enunciated therein did not apply. 28. By a judgment of 25 May 2010, the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicant and upheld the first-instance judgment. It considered that there had been no breach of the applicant’s rights since criminal and civil proceedings were separate and distinct: one was brought by the State, had a specific set of rules and aimed at the imposition of a punishment, whereas the other was brought by an interested individual for the restitution of his or her property rights. During criminal proceedings various rules played in favour of the accused, who might be found innocent simply because there was not sufficient evidence. This should not deny any third party the possibility of access to court to obtain relevant redress on the basis of a different burden of proof. The applicant had been cleared of all charges except those of receiving certain goods stolen from certain properties. However, that did not mean that the items in question, found in the applicant’s possession, were his own. The civil proceedings instituted by individuals claiming certain items against the possessor were independent of the defendant’s good or bad faith. The Court of Appeal had in each case found for the claimants, after considering that the latter had proved that they were the owners of the stolen items and that the applicant had not proved his ownership. The cases had dealt solely with the establishment of the ownership of the items, and nothing more, and if the outcome was that the items were not his own, then he was bound to give them back to their rightful owners, regardless of how they came to be in his possession.",[],[],[],['6'],['6-2'],[],0
