001-109191,ENG,ROU,CHAMBER,2012,CASE OF KARRER v. ROMANIA,3,Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life);Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Non-pecuniary damage - award,Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Ján Šikuta;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Mihai Poalelungi;Nona Tsotsoria,"['6. The first applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Furstenfeld, Austria. He is the father of the second applicant, who was born in 2006 and lives at an unspecified address in Romania.', '7. On 13 April 2004 the first applicant married a Romanian citizen, K.T. The marriage was concluded in Salzburg, Austria. On 15 February 2006 their daughter, the second applicant, was born. The parents had joint custody of the child under Austrian law. They lived in Salzburg.', '8. On 1 February 2008 K.T. and the first applicant separated. On 25 February 2008 K.T. filed a divorce petition with the Salzburg authorities. The first applicant lodged a counter petition on 25 March 2008.', '9. On 29 January 2008 K.T. filed for an interim injunction against the first applicant, seeking his removal from the family home on the ground of his violent behaviour. On 8 February 2008, the Salzburg District Civil Court granted the interim injunction for a period of three months. Criminal proceedings were also initiated against the first applicant for infliction of bodily harm.', '10. On 1 February 2008 K.T. lodged an action for temporary sole custody of the second applicant throughout the divorce proceedings. At the end of September 2008, while the proceedings for the award of custody were pending before the Austrian courts, K.T. left for Romania together with the second applicant. The first applicant was not informed of the departure, even though at the time the spouses had joint custody of the second applicant.', '11. In the meantime, on 25 July 2008 the Salzburg District Criminal Court acquitted the first applicant of inflicting bodily harm. The Salzburg Public Prosecutor reserved the right to initiate criminal proceedings against K.T. for perjury.', '12. On 25 November 2008, the Salzburg District Civil Court granted the first applicant temporary sole custody of the second applicant until the finalisation of the divorce proceedings. The court relied, inter alia, on expert opinion which concluded that the first applicant was better suited to have custody. K.T. does not appear to have appealed against the judgment.', '13. Currently, the divorce proceedings between the first applicant and K.T. are pending before the Romanian courts.', '14. On 30 September 2008 the first applicant submitted a request for the return of the second applicant to Austria under Article 3 of the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (“the Hague Convention”). He argued that the second applicant had been removed from Austrian territory in breach of the joint custody held by the spouses at the time of the removal. On 7 October 2008 the Austrian authorities submitted the request to the Romanian Ministry of Justice (“the Romanian Ministry”), the Central Authority responsible for the obligations established under the Hague Convention.', '15. On 28 October 2008, at the request of the Romanian Ministry, the General Police Department (Inspectoratul General al Poliţiei) confirmed that the second applicant was living with her mother, in Romania, at her grandparents’ home. Furthermore, on 3 November 2008 the Department for Social Services and Child Protection (Departamentul General de Asistenţă Socială şi Protecţia Copilului) drafted a report in relation to the second applicant. The report mainly mentioned K.T.’s statements concerning her situation in Austria, her reasons for departure as well as the maternal grandparents’ declarations concerning their commitment to provide housing and financial support to the second applicant indefinitely. It was also mentioned that the second applicant did not appear to be an abused or neglected child and that she was very attached to her mother and her maternal grandparents. The report concluded that the second applicant had appropriate living conditions, both from a material and emotional point of view.', '16. On 5 December 2008 the Romanian Ministry instituted proceedings on behalf of the first applicant before the Bucharest County Court. By a judgment of 28 January 2009, communicated on 28 May 2009, the Bucharest County Court found in favour of the first applicant, ordering the return of the second applicant to Austria. The Bucharest County Court held that the request fell under Article 3 of the Hague Convention and that none of the exceptions provided for under Article 13 applied.', '17. K.T. appealed. She submitted several pieces of evidence, including declarations of her parents as witnesses given before a Romanian Court in the context of the divorce and custody proceedings. She further submitted a welfare report drafted by the Custody Service within the Timişoara City Hall (Serviciul de Autoritate Tutelară din cadrul Primariei Municipiului Timişoara). The report included information on K.T.’s family situation, living conditions, and K.T.’s declarations in relation to the circumstances of her living and departing from Austria. Finally, the report recommended that K.T. were awarded the custody over the second applicant.', '18. By a final judgment delivered on 8 July 2009, and rendered in written form on 17 September 2009, the Bucharest Court of Appeal allowed the appeal on points of law, holding that the return of the second applicant to Austria would expose her to physical and psychological harm, within the meaning of Article 13 § 1 (b) of the Hague Convention. On the merits, the Bucharest Court of Appeal held that the first applicant had shown violent behaviour towards K.T., as the Salzburg District Civil Court had maintained when granting K.T. the interim injunction of 8 February 2008. The Bucharest Court of Appeal further held that the first applicant had breached the restraining order in September 2008, which determined K.T. to come to Romania. Finally, the domestic court reasoned that even if there was no evidence of a violent behaviour of the first applicant towards the child, this could be inferred from his behaviour towards K.T. and from K.T.’s departure to Romania. The Salzburg District Civil Court’s judgment of 25 November 2008 was set aside on the ground that by that time K.T. and the second applicant had already left Austria.', '19. Throughout the domestic proceedings, the Romanian Ministry informed the Austrian authorities of the progress of the Hague Convention proceedings. The information included the date of the hearings and whether or not an appeal had been lodged. From the evidence adduced to the case file, it appears that the Romanian Ministry did not have any direct contact with the first applicant in connection with the Hague Convention proceedings.', '20. The relevant provisions of the Hague Convention, which entered into force in respect of Romania on 30 September 1992, read, in so far as relevant, as follows.', '“The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where –', 'a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and', 'b) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention.', 'The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph a) above, may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State.”', '“The Convention shall apply to any child who was habitually resident in a Contracting State immediately before any breach of custody or access rights. The Convention shall cease to apply when the child attains the age of 16 years.”', '“A Contracting State shall designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Convention upon such authorities. [..]”', '“Central Authorities shall co-operate with each other and promote cooperation amongst the competent authorities in their respective State to secure the prompt return of children and to achieve the other objects of this Convention.', 'In particular, either directly or through any intermediary, they shall take all appropriate measures –', '[..]', 'f) to initiate or facilitate the institution of judicial or administrative proceedings with a view to obtaining the return of the child and, in a proper case, to make arrangements for organizing or securing the effective exercise of rights of access; [..]”', '“The judicial or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously in proceedings for the return of children.', 'If the judicial or administrative authority concerned has not reached a decision within six weeks from the date of commencement of the proceedings, the applicant or the Central Authority of the requested State, on its own initiative or if asked by the Central Authority of the requesting State, shall have the right to request a statement of the reasons for the delay. If a reply is received by the Central Authority of the requested State, that Authority shall transmit the reply to the Central Authority of the requesting State, or to the applicant, as the case may be.”', '“Where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained in terms of Article 3 and, at the date of the commencement of the proceedings before the judicial or administrative authority of the Contracting State where the child is, a period of less than one year has elapsed from the date of the wrongful removal or retention, the authority concerned shall order the return of the child forthwith.', 'The judicial or administrative authority, even where the proceedings have been commenced after the expiration of the period of one year referred to in the preceding paragraph, shall also order the return of the child, unless it is demonstrated that the child is now settled in its new environment.', 'Where the judicial or administrative authority in the requested State has reason to believe that the child has been taken to another State, it may stay the proceedings or dismiss the application for the return of the child.”', '“Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that –', 'a) the person, institution or other body having the care of the person of the child was not actually exercising the custody rights at the time of removal or retention, or had consented to or subsequently acquiesced in the removal or retention; or', 'b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.', 'The judicial or administrative authority may also refuse to order the return of the child if it finds that the child objects to being returned and has attained an age and degree of maturity at which it is appropriate to take account of its views.', 'In considering the circumstances referred to in this Article, the judicial and administrative authorities shall take into account the information relating to the social background of the child provided by the Central Authority or other competent authority of the child’s habitual residence.”', '“The return of the child under the provisions of Article 12 may be refused if this would not be permitted by the fundamental principles of the requested State relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms.”', '21. Council Regulation (EC) No. 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and matters of parental responsibility (“the Regulation”), in so far as relevant reads as follows:', '(17)“In cases of wrongful removal or retention of a child, the return of the child should be obtained without delay, and to this end the Hague Convention of 25 October 1980 would continue to apply as complemented by the provisions of this Regulation, in particular Article 11. [...]”', '“1. Where a person, institution or other body having rights of custody applies to the competent authorities in a Member State to deliver a judgment on the basis of the Hague Convention [..], in order to obtain the return of a child that has been wrongfully removed or retained in a Member State other than the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, paragraphs 2 to 8 shall apply.', '[...]', '3. A court to which an application for return of a child is made as mentioned in paragraph 1 shall act expeditiously in proceedings on the application, using the most expeditious procedures available in national law.', 'Without prejudice to the first subparagraph, the court shall, except where exceptional circumstances make this impossible, issue its judgment no later than six weeks after the application is lodged.', '4. A court cannot refuse to return a child on the basis of Article 13 (b) of the [...] Hague Convention if it is established that adequate arrangements have been made to secure the protection of the child after his or her return.', '5. A court cannot refuse to return a child unless the person who requested the return of the child has been given an opportunity to be heard.', '6. If a court has issued an order on non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the 1980 Hague Convention, the court must immediately either directly or through its central authority, transmit a copy of the court order on non-return and of the relevant documents, in particular a transcript of the hearings before the court, to the court with jurisdiction or central authority in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention, as determined by national law. The court shall receive all the mentioned documents within one month of the date of the non-return order.', '7. Unless the courts in the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention have already been seized by one of the parties, the court or central authority that receives [a copy of an order on non-return pursuant to Article 13 of the Hague Convention and of the documents relevant to that order] must notify it to the parties and invite them to make submissions to the court, in accordance with national law, within three months of the date of notification so that the court can examine the question of custody of the child.

The applicant is a paediatrician, born in 1943, who continued in private practice after her retirement.', '7. On 30 November 1995 a mother brought her daughter, V., born in 1993, to the applicant’s practice to be examined, suspecting that the girl had been sexually abused by her father. The applicant examined her and took photographs.', '8. On 13 June 2000 the girl was taken into public care because of her mother’s mental health problems and was placed in a family support centre.', '9. The events now in issue began on 16 December 2000, when the mother failed to return V. to the family support centre after spending time with her. It appears that the centre was going to close during the Christmas holidays and it was alleged during the domestic proceedings that the girl had indicated to her mother that she was unwilling to go to her father’s home for the holidays.', '10. V. fell ill and was taken to the applicant’s practice by her mother on 26 December 2000. When she left the practice V. remained with her mother until she was found by the authorities on 22 April 2001.', '11. On 18 April 2001 the applicant was arrested as a suspect in the deprivation of V.’s liberty, which had allegedly begun on 16 December 2000 in [town A]. The applicant’s home and practice were searched the same day. On 20 April 2001 the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten), having heard the applicant in person, remanded her in custody, considering it likely that she would otherwise complicate the resolution of the case and continue to engage in criminal activity.', '12. By five separate decisions between May and September 2001, given at the request of the police, the District Court granted permission to obtain information about calls to and from telephones used by V.’s mother and a third suspect during different periods between 15 December 2000 and 22 April 2001. The information gathered showed that calls had also been made from and to a telephone in the applicant’s possession.', '13. V. was found on 22 April 2001. On 25 April 2001 the applicant was released. Following her release, the applicant complained on several occasions, inter alia, about the District Court’s decision of 20 April 2001 remanding her in custody, and requested an investigation of, inter alia, the actions of a number of police officers during her arrest and related events.', '14. On 11 May 2001 the police issued an interim restraining order in respect of the applicant, the terms of which were that she was not allowed to visit certain places frequented by V. Those places were specified in the decision.', '15. On 1 June 2001 the District Court found that it was unlikely that the applicant would or could continue to harass the girl or commit an offence against her. It therefore quashed the restraining order.', '16. On 18 April 2002 the public prosecutor preferred charges against V.’s mother, the applicant and a third person. The applicant was charged with seriously depriving V. of her liberty during the period from 16 December 2000 to 22 April 2001 or, in the alternative, aiding and abetting the commission of that offence. The applicant had allegedly, through her opinions, advice and actions, contributed to the mother’s decision to abduct her child on 16 December 2000 in [town A] and, after the mother had abducted her child and taken her at Christmas 2000 at the latest to [town B], the applicant had, with the mother’s consent, unlawfully isolated V. As the deprivation of liberty had lasted a long time, had been planned and premeditated and had endangered the girl’s emotional development, the offence was considered aggravated.', '17. In her written reply to the charge the applicant denied that she had in any way had an impact on the mother’s actions. She had only provided medical treatment for V. It had not been shown that the suspicions of sexual abuse were unfounded.', '18. On 17 July 2002 and 22 January 2003 the applicant unsuccessfully made an application to the Office of the Prosecutor General (valtakunnansyyttäjä, högsta åklagaren), requesting that the public prosecutor be replaced by an impartial one and alleging a number of irregularities in the performance of his duties.', '19. On 21 August 2002 the District Court appointed a public defender to represent the applicant – Ms M.K., a member of the Bar – as the representative chosen by the applicant – Mr J.R., a civil engineer – was not considered capable of representing her, given the gravity of the alleged offence. The applicant contested the appointment of Ms M.K. in a written representation, without however naming a lawyer of her choosing, although invited to do so. On 21 October 2002 the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) rejected the applicant’s representation.', '20. At a preliminary hearing on 19 September 2002 the District Court ordered, against the applicant’s wishes, that the case be examined in camera as it concerned sensitive issues relating to a child’s life. It also held that the applicant was unable to defend herself, given the nature of the case. The applicant unsuccessfully complained to the higher courts about this decision.', '21. The case was heard over four days, beginning on 22 October 2002. The applicant informed the court that she considered that her public defender, Ms M.K., who was present at the hearing, was not entitled to plead on her behalf. The applicant declared that she would defend herself.', '22. The District Court heard statements from the applicant and the two other defendants. It also heard V.’s father, representing V., and ten witnesses. On 24 October 2002 the court rejected as irrelevant a request by the applicant that V., Mr J.R., a police inspector and two lawyers be heard as witnesses regarding the applicant’s deprivation of liberty and the alleged misinterpretation of the facts by the public prosecutor, which the applicant described as criminal. The applicant then reiterated her request, stating that the witnesses should testify about the background to the offence with which she was charged. The District Court also rejected that request, noting that she had not given any reasons which would have justified hearing the witnesses she proposed.', '23. On 25 October 2002 the District Court ordered the applicant and V.’s mother to undergo a psychiatric assessment under Chapter 17, Article 45, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, Rättegångs Balk) and section 16(1) of the Mental Health Act (mielenterveyslaki, mentalvårdslagen), and adjourned the proceedings for the assessment to take place. The applicant then went into hiding.', '24. Dr K.A., a psychiatrist, noted in a written medical opinion of 30 December 2002 that he had met the applicant twice, on 14 November and 30 December 2002, and that in the two conversations he had had with her he had not observed any signs of mental disorder and that, in his opinion, she was not in need of involuntary care. He emphasised, however, that he had not carried out a psychiatric assessment, as such an assessment could only take place in a hospital and not in a private consulting room.', '25. Niuvanniemi Hospital, one of the two State mental hospitals, informed the applicant that it was ready to receive her from 2 January 2003. At the applicant’s request, the assessment was postponed first to 20 January 2003 and then to 12 March 2003. The applicant failed, however, to appear at the hospital.', '26. By a letter dated 8 January 2003 the applicant proposed Mr P.S. as her new representative. On 13 January 2003 the District Court appointed Mr P.S., a member of the Bar, as the applicant’s new public defender.', '27. On 25 March 2003 the District Court ordered the applicant’s arrest and detention in absentia on the ground that she was seeking to evade trial, as she had not appeared at Niuvanniemi Hospital. The applicant was represented at the hearing by Mr P.S. The applicant lodged a complaint, alleging insufficient grounds for detention and procedural errors. On 28 April 2003 the Court of Appeal dismissed the complaint as unfounded. On 16 June 2003 the Court of Appeal dismissed a further complaint by the applicant without considering its merits. The applicant later lodged a third complaint, which was dismissed as unfounded by the Court of Appeal on 18 March 2004. The Supreme Court refused requests by the applicant for leave to appeal.', '28. On 9 October 2003 the Court of Appeal rejected a complaint by the applicant in connection with the order that she undergo a psychiatric assessment, finding the applicant’s allegations of procedural errors in the District Court proceedings unsubstantiated. On 30 March 2004 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '29. After receiving a request from Mr P.S. to withdraw, on 5 May 2004 the District Court, having given the applicant an opportunity to be heard in writing, appointed Mr M.S., a member of the Bar, as her new public defender. On 23 June 2004 the Court of Appeal rejected a complaint by the applicant against this decision, finding that she was unable to defend herself and that Mr M.S. was not biased as she had alleged. It also rejected a request by the applicant for an oral hearing as manifestly unnecessary. On 27 June 2005 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '30. On 15 June 2004 the Court of Appeal rejected a complaint by the applicant that, inter alia, the District Court Judge who had ordered her psychiatric assessment was biased. A request by the applicant that its decision be supplemented was rejected by the Court of Appeal on 12 July 2004. On 27 June 2005 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '31. By a letter dated 2 September 2004 the District Court informed the applicant that it would hold an oral hearing on 20 September 2004 concerning her detention. The applicant was informed that other aspects of the criminal charges against her would not be dealt with at that hearing and no evidence would be taken other than on her detention.', '32. On 20 September 2004 the District Court issued a further order for the applicant’s arrest and detention, finding that she was still seeking to evade trial. She was represented at the hearing by her public defender Mr M.S. On 9 November 2004 the Court of Appeal dismissed a complaint by the applicant concerning the decision of 20 September 2004 without considering its merits, as it had been drawn up by Mr J.R., who did not fulfil the requirements set out in Chapter 15, Article 2, of the Code of Judicial Procedure. It was noted that a public defender had been appointed to represent the applicant. A further complaint by the applicant was dismissed by the Supreme Court on 29 September 2005 without consideration on the merits.', '33. On 12 October 2004 the applicant was arrested.', '34. On 15 October 2004, having heard the applicant in person, the District Court remanded her in custody, finding that she was aware of the psychiatric assessment to be conducted and the subsequent arrest warrants. The court stated that the applicant had been evading trial, of which the assessment formed a part. The applicant was ordered into police custody and from there to a mental institution to be designated by the National Forensic Medical Authority (terveydenhuollon oikeusturvakeskus, rättsskyddscentralen för hälsovården).', '35. On 11 November 2004 the applicant was taken to Vanha Vaasa Hospital, the other State mental hospital, for a psychiatric assessment, the duration of which was initially to be two months. The assessment was carried out by Dr A.K. a specialist in psychiatry, adolescent psychiatry and forensic psychiatry. During the assessment the applicant was interviewed by Dr A.K. on ten occasions. She also saw two psychologists, G.W-H. and A.K-V. She refused to undergo somatic and neurological examinations and special examinations, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. She also refused laboratory tests and psychological tests.', '36. On 3 January 2005 Dr A.K. gave his written opinion to the National Forensic Medical Authority on the basis of the assessment conducted between 11 November 2004 and 3 January 2005. His conclusions were that the applicant was suffering from a delusional disorder and had not been criminally responsible at the time of the alleged offence. Dr A.K. also found that the criteria for involuntary confinement, set out in section 8 of the Mental Health Act, were met and that the applicant could not be heard at the trial. Her capacity to look after her own interests was diminished by her mental illness, and she was thus in need of a guardian for the criminal proceedings.', '37. On the same date the applicant asked the National Forensic Medical Authority for a second opinion. On 5 January 2005 that authority informed the applicant that ordering a psychiatric assessment of a defendant in a criminal case was outside its authority, and she should therefore direct her request to the court.', '38. By an interlocutory decision of 20 January 2005 the Forensic Psychiatry Board of the National Forensic Medical Authority (terveydenhuollon oikeusturvakeskuksen oikeuspsykiatristen asioiden lautakunta, nämnden för rättspsykiatriska ärenden vid rättsskyddscentralen för hälsovården – hereafter “the Forensic Psychiatry Board”) requested Dr A.K. to supplement his opinion, as far as possible, by giving the applicant psychological tests and by submitting such background information as would enable a comparison to be made between the applicant’s ability to manage in her earlier life and her ability to manage at the time of the alleged criminal events. Dr A.K. was also invited to provide detailed reasons why he considered that the criteria for involuntary care were met and why outpatient treatment was not considered sufficient. The results of the supplementary examination were to be submitted to the National Forensic Medical Authority as soon as possible.', '39. The supplementary examination was completed on 4 February 2005. The applicant again refused psychological tests by the hospital staff, doubting their impartiality. In his report, dated the same day, Dr A.K. found that the applicant was suffering from a psychotic delusional disorder and that her condition had already been present prior to the events leading to the criminal charges. The applicant had observed indications of sexual abuse which other experts had not been able to detect. In Dr A.K.’s opinion, the applicant was in need of involuntary psychiatric treatment in order to recover from her disorder, which mainly related to judicial matters, but also to a delusion of grandeur as to the correctness of her own actions. Further, as a doctor she was endangering other people’s well-being by prescribing them treatment which put their health at risk. Because the applicant had for a long time evaded psychiatric assessment, and as she opposed treatment, outpatient treatment would not be sufficient. In conclusion, Dr A.K. considered that the applicant was paranoid and that she had made accusations against various authorities about continued abuse of office. She had become entangled in the tiny details of her own case without being able to perceive the wider picture. He considered that her delusional disorder had reached the level of psychosis, which distorted her conception of reality. Owing to her illness, she did not understand the unlawfulness and repercussions of her actions and she had been psychotically deluded when she had taken part in the deprivation of a child’s liberty. Moreover, she was in denial of her illness.', '40. The applicant sent a number of letters to the Forensic Psychiatry Board, in which she criticised the psychiatric assessment conducted by Dr A.K., among other things. She also submitted to the Board Dr K.A.’s divergent medical opinion of 30 December 2002 (see paragraph 24 above).', '41. On 17 February 2005 the National Forensic Medical Authority submitted its opinion on the psychiatric assessment to the District Court under section 16(3) of the Mental Health Act, finding that the applicant had not been responsible for her actions at the time of the offence.', '42. On 23 February 2005, the psychiatric assessment being complete, the District Court ordered the applicant’s release from detention. She was, however, to remain in hospital for treatment, as ordered on 17 February 2005 by the Forensic Psychiatry Board.', '43. On 17 February 2005 the Forensic Psychiatry Board ordered, on the basis of Dr A.K.’s proposal, that the applicant receive involuntary treatment in Vanha Vaasa Hospital. It considered that she was suffering from a delusional disorder, which had affected her for years and which made her incapable either of seeing a matter from a viewpoint other than her own or of questioning the correctness of her own conclusions. She suspected that the authorities had “ganged up” on her. During the psychiatric assessment she had tried, as a medical doctor, to take a stand regarding the treatment of other patients on the ward. The delusional disorder, if not treated, would considerably worsen her mental illness or seriously endanger her health and the health of others. No other mental health services were considered adequate, having regard to the fact that the applicant did not consider herself to be mentally ill. The decision referred to sections 8, 17(1) and 17a of the Mental Health Act.', '44. The applicant considered that she was not in need of mental health treatment, and wished to obtain a second opinion on her need for treatment. However, at the beginning of February 2005 the hospital refused to allow a Dr M-P.H. to visit her during the ongoing psychiatric assessment.', '45. The initiation of medication was discussed with the applicant on 21 March 2005. She was given the opportunity to take medication orally, but she repeatedly refused to do so. Owing to the applicant’s resistance, the administering of medication began with involuntary injections of Zyprexa. As the applicant had made it clear that she would not cooperate, it was decided to continue her medication by giving long-acting injections of Risperdal Consta every two weeks, starting on 31 March 2005. The basis of the decision was explained to the applicant and she was also given information about the drug. The issue of medication was discussed with the applicant on several occasions after that. She was encouraged to take it orally, but she persistently refused.', '46. As the applicant’s core symptoms persisted after two and a half months of medication, it was decided on 22 June 2005 to increase the dosage of Risperdal Consta from 25 milligrams to 37.5 milligrams. It was reduced to 25 milligrams again from 16 November 2005.', '47. The applicant alleged that when she had questioned the forcible administering of medication, she was informed that it was intended to cure her telephone surveillance delusion. The applicant argued that the surveillance had taken place and that there had been no delusion on her part.', '48. On 7 July 2005 the applicant claimed to have been assaulted in connection with the forcible administering of medication. She had resisted, as she considered the medication unnecessary, whereupon she had been dragged by her arms and legs to her room. When she was put on the bed her thigh had hit the edge of the bed. She had reported the incident to the police, who had asked a medical doctor, Dr S.Ö., to examine her, which he did on 28 July 2005. In his medical opinion of 5 August 2005 he noted that the applicant had a 10 cm bruise on her thigh, which could have been caused in the manner described by the applicant.', '49. On 22 July 2005 the head physician of the hospital decided to continue the applicant’s involuntary treatment.', '50. In a written statement of 17 August 2005 to the Administrative Court the head physician of Vanha Vaasa Hospital, M.E., noted that the applicant was still in denial of her illness and very strongly opposed medical treatment. She was literally fighting back, and this had resulted in several difficult situations when attempts were being made to proceed with the administering of medication in a manner which would be safe for both the applicant and the hospital staff.', '51. It appears that in August 2005 enquiries were made about a possible transfer of the applicant to a different hospital in her home town. However, that hospital did not consider itself able at that point to accept responsibility for the applicant’s care.', '52. The applicant alleged that she was still suffering side effects from the medication. The applicant’s patient records indicate that the alleged side effects could not be objectively verified. The applicant refused to undergo further medical examinations whereby any side effects could be detected.', '53. On 3 October 2005 the applicant was visited by Dr E.P., a general practitioner at an occupational health care centre. In his opinion of 5 October 2005 Dr E.P. emphasised that he did not specialise in psychiatry and he could not therefore take a stand as to the diagnosed delusion on the basis of one visit. He noted, however, that the applicant had been lucid and well-orientated. During their conversation he had not observed any signs of psychosis or delusion. In his capacity as a general practitioner, he considered that the conditions for involuntary treatment were not met.', '54. On 22 October 2005 the applicant was visited by a psychiatrist, Dr M-P.H., who in a written medical opinion of 25 October 2005 considered, as an outsider, that the choice of medication for the applicant (37.5 milligrams of Risperdal Consta injected into the muscle every two weeks) seemed excessive, given the patient’s age and state of health. Furthermore, he considered that the involuntary and forced medication fulfilled the constitutive elements of assault. In conclusion, he considered that open-care measures were possible and that the danger posed by the applicant to herself and others had been considerably exaggerated, and accordingly that the criteria for involuntary care were not met.', '55. It appears from the applicant’s patient records that from November 2005 at the latest she was no longer physically resisting the injections, although she was still verbally opposing her medication.', '56. On 19 November 2005 the hospital decided to move the applicant from the closed ward to an open one.', '57. On 24 November 2005 the applicant agreed to blood tests.', '58. On 21 December 2005 the applicant again saw Dr M-P.H., who in a written medical opinion of 21 December 2005 considered that the conditions for involuntary care were not met.', '59. The applicant spent Christmas at home. She had with her a dose of Risperdal Consta, which she injected during her holiday with the assistance of a nurse.', '60. On 9 January 2006 it was decided, by mutual agreement with the applicant, that the medication should be terminated, as she was not at all motivated to take it.', '61. On 20 January 2006 the head physician of the hospital took a further decision to continue the applicant’s involuntary care.', '62. On 27 January 2006 the applicant was discharged from hospital.', '63. On 30 May 2006 Dr M.E. considered that the grounds for continuing the involuntary care under section 8 of the Mental Health Act no longer existed, whereupon the treatment was officially terminated by a decision of the National Forensic Medical Authority of 22 June 2006.', '64. On 23 February 2005 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (korkein hallinto-oikeus, högsta förvaltnings-domstolen) against the decision of 17 February 2005 by the Forensic Psychiatry Board, arguing that there was no legal basis for the involuntary care. She alleged that Dr A.K. had erred in his assessment. She relied, inter alia, on the above-mentioned medical opinion of Dr K.A., who had seen her twice, in November and December 2002, and who had not found any signs of mental illness on the basis of those meetings. She alleged that there was no other reason for the forced medication than the hospital doctors’ attempt to conceal their incorrect diagnosis.', '65. On 4 March 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court found no reason to stay execution pending its proceedings.', '66. On 30 June 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court prohibited Mr J.R. from acting as the applicant’s representative. Under Chapter 15, Article 10a(2), of the Code of Judicial Procedure the applicant was invited to inform the court of her choice of counsel. Subsequently, the applicant was represented by Ms H.M., counsel chosen by her. She was granted legal aid.', '67. On 30 August 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court decided to hold an oral hearing in the case.', '68. On 29 and 30 September 2005 the applicant requested the court to postpone the oral hearing until she had obtained an impartial medical opinion and until she had recovered from the side effects of her medication. On 3 October 2005 she informed the court that she had fallen ill and again requested that the hearing be postponed.', '69. On 4 October 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court held an oral hearing and received the testimony of, inter alia, the applicant and six witnesses proposed by her. The applicant was represented by Ms H.M.', '70. The court refused the applicant’s request for a stay of the proceedings pending the submission of fresh medical opinions. The court considered this unnecessary given the fact that the issue to be decided was whether the applicant had been in need of involuntary care at the turn of the year 2004 to 2005. The validity of the impugned decision had already expired, as more than six months had elapsed since it had been given. It was difficult to see how a fresh examination could affect the court’s assessment.', '71. On 7 October 2005 the applicant submitted to the court a medical opinion by Dr E.P. dated 5 October 2005.', '72. On 13 October 2005 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. Having first noted that the impugned decision met the formal requirements and that the applicant’s complaint of partiality on the part of Dr A.K. and the members of the Forensic Psychiatry Board could not be upheld, it went on to note that the question to be decided was whether the criteria for involuntary care under section 8 of the Mental Health Act had been met on 17 February 2005, when the Board had given its decision. The question of whether a person was mentally ill was a factual question to be decided on the basis of medical evidence, having due regard to the correctness of the decision-making procedure applied.', '73. The court considered that Dr A.K., a specialist in psychiatry since 1990, was an experienced psychiatrist. His opinion and the opinion of the Board were based on a professionally qualified and reliable medical assessment.', '74. As to the subject matter the court reasoned, inter alia:', '“... Dr A.K. interviewed the applicant on ten occasions and was then able to make observations on her. Drs A.K. and M.E. explained at the oral hearing that the diagnosis of delusion was affected by the absoluteness of the applicant’s views on incest. They stressed that incest diagnoses required examinations by doctors specialising in gynaecology and also child psychiatry examinations. The applicant is a specialist in paediatrics. In particular, Dr M.E. gave evidence that in his discussions with the applicant she had refused to take into account the possibility that there had been no incest, although she admitted in general that doctors could also be mistaken. The fact that witnesses J. and S. gave evidence that the applicant had explained her situation in a pertinent manner did not undermine the view of Drs A.K. and M.E. The doctors gave concordant evidence that the discussions with the applicant were pertinent as long as her view on the alleged incest was not contradicted. At the oral hearing it became evident that witnesses J. and S. had not disputed the applicant’s views, but had mostly listened to what she had to say. S. indeed gave evidence that she had checked the information provided by the applicant against other sources, but as she had concluded that the views of the applicant were tenable, she had naturally not come into conflict with her. Witness P. had not taken a stand as to whether or not the applicant had a delusional disorder. He had only judged whether or not open-care measures were possible.', 'According to Dr A.K., the diagnosis of delusion had also been affected by the applicant’s continuing suspicion of authority and of medical and psychological examinations. Dr M.E. also gave evidence about the numerous appeals made by the applicant and how her world centred on them. The applicant had refused a somatic and neurological examination, magnetic imaging and psychological tests because she believed that the tests would be carried out by biased and prejudiced persons.', 'The applicant has the right to refuse to be examined in respect of her mental health. On the other hand, it is justifiable to question the basis for the absolute refusal to undergo the examinations offered and whether the refusal may be based precisely on thinking typical of a delusional disorder. Having regard to these considerations, it cannot be said that the diagnosis of delusional disorder was based on improper or arbitrary grounds, although the applicant has explained her refusal of examinations by stating that she had the right to do so, and her writing of legal submissions by stating that it was necessary to do so. At the oral hearing the applicant admitted that a deluded person would probably not be aware of her own illness.', 'At the oral hearing the applicant’s son, Dr E., a doctor in general practice, gave evidence stating that he understood, given his mother’s absolute and rigid behaviour, that she had been diagnosed as delusional. He could not, however, be certain of the correctness of the diagnosis, since he had seen his mother only a few times in recent years.', 'On the basis of the documents in the file and the information received at the oral hearing, and on the above grounds, the Supreme Administrative Court finds that reliable evidence has been provided for the diagnosis of delusional disorder in the decision of the Forensic Medical Authority.', 'A diagnosis of delusional disorder as such does not, however, suffice to warrant involuntary treatment. In addition, its effects on the person concerned and on others must be assessed.', 'The decision of the National Forensic Medical Authority was that the applicant was in need of involuntary treatment and that, if not treated, her mental illness would considerably worsen and seriously endanger her health and the health of others.', 'According to information received, when the decision on treatment was taken regard was had to the repercussions for the applicant’s life if her conflicts with the authorities and raising of associated issues were to continue. At the time it was considered that the applicant was not able to think matters through and that ordering treatment could help her to continue life in a calmer way.', 'These considerations must be held to be pertinent to an assessment of the need for the involuntary treatment for the sake of the applicant’s own health. The fact that after about six months of treatment and medication the head physician, Dr M.E., in his explanation of 17 August 2005, and the witnesses put forward by the applicant, in their statements, expressed divergent conclusions does not justify calling into question the assessment of the National Forensic Medical Authority regarding the need for treatment on 17 February 2005 for the sake of the applicant’s health.', 'The National Forensic Medical Authority did not consider that, if not treated, the applicant would seriously endanger the safety of others. However, it held that the health of others could be seriously endangered. It should be taken into account that the applicant could have an influence on other people, owing to the authority which she enjoys by reason of her status as a paediatrician. She may engender in other people suspicions which lack real foundation, causing them to act hastily, inappropriately or even criminally. The possibility of this kind of influence is not lessened by the fact that the applicant is retired. Nor would the possibility of influence be prevented by the mere withdrawal of the applicant’s licence to practise medicine, because the influencing is exerted on a psychological level and also in contexts other than that of a doctor’s consulting room.', 'The nurse assigned to the applicant, P., gave evidence to the effect that the applicant was not dangerous to other people. Although in his witness statement he also raised the issue of whether the applicant had given other patients dangerous advice, P.’s testimony can be regarded as a common judgment of a person’s dangerousness, such as violent behaviour or similar. This is not the case when it comes to the applicant. On the contrary, all the witnesses have concordantly testified that she tries to do good things and tries to help others. The doctors treating her have made similar statements. This intention does not, however, obviate the possibility that the actions of the person could cause harm to others. In this case there are sufficient grounds for holding that, if not treated, the applicant could have seriously endangered the health of others.', 'Other mental health services are inadequate, having regard to the fact that the applicant is in denial as regards her illness. That being the case, it can be held that the applicant would try to avoid treatment and would refuse examinations.', 'Conclusion', 'The Supreme Administrative Court finds, on the basis of the documents in the file and the information received at the oral hearing, that it has been reliably and objectively shown that the applicant was, at the time of the decision of the National Forensic Medical Authority, mentally ill within the meaning of section 8 of the Mental Health Act. Owing to her mental illness, she was in need of treatment and, if not treated, her mental illness would have considerably worsened or seriously endangered her health and the health of others. Other mental health services would not have been adequate. The conditions for ordering the applicant to undergo involuntary hospital treatment were thus present. The decision of the National Forensic Medical Authority ordering treatment was based on the Mental Health Act and was made in accordance with the procedure laid down by law. Nor is the decision unlawful.”', '75. On 22 July 2005, on the basis of a medical observation report by the doctor treating the applicant and the applicant’s medical records, the head physician of Vanha Vaasa Hospital decided to continue her treatment. It was noted that the applicant had, inter alia, criticised the treatment being given in the hospital and had tried to play a role in other patients’ treatment in her capacity as a doctor. She had also given them instructions concerning medication, even after she had been forbidden to do so. Open-care measures were considered insufficient, because the applicant was in denial of her illness and completely lacked motivation in relation to her treatment.', '76. The decision of 22 July 2005 was submitted for confirmation to the Administrative Court (hallinto-oikeus, förvaltningsdomstolen). The applicant also appealed against that decision to the same court, requesting an oral hearing.', '77. On 31 October 2005, having obtained a statement from the head physician of Vanha Vaasa Hospital and the applicant’s comments on it, the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It observed that the applicant’s condition had improved during treatment and that there had been discussions about a possible transfer to a psychiatric hospital in her home town. The court noted that the applicant was not suicidal and thus not endangering her own health, nor was she violent towards others. She was able to discuss day-to-day matters in a pertinent and polite manner as long as no one contested her views. However, she was still denying her illness, which manifested itself in her opposition to medical treatment and all further medical examinations offered her. The denial of the illness and lack of motivation in relation to treatment led the court to the conclusion that the applicant would most likely neglect treatment outside the hospital, which would severely aggravate her illness and endanger her health. As her delusion was related to her medical profession and her patients, lack of treatment could also put the health of others at serious risk. The Administrative Court also dismissed the applicant’s request for an oral hearing as manifestly unnecessary, making reference to the hearing held by the Supreme Administrative Court on 4 October 2005. Moreover, the court considered that the main issue, that of whether the applicant’s condition had improved to the extent that grounds for involuntary treatment no longer existed, could be adequately resolved on the basis of the case file alone.', '78. The applicant appealed further to the Supreme Administrative Court, citing, inter alia, the medical opinion of 30 December 2002 by Dr K.A., the medical opinion of 5 October 2005 by Dr E.P., and those of 25 October 2005 and 21 December 2005 by Dr M-P.H.', '79. On 16 May 2006 the Supreme Administrative Court, having obtained a fresh statement from the head physician of Vanha Vaasa Hospital and the applicant’s comments on it, upheld the lower court’s decision, on mainly the same grounds. It rejected the applicant’s request for an oral hearing, finding oral evidence on circumstances which prevailed after the adoption of the impugned decision of 22 July 2005 irrelevant.', '80. On 20 January 2006 the head physician of Vanha Vaasa Hospital took a further decision to continue the applicant’s involuntary care, based on a medical observation report by another hospital physician. It was noted that the applicant’s condition had improved and that she was currently cooperating with hospital staff. While her sense of reality still failed her as far as the criminal charge against her was concerned, she was able to discuss the matter pertinently and without agitation. She was no longer regarded as dangerous to herself or others and planning for her future transfer to outpatient care was considered justified.', '81. That decision was submitted to the Administrative Court for confirmation. The applicant appealed against that decision also.', '82. On 20 April 2006, having held an oral hearing, the Administrative Court found that the applicant was still suffering from psychotic delusions and that her illness was of a chronic nature. According to the court, the cessation of treatment would therefore significantly aggravate her illness. The court also took into account the marked improvement in the applicant’s condition, which had made it possible to plan her gradual transfer to outpatient care. It was noted that the applicant’s medication by injection had been terminated at the beginning of January. The court considered that it had been important for safety reasons to observe the effects of the withdrawal of medication in the hospital and, therefore, other forms of care would have been insufficient at the time.', '83. It is not known whether the applicant lodged a further appeal with the Supreme Administrative Court.', '84. During her stay in Vanha Vaasa Hospital the applicant made representations to the National Forensic Medical Authority, which by letter of 15 July 2005 noted that it had commenced an investigation of the actions of the medical staff involved in the applicant’s treatment. It did not however have the authority to monitor health care establishments. It informed the applicant that that authority lay with the social and health affairs department of the relevant State Provincial Office (lääninhallitus, länsstyrelse). Nor did the National Forensic Medical Authority have the authority to intervene in the administering of medication or to order the medication to be discontinued. It could, however, assess retrospectively the appropriateness of a doctor’s professional activity.', '85. Between January and July 2005 the applicant lodged a number of other requests with the National Forensic Medical Authority concerning, inter alia, her psychiatric assessment and treatment in Vanha Vaasa Hospital. On 12 January 2007 the National Forensic Medical Authority gave its decision in respect of those complaints. It relied on the judgment of 13 October 2005 by the Supreme Administrative Court in finding that the confinement of the applicant in involuntary care had been justified. As a general remark it was noted that the primary and sometimes only symptom of a delusional disorder was a false belief which the patient holds to and attempts to act upon. The delusion was continuous, clear and systematic, and could be very persistent and steadfast. It was common for a patient suffering from a delusional disorder not to manifest any other anomalous behaviour. A special form of delusion was what was known as a querulous delusion, which was characterised by continual claims for rectification, complaints and legal proceedings, driven by psychotic thinking, with the aim of restoring the person’s injured self-esteem. A delusional disorder was treated with therapeutic consultations and antipsychotic medicines. Lack of motivation for treatment and an inadequate response to treatment posed fundamental risks to the successful outcome of medical treatment. As regards the applicant’s treatment, and the forced administration of medication in particular, the National Forensic Medical Authority found no indication of conduct deviating from appropriate and commonly accepted medical practice, so her representations could therefore be considered erroneous. The decision was not subject to appeal.', '86. By letters dated 8, 11, 25 and 26 July 2005 Ms H.M. approached the Chancellor of Justice on the applicant’s behalf, requesting him to take action concerning the involuntary treatment of the applicant. Having regard to the provisions concerning the division of duties between the Chancellor of Justice and the Parliamentary Ombudsman, those letters were transmitted to the latter authority. By a letter dated 27 September 2005 Ms H.M. was informed of the Ombudsman’s decision not to deal with the case, as it was already pending before other authorities, namely the Supreme Administrative Court, the National Forensic Medical Authority, and the police.', '87. The applicant reported three Vanha Vaasa Hospital doctors to the police, alleging, inter alia, serious deprivation of liberty. On 27 January 2006, having obtained written statements from the National Forensic Medical Authority, the police found that no offence had been committed and closed the investigation.', '88. The applicant also made representations to the State Provincial Office, which sent the regional medical officer and health care inspector to Vanha Vaasa Hospital to interview the applicant and the hospital staff involved in her treatment. The regional medical officer also met the applicant’s representative. Furthermore, the authority acquainted itself with the applicant’s medical records and other documents related to the case and obtained written statements from hospital staff and the applicant’s comments on them. In its decision of 26 June 2006 the State Provincial Office noted that the issues raised by the applicant had previously been thoroughly examined by the National Forensic Medical Authority, which had found no irregularities. In the light of its own examination of the case, the State Provincial Office did not find that there was any reason to take further measures. The decision was not subject to appeal.', '89. In its decision of 17 February 2005 the Forensic Psychiatry Board found that the applicant’s capacity to look after her own interests in the criminal proceedings was reduced by her mental illness and that she was therefore in need of a guardian. The applicant contested this, arguing that she was well.', '90. On 23 February 2005, referring to the above statement by the National Forensic Medical Authority, the District Court informed the applicant by letter that it had decided under Chapter 12, Article 4a of the Code of Judicial Procedure to appoint a guardian for her in respect of the ongoing proceedings. It was noted that counsel M.S., who was considered to be suitable for the task, had given his consent. The applicant was provided with the opportunity to give her opinion on the matter by 3 March 2005. She was also informed that the court would hold a further oral hearing on 14 March 2005 and that her attendance at that hearing was not obligatory.', '91. By a letter dated 24 February 2005 the applicant opposed the appointment of a guardian without giving further reasons. She demanded that all documents concerning that matter be faxed to Mr J.R. and sent to her by post.', '92. On 2 March 2005 the District Court appointed the applicant’s public defender, Mr M.S., guardian. It was noted in the decision that the applicant was against the appointment of a guardian.', '93. On 20 June 2005 the Court of Appeal rejected the appeal signed by the applicant, noting that she was, in the opinion of the National Forensic Medical Authority, in need of a guardian, owing to her mental illness. The court did not find reasons to hold otherwise. Nor did it hold an oral hearing as requested by the applicant. The court did not examine a writ of appeal signed by Mr J.R., as he did not fulfil the requirements under Chapter 15, Article 2 § 1, of the Code of Judicial Procedure. Nor did it examine the appeal lodged by the applicant’s daughter, as she had failed to give notice of her intention to appeal as required by Chapter 25, Article 5 § 1, of the said Code.', '94. The applicant, represented by Ms H.M., sought leave to appeal, requesting an oral hearing. She argued that Mr M.S., whom she had never met, had not acted in her best interests. For instance, he had failed to request an oral hearing in the Court of Appeal although the applicant had asked him to submit a request to that effect. Nor had he questioned the correctness of the psychiatric assessment. She also submitted that she was in good health and not in need of a guardian.', '95. On 30 September 2005 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '96. On 10 March 2005 the applicant submitted to the District Court a list of eighteen witnesses she wished to examine before the court concerning, inter alia, the events in December 2000 and the alleged serious deprivation of liberty. She also sought to have Drs H.L. and M-P.H. heard as medical experts. She further identified a number of documents to be adduced as written evidence.', '97. On 14 March 2005 the District Court held the final hearing in the criminal case. The applicant arrived at the court house but left before the hearing began. According to the applicant, she did so because Mr J.R., whom she had wanted to have heard as a witness, had been removed from the premises by force.', '98. The District Court proceeded with the hearing, in which the applicant was represented by her guardian, Mr M.S. The latter did not contest the accuracy of the medical opinion on the applicant’s psychiatric assessment. Nor did he refer to other medical opinions on the applicant’s mental health. He pleaded on the applicant’s behalf that she could only be regarded as an accessory to the offence in her capacity as a doctor. He did not find it necessary to hear witnesses.', '99. In its judgment of 8 April 2005 the District Court found V.’s mother responsible for serious deprivation of liberty between 16 December 2000 and 22 April 2001. The applicant was found responsible for aiding and abetting V.’s mother in the commission of that offence between 26 December 2000 and 22 April 2001. The court did not pass sentence on them as they were not responsible for their actions at the material time. However, it ordered them to pay damages and legal costs.', '100. As regards the background to the case, the court noted that V. had been examined from 1995 onwards as a result of her mother’s suspicions that she had been sexually abused. The public prosecutor L.K. had decided on 19 April 1999 not to prefer charges against the father, as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place during the period from 1994 to March 1996. On 21 April 1998 the public prosecutor M.P. waived charges against another person, as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place in July 1997. On 4 June 2001 the public prosecutor L.K. waived charges against the father, as there was no evidence that an offence had taken place during the period from September 1998 to June 2000. In June 2000 the mother took V. to a university hospital for examination. Those examinations did not support her suspicions of sexual abuse. On 13 June 2000 the girl was taken into emergency public care because of her mother’s mental health problems and was placed in a family support centre. An ordinary care order was made in July 2000. Meanwhile, on 26 June 2000 the mother removed the girl from the centre without permission and they were found later that day in a town some 100 km away, whereupon the girl was returned to the centre by the police. On 3 April 2001 the Court of Appeal granted the father sole custody of the girl, who was to see her mother during supervised visits three times a week.', '101. As to the applicant’s actions, the court noted that she had expressed a number of opinions which could not be regarded as medical opinions. She had predominantly functioned as an aide to the girl’s mother, making suggestions on what measures to take. The applicant had been aware of the fact that the girl had been taken into public care and on 18 December 2000 the police had told her that the girl was missing. The court found it established that V. and her mother had come to meet the applicant on 26 December 2000. Since that date the applicant had found accommodation for them and transported them in her car. The applicant had allowed the mother’s mail to be redirected to her address. The court noted that it had not even been suggested that the applicant had been in [town A] on 16 December 2000.', '102. By a letter dated 12 April 2005 Mr M.S. informed the applicant that, as her guardian, he had notified the District Court of the applicant’s intention to appeal against its judgment. He asked the applicant to state her opinion on the judgment in writing and informed her that he would be in Vaasa on 26 April 2005, should the applicant wish to meet him in person. It appears that no meeting took place.', '103. Mr M.S. subsequently appealed on the applicant’s behalf, arguing that the charge should be rejected on the grounds of lack of intent. In her capacity as a doctor, the applicant had only wished to protect the mother and the child as she was firmly convinced that the girl had been sexually abused. The guardian took the view that the case could be examined by the appellate court in a written procedure. On 9 May 2005 Mr M.S. sent a copy of the notice of appeal to the applicant for information, noting that it corresponded, in the main, to the draft he had sent her earlier, on 2 May 2005. He also noted that the applicant had not made any comments on that draft.', '104. In her own writ of appeal the applicant requested an oral hearing, at which she wished the court to hear the same eighteen witnesses she had requested in the proceedings before the District Court. She also questioned the motives of the public prosecutor in bringing charges for an aggravated offence. The applicant had acquired a copy of his notes to the proceedings, in which it was implied that a psychiatric assessment was the only means of treatment, which, in turn, was the only means of stopping the terrorising of the father and the child and the misuse of justice. The applicant later lodged a number of additional submissions with the appellate court.', '105. On 31 August 2005, relying on Chapter 26, Article 14 § 2, point 4, of the Code of Judicial Procedure, the Court of Appeal refused the applicant’s request for an oral hearing as manifestly unnecessary. As regards the subject matter, the court upheld the lower court’s judgment, finding no reason to deviate from it. Under Chapter 25, Article 12 § 2 of the Code, the court dismissed the applicant’s own belated representations without examining their merits.', '106. The applicant, represented by counsel of her choosing, Ms H.M., requested leave to appeal.', '107. On 14 February 2006 the Supreme Court refused leave to appeal.', '108. On 24 October 2005 the National Forensic Medical Authority decided that the applicant’s ability to work as a doctor and her health should be examined.', '109. By an interim decision of 17 March 2006 the National Forensic Medical Authority prohibited the applicant from practising her profession during 2006.', '110. The applicant was assessed in an open ward of the psychiatric clinic at Helsinki University Hospital from 6 September to 6 October 2006.', '111. The resultant medical opinion of 10 October 2006 did not note any specific psychiatric disorder affecting the applicant. It was noted, however, that a full examination could not be conducted because the applicant refused to surrender documents from Vanha Vaasa Hospital concerning her medical history. It was considered that the fact that she had suffered from a narrowly focused delusional disorder would hamper her ability to function as a sound expert in sexual abuse cases. She should thus concentrate on general paediatrics.', '112. On 29 January 2007 the National Forensic Medical Authority revoked its decision of 17 March 2006, but ordered that the applicant should not deal with suspected child abuse cases in her private practice. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Administrative Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. Those appeals were dismissed on 24 September 2008 and 24 August 2009 respectively.', '113. The applicant states that she is again seeing patients at her surgery.', '114. The Constitution (Suomen perustuslaki, Finlands grundlag; Law no. 731/1999) provides in its relevant parts:', '“Section 7 - The right to life, personal liberty and integrity', 'Everyone has the right to life, personal liberty, integrity and security.', 'No one shall be sentenced to death, tortured or otherwise treated in a manner violating human dignity.', 'The personal integrity of the individual shall not be violated, nor shall anyone be deprived of liberty arbitrarily or without a reason prescribed by an Act.

At the relevant time Chapter 17, Article 45, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, Rättegångs Balk, Law no. 571/1948) read:', '“The court may, where it is deemed necessary, order a psychiatric assessment of the defendant. Such an assessment may not be ordered against the defendant’s will save in cases where he or she has been placed in detention pending trial or is charged with an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year. (494/1969)', 'Separate provisions apply to psychiatric assessment and admission to a mental institution for such an assessment.”', '117. That provision was amended by Law no. 244/2006, which took effect on 1 October 2006. According to the amended provision, a psychiatric assessment of the defendant may be ordered if the court has, in an interim judgment, found the defendant guilty as charged, such an assessment is justified, and the defendant agrees to the assessment or he or she has been placed in detention pending trial or has been charged with an offence punishable by more than one year’s imprisonment. At the request of the prosecutor, the defendant or his or her guardian, the court may order a psychiatric assessment earlier, during the pre-trial investigation or prior to the main hearing, if the defendant has pleaded guilty to the charge or if the need for such an assessment is otherwise clear.', '118.

According to the preparatory documents relating to section 22b of the Mental Health Act (Government Bill HE 113/2001 vp), a care order issued for the involuntary hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient is understood to contain an automatic authorisation to treat the patient, even against his or her will. Although the doctors may seek to obtain a person’s consent prior to the treatment, there is no obligation to have such consent in written form or to seek such consent from the patient’s relatives or guardian. If a patient refuses to give his or her consent or withdraws consent previously given, the provision allows the forced administration of medication. This is in the interest of the patient in order to secure his or her constitutional right to necessary care in a situation in which the patient is not personally able to make a decision about the treatment on account of his or her illness.', '120. Section 7(3) of the Administrative Courts Act (hallinto-oikeuslaki, lagen om förvaltningsdomstolarna, Law no. 1424/2001) provides that in administrative courts an expert member participates in the consideration of, and decision on, matters concerning the order of involuntary care and continuing involuntary care of a person referred to in the Mental Health Act.', '121.

The Board was composed of a chairman, who had to be an official of the National Forensic Medical Authority, and three other members. One of the members had to be an expert in the field of law, and two members, one of whom also had to be a representative of municipal health care, had to be an expert in the field of psychiatry.', '123. State Provincial Offices ceased to exist on 1 January 2010, and their tasks have been transferred to various other authorities. Prior to that rearrangement within the administration, the provisions regulating the tasks of the State Provincial Offices were to be found in some 130 different statutes. General information about the tasks and powers of that authority may be found in the Government Bill HE 154/2005 vp concerning, inter alia, certain amendments to the Mental Health Act. According to that document, the State Provincial Offices were to exercise guidance and supervision of State mental hospitals, among a number of other institutions and services. This was implemented, inter alia, by way of distribution of information, on-site inspections and dealing with complaints. In 63% of the decisions given by State Provincial Offices in 2004, in their capacity as supervising authorities, no appearance of inappropriateness to a degree which would have justified their taking measures was found; 18% of the cases dealt with resulted in the attention of a health care professional being drawn to the matter, and an admonition was given in 5% of the cases.', '124. The relevant parts of Chapter 2, section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act (laki oikeudenkäynnistä rikosasioissa, lagen om rättegång i brottmål, Law no. 689/1997) provide as follows:', '“A person suspected of an offence has the right to defend him or herself in pre-trial investigations and at the trial ...', 'A public defender shall be appointed for the suspect of the court’s own motion when: (1) the suspect is incapable of defending himself or herself; (2) the suspect, who has not retained a public defender, is under 18 years of age, unless it is obvious that he or she has no need of one; (3) the public defender retained by the suspect does not meet the qualifications required of a public defender or is incapable of defending the suspect; or (4) there is another special reason for the same.” (107/1998)', 'Chapter 2, section 2 (1) reads:', '“A person appointed under section 1 ... as public defender ... must be a public legal-aid attorney or an advocate. If there is no suitable public legal-aid attorney or advocate available or there is another special reason to do so, another person with a degree of [Master of Law] who by law is qualified to act as an attorney may also be appointed as public defender ... The person to be appointed as public defender ... must have an opportunity to be heard on the appointment.” (260/2002)', '125. Chapter 12, Article 4a, of the Code of Judicial Procedure (Law no. 444/1999) reads:', '“If a party is incapable of looking after his or her interests in court proceedings owing to illness, mental disorder, ill health or another similar reason, the court before which the case is pending may of its own motion appoint a guardian for that party for the purposes of the proceedings. The provisions of the Guardianship Services Act shall apply to such guardian.', 'Unless the court decides otherwise, the appointment of the guardian shall remain in effect before an appellate instance where the matter is pending on appeal.”', '126. Section 5 of the Guardianship Services Act (laki holhoustoimesta, lagen om förmyndarverksamhet, Law no. 442/1999) provides that a suitable person who consents to the appointment is eligible as a guardian. In the assessment of the suitability the skills and experience of that person, among other things, and the nature and extent of the task shall be taken into account.', '127. Chapter 8 of the Code of Judicial Procedure (Law no. 768/2002) lays down provisions concerning the procedure to be followed in dealing with petition-based cases (hakemusasia, ansökningsärendet) in the District Court. Those provisions apply also to such petition-based cases which the court may take into consideration of its own motion (Article 1 § 2). A petition-based case shall be examined in chambers or at a hearing. If a party, a witness or another person is to be heard in person, a hearing must be held. A hearing must also be held if the matter has been contested and a party requests a hearing or if the court considers a hearing necessary for the matter to be resolved (Article 3). If a party is to be reserved an opportunity to be heard in a petition-based case, the court must invite him or her to submit a written statement (Article 5). A petition-based case may be dealt with in connection with related criminal proceedings, if that is possible without impeding the proceedings (Article 9 § 2.', '128. Chapter 26 of the Code regulates the appeal procedure in the Court of Appeal. Article 14 of that Chapter (Law no. 165/1998) reads as follows:', '“An oral hearing shall be held in the Court of Appeal if a party to a civil case or the injured party or the defendant in a criminal case so requests.', 'However, an oral hearing need not be held for the reason referred to in subsection 1, if: (1) in a civil case amenable to settlement, the opposing party has consented to the appellant’s request for a change; (2) in a criminal case only the appellant has requested a full hearing and it is the appeal decision which makes the ruling on the case; (3) the person requesting a main hearing is satisfied with the decision of the District Court and the decision is not changed to his or her detriment; (4) the appeal is manifestly ill-founded; (5) the matter is to be decided in the case is procedural only; or (6) a full hearing is for another reason manifestly unnecessary.', 'The provisions in paragraph 1 and in paragraphs 2 § 1 and 2 §§ 3--6 also apply, in so far as appropriate, when hearing an appeal lodged in a petition-based case.”', '129. According to the relevant Government Bill (HE 33/1997 vp) the term “ill-founded” in Chapter 26, Article 14 § 2, point 4, of the Code refers to a situation where it is impossible for the grounds presented in the appeal to lead to the changes requested. An appeal is also ill-founded where the grounds for it do not correspond to the generally known facts. The provision may also be applied in criminal cases where, inter alia, the defendant requests an acquittal relying on matters which he or she would present at the oral hearing but which could not have any impact on a decision in the case. No consideration is to be given to the gravity of the offence or the sentence imposed when that provision is applied.', '130. Chapter 26, Article 15 § 1 of the Code (Law no. 165/1998) reads:', '“The Court of Appeal shall hold an oral hearing, regardless of whether one has been requested, if a decision on the matter turns on the credibility of the testimony admitted in the District Court or the findings of the District Court in a judicial inspection, or on new testimony to be admitted in the Court of Appeal. In this event, the evidence admitted in the District Court shall be readmitted and the inspection carried out again in an oral hearing, unless there is an impediment to this.”', '131. Chapter 6, section 5 § 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act stipulates, inter alia, that it is a court’s task to ensure that a case is dealt with in a coherent and orderly manner. It shall also ensure that the proceedings are conducted appropriately and that no irrelevant issues are introduced.', '132. Paragraph 41 of the CPT report concerns the consent of a patient to treatment given in a mental hospital. It reads as follows:', '“Patients should, as a matter of principle, be placed in a position to give their free and informed consent to treatment. The admission of a person to a psychiatric establishment on an involuntary basis should not be construed as authorising treatment without his consent. It follows that every competent patient, whether voluntary or involuntary, should be given the opportunity to refuse treatment or any other medical intervention. Any derogation from this fundamental principle should be based upon law and only relate to clearly and strictly defined exceptional circumstances.', 'Of course, consent to treatment can only be qualified as free and informed if it is based on full, accurate and comprehensible information about the patient’s condition and the treatment proposed; to describe ECT as ""sleep therapy"" is an example of less than full and accurate information about the treatment concerned. Consequently, all patients should be provided systematically with relevant information about their condition and the treatment which it is proposed to prescribe for them. Relevant information (results, etc.) should also be provided following treatment.”', '133. The CPT visited Finland from 7 to 17 September 2003, the Niuvanniemi State Mental Hospital being among the establishments visited. In paragraph 144 of its report, published on 14 June 2004, the CPT made the following remark:', '“As regards safeguards, the procedures concerning the mental examination of persons accused of a crime and the initial placement of such persons offered, overall, adequate guarantees of independence and impartiality as well as objective medical expertise. By contrast, the manner in which an order for treatment in respect of both civil and forensic patients was being renewed would merit a reassessment. The CPT considers that the periodic review of an order to treat a patient against his/her will in a psychiatric hospital should involve a psychiatric opinion which is independent of the hospital in which the patient is detained.”', '134. On its next visit to Finland, between 20 and 30 April 2008, the CPT visited, inter alia, the Vanha Vaasa State Mental Hospital and another psychiatric establishment. In its report, published on 20 January 2009, the CPT made, inter alia, the following remarks and recommendations:', '“ ... 126 - In both establishments, the use of psychiatric medication appeared appropriate. As regards the Vanha Vaasa Hospital, the current rhythm of formal multidisciplinary clinical review (twice a year) is not sufficient. Staff representing different specialties (psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, occupational and work therapists, social workers) should all meet and discuss each patient’s condition and progress on a more frequent basis. The CPT recommends that steps be taken in the light of these remarks ...', '140 - Involuntary hospitalisation of a psychiatric patient continued to be construed as automatically authorising treatment without his/her consent. In practice, doctors in the two psychiatric establishments visited sought to obtain patients’ verbal consent to treatment, but there was no written proof that such informed consent had been given. Further, a patient’s refusal or subsequent withdrawal of consent to treatment did not result in an external independent psychiatric review as to whether treatment could be provided against the patient’s will. In addition, patients could not appeal against such decisions to a court.', 'The CPT recommends that a special form relating to informed consent to treatment, signed by the patient and (if he is incompetent) by his legal representative, be introduced at the ... and the Vanha Vaasa Hospital (as well as in all other psychiatric establishments in Finland). The relevant legislation should be amended so as to require an external psychiatric opinion in any case where a patient does not agree with the treatment proposed by the establishment’s doctors; further, patients should be able to appeal against a compulsory treatment decision to the court ...”']","['5', '8']","['5-1', '8-1']",['5-1-e'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1965 and currently lives in London.', '7. The applicant worked at the Institute of the USA and Canada at the Russian Academy of Science as the head of the Military-Technical and Military-Economic Policy Department. He resided in Obninsk, Kaluga Region.', '8. On 26 October 1999 the Kaluga Region Department of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (Управление Федеральной службы безопасности Российской Федерации по Калужской области, the “FSB”) opened criminal proceedings under Article 283 of the Criminal Code in connection with the publication in 1998 of the book “Strategic Nuclear Weaponry of Russia” which allegedly contained State secrets.', '9. On 27 October 1999 the FSB, acting on the basis of a search warrant, searched the applicant’s flat in the presence of the applicant and his wife and seized notes, books, press clippings, computers, money in foreign currencies (cash) and other items. They took the applicant to their office in Obninsk. Over the next three days an investigator questioned him as a witness, having warned him about his criminal liability if he refused to testify or made false statements. The applicant had no access to a lawyer, nor did he request that one be appointed.', '10. On 29 October 1999 the FSB brought criminal proceedings against the applicant on suspicion of high treason in the form of espionage, punishable under Article 275 of the Criminal Code.', '11. On the same day an investigator joined the two cases and ordered the applicant’s detention on remand under Article 90 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The detention order, upheld by the prosecutor of Obninsk on the same day and served on the applicant at 12.30 a.m. on 30 October 1999, stated that the applicant had gathered, systematised and summarised information of a military-technical nature and then passed it on to representatives of a foreign organisation, Alternative Futures, for remuneration, during meetings with them outside Russia. Thus, in September 1998 in Budapest the applicant had allegedly handed over analytical materials containing State secrets on the state of the Russian rocket attack warning system. In July 1999 in Brussels he had allegedly passed on materials concerning the latest Russian aircraft complexes and had been requested to collect information on the Akula submarine and the MIG-29 aircraft. He had prepared that information and obtained an entry visa for Italy, intending to hand it over in Rome in October 1999. He had failed to do so for reasons beyond his control. The investigator concluded that the applicant’s actions contained elements of treason, punishable under Article 275 of the Criminal Code. The order also stated that the preparation of charges against the applicant had not been completed, that he might obstruct the investigation and continue his criminal activities and that he might abscond.', '12. On 1 November 1999 the applicant was questioned as a suspect in the presence of his lawyer.', '13. On 5 November 1999 the applicant was charged with high treason in the form of espionage under Article 275 of the Criminal Code. The charges were formulated in a one-page document. The applicant was accused of collecting and handing over to the UK-based consultancy firm Alternative Futures information containing State secrets and other information damaging to Russia’s national security, in the manner described in the detention order of 29 October 1999.', '14. On 24 December 1999 the prosecutor’s office extended the term of the preliminary investigation and the applicant’s detention on remand to 26 March 2000.', '15. On 25 February 2000 the applicant’s counsel requested the investigator to replace the applicant’s detention with another preventive measure that would not involve deprivation of liberty. He specifically requested that factors other than the gravity of the charge against him be taken into consideration. He pointed out that Obninsk was the place of the applicant’s permanent residence, that the applicant was married and had two small children, that his family did not have a source of income other than his salary, that he had a number of diseases which required medical care and that he wished to continue his work at the institute. The request was supported by applications from a Vice-President of the Russian Academy of Science and another scientist, who wished to be the applicant’s personal guarantors. On 1 March 2000 the investigator from the Kaluga Region Department of the FSB rejected the request. The applicant appealed against this decision.', '16. On 23 March and 13 April 2000 the prosecutor’s office extended the term of the preliminary investigation and the applicant’s detention on remand to 26 April and 26 July 2000 respectively.', '17. On 26 April 2000 the Regional Prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the investigator’s decision of 1 March 2000, stating that the investigator had rightly rejected the request because the applicant had been charged with a particularly serious offence. A further appeal to the Deputy General Prosecutor of the Russian Federation was rejected on 28 April 2000 on the same ground.', '18. On an unspecified date the applicant filed a court appeal complaining that his detention was unlawful and unjustified and requesting his release. In particular, he argued that he had been unlawfully detained from 27 to 29 October 1999. He pointed out that there was no evidence that he might flee, and that various other factors, including his family situation, made him eligible for release. On 29 June 2000 the Kaluga District Court of the Kaluga Region rejected the application as unfounded. The court pointed out that the applicant was accused of a crime falling into the category of particularly serious offences. It then observed that the domestic law permitted [the courts] to remand in custody those accused of such offences by a mere reference to the gravity of the offence. The court added that the investigation into the charges against the applicant had not been completed. It did not comment on the applicant’s allegations concerning the period from 27 to 29 October 1999. The decision of 29 June 2000 was subject to appeal to the Kaluga Regional Court. There is no indication that the applicant appealed against it.', '19. The investigating authority ordered that an expert examination be carried out with a view to determining whether the materials which the applicant had allegedly collected, stored and passed on to Alternative Futures contained State secrets, and whether they could have been obtained from the publications to which the applicant referred as the sources of his information. The applicant asked the investigating authority to give him an opportunity to provide explanations to the experts. His motion was rejected.', '20. On 30 June 2000 a commission of experts from the Land Forces Headquarters, which included expert K., reached the conclusion that materials on the topic “The RF Ministry of Defence’s failure to implement in full plans to set up permanent readiness units in 1998” could have been derived from open publications and did not contain State secrets.', '21. On 12 July 2000 the Deputy General Prosecutor extended the term of the applicant’s detention in custody until 26 September 2000. An appeal by the applicant against this decision and an application for release were rejected by the Kaluga District Court on 10 August 2000. In its decision the court again referred to the gravity of the charges against the applicant as the only reason for his continued detention. There is no indication that the applicant appealed to the Kaluga Regional Court against this decision.', '22. On 17 August 2000 another group of experts from the General Headquarters of the Russian armed forces, which included expert N., stated that the information on the topic “Options for the structure of the RF’s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to 2007” could have been derived from open sources, represented the result of analytical research, was untrue and did not contain State secrets.', '23. Information relating to thirty-eight other topics was found by the experts to have contained State military secrets.', '24. On 19 September 2000 the finalised charges were brought against the applicant. They consisted of thirty-eight items, set out on eleven pages. The applicant was accused of gathering, by way of analysing and systematising information published in Russia and other countries, and information from other non-established sources, and of passing on materials concerning Russia’s military and defence potential which contained State secrets and other materials of a military and military-technical nature, to two representatives of the US intelligence service, who were working under cover of the consultancy firm Alternative Futures, to be used to damage Russia’s national security. According to the charge sheet, the applicant had handed over materials on thirty-eight topics of the above nature, for remuneration, during seven meetings in 1998-1999 in Birmingham, London, Budapest and Brussels.', '25. According to the applicant, all of the information used in charging him was obtained by the investigating authority from his statements given on 27-29 October 1999, 1-5 and 24 November 1999, 25 January and 4 September 2000.', '26. On 26 September 2000 the preliminary investigation was finalised.', '27. On 23 October 2000 the defence finished examining the case file.', '28. On 26 October 2000 the Deputy Kaluga Regional Prosecutor transmitted the case to the Kaluga Regional Court for trial.', '29. On 9 December 2000 the Kaluga Regional Court ordered that the case be heard by a bench composed of a judge and two people’s assessors, in a closed trial. On the same day the court rejected the applicant’s request for release, supported by two non-governmental organisations, on the ground of the gravity of the charges against him.', '30. A hearing was originally scheduled for 26 December 2000. It was adjourned until 9 January and then until 26 February 2001, on a request by the applicant’s two new counsels, in order to allow time for examination of the case file.', '31. On 7 February 2001 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (“the Supreme Court”) dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 9 December 2000. It stated that, under Article 96 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, detention on remand could be applied on the mere ground of the gravity of the crime. It held: “As follows from the materials of the case, Sutyagin is accused of committing a particularly grave crime. In these circumstances one cannot accept the arguments in the appeal with regard to the unlawfulness and groundlessness of the judge’s decision to maintain detention on remand as a measure of restraint.”', '32. The hearing took place on 27 and 28 February 2001. On 1 March it was adjourned to 5 March 2001, 3 and 4 March being non-working days, because one of the defence counsel would be busy in another trial on the following day.', '33. The hearing was held on 5-7 March 2001. Between 14 March and 21 May 2001 no hearing took place because one of the defence counsels was ill.', '34. The examination of the case continued on 25, 28-30 May, 4-9, 14-15, and 18-20 June 2001. On the latter date the court granted the prosecutor’s request to call witnesses and experts and adjourned the hearing until 17 July 2001.', '35. The trial continued on 18-20, 23-27 and 30-31 July, 2-3, 6-10, 13-14 and 16-17 August 2001. On 20 August 2001 the hearing was adjourned to 4 September 2001 on account of the defence counsel’s illness. It continued on 5-7, 10-14, 17-18, 20-21 September 2001. On the latter date the court granted the prosecution’s request to adjourn the hearing until 29 October 2001 to allow time for preparation of their pleadings.', '36. The hearing continued on 29-31 October 2001. The defence asked that the hearing be adjourned to 12 November 2001 to allow the defence time to prepare on the basis of the prosecutor’s submissions. The request was granted.', '37. On 1 November 2001 the court heard the prosecutor’s pleadings. According to the applicant, the First Deputy Prosecutor of the Kaluga Region B., who represented the prosecution, acknowledged that the applicant had been unlawfully detained by the FSB department of the Kaluga Region from 27 to 29 October 1999 and asked the court to issue a “special finding” (частное определение) with such an acknowledgment.', '38. On 12 November 2001 the court heard pleadings by the defence.', '39. On 13 November 2001 the court adjourned the hearing until 25 December 2001, giving no reasons, and then until 27 December 2001 on account of illness among the judges.', '40. On 27 December 2001 the court heard the applicant’s final statement. The applicant stated that he had gathered information for Alternative Futures using open sources and denied the charges against him.', '41. On the same day, after deliberations, the Kaluga Regional Court remitted the case for additional investigation.', '42. In its decision the Kaluga Regional Court stated that the investigating authority had significantly breached the rules of criminal procedure in the course of the preliminary investigation, thus prejudicing the applicant’s right to defend himself. The charges against the applicant in the statement of charges of 19 September 2000 and in the bill of indictment, notably the content of the materials which the applicant had allegedly gathered, stored and transmitted to a foreign intelligence service, were excessively vague. Those documents contained the titles and general description of the topics about which the applicant had allegedly transmitted information, but did not indicate the content of that information. With regard to some accusations there was a significant discrepancy between their formulation in the statement of charges and the bill of indictment, which fact, in line with the practice directions of the Supreme Court, was a ground for remitting the case for additional investigation. With regard to certain other charges, the court noted that the investigating authority had contradicted itself in the statement of charges and the bill of indictment by referring to the same information as classified and non-classified.', '43. A general criticism about the charges on twenty-nine topics was that it remained unclear exactly what information the applicant had allegedly gathered, stored and transmitted. This made it impossible for the court to assess the arguments put forward by the prosecution and the defence; to establish factual questions concerning the sources and circumstances in which the information was collected; to assess whether the information was truthful and comprised State secrets, and to assess the possibility that it was damaging to Russia’s external security. The vague formulation of the charges, which made it impossible for the applicant to know exactly what he was accused of, also violated his right to defend himself.', '44. The investigating authority had established the applicant’s guilt based, inter alia, on the applicant’s own statements. At the same time they had failed to set out and analyse in the bill of indictment the applicant’s statements concerning the circumstances in which the information was collected and stored and the content of that information.', '45. According to the investigating authority, the applicant’s guilt was corroborated by the applicant’s four notebooks. There was nothing in the bill of indictment about the content of those notebooks or its analysis.', '46. The bill of indictment referred to mutually exclusive evidence which had not been analysed and was not assessed by the investigating authority. Thus, the applicant was accused of gathering, storing and transmitting secret information concerning “options for the structure of the RF’s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to 2007”. The bill of indictment referred to three expert reports as evidence: (i) report of 29 February 2000 by the commission of experts from the Armed Forces General Headquarters, according to which this information was “top secret”; (ii) statements by a certain expert to the effect that this information was partially untrue but did however contain State secrets; and (iii) report of 17 August 2000 by the commission of experts from the Armed Forces General Headquarters, according to which the information was untrue and did not contain State secrets.', '47. The bill of indictment did not set out the applicant’s arguments and any results of their examination by the investigating authority. Thus, after the charges had been served on him Mr Sutyagin contended that he had taken certain information, allegedly secret, from various published interviews with Russian military commanders. He asked whether such information had been declassified. Neither the applicant’s arguments nor the results of their examination were set out in the bill of indictment. The applicant had argued that he obtained some information from the foreign press in English. However, the experts submitted to the trial court that they had never examined these publications. The applicant had contended that he had received all of his information, including that which, according to the experts, had comprised State secrets, from open sources. These arguments by the applicant had not been properly examined in the course of the preliminary investigation. The results of the examination had not been set out in the bill of indictment.', '48. During the preliminary investigation, expert examinations had been conducted into the secrecy of the information allegedly gathered, stored and transmitted by the applicant. Four expert commissions had concluded that part of the information contained State secrets of different levels. The experts’ conclusions had been included in the formulation of charges. In their examination the experts had been governed by order no. 055 of the Ministry of Defence of 10 August 1996, containing a list of information subject to classification in the RF Armed Forces, to which the applicant had never had access. By failing to provide the applicant with access to that document the investigating authority had violated his right to defend himself. Furthermore, that list was a secret document and had never received State registration; it should not therefore have been relied on by the experts (the Supreme Court in its decision of 12 September 2001 held that this order was a document touching upon human rights which should be registered; normative acts void of registration were invalid).', '49. The trial court agreed with the defence that the expert examinations (reports of 29 February, 25 July, 2 and 17 August 2000) had been ordered and carried out in violation of the law on criminal procedure.', '50. In view of the above violations the trial court remitted the case to the Kaluga regional prosecutor for additional investigation, as required by Articles 232 § 1 (2) and 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and ordered, without giving any reasons, that the applicant should remain in detention.', '51. The court held that should the evidence gathered as a result of the new investigation be sufficient to bring charges against the applicant, those charges were to be formulated in detail in a statement of charges, in accordance with the requirements of Article 144 of the Code. A bill of indictment had to comply with Article 205 of the Code and contain, in particular, the detailed formulation of a charge, which was not to differ significantly from the formulation in the statement of charges to the detriment of the accused. The bill of indictment had further to describe and examine evidence produced by the investigating authority and the accused’s arguments in his defence. Expert examination of the information included in the charges should, if necessary, be carried out so that the accused’s rights would be duly respected.', '52. The applicant and his counsel appealed against this decision. They did not dispute the trial court’s findings with regard to the procedural violations by the investigating authority. They argued, however, that the vague formulation of the charges, as well as the violations in preparing the bill of indictment and in ordering and carrying out expert examinations, showed the irreparable incompleteness of the investigation, which warranted the applicant’s acquittal. The trial court should not have remitted the case for additional investigation on its own initiative without relevant requests to that effect by the parties. The flawed preliminary investigation should have resulted in the applicant’s acquittal.', '53. The defence also appealed against the decision upholding the applicant’s detention. They submitted that there was no evidence that he would flee. The applicant and his family and relations – his wife, two minor children, parents and brother – resided permanently in Obninsk. His wife and children were in a difficult financial situation. The applicant had a number of diseases which could not be treated properly in his detention facility. There was no evidence that the applicant could obstruct the investigation or would engage in criminal activities. The counsel complained about violations of Article 5 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in particular, given that the gravity of the offence was the sole ground for the applicant’s continued detention.', '54. On 20 March 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the decision. It maintained that the charges against the applicant had been too vague, and stated that the Kaluga Regional Court had rightly decided to remit the case for additional investigation and remand the applicant in custody, and that it found no ground to quash or amend that decision.', '55. On 8 April 2002 the investigation department of the FSB of the Kaluga Region commenced the additional investigation.', '56. On 6 June 2002 they ordered a new comprehensive expert report on whether the information which the applicant had allegedly transmitted to Alternative Futures contained State secrets. The defence objected to that decision, arguing that the experts were supposed to compare the statutory list of classified information and the transmitted information, which was in fact legal assessment. The applicant requested that he be allowed to be present at the expert examination and to provide explanations to the experts. He also noted that for unknown reasons the investigating authority had not forwarded to the experts a number of publications used by him. He requested that those publications be sent to the experts for their examination.', '57. In his decision of 17 June 2002 the head of the investigation department rejected the applicant’s requests. He stated, in particular, that all open sources had been forwarded for expert examination, except for those to which the applicant had referred without any ground, as they were mismatched chronologically (published after the events incriminated to the applicant) or textually with the information transmitted by the applicant. He stated that the applicant’s presence at the expert examination was not necessary since the materials submitted to the experts, including the applicant’s statements, were sufficient to answer the questions put to them.', '58. On 18 June 2002 the case was transferred to the FSB central investigation department in Moscow on the Deputy Prosecutor General’s instruction.', '59. On 18 July 2002 a commission of experts from the Headquarters of the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation carried out an assessment of the materials given to them by the investigating authority (records of the applicant’s interrogations and the publications to which the applicant referred as the sources of his information) and reached the conclusion that the materials on the following five topics constituted State secrets, were true and could not have been obtained from the publications examined by them:', '– the structure and state of the missile [early-]warning system;', '– the RF Ministry of Defence’s failure to implement in full plans to set up permanent readiness units in 1998;', '– options for the structure of the RF’s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to 2007;', '– specific features of the construction and military potential of the MiG-29 SMT aircraft and the military potential of the modernised MiG-29;', '– possible directions in the development of Russian air-to-air missiles.', '60. In their assessment the experts were governed by the Official Secrets Act, as amended on 6 October 1997, Presidential decree no. 1203 of 30 November 1995, the Code of Criminal Procedure and unpublished decrees of the Ministry of Defence nos. 055 and 015 issued on 10 August 1996 and 25 March 2002 respectively.', '61. On 29 July 2002 the applicant was re-charged with five counts of treason by way of espionage under Article 275 of the Criminal Code. He was accused of gathering, using the opportunities provided by his job at the Institute of the USA and Canada, information on five topics containing State secrets from various sources, including closed sources, and transmitting it, on five occasions in 1998-1999, to representatives of a foreign state with a view to damaging the national security of Russia. The charges in respect of the remaining items were withdrawn.', '62. On 7 August 2002 the additional investigation was finalised.', '63. On the same day the applicant and his counsel began examination of the case file. The case file was composed of more than 8,120 pages, computer files, audio and video records.', '64. On 9 August 2002 the Moscow City Court extended the applicant’s detention on remand to 8 October 2002 at the investigator’s request. The applicant appealed. On 2 October 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the decision as unlawful and ordered a fresh examination. It stated in its decision that pre-trial detention could only be extended if legitimate grounds were supported by the relevant factual circumstances.', '65. Following this decision, an investigator from the prosecutor’s office submitted to the Moscow City Court a copy of a document from which it followed that the applicant had received an entry visa for Italy which had expired in November 1999.', '66. On 3 October 2002 the City Court gave a new decision extending the applicant’s detention until 8 October 2002, on the grounds that, in view of his open visa for a trip abroad, he could abscond or otherwise obstruct the investigation and that he was accused of committing a particularly serious offence.', '67. On 4 October 2002 the Moscow City Court extended the applicant’s detention on the same grounds until such time as the applicant had completed examination of the case file.', '68. The defence appealed against the two decisions, pointing out, inter alia, that, according to the applicant’s passport, his Italian visa had been issued for the period from 28 October 1999 to 18 November 1999.', '69. On 25 December 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the appeals, holding that there were no grounds for the applicant’s release and referring to the gravity of the charges.', '70. On 15 August 2003 the defence finished its examination of the case file. The applicant requested that N. and K., who had carried out the expert assessment in the case in 2000, be examined by a trial court. The investigating authority included these individuals in the list of witnesses to be examined by a trial court, which was enclosed with the bill of indictment. Three prosecution witnesses, the Obninsk Navy training unit officers T., V. and G., were also added to that list.', '71. In August 2003 the applicant lodged a request for his case to be heard by a jury. The case was transferred to the Moscow City Court for trial.', '72. On 8 September 2003 a judge of the Moscow City Court listed a preliminary hearing for 15 September 2003. The hearing started on the latter date but was adjourned to 25 September 2003 at the prosecutor’s request to allow time for preparation.', '73. On 23 September 2003 the President of the Moscow City Court assigned the case to judge Sh., who held a preliminary hearing on 25 September and scheduled a hearing on the merits by a jury for 3 November 2003.', '74. On 29 September 2003 judge Sh. examined an application for release lodged by the defence. He observed that the applicant had been detained in connection with the accusation of a particularly grave offence, on well-founded grounds which were still valid. He held that the applicant’s detention as a preventive measure should therefore remain in place. The defence appealed, arguing that the decision contained no reasons for the applicant’s continued detention.', '75. The jury was formed and the trial commenced on 3 November 2003.', '76. On 5 November the prosecution asked that the hearing be adjourned to 11 November 2003 in order to produce evidence. The request was granted.', '77. On 11 November the hearing was postponed to 18 November 2003 as the prosecution witnesses had failed to appear.', '78. On 12 November 2003 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 29 September 2003 and upheld that decision. It noted the seriousness of the charges against the applicant and stated that the reasons for the initial decision to remand the applicant in custody as a preventive measure were still valid and that there had been no violations of the rules of criminal procedure.', '79. On 18 November 2003 the examination of the case was adjourned to 25 November 2003 as the applicant had not been transported to court on account of quarantine in his detention facility.', '80. On 25 November 2003 the court adjourned the hearing until the end of the quarantine period and the applicant’s recovery.', '81. On 26 November 2003, as the defence later learned from the materials of the case file, the President of the Moscow City Court assigned the case to judge K. The materials of the case file contain the following resolution by the President: “To M.A. K., [I] [a]sk [you] to take the case over for examination”.', '82. The list of jurors of the Moscow City Court for 2004 was approved by the Mayor of Moscow on 4 December 2003 and later sent to the court.', '83. According to the applicant, the quarantine ended on 5 December 2003. The defence filed numerous requests with the presiding judge, the President of the court and various authorities, seeking to have hearings in the case resumed.', '84. On 16 February 2004 the defence was notified that the hearing would take place on 15 March 2004 and that the case had been assigned to judge K. The defence lodged a number of requests, seeking information on the grounds and reasons for the replacement of the presiding judge, including a request of 15 March 2004 addressed to the President of the Moscow City Court. They were all left unanswered.', '85. On 24 February 2004 judge K. examined a request by the prosecution for extension of the term of the applicant’s detention. She also examined an application for the applicant’s release, supported by an application from representatives of various non-governmental organisations, the State Duma and the Academy of Science. The judge noted that the sixmonth period of the applicant’s detention in custody, from the moment of the receipt of the case by the court, would expire on 25 February 2004. Under Article 255 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in cases concerning grave and particularly grave offences a court could prolong the terms of detention in custody for not more than three months each time. In the circumstances, the judge concluded that the period of the applicant’s detention should be extended until 25 May 2004. The defence appealed against this decision, arguing that it contained no reasons to justify the extension of the applicant’s detention.', '86. The new presiding judge K. held a hearing on 15 March 2004 at which she carried out the selection of a new jury from thirty-one candidate jurors.', '87. The request by the defence to have the case examined by the initial composition of the jury, which, they alleged, had been unlawfully dismissed, was rejected. So too was a motion challenging the presiding judge who, according to the defence, was conducting the trial in a way favourable to the prosecution.', '88. One of the questions put to the candidate jurors by the presiding judge was whether there were among them heads or deputy heads of bodies of the representative or executive authorities, deputies, servicemen, clergymen, judges, prosecutors, investigators, advocates, notaries and persons serving in the Ministry of Interior or the FSB. Four persons responded that they had served in the FSB. They were dismissed at the request of the defence. The defence asked the candidate jurors fourteen questions, some of which were addressed to all of them, for example, questions about their place of work, knowledge of foreign languages and Internet use. The defence challenged some of the candidate jurors twice without giving reasons. A candidate juror, Mr Y., answered that he worked as a deputy head of a foreign company representative office and spoke Polish.', '89. On the same day the individuals who were selected to serve on the jury took the oath.', '90. The hearing was adjourned until 17 March 2004 in order for the applicant to have additional time to examine the case file, as requested by him. On the latter date the defence unsuccessfully challenged the presiding judge.', '91. On 22 March 2004 the prosecution witnesses, notably T., V., G. and L., were examined before the jury.', '92. At a hearing on 29 March 2004 the presiding judge granted the motion by the defence to have those publications, which, according to the applicant, had been the only source for the information transmitted to Alternative Futures, presented to the jury. The publications were presented.', '93. The expert reports of 18 July 2002 and 17 August 2000 were then read out before the jury on a motion by the defence.', '94. It follows from the records of the hearing that the defence then requested the examination of N. as one of the experts who had prepared the report of 17 August 2000. The representatives of the prosecution objected, stating that it was impossible to understand from the report which part of the examination had been carried out by a particular expert; that in 2000 and 2002 the experts had examined different materials; and that the 2000 report had lacked the “research part”, as a result of which a new expert examination – conducted in compliance with the legal requirements – had been commissioned at the stage of the additional investigation in 2002. The prosecution requested that the report of 17 August 2000, which had been conducted in breach of the law on criminal procedure, be declared inadmissible evidence. The presiding judge granted the motion by the defence to examine N. as an expert. Since his examination was connected with the issue of admissibility of evidence the judge ordered N.’s examination in the jury’s absence and adjourned the decision on the admissibility of evidence until after N.’s examination. After hearing N. the judge declared the expert report of 17 August 2000 inadmissible evidence on the ground that the expert examination had been carried out with breaches of the law on criminal procedure, notably Article 191 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure, in force at the material time. Thus, the report did not state what examination had been carried out by a particular expert, what facts a particular expert had established and what conclusions he or she had reached. The judge rejected the motion by the defence to have N. examined before the jury since “the expert’s examination [was] connected with the issue of admissibility of evidence”. Upon the jury’s return to the court room they were told that the expert report of 17 August 2000 had been declared inadmissible evidence and that the parties could not therefore refer to it.', '95. On 30 March 2004 more publications, from which, the applicant alleged, he had obtained information for Alternative Futures, were presented to the jury. The defence asked to examine the expert report of 30 June 2000 before the jury. The presiding judge declared the report inadmissible evidence for the same reasons as the report of 17 August 2000. It follows from the records of the hearing that the defence asked to examine as a witness K., one of the experts who had prepared the report of 30 June 2000 and who came to the court at the request of the defence. The defence asked to examine him on issues unrelated to the expert examination in question. The prosecution objected, arguing that at the preliminary investigation K. had carried out the expert examination and had later been examined as an expert in the trial before Kaluga Regional Court. This prevented him from being examined as a witness in the case. K. had erroneously been put on the list of witnesses in the bill of indictment. The prosecution requested that the motion by the defence be rejected. The presiding judge rejected the motion to examine K. on the ground that K.’s procedural status as an expert who had carried out the examination and given statements at the earlier hearing excluded the possibility of examining him as a witness.', '96. The applicant asked that the expert assessment report of 18 July 2002 be declared inadmissible evidence since, he claimed, it had the same procedural defects as the above two expert reports, given that it also lacked a “research” section. The judge rejected the motion. The applicant argued before the jury that not all publications from which he had obtained the information transmitted to Alternative Futures had been examined by the experts who prepared the report of 18 July 2002.', '97. The judge rejected a request by the defence to examine before the jury an opinion obtained by the defence from the Russian aircraft construction corporation MiG, which allegedly could help the defence to prove that the materials concerning the MiG-29 aircraft (specific features of the construction and military potential of the MiG-29 SMT aircraft and the military potential of the modernised MiG-29) did not contain State secrets.', '98. The applicant consistently claimed that in preparing the materials for Alternative Futures he had only used information from publicly available sources – Russian and foreign publications – which were listed in his statements to the investigating authority and the court. According to the Director of the Institute of the USA and Canada, who was examined at the trial, the applicant did not have admission or access to information containing State secrets during his work at the Institute. As a researcher at the institute, the applicant had to be aware of all publicly available information concerning the armament policies of the USA and Russia. The institute did not have at its disposal information containing State secrets. According to the applicant, the prosecution did not establish any closed source from which he had allegedly obtained classified information.', '99. On 30 and 31 March 2004 the defence again challenged presiding judge K., since they considered that she had violated the principle of equality of arms. She dismissed the requests.', '100. On 1 April 2004 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 24 February 2004 extending his pre-trial detention, stating that he could not be released because the trial was underway.', '101. The following four questions were put to the jury by the presiding judge:', 'Question 1. Has it been shown that, from 19 February to June 1998, meetings occurred in Birmingham and London (Great Britain) at which a cooperation agreement was concluded with S. Kidd, a representative of US military intelligence, on gathering information about the Russian Federation, for subsequent transfer to the above-mentioned individual; in accordance with instructions from S. Kidd, the following information was collected in the Institute for the USA and Canada in Moscow and Obninsk (Kaluga oblast), stored and handed over on various dates:', '(a) from 24 June to 15 September 1998 information on the topic “the structure and state of the domestic missile early warning system”, specifically ... was collected and stored, and subsequently handed over to S. Kidd, representative of US military intelligence, at hotel A in Budapest (Hungary) from 15 to 17 September 1998;', '(b) from 22 October 1998 to 15 January 1999 information on the topic “the RF Ministry of Defence’s failure to implement in full plans to set up permanent readiness units in 1998”, specifically ... was collected and stored, and subsequently handed over to Locke and Kidd, representatives of US military intelligence, at hotel B in Budapest (Hungary) from 15 to 18 January 1999;', '(c) from 18 January to 27 March 1999 information on the topic “options for the structure of the RF’s strategic nuclear forces for the period up to 2007”, specifically ... was collected and stored, and subsequently handed over to S.

Locke, representative of US military intelligence, at hotel D in Birmingham (Great Britain) from 20 to 23 May 1999;', '(e) from 23 May to 14 July 1999 information on the topic “possible directions in the development of domestic air-to-air directed missiles”, specifically ...was collected and stored, and was handed over to N. Locke, representative of US military intelligence, at hotel E in Brussels (Belgium) from 14 to 18 July 1999 ;', 'Question 2. If an affirmative answer has been given to the first question, then has it been shown that the actions set out in it were committed by Sutyagin and that he received financial compensation for them?', 'Question 3. If affirmative answers have been given to Questions 1 and 2, then is Sutyagin guilty of having committed the above-mentioned actions?', 'Question 4. If an affirmative answer has been given to Question 3, then does Sutyagin deserve leniency?', '102. The applicant’s lawyers sought to have other questions put to the jury, in particular a question as to whether the collected and transmitted information contained State secrets and had been obtained from closed sources. Their motion was refused by the presiding judge.', '103. On 5 April 2004 the jury unanimously found the applicant guilty, having answered the first three questions put to them in the affirmative and the fourth question in the negative.', '104. On 7 April 2004 the judgment was delivered. It stated as follows:', '“The court ..., having examined in a closed hearing a criminal case on the charges against Sutyagin Igor Vyacheslavovich of having committed an offence provided for by Article 275 of RF CC [Criminal Code]', 'ESTABLISHED:', 'By the jury verdict of 5 April 2004 that Sutyagin is found guilty in that from 19 February to June 1998 in the cities of Birmingham and London (Great Britain) [he] met with Sh. Kidd, representative of US military intelligence, and gave his consent for co-operation for collection of data about the Russian Federation with its subsequent transfer to the said person. On Sh. Kidd’s instructions Sutyagin collected, stored and transferred, at different times, at the RAN [Russian Academy of Science] Institute for the USA and Canada in Moscow and Obninsk, Kaluga Region, the following data:', '(a) from 24 June to 15 September 1998, information on the topic “the structure and state of the domestic missile early warning system”, specifically ... , was collected and stored, and subsequently handed over to Sh.

[hotel E], Brussels (Belgium) from 14 to 18 July 1999.', 'On the basis of circumstances as established by the guilty verdict the court determines that the accused Sutyagin’s acts were high treason in the form of espionage under Article 275 of the RF CC, specifically transmission, collection and storage with a view to transmission to foreign state representatives, of information constituting State secrets, to be used to damage the RF’s national security committed by a RF citizen.', 'It has been established that the aforementioned information, which Sutyagin collected and stored with a view to transmission, and transmitted to US military intelligence representatives, constitutes State secrets.', 'Furthermore, the mechanism of the espionage activities committed by him is characterised by a mercenary motive ...

The court found no circumstances extenuating or aggravating Sutyagin’s punishment.', 'and the fact that the RF’s defence and security was damaged as a result of the transmission by Sutyagin of information about Russia constituting State secrets to foreign state representatives, the court concludes that the culprit’s correction and reformation are only possible in the conditions of his isolation from society by serving his sentence in a strict-regime correctional colony.', 'On the basis of the aforesaid and being governed by Articles 343, 348, 350 paragraph 3 and 351 of the RF CCP, the court', 'SENTENCED:', 'Sutyagin Igor Vyacheslavovich to be convicted of an offence provided for by Article 275 of the RF CC and to be punished by way of deprivation of liberty for 15 years, to be served in a strict-regime correctional colony.', 'I.V. Sutyagin’s sentence is to be calculated from 29 October 1999.', '...”', '105. The applicant appealed against the judgment. In particular, he complained that the replacement of Judge Sh. and the original jury composition by assigning judge K. to the case had been unlawful; that juror Y. should not have sat in his trial as he had been included in the list of jurors of the Moscow Circuit Military Court; and that the list of jurors of the Moscow City Court had not been published. The applicant further complained that the questions to the jury had been formulated in breach of the domestic law. The presiding judge had dismissed his request to put to the jury questions as to whether the information collected, stored and transmitted by him had constituted State secrets and had been received from closed sources. No questions had been put to the jury as to whether he had had intent to damage national security, whether the representatives of Alternative Futures had belonged to foreign intelligence or whether he had transmitted information which had previously been published in open sources. Nor was the latter question examined in the judgment. The applicant further argued that the trial court had had no grounds to declare the exculpatory expert reports of 30 June and August 2000 inadmissible evidence, to reject his request for examination of N. and K. as witnesses and simultaneously to refuse to declare the inculpatory expert report of 18 July 2002, which had the same procedural flaw as the former two reports, inadmissible evidence. In his appeal the applicant relied on Articles 6, 7 and 10 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.', '106. In May 2004 the general list of jurors for the Moscow Circuit Military Court was published with Y.’s name on it.', '107. On 17 August 2004 the Supreme Court delivered a final decision in the case. It rejected the appeal and upheld the judgment, having succinctly stated that there had been no violations of the RF Code of Criminal Procedure on the part of the trial court, in particular in its reasoned refusal to examine experts as witnesses and to admit their reports in evidence, as well as in its formulation of questions to the jury. The Supreme Court stated that the principle of immutability of a court composition had not been violated in the case, which had been examined in compliance with the requirements of Article 242 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It noted that Y. had been included in the approved list of jurors of Moscow. It held that the court’s finding of the applicant’s guilt had been based on the jury’s lawful verdict and that the applicant’s acts had been legally characterised in accordance with the factual circumstances established by the jury’s verdict. The applicant’s arguments concerning the failure to prove his guilt could not be taken into consideration as the judgment delivered as a result of the jury trial could not be appealed against and quashed on those grounds, of which the applicant had been aware.', '108. The general list of jurors of the Moscow City Court (for the North administrative circuit of Moscow) was published on 18 August 2004. It included Mr Y. According to the applicant, thereafter the defence obtained information that juror Mr Y. had allegedly worked for the FSB.', '109. In July 2010, after signing a clemency petition to the President of the Russian Federation in which the applicant acknowledged his guilt in the crime of which he was convicted, he was released as part of an exchange of prisoners between Russia and the United States. He was taken to Britain, where he currently resides. The applicant claims that he was coerced into acknowledging his guilt by the circumstances surrounding the exchange and that he in fact denies his guilt.', '110. For the domestic law regulating detention during criminal proceedings see Bykov v. Russia [GC], no. 4378/02, §§ 4955, ECHR 2009... in respect of the period until 1 July 2002, and Veliyev v. Russia, no. 24202/05, §§ 107-113, 24 June 2010 in respect of the period since 1 July 2002.', '111. The Constitution of the Russian Federation guarantees the right to have one’s case examined in a court and by a judge whose jurisdiction to examine the case is established by law (Article 47). According to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 16 March 1998, such a law (laws) must contain criteria which would predetermine in which court this or that civil or criminal case falls to be examined. This would allow the court (judge), parties and other participants in the proceedings to avoid uncertainty in this question. Such uncertainty would have otherwise to be obviated by way of an enforcement decision, that is, the discretionary power of an enforcement body or official. In the latter case jurisdiction would not be determined on the basis of law.', '112. The Constitution provides that judges are independent and that they are subordinate only to the Constitution and the federal law (Article 120).', '113. The Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation in force since 1 July 2002 (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, the “CCrP”), provides as follows:', '“1. The case must be examined by one and the same judge or by a court bench in one and the same composition.', '2. If one of the judges is no longer able to take part in the hearing he must be replaced by another judge, and the court hearing must restart from the beginning.”', '114. Law no. 3132-I of 26 June 1992 “On the Status of Judges in the Russian Federation” provides:', '1. The Court President, at the same time as exercising judicial powers in the respective court and the procedural powers conferred on court presidents by Federal Constitutional Laws and Federal Laws, carries out the following functions:', '(1) organises the court’s work;', '...', '(3) distributes duties between the President’s deputies and, in accordance with the procedure provided for by Federal Law, between the judges; ...', '115. The instruction on courts’ internal document management, in force at the material time, provided that the court President was responsible for the court’s clerical and office management (Instruction no. 169 of the Courts Administration Office at the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation of 28 December 1999).', '116. As a matter of common practice, a court President distributed cases lodged with a court between the judges of that court.', '117. Under paragraph 19 of Resolution no. 23 of the Supreme Court Plenum of 22 November 2005, setting out practice directions on the application of the Code, the replacement of a presiding judge in jury trials invalidates the trial which has taken place up to that moment and calls for the replacement of a jury because, under Article 328 of the Code, the obligation to form a jury is imposed on the presiding judge.', '118. Article 30 of the CCrP reads as follows:', '“...', '2. In courts of first instance, criminal cases shall be examined by the following compositions:', '...', '(2) At the defendant’s request, the judge of a federal court and a jury of twelve persons shall examine cases concerning the crimes set out in Article 31 § 3 of this Code....”', 'Article 31 § 3 of the Code includes, inter alia, a crime punishable under Article 275 of the Criminal Code.', '119. A secretary or a judge assistant selects candidate jurors from the court’s annual list of jurors by drawing them at random (Article 326 of the Code).', '120. The procedure for drawing up the list of jurors of Moscow for 2004 was regulated by the RSFSR Law on the Judicial System of 8 July 1981, as amended on 16 July 2003, and the Moscow Mayor’s instruction of 31 October 2003. The initial lists of jurors were drawn up by the Moscow district councils, informing the public and providing the public with access to the lists with a view to enabling them to request their inclusion or exclusion from the lists. After necessary corrections the lists were then amalgamated by the prefectures of the Moscow administrative circuits and further served as the basis for drawing up separate lists of jurors for the Moscow City Court and the Moscow Circuit Military Court by the Moscow Administration’s Territorial Organs Department. The lists were to be approved by the Moscow mayor and forwarded to those courts. 30 November 2003 was fixed as a time-limit for submitting the 2004 jurors’ lists, approved by the Mayor, to the Moscow City Court and the Moscow Circuit Military Court. The lists were to be published. Under paragraph 14 of Recommendations of the RF Minister of Justice of 30 September 1993 concerning the procedure for drawing up lists of jurors, it was desirable to publish general and reserve lists of jurors in the regional press not later than two weeks before sending them to the relevant court. The publication had to explain to citizens their rights to request regional councils to include or exclude them from those lists.', '121. One and the same person cannot sit as a juror more than once a year (Article 326 of the CCrP and section 85 of the Judicial System Act).', '122. Parties to proceedings can challenge candidate jurors with or without reasons, twice in the latter case (Article 327 of the CCrP). The parties can ask them questions for the purpose of uncovering circumstances which would prevent them from sitting in a case. The presiding judge explains to candidate jurors their duty to answer questions put to them truthfully (Article 328 of the Code).', '123. Under Article 330 of the Code, before the jurors take the oath it is open to the parties to proceedings to plead that the jury as a whole might be unable to deliver an objective verdict in view of the specific features of a case. After hearing the parties the presiding judge delivers a decision. If the request is found to be justified the jury will be dismissed.', '124. Each juror takes an oath prior to the examination of a case. The oath reads as follows (Article 332 of the Code):', '“In assuming the responsible duties of a juror, I solemnly swear to fulfil them honestly and impartially, to take into consideration all the evidence examined in court, both which incriminates the defendant and which exonerates him or her, to decide the criminal case on the basis of my inner conviction and conscience, not acquitting the guilty and not convicting the innocent, as befits a free citizen and fair person.”', 'The presiding judge reads the text of the oath, after which each juror replies when called by the judge: “I swear.”', '125. Under Articles 334 § 1 and 339 of the CCrP, jurors take decisions on the following questions which are put to them after examining the evidence and hearing the parties:', '– has it been proven that the acts of which the culprit is accused were committed;', '– has it been proven that those acts were committed by the culprit;', '– is the culprit guilty of committing those acts?', 'Jurors can also be asked particular questions about, inter alia, circumstances which may have an impact on the issues of guilt or may entail the culprit’s exemption from liability. No questions requiring legal assessment can be put to jurors.', 'If the culprit is found guilty the jurors also state whether the culprit deserves leniency.', 'The questions to the jury are formulated in writing by the presiding judge. The parties can make their observations on the questions and propose new questions (Article 338 of the CCrP).', '126. Questions other than those to be decided by jurors, as stated above, are decided by the presiding judge alone without jurors’ participation (Article 334 § 2 of the CCrP).', '127. Issues of inadmissibility of evidence are examined without jurors’ participation. After hearing the parties the presiding judge takes a decision to exclude evidence which he or she found inadmissible (Article 335 §§ 5 and 6 of the CCrP).', '128. Before the jury retires to the deliberation room the presiding judge gives directions (Article 340 of the CCrP). The presiding judge sums up the charges; informs them about the applicable criminal law provisions; sums up the evidence examined at the trial and the positions of the prosecution and the defence; and explains the rules of assessment of evidence in their entirety, the principle of presumption of innocence, the rule of interpreting insoluble doubts in favour of the accused, the rule that their verdict must only be based on evidence examined at the trial and that no evidence has predetermined force for them. The presiding judge further brings jurors’ attention to the fact that the culprit’s refusal to give statements at the trial should not be interpreted as evidence of guilt. The presiding judge explains the rules of deliberations and voting. The jurors are reminded of the oath taken by them.', '129. No one except the jurors may be present in the deliberation room (Article 341 of the CCrP). The questions put to the jurors are answered by way of affirmation or negation, to be supplemented by a word or a phrase to make the meaning of the answer precise (Article 343 § 7 of the CCrP).', '130. If the jury delivers a guilty verdict the trial continues without the jurors to examine, inter alia, circumstances relevant to the legal characterisation of the acts committed by the culprit, sentencing and determination of a civil claim. The parties’ submissions may concern any legal issues to be resolved in a judgment (Articles 346-347 of the CCrP) which will be delivered by the presiding judge on the basis of the jury’s verdict. The presiding judge may deviate from the guilty verdict and acquit the culprit if he or she finds that the acts committed by the culprit do not contain the elements of a crime. The presiding judge may dissolve the jury and order a fresh examination of the case by a new composition of the court if he or she finds that the event of a crime or the culprit’s participation in a crime have not been established and that the guilty verdict has therefore been delivered in respect of an innocent person and there are sufficient grounds for his or her acquittal (Article 348 of the CCrP). The jury’s opinion that the culprit deserves leniency is binding on the presiding judge (Article 349 of the CCrP).', '131. A higher court which examines the case on appeal may not quash or change a judgment delivered as a result of a jury trial on the ground of inconsistency between the conclusions reached by the trial court in its judgment and the facts established by that court. Permissible grounds for quashing or changing a judgment in such a case are violation of the procedural law, misapplication of criminal law, and unfairness of the sentence imposed (Article 379 of the CCrP).', '132. Article 29 § 4 of the Constitution provides:', '“Everyone has the right to freely search, obtain, impart, generate and disseminate information by all lawful means. The list of information constituting State secrets shall be defined by a federal law.”', 'The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation held that this provision was motivated by the need to defend the sovereignty of Russia and to ensure its defence and security, and is in accord with Article 55 § 3 of the Constitution, which permits restrictions of human rights and freedoms and, therefore, the right to information for the above-mentioned purposes. It follows that the legislature may establish a list of information which can be classified as State secrets and regulate its declassification and protection, as well as admission and access to such information. Under section 1 of the State Secrets Act, its provisions are binding within and outside the territory of the Russian Federation for, inter alia, nationals of the Russian Federation who have accepted obligations or are obliged in view of their status to enforce the requirements of the Russian legislation on State secrets. The duty to observe the legislation on State secrets flows from the general legal duty to observe the Constitution and the laws (Article 15 § 2 of the Constitution). Thus, section 1 of the State Secrets Act is in conformity with the Constitution (the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 27 March 1996).', '133. The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation of 1996 provides:', '“High treason, i.e. espionage, disclosure of state secrets or assistance otherwise provided to a foreign state, a foreign organisation or their representatives for their subversive activities undermining the external security of the Russian Federation, committed by a Russian national, shall be punishable by 12 to 20 years’ imprisonment with or without confiscation of property.”', '134. Section 5 of the “Official Secrets Act” (RF Law no. 5485-1) of 21 July 1993, as amended on 6 October 1997, provided:', '“The following information shall be classified as State secrets:', '(1) information in the military sphere:', 'On the content of strategic and operational plans, documents of the combat department on the preparation and conduct of operations, and on the strategic, operational and mobilisation deployment of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, and of other troops, military formations and units as envisaged in the Federal “Defence Act”, on their combat and mobilisation readiness, on the creation and use of mobilisation resources;', 'On plans to develop the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, other troops of the Russian Federation, on guidelines on the development of armaments and military hardware, on the content and results of special programmes, research and experimental design projects on the creation and modernisation of models of armaments and military hardware;', 'On the development, technology, production, output volume, storage and recycling of nuclear munitions, their components, fissionable materials used in nuclear munitions, on the technical systems and (or) methods for protecting nuclear munitions from unauthorised use, and also on nuclear power units and special physical installations for defence purposes;', 'On the tactical-technical specifications and potential for combat use of models of armaments and military hardware, on the properties, formulae or production technology of new forms of rocket fuel or explosives for military use;', 'On the disposition, names, degree of readiness, defence capabilities of operational and especially important facilities, their designs, construction and exploitation, and also on the assignment of land, underground areas and bodies of water for these facilities;', 'On the disposition, actual names, organisational structure, weapons, and numerical strength of troops and the status of their combat support systems, and also on militarypolitical and (or) operational conditions;', '...”', '135. Under section 4 of the Official Secrets Act, the RF President approves, upon the Government’s submission, the list of information constituting State secrets. Presidential Decree no. 1203 of 30 November 1995 defined the list of military information classified as State secrets as follows:', '1. Information revealing strategic plans for the use of troops, operational plans, battle management documents, documents on bringing troops to various levels of combat readiness.', '2. Information on the strategic and operational deployment of troops.', '3. Information on construction plans, development, numerical strength, effective combat strength or quantity of troops, their combat readiness, and also on militarypolitical and (or) operational conditions.', '4.

FINLAND,3,Violation of Art. 6-1+6-3-d;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,Nicolas Bratza,"['6. On 7 August 2000 a mother contacted the police on account of a suspicion that her children, a girl born in 1991 and a boy born in 1993, had been sexually abused by a neighbour, the applicant. On 10 August and 2 September 2000 the siblings were interviewed by a police officer experienced in investigating sexual abuse of children. The applicant was also suspected of having abused two other girls, both friends of the siblings and born in 1991. The girls were interviewed by the police on 11 August and 18 August respectively and again on 3 September 2000. All the interviews were recorded on videotape.', '7. At the time of the first interviews, i.e. on the morning of 10 August 2000, the applicant had not been informed of the suspicions against him and no defence counsel had yet been appointed for him. Neither the applicant nor his counsel was present during the later interviews. The siblings and one of the other girls underwent a psychological examination in the Family Advice Centre with a view to assessing whether their testimonies during the pre-trial investigation were reliable.', '8. Meanwhile, on the afternoon of 10 August 2000 the applicant was questioned by the police. Before the questioning he was notified of the suspicions against him and it appears that he did not exercise his right to have his counsel present. The applicant was in detention from that day until 7 September 2000 when travel restrictions were imposed on him. He was accompanied by counsel when questioned again on 17, 18, 19 and 23 August and 6 September 2000. He was questioned alone on 12 January 2001.', ""9. Prior to the close of the pre-trial investigation, in his closing statement the applicant requested, on 7 December 2000, having watched the above-mentioned video recordings, that the siblings be questioned again and that his questions be put to them about how and where they had learnt about the sexual things they had mentioned to him and, in particular, if they had been subjected to sexual acts at a place other than the applicant's home. His request was however refused on 21 January 2001. According to the Government, this was because their mother had refused to allow any further questioning of the children, now aged 7 and 9."", '10. The applicant was charged before the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) with having sexually abused the four children during the summer of 2000. He denied the charges. He however admitted having tapped two of the girls on their buttocks.', '11. In February 2001 the District Court held an oral hearing during which the applicant, the parents of the siblings and the mothers of the other two girls gave evidence. The children were not heard in person. The videotaped interviews with the children were shown during the hearing. The court also heard evidence from a psychologist on the reliability of the statements of the siblings and of one of the other girls. The applicant did not request that the children give evidence at the hearing.', ""12. The mother of the siblings testified that they had told her about the improper touching in the same manner as they had done on the videotape. When the touching had become known, on 1 August 2000, her son had reacted intensely by crying and slamming doors. He had also suffered from sleeping problems and her daughter had suffered from headaches. Neither of these ailments had occurred before. According to two written opinions of the Family Advice Centre, the siblings' accounts of the events were considered credible given their detailed and precise nature. There was nothing to suggest that they were the siblings' own inventions. The mothers of the two other girls testified that they had told them about the improper touching in the same manner as they had done on the videotape."", ""13. In its judgment of 28 February 2001 the District Court observed that the evidence was mainly of an indirect nature and that the sole direct evidence was the testimony of a psychologist, who had testified as to the children's credibility."", '14. The court noted that the applicant had argued that the main evidence in the case was flawed due to the fact that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to the children and that the authorities had put leading questions to them. He had also argued that there were shortcomings insofar as the psychological examinations carried out by the Family Advice Centre were concerned. The court however found no such flaws as would significantly have reduced the evidentiary value of the examinations.', ""15. The court then stated that the case turned on an assessment of the credibility of the children's statements. While it was true that the pre-trial statements' probative value was weakened by the fact that the applicant had not been able to put questions to the children, these statements were nonetheless reliable as the children had provided details about the events and as their young age gave no reason to believe that they would have sought to lie about the events. Although some leading questions may have been put to the children, there was nothing to suggest that they would have sought to please the interviewer and adapted their replies accordingly. This being so, the court found that questioning the children in court would not have added anything significant to the case. Having regard to their best interests, the questioning of children of such a young age before a court could not be considered justifiable. The court found that the testimonies of the psychologist and the parents supported the credibility of the children's accounts."", ""16. It convicted the applicant of having sexually abused the four children and sentenced him to two years and three months' imprisonment."", '17. The applicant appealed, alleging inter alia a breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention in that he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to the children.', ""18. The Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten) held an oral hearing and was presented with the same evidence as had been before the District Court. The parties agreed that it was in the best interests of the children that they should not be heard before the court. The applicant however rejected the admission of the children's pre-trial statements as evidence since he had not been afforded an opportunity to put questions to them."", ""19. In its judgment of 6 November 2001 the Court of Appeal noted that the children had been interviewed twice during the pre-trial investigation and all but one of the girls had been examined in the Family Advice Centre using tests and interviews. As the questioning of the children, now aged 8 to 10, before the court would probably have caused them suffering, it was possible to use in evidence their pre-trial statements, although the applicant's minimum rights under, inter alia, Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention would thereby be violated. In evaluating the weight to be attached to the children's statements, the court found that it had to take into account the discrepancies pointed out by the applicant and the fact that the police had not put to the children the questions proposed by him in his pre-trial closing statement."", ""20. In its assessment of the evidence the appellate court reached the same conclusions as the lower court and upheld the conviction. It however reduced the sentence to one year and eight months' imprisonment, which it considered fair, having regard to the fact that the applicant had not forced the children into doing anything, the relevant sentencing practice and the fact that the applicant had no previous convictions."", '21. The applicant requested leave to appeal, maintaining, inter alia, that there had been a breach of Article 6 § 3 (d) of the Convention. He did not submit any request for the children to be heard.', '22. On 28 February 2002 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) refused leave to appeal.', '23. The Decree on Criminal Investigations and Coercive Measures (asetus esitutkinnasta ja pakkokeinoista, förordning om förundersökning och tvångsmedel; Act no. 575/1988) provides that when questioned during a pre-trial investigation the child must be treated with due respect having regard to his or her age and level of development. Where possible, the interview should be carried out by a police officer acquainted with that task. If need be, a doctor or an expert must be consulted before the interview (section 11).', '24. The Criminal Investigations Act (esitutkintalaki, förundersökningslagen; Act no. 449/1987) provides that questioning and other investigation measures requested by a party must be carried out, if that party shows that there is a possibility that these measures could have an effect on the case, provided that the expenses so incurred are not disproportionate to the nature of the case (section 12). The competence to decide on investigation measures requested by a party lies with the head of investigation during the pre-trial investigation and with the public prosecutor after the case has been transferred to him or her (section 15(3), Act no. 692/1997). A pre-trial investigation has to be carried out in such a manner that no one is placed under suspicion without due cause and no one is unnecessarily subjected to harm or inconvenience. Nor must the rights of those concerned be infringed more than is necessary for the achievement of the purpose of the investigation (section 8).', '25. The investigator may permit a party and his counsel to be present during the questioning of another party or witness, provided this does not hinder the investigation of the offence (section 32(1), Act no. 692/1997). A party and his or her counsel may, with the permission of the investigator, put questions to the person being questioned in order to clear up the case. The investigator may decide that the questions are to be put through him or her. Also, the prosecutor may put questions to the person being questioned. A party and his or her counsel have the right to request the investigator to ask the person being questioned about matters necessary for the clearing up of the case at other times also (section 34, Act no. 692/1997).', '26. Before the closing of the criminal investigation, the parties must be afforded the opportunity to present to the criminal investigation authority their statement on the material gathered during the investigation, if this is conducive to hastening or facilitating the hearing of the case in court. The statement is to be appended to the investigation record (section 42).', '27. The Code of Judicial Procedure (oikeudenkäymiskaari, rättegångsbalken) lays down the applicable rules on receiving testimony.', '28. A statement in a pre-trial investigation record or another document may as a rule not be admitted as evidence in court. The court may exceptionally admit such a statement as evidence, if the witness in question cannot be questioned before the court (chapter 17, Article 11; Act no. 690/1997). A witness must give testimony orally before the court and must not refer to a written testimony. Oral evidence given during a pre-trial investigation may be read out when the witness in question is heard by the court only if he or she retracts in court an earlier statement or states that he or she is unable or unwilling to testify before the court (chapter 17, Article 32; Act no. 571/1948).', ""29. If a person called as a witness is less than 15 years of age, is mentally ill or mentally retarded, or his or her mental capacities have otherwise been impaired, the court shall, taking into consideration the circumstances, assess whether or not he or she may be heard as a witness (Chapter 17, Article 21). Although the hearing of evidence from children falls within the court's discretion, there has been a long-standing practice not to hear evidence in court from children under the age of ten."", '30. At the time of the proceedings in question, there were no legal provisions concerning the use as evidence of a video recording of a statement given by a child during the pre-trial investigation. There was however a practice to admit such recordings as evidence.', '31. The Code of Judicial Procedure was amended with effect from 1 October 2003 to the effect that the testimony of a person under 15 years of age, or a mentally disturbed person, recorded on audio or videotape during a pre-trial investigation may be used as evidence if the accused has been provided with an opportunity to have questions put to the person giving the testimony (chapter 17, Article 11(2); Act no. 360/2003). According to the explanatory report to the relevant Government Bill (no. 190/2002), this new provision places emphasis on both the idea that giving testimony before the court may be detrimental to inter alia a child and on the importance of respecting the rights of the defence.', '32. Chapter 17, Article 21 (as amended by Act no. 360/2003) of the Code of Judicial Procedure reads with effect from 1 October 2003 as follows:', '“(1) A person who has not attained the age of fifteen or whose mental capacities have been impaired, may be heard as a witness or for the purpose of obtaining evidence if the court finds it appropriate and:', '(i) if the hearing in person is of significant relevance for the establishment of the facts of the case; and', '(ii) the hearing is not likely to cause such suffering or other harm to the person to be heard as could be detrimental to the person concerned or his or her development.', '(2) Where necessary, the court shall designate a support person for the person to be heard, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 2 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Act no. 689/1997).', '(3) The person to be heard shall be questioned by the court, unless the court finds particular reason to entrust the questioning to the parties in accordance with the provisions of section 33. The parties shall be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the person to be heard through the intermediary of the court or, if the court finds it appropriate, directly to the person concerned. Where necessary, the hearing may take place on premises other than the court room.”', '33. In 2003, the Criminal Investigations Act was supplemented with a new section 39a (Act no. 645/2003) that entered into force on 1 January 2004 and reads as follows:', '“The questioning of a victim or a witness must be recorded on videotape, or by using other comparable audio-visual means of recording, if there is an intention to use the statement given in the interview as evidence in court proceedings, and where it is not possible to hear the victim or the witness in person, due to his or her young age or mental disturbance, without causing likely harm to him or her. The special requirements set by the level of maturity of the questioned person for the methods used, for the number of participating persons, and for other conditions, must be taken into account in the questioning. The person in charge of the criminal investigation may decide that authorities other than the investigators may, under the supervision of the investigator, put the questions to the person being interviewed. The suspect must be provided with an opportunity to put questions to the questioned person. On the request of the suspect, he or she may also put the questions through a legal counsel or other representative. However, the investigator may order that the questions be put through his or her intermediary.”']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],[],[],[],1

The applicant is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1944 and is currently serving a sentence of imprisonment in HMP Maidstone.', ""8. The applicant and his wife frequently travelled between various European countries. On 16 April 1997, the Chief Constable of South Wales authorised the installation of covert recording devices at the applicant's cottage and this was carried out on 23 April 1997. Authority for a further 28 days' surveillance was granted on 14 May 1997."", '9. Over 160 hours of tapes were obtained between the period of 25 April to 9 June 1997, on which latter date the applicant and his wife were arrested. The transcripts of the taped conversations made up the bulk of the case against the applicant.', ""10. At trial, the applicant's defence alleged that the recorded discussions, which occurred while he and the others concerned were under the influence of drugs, were “drug-crazed ramblings” and challenged their admissibility. A “voir dire” took place from 28 May to 1 June 1998, during which the defence made submissions concerning the procedure for authorisation of the surveillance and seeking inter alia to exclude irrelevant or prejudicial material under sections 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). By agreement, the transcript evidence was reduced from five to two files and an agreed schedule was adopted by all counsel concerning the occasions on which the conversations occurred at the same time as drug taking. In summing up to the jury at the conclusion of the trial, the judge directed their attention to the fact that the supposedly incriminating statements taped at the cottage were or may have been the product of the participants' intoxicated state and that it was for them to assess whether despite the drugs the defendants were expressing rational, genuine thoughts, real ideas, plans or arrangements."", ""11. On 15 June 1998, the applicant was convicted of charges inter alia of conspiracy to import controlled drugs and possession of controlled drugs in connection with importation of marijuana and cocaine from overseas. He was sentenced to a total of fifteen years' imprisonment. A confiscation order was imposed on him on 24 September 1998 in the sum of 50,169.18 pounds sterling (GBP)."", ""12. On 10 November 1999, a single judge of the Court of Appeal refused an extension of time to appeal against sentence and refused leave to appeal against conviction, noting that no satisfactory or sufficient reason had been given for the 11 month delay in lodging the application. The applicant's renewed application was refused by the Court of Appeal on 17 October 2000."", '13. At the relevant time, the Home Office Guidelines of 1984 on the use of equipment in police surveillance operations provided that only chief constables or assistant chief constables were entitled to give authority for the use of such devices. The Guidelines were available in the library of the House of Commons and were disclosed by the Home Office on application.', '14. In each case, the authorising officer had to satisfy himself that the following criteria were met: (a) the investigation concerned serious crime; (b) normal methods of investigation had been tried and failed, or had been, from the nature of things, unlikely to succeed if tried; c) there must have been good reason to think that the use of the equipment would be likely to lead to an arrest and a conviction, or where appropriate, to the prevention of acts of terrorism and d) the use of equipment was operationally feasible.', '15.

While she was married to M. she gave birth to seven children, Matthias, born in 1985, Sascha, born in 1986, Ramona, born in 1987, Alexander, born in 1988, Timo, born in 1990, and the twins Lisa-Marie and Nico, born in 1992. With her second husband, Mr Haase, she had five children. Anna-Karina was born in 1995, Sandra-Kristin in 1998, Maurice-Pascal in 2000 and Laura-Michelle on 11 December 2001. In December 2003 Mrs Haase gave birth to her last child.', ""9. In 1993 the relations between Mrs Haase and M. deteriorated. In April 1993 M. instituted divorce proceedings and requested to be afforded parental rights over the children. By a decision of 29 October 1993 the Münster District Court (Amtsgericht) granted parental rights over the three younger children, Timo, Lisa-Marie and Nico, to Mrs Haase and over the four older children to her first husband. The Münster Youth Office appealed against the decision, but withdrew the appeal in September 1994. In December 1993 Mrs Haase moved with the three children to live withher present husband. On 18 November 1994 the Münster District Court pronounced Mrs Haase's divorce from her first husband. The applicants have been married since December 1994."", ""10. In February 2001 Mrs Haase applied to the Münster Youth Office (Amt für Kinder, Jugendliche und Familien - KSD) for family aid. In order to be granted the aid, the applicants agreed to have their family situation assessed by a psychological expert. In May 2001 the Municipal Social Service instructed G. to draw up an expert report. The expert met Mrs Haase and three of her children on 26 September and 11, 15 17 and 22 October 2001 at the applicants' home."", ""11. Being of the opinion that the questions put to the children by the expert were irrelevant for the purposes of family aid and having regard to the expert's objection to Mrs Haase attending the meetings with the children's teachers, the applicants refused to co–operate with the expert any longer."", ""12. On 17 December 2001 the expert submitted his report to the Münster Youth Office. According to this report, the deficiencies in the children's care and home conditions risked jeopardising their development seriously. There was a damaging cycle of events in which the applicants were unreasonably harsh with their children on repeated occasions and had beaten them. The children needed to be in a secure long-term placement and any further contact between them and the applicants would have to be avoided."", ""13. On the same day the Youth Office applied to the Münster District Court for an interim injunction (einstweilige Anordnung) withdrawing the applicants' parental rights over the seven children, namely their four children, Anna-Karina, Sandra-Christine, Maurice-Pascal and Laura-Michelle, and three of the children born during Mrs Haase's first marriage, namely Timo, Nico and Lisa-Marie."", ""14. On that very day, i. e. on 17 December 2001, the Münster District Court, without hearing the parents or their children, issued the requested interim injunction. The applicants were ordered to hand over the children forthwith to the Münster Youth Office. The officer in charge of enforcing the decision was authorised to use force if necessary to collect the children. Relying notably on the findings of the expert report, the District Court found that the parents' inability to give the children satisfactory care and education and an abusive exercise of parental authority jeopardised the physical, mental and psychological well-being of all of the children to the extent that their separation from the applicants appeared to be the only possible solution to protect them. The District Court referred to the relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Articles 1666 and 1666a - see paragraphs 53 and 54 below)."", ""15. By a decision of 18 December 2001 the Münster District Court supplemented its decision of 17 December 2001, prohibiting all access between the applicants and their children and the three children of the first marriage, Timo, Nico and Lisa-Marie. The whereabouts of the children were not to be communicated to the applicants. The District Court further prohibited all access between the four other children of the first marriage and Mrs Haase. She was also forbidden to come nearer than 500 metres to the four other children's residence or their schools. The District Court considered that the expert opinion was sufficient evidence to show that the separation of the parents from their children was necessary for the protection of the children. It had further been shown that the parents would object and try by all means to exert pressure upon the children. In order to avoid stress to the children, these measures were necessary in their best interests. The parents were urged to recognise their own deficiencies in respect of the care and the physical and psychological well-being of the children and take into account the clearly expressed need of the children for a change in their situation. The parents were invited to accept - at least for the time being - the measures taken and to contribute as far as possible to a calming of the general situation. This was only possible if the parents accepted the existing circumstances. The approach of the Youth Office met in part the expressly stated wishes of the children. The District Court concluded that the momentarily inevitable measures were proportionate to the urgent needs and the objective interests of all of the children."", '16. The children were taken on the same day about noon from three different schools, a nursery and from home and were placed in three foster homes. The seven-day-old youngest daughter, Laura-Michelle, was taken from the hospital and since that time has lived with a foster family.', ""17. In a letter of 18 December 2001 Dr W., a gynaecologist and head physician at the Johannesstift hospital in Münster, complained to the Münster District Court about the conduct of the authorities. He stated that, according to a telephone call of 17 December 2001, the six children of Mrs Haase as well as the newborn child in the hospital were to be removed from their mother without her knowledge. His patient was to be informed of the measure after her child had been taken from the nursery. Staff members were asked to take the child downstairs to the hospital's entrance and place it in a taxi."", 'He, as the head physician, and the medical hospital staff were surprised and shocked by the lack of warning and considered this conduct an affront to both Mrs Haase and the medical staff. Since 1992 Mrs Haase had been taken care of by the medical staff of the hospital. She had always given the impression of a being highly responsible person. She had come regularly to the preventive medical check-ups during her pregnancy. When she was accompanied by her children, the children behaved well, were friendly and well brought-up. There were no signs that they were in any way neglected or ill-treated.', '18. On 19 December 2001 the Youth Office informed the applicants that the children had been granted financial assistance in the sum of EUR 4,000 per month and that the parents had to contribute to these fees according to their financial means.', ""19. On 19 December 2001 the applicants appealed against the District Court's decision of 17 December 2001. They submitted that it was difficult to understand that in the context of family aid an expert opinion on the parents' ability to bring up their children had been drawn up and that they had not been informed about this opinion. The contested decision was unexpected and had been given at a moment when Mrs Haase was in a critical state of health, having given birth to her daughter a week before. They proposed witnesses who would confirm that the children had not been ill-treated, but were being brought up with love and understanding."", ""20. On 7 January 2002 the District Court held a hearing in the presence of the applicants assisted by a lawyer, Mrs Haase's first husband, representatives of the Münster Youth Office, a representative of a nursery and the expert G. The four witnesses of the applicants' own choosing were not heard and had to leave the courtroom."", ""The District Court instructed G. to proceed with the assessment of the remaining children and to finalise his report. It further appointed a new expert, H., to assess the applicants' capacity to bring up their children."", ""21. In the following interviews to prepare the assessment, the applicants asked the expert make a tape-recording of the interviews. Upon the expert's refusal to do so, the applicants were unwilling to continue to co-operate with him."", ""22. On 1 March 2002 the Hamm Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht) dismissed the applicants' appeal against the decision of 17 December 2001. It noted that the District Court had had regard to the report submitted by the Youth Office in connection with its request of 17 December 2001 to revoke the applicants' parental rights and to the expert opinion submitted by G. and that the District Court had considered that the impugned measure was justified. The expert had concluded that the basic needs of the children were not satisfied and that patterns of violence and permanent shortcomings of all kinds determined the children's day-to-day life. It was thus necessary to put an end to the risk to which the well-being of the children appeared to be exposed. A new expert opinion was to be expected by the middle of April 2002. The Court of Appeal found that the applicants' appeal could therefore be dismissed without holding a hearing. It was against the best interests of the children to take them out of the new environment in which they were building up new contacts, and to restore them to their former family, there being the risk that they would be taken to a new environment again shortly afterwards."", '23. On 8 March 2002 the applicants challenged the judge at the Münster District Court for bias.', ""24. On 4 April 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht), sitting as a bench of three judges, dismissed the applicants' request for an interim injunction."", ""The Federal Constitutional Court found that the applicants' constitutional complaint was neither inadmissible nor manifestly ill-founded. There were doubts in particular whether the courts had breached the applicants' right to a fair hearing and their right to respect for their family life. However, if the requested interim injunction was issued and if later the constitutional complaint had to be dismissed, the children would have to be taken from the applicants again and placed somewhere else. Having regard to the fact that the expert opinion was to be drawn up by mid-April 2002, the applicants should await the outcome of the main proceedings rather than have the children run the risk of being separated from their parents again later. It had to be assumed that the competent courts would conduct the main proceedings speedily having regard to the time element in these matters."", '25. On 10 April 2002 the Münster District Court dismissed the challenge to the judge and on 11 April 2002 another to the expert G.', '26. On 19 April 2002 the Münster District Court appointed a lawyer of the Münster Bar as curator ad litem (Verfahrenspfleger) to represent the children in the proceedings. It instructed the already appointed experts to submit the results of their investigations obtained so far and discharged them from any further expert activity. It appointed a new expert, Professor K., with a view to determining whether separating the children from the family was the only way of eliminating all danger for them.', '27. On 11 June 2002 Professor K. interviewed the applicants at their home. The interview lasted for six hours.', '28. On 21 June 2002 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, set aside the decisions of the Hamm Court of Appeal of 1 March 2002 and the Münster District Court of 17 December 2001 and referred the case back to the Münster District Court.', '29. In so far as the applicants complained about the decisions of the Münster District Court of 18 December 2001 and 7 January 2002, the Federal Constitutional Court declared the constitutional complaint inadmissible, since the applicants had failed to appeal against these decisions in accordance with section 19 of the Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings (Gesetz über die Angelegenheiten der freiwilligen Gerichtsbarkeit - FGG).', ""30. In so far as the constitutional complaint was admissible, the Federal Constitutional Court considered that, in accordance with the principles established in its case-law, the decisions of the Münster District Court and the Court of Appeal violated the applicants' family rights as guaranteed by Article 6 § 2, first sentence, of the basic Law, taken together with Article 6 § 3 (see “Relevant Domestic Law” below)."", ""There were serious doubts whether the courts had respected the importance of parental rights when giving their decisions and whether they had sufficiently taken into account the principle of proportionality. The question whether the evidence established that there was a risk of harm to the children had not been adequately considered. The District Court and the Court of Appeal had merely referred to the report of the Youth Office and the expert opinion. It did not appear from their decisions whether the expert's conclusions were based on reliable facts. An assessment of the applicants' submissions and considerations as to the possibility of ordering alternative measures, that would not have required the total revocation of parental rights, had not been made. Both the Court of Appeal and the District Court had failed to question the children or give the persons taking part in the proceedings the opportunity to be heard."", 'The measures which had been ordered had led to a drastic change in the lives of all the persons concerned and constituted a particularly serious interference with parental rights. However, no inquiries had been made, even by telephone, before the decision was taken. No reasons were given justifying the urgency of the matter.', 'The Family Court had no information on the possible effects of its decision, since the Youth Office and the expert had not commented on this issue. When examining the advantages and disadvantages of a family measure it was, however, relevant to consider that a separation of the children from their parents could jeopardise the development of the children, in particular in their first years of life.', 'The courts had also failed to clarify the contradiction between the findings in the expert opinion according to which the applicants were not ready to co-operate and the fact that Mrs Haase herself had asked to be granted child-rearing guidance. Furthermore there was no indication whether and to what extent the applicants had refused any contact or help offered by the Youth Office and it was not clear which “specific measures granting assistance” (einzelne Jugendhilfemaßnahmen) had been carried out in the past and why they were not successful.', 'The District Court should have first clarified the questions which arose and in the meantime could have taken alternative provisional measures if there was serious reason to believe that the welfare of the children was at risk.', ""31. According to the Federal Constitutional Court, it could not be excluded that, prior to the termination of the proceedings on the merits, which had to be dealt with as a priority, the District Court would issue another emergency decision. If so, the District Court was directed to examine carefully whether, in the light of the evidence obtained in the meantime, the continued separation of the children from the applicants was still justified and whether a repeated change of the children's place of residence would be in their best interests. If the District Court found that the present situation were to be maintained, it would have to consider whether the applicants should be granted a right of access, restricted or subject to conditions if necessary, and whether, in strict accordance with the principle of proportionality, the effects of such a decision should be limited in time."", '32. On 13 and 14 June 2002 four of the children, Timo, Nico, Anna-Karina and Lisa, were interviewed by the judge at the Münster District Court at the respective institutions where they were placed.', '33. According to the minutes of the District Court of 14 June 2002, Timo declared that he wished to return to his parents. He knew that there were certain reasons for placing him and his siblings in a different environment and confirmed that he had had too much work and strain at home. He sent his greetings to his brothers and sisters.', ""34. Nico, Anna-Karina and Lisa were interviewed in another foster home. Nico stated that he wished to know whether his parents and his “favourite” father (Lieblingsvater) were all right. He asked why he could not join his “favourite” father and whether somebody, his parents, his father or Maurice, could not come to see him. Lisa and Anna were with him and, according to them, were all right. Lisa had let him know that she too wished to return home. He stated that he was fine. Asked about his dreams, he said that he wished to go to his “favourite” father who was very nice, better than his stepfather. In reply to the question whether the judge should leave a message, he dictated the following letter on a dictaphone: “Dear Sascha (his favourite brother), (his favourite sisters Lisa and Ramona), dear Alex, what a pity that we don't see each other ... Sascha, Matthias, Ramona, Alex, his favourite father and his parents should come and visit him.” (Lieber Sascha (sein Lieblingsbruder), (Lieblingsschwestern Lisa und Ramona) lieber Alex, schade, dass wir uns nicht sehen ... Sascha, Matthias, Ramona, Alex, sein Lieblingsvater und seine Eltern sollten ihn besuchen kommen.)"", 'The following letter to his mother was recorded on a dictaphone: “Dear Mama, it is a pity that you do not come and best regards from Maurice and Sandra and Timo and Lisa. Lisa and Anna are all right. Yes and perhaps could you come to see us? Or is that not possible? “ (Liebe Mama! Schade, dass Du nicht kommst und liebe Grüsse von Maurice und Sandra und von Timo und von Anna und dass es Lisa und Anna gut geht. Ja und, vielleicht: könntet Ihr ja mal herkommen. Oder geht das nicht?)', '35. Anna-Karina stated that she felt fine. She was in the company of Lisa and Nico. Everybody said that she should tell her parents that everything was all right. She then added that she did not like it there.', '36. Lisa-Marie regretted that “poor Sandra” was all on her own without any member of the family. She would never bear this. She had to protect Nico and Anna. That was her duty as the elder sister. Nico was beaten very often in that place. She did not know the reason. In reply to a question, she stated that she was doing her homework thoroughly and that she was doing well in school. At home she had almost fallen asleep when doing her homework. When asked what message the judge could pass on, she said that she did not like the place and that she wished to return home. However, the staff did not believe her. She did not really like them. She did not want to go to another institution. She wished to go home. If she were not allowed to go home, she should at least be authorised to see everybody, her brothers and sisters, parents and stepfather. She missed taking Maurice to bed sometimes. Having been told that Nico wished to return to his “favourite” father, Lisa-Maria replied that, unlike Nico, she loved both her father and her stepfather.', '37. On 24 June 2002, as a consequence of the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Münster District Court set down for hearing on 1 July 2002 the request of the Münster Youth Office of 17 December 2001 to provisionally revoke the parental rights of the applicants over the children. It transferred to the Youth Office the right to decide where the children should live (Aufenthaltsbestimmungsrecht). The District Court found that the best interests of the children did not require a modification of the present situation before a decision on the merits was given. The District Court considered that its decision of 18 December 2001 prohibiting the applicants all access to the children was still relevant, since it had not been set aside by the Federal Constitutional Court.', ""38. On 1 July 2002 the Münster District Court held a hearing attended inter alia by the applicants assisted by a lawyer, Mrs Haase's first husband, the curator ad litem, a lawyer and representatives of the Münster Youth Office, the experts G. and Professor K. and the children's paediatrician Dr J. Professor K. gave details of her visit to the applicants' home on 11 January 2002 and resumed the content of the interview. Having studied the extensive files concerning the applicants and G.'s report, Professor K. could not confirm that the findings in the report were erroneous. She expressed the view that the children should not be returned to the applicants."", ""The children's paediatrician, Dr J., stated that all the children had been his patients since their birth except the daughter born in December 2001. Although he knew about the children's problems, in particular the difficulties with Nico, the applicants made a quite positive impression on him. It was a big family with many children. However, the applicants were loving parents who took great care of their children. There was no indication that the children had been beaten or otherwise abused."", 'The curator ad litem was opposed to contacts between the applicants and the children.', ""39. By an interim injunction of the same day, namely 1 July 2002, the Münster District Court provisionally transferred the custody (Personensorge) over the children to the Münster Youth Office and confirmed its decision of 18 December 2001. The expert was instructed to add to her report. She was requested to comment in particular on whether, in the best interest of the children, it was necessary to maintain the access prohibition, whether the children should be granted access to the older children of the first marriage, Matthias, Sascha, Ramona and Alexander, and if appropriate, in what way such contact could be arranged while keeping the children's place of residence secret."", '40. The District Court relied in particular on the findings of the expert G. that the separation of the applicants from their children had to be maintained. The applicants were incapable of bringing up their children because of their own basic and irreparable educational deficiencies and their abuse of parental authority. The children were emotionally disturbed and presented unusual patterns of behaviour. They had been beaten and locked up. Furthermore the four older children of the first marriage had approved the separation of the younger children from their mother and had refused any contact with her. The sole reason why Mrs Haase was intent on giving a positive impression of herself was to obtain support from others. However, any such support was foredoomed.', ""The District Court noted that Professor K. had not yet submitted her report. However, she had confirmed the findings of the expert G. and had stated at the hearing of 1 July 2002 that there was no alternative to separating the children from the applicants. According to her, Mrs Haase had never been willing to call her own behaviour into question. She satisfied her own needs only and refused to accept child-rearing guidance with a view to reducing her own deficiencies. In fact, she had admitted not having undergone therapy in 1994. Professor K. had found that G.'s expert opinion could not be objected to."", 'The District Court considered that the numerous written statements of witnesses submitted by the applicants confirming that the children had not been beaten or ill-treated did not constitute sufficient evidence in their favour. Harm, such as verbal cruelty, could be of a psychological nature. The statement made by Lisa-Marie that she wished to return to the applicants did not reflect her real intention, but resulted from a conflict of loyalty.', 'The District Court further compared the situation described in an expert report drawn up in 1993 with the present situation: Mrs Haase was always well-dressed while her husband looked tired and worn out. It concluded that Mrs Haase was not aware of her problems. She aggravated with each new pregnancy the emotional deficiencies of the children. This had been confirmed by Professor K. after a discussion with the applicants on 11 June 2002.', 'The District Court affirmed that its decision of 17 December 2001 was based on its experience in cases where coercive measures had to be taken. Had the parents been warned of the requested measure, they would have offered resistance, as was shown by their own reaction and the excessive reaction of the media in the case. An enforcement of the court decisions with the intervention of the authorities and the police would have been contrary to the best interests of the children.', '41. On 16 July 2002 the applicants appealed against this decision to the Hamm Court of Appeal.', ""42. On 20 August 2002 the applicants challenged Professor K. for bias. They complained that she had intentionally delayed the preparation of her expert report in order to separate the children from their parents for a longer period. She could not be relied upon to act in the best interests of the children. Without having seen them, she had recommended at the hearing before the District Court of 1 July 2002 that they be separated from the applicants. Her unfriendly conduct vis-à-vis the applicants, when interviewing them at their home on 11 June 2002, and the reference to files dating from Mrs Haase's divorce problems in 1993 confirmed the view that she was not impartial."", '43. On 18 September 2002 the applicants challenged the judge at the Münster District Court for bias. They referred to previous decisions given by that judge in favour of the Youth Office, allegedly in contrast to expert recommendations.', 'On 23 September 2002 the judge declined to stand down.', ""On 30 September 2002 the applicants' lawyer again challenged the judge at the District Court and Professor K. for bias."", ""On 7 October 2002 the Münster District Court dismissed the challenge to the judge on the ground that the applicants' allegations were unsubstantiated."", ""44. On 10 December 2002 the Hamm Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants' appeal against the Münster District Court's decision of 7 October 2002."", 'On 19 December 2002 the Münster District Court rejected the challenge for bias in respect of Professor K.', '45. On 13 January 2003 Professor K. submitted her report. She confirmed her previous findings.', ""46. On 19 February 2003 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting as a bench of three judges, refused to entertain the applicants' constitutional appeal against the decisions of 10 December 2002 and 7 October 2002."", '47. On 18 February 2003 the Münster District Court held a hearing. The applicants, the Youth Office, the curator ad litem and the experts G. and K. were present. The curator ad litem declared that the children had adapted to the changed living conditions and appeared to be comfortable with the new situation.', '48. On 4 March 2003 three of the children living with their father, Matthias, Sascha and Alexander, were heard separately by the Münster District Court. They were opposed to seeing their mother.', ""49. By a decision on the merits of 6 March 2003, the Münster District Court withdrew the applicants' parental rights over their four children and the three children of the first marriage previously living with them and prohibited access to them until June 2004. It relied on Articles 1666, 1666a and 1684 § 4 of the Civil Code (see paragraphs 53-55 below). The authorities were compelled to take the contested measures, which were justified under Article 6 § 3 of the Basic Law, and necessary in a democratic society for the protection of the health and the rights of the children within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. It found that the domestic situation was difficult and that the children were in danger. The applicants, in particular Mrs Haase, were inflexible and incapable of understanding the children's needs and with her it would be impossible to implement any educative measures. The conditions in which the children had been brought up were highly unsatisfactory. The children had made positive progress in the foster homes in which they had been placed, had gained in confidence and were less affected by behavioural disorders."", ""50. By a separate decision of the same day the Münster District Court prohibited contact between Mrs Haase and her four eldest children, Matthias, Sascha, Ramona and Alexander before the end of 2004, or in the case of Mrs Haase's eldest son Matthias, before he attained his majority."", '51. The applicants appealed against the above decisions.', '52. Article 6 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz) reads as follows:', '“...', '(2) Care and upbringing of children are the natural right of the parents and a duty primarily incumbent on them. The state watches over the performance of this duty.', '(3) Separation of children from the family against the will of the persons entitled to bring them up may take place only pursuant to a law, if those so entitled fail in their duty or if the children are otherwise threatened with neglect.', ""53. Article 1666 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) provides that the family courts are under an obligation to order necessary measures if a child's welfare is jeopardised (Gefährdung des Kindeswohls)."", ""54. The first sub-paragraph of Article 1666a provides that measures intended to separate a child from its family are permissible only if it is not possible for the authorities to take any other measure to avoid jeopardising the child's welfare."", 'The second sub-paragraph of Article 1666a provides:', '“Full [parental] responsibility may only be withdrawn if other measures have proved ineffective or have to be regarded as insufficient to remove the danger [Die gesamte Personensorge darf nur entzogen werden, wenn andere Maßnahmen erfolglos geblieben sind oder wenn anzunehmen ist, dass sie zur Abwendung der Gefahr nicht ausreichen].”', ""55. According to Article 1684 § 4 of the Civil Code, the family court can restrict or suspend the right of access if such a measure is necessary for the child's welfare. A decision restricting or suspending that right for a lengthy period or permanently may only be taken if the child's well-being would otherwise be endangered. The family courts may order that the right of access be exercised in the presence of a third party, such as a Youth Office authority or an association.""]",['8'],[],[],[],[],[],1

He was accused of membership of an illegal organisation, the YEKBUN (Kurdistan United People’s Party).', '11. The police officers interrogated the applicant in relation to his alleged involvement in the YEKBUN.

The first applicant, María Iglesias Gil, was born in 1961 and lives in Vigo. She is the mother of the second applicant, A.U.I., who was born in 1995.', '10. On 8 September 1989 the first applicant married A.U.A. On 3 June 1994 the couple divorced. Their son A.U.I. was born on 7 December 1995 and A.U.A. acknowledged paternity. In a decision of 20 December 1996, the Vigo Family Court awarded the first applicant custody of A.U.I., and the father access. On 1 February 1997 A.U.A. abducted his son during an access visit and left Spain with him. After passing through France and Belgium, he travelled with the child by air to the United States.', '11. The first applicant lodged a criminal complaint with Vigo investigating judge no. 5 alleging child abduction and applied to be joined to the proceedings as a civil party. On 4 February 1997 the investigating judge made orders for a nationwide search to be made for A.U.A. and for the child’s immediate return to its mother. Subsequently, the first applicant also made criminal complaints against various members of A.U.A.’s family who, she said, had assisted in her son’s abduction.', '12. During the investigation, the first applicant requested Vigo investigating judge no. 5 to monitor calls on A.U.A.’s mobile telephone and to interview members of A.U.A.’s family. In a decision of 19 February 1997, the investigating judge turned down both requests, the former on the ground that there was no evidence that the mobile telephone number that had been given was A.U.A.’s and the latter because the first applicant had not given precise details of the questions she wished to be put to her former husband’s relatives. The first applicant also asked the investigating judge for a search to be carried out at the registered office of a company belonging to A.U.A. that was responsible for administering his property in his absence, and for the examination of a vehicle he had used to leave Spain. The judge again refused.', '13. The first applicant asked the judge to issue an international search and arrest warrant against A.U.A., but in an order of 29 May 1997, he declined, stating:', '“...', '2. As regards the international search and arrest warrant, the offences of coercion and extortion have not been made out. It is debatable whether there has been an offence of criminal contempt, since it has not been proved that the person concerned was ordered to comply with the judgment of the family court and warned that he was liable to commit this offence. In addition, since this offence (Article 556 of the Criminal Code) only carries a prison sentence of between six months and one year, an international search and arrest warrant is not justified, [especially] as the conduct complained of appears to come within Article 622 of the Criminal Code, which characterises it as a minor offence.', '...', '4. Furthermore, it should be noted that the requested procedural steps are neither lawful, nor adapted to the aim pursued, and must therefore be refused pursuant to Article 311 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”', '14. In a decision of 5 June 1997, investigating judge no. 5 turned down further requests by the first applicant for investigative steps to be taken as a result of her former husband’s contempt and failure to comply with the judgment of the family court on the following grounds:', '“...', '2. Investigative steps are taken in order to establish whether an offence has been committed. The investigation is brought to an end by a judicial decision, not at the request of a party (Article 785 Code of Criminal Procedure).', '3. The inquiries made to date do not prove that A.U.A. failed to return his son to his mother at the end of the period for which he was entitled to have him to stay.', '...', '6. A wanted notice has been issued for A.U.A. nationally. As soon as he has been traced, final provision 19 of Institutional Law no. 1/1996 of 15 January 1996 on the legal protection of minors can be applied.”', '15. In an order of 25 May 1998, the investigating judge also examined whether a person could be prosecuted for the abduction of a minor for whom he had joint parental responsibility. He found that this was not possible under the case-law, as the only offences that could be committed in such circumstances were criminal contempt and extortion. In a further order dated 1 July 1998 the investigating judge reiterated that no international search and arrest warrant could be issued for the suspected offence of criminal contempt, for the following reasons:', '“... As regards an international search and arrest warrant against A.U.A., this issue was resolved by the Pontevedra Audiencia in its decision of 23 September 1997. No new facts have emerged since then that would justify reclassifying the offence. Under no circumstances can it amount to ‘false imprisonment’, as the judgment of 5 July 1993 on the abduction of minors makes clear. In that judgment, the court held: ‘The fact that a father has taken his minor child with him solely in order to enjoy its company cannot amount to the offence of child abduction’ ...', 'Lastly, as to the suspected offence of criminal contempt, no international search and arrest warrant can be issued as it is not an offence that comes within the extradition treaties. Consequently, Interpol would not act on such a warrant, as it would not be valid in law.”', '16. An appeal by the first applicant was dismissed by the Pontevedra Audiencia Provincial on 17 November 1998.', '17. The first applicant sought amparo relief under Articles 24 (right to a fair hearing), 15 (right to life and mental and physical integrity) and 17 (right to liberty and security) of the Constitution, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. In a decision of 2 June 1999, the Constitutional Court dismissed her appeal as manifestly ill-founded, holding that she had not stated why she disagreed with the reasoned decisions of the lower courts.', '18. At the end of the investigation, on 3 July 1998, Vigo investigating judge no. 5 issued a provisional discharge order dismissing the charges against A.U.A. However, he renewed the orders for a nationwide search for A.U.A. and the order freezing his assets. He also made a final order dismissing the charges against the members of A.U.A.’s family who had been implicated by the first applicant. The reason given by the judge for making the provisional discharge order in respect of A.U.A. was that the latter’s absence from Spain had prevented his being questioned or formally charged in accordance with Article 791 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. An appeal by the first applicant was dismissed by the Pontevedra Audiencia Provincial on 9 November 1998.', '19. The first applicant lodged an amparo appeal against those decisions with the Constitutional Court, in which she alleged violations of Article 17 (right to liberty and security), taken together with Articles 18 (rights to private life and family privacy), 24 (right to a fair hearing) and 39 (social, economic and legal protection of the family and children) of the Constitution. She also relied on Articles 5 and 8 of the Convention. In her appeal, she complained in particular of the investigating judge’s systematic refusal to issue an international search warrant for her child, a refusal which, she said, was in breach of the positive duty to protect children and families. She also alleged a violation of Article 11 § 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989, which requires States to take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad. In her submission, by refusing to take any investigative steps, the investigating judge had directly infringed both her and her son’s right to private and family life, and her right to judicial protection, as guaranteed by Article 24 the Constitution and Article 6 of the Convention.', '20. In a decision of 17 June 1999, the Constitutional Court dismissed the amparo appeal as unfounded, holding that the first applicant had confined herself to contesting the decisions of the criminal courts which, in reasoned and well-founded decisions, had decided to make a provisional discharge order in respect of her criminal complaint of child abduction, while renewing certain preventive measures.', '21. In connection with an appeal by the first applicant to the Pontevedra Audiencia Provincial against one of his decisions, investigating judge no. 5 said in a report to the Audiencia Provincial on 5 September 1997:', '“... The purpose of criminal proceedings is to prosecute the offence and, if appropriate, to punish the perpetrators. However, an investigating judge cannot, under any circumstances, allow himself to be manipulated by a woman driven by jealousy or hatred against her former husband’s family and take a series of procedural measures that serve no purpose other than to inconvenience third parties uninvolved in the proceedings. In the present case, all that has been proved so far is that A.U.A. did not return his son A.U.I. to his mother at the end of the period he was allowed by the family court.”', '22. An application for an order requiring investigating judge no. 5 to stand down was dismissed in a decision of 20 November 1997. In a decision of 22 February 1999, an application for the proceedings to be declared null and void was likewise dismissed.', '23. In a judgment of 12 February 1999, the Vigo Family Court withdrew parental responsibility from A.U.A. and awarded the first applicant full parental responsibility. It gave the following reasons for its decision:', '“... Having considered the evidence, the Court has decided to grant the applicant’s application. ... the case file shows that, after continually failing to comply with the access arrangements (see this Court’s decision of 20 December 1996), the respondent did not return the child to its mother at the end of the period stipulated in the decision of 20 December 1996. Furthermore, since 1 February 1997, the whereabouts of both father and child have been unknown, which means that the child has been removed from the applicant’s custody in breach of a court order. Such conduct can only be described as very serious, as it has entailed the cruel and abrupt removal of the child from the family background in which it was being happily brought up, thereby depriving it both now and then of its mother’s love and protection ... at the most tender of ages, with the serious harm which that entails ... Thus, by putting his own interests before those of his child, [A.U.A.] has acted in a manner that is seriously detrimental to the child’s welfare ...”', '24. According to a psychologist’s report produced by the first applicant in April 2000, A.U.A. first made contact with her through a telephone call in which he imposed various conditions for the child’s return, threatened her and used the prospect of her not seeing her son again as blackmail. On 12 June 2000 the first applicant lodged a criminal complaint against A.U.A. alleging threatening behaviour and coercion. On 30 September 2000 Vigo investigating judge no. 6 made a provisional discharge order. On an appeal by the first applicant, that order was quashed by the Pontevedra Audiencia Provincial in a decision of 15 May 2001.', '25. On 18 April 2000 the first applicant saw her son for the first time since his abduction in February 1997. On 12 May 2000 A.U.A. voluntarily appeared before the investigating judge, who, after hearing his representations, decided not to order his detention pending trial. Finally, on 18 June 2000 the first applicant was able to recover her child with police assistance on A.U.A.’s return to Vigo with the child. She said that for a time she was forced to go into hiding with her son in a shelter for women.', '26. On 14 July 2000 the Family Court granted A.U.A. access. As he was prevented from exercising that right, A.U.A. lodged a criminal complaint with the Vigo investigating judge against the first applicant and her parents alleging aggravated contempt.', '27. The relevant provisions of the Constitution read as follows:', '“Provisions relating to the fundamental rights and the freedoms recognised by the Constitution shall be construed in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and international treaties and agreements on human rights that have been ratified by Spain.”', '“1.

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Szolnok.', '6. The applicant, a civil servant for more than thirty years, had been in the service of the Hungarian Tax Authority. On 31 March 2011 she was dismissed, with effect from 1 June 2011. Her dismissal was part of a wave of similar measures throughout the entire civil service.', '7. On dismissal, the applicant was statutorily entitled to two months’ salary for April and May 2011, during which time she was exempted from working. In addition, she was to receive severance pay amounting to twelve months’ salary in application of section 19(2) of Act no. XXIII of 1992 on the Status of Civil Servants (see paragraph 8 below).', 'These benefits were subsequently taxed at 98% in their part exceeding 3,500,000 Hungarian forints (HUF). The exceeding part was HUF 3,903,529, the tax amounting to HUF 3,825,458. This represented an overall tax burden of approximately 60% on the entirety of the severance, as opposed to the general personal income tax rate of 16% in the relevant period.', 'The tax amount in question was never disbursed to the applicant, but was withheld by the employer and directly transferred to the tax authority on 8 June 2011.', '8. Section 19 of Act no. XXIII of 1992 on the Status of Civil Servants provides as follows:', '“(1) A civil servant ... shall be entitled to severance if his service relationship is terminated by ordinary dismissal ... .', '(2) The amount of severance shall be, if the civil servant’s service has been at least:', '...', 'g) 20 years: eight months’ salary ...', 'The amount of severance shall be increased by four months’ salary if the service relationship is terminated within the five-year period prior to the civil servant’s qualification for old-age pension [section 19/A § 1(a)] or anticipated old-age pension.”', '9. On 22 July 2010 Parliament adopted Act no. XC of 2010 on the Adoption and Modification of Certain Economic and Financial Laws (“the Act”). The Act, which was published in the Official Gazette on 13 August 2010, introduced inter alia a new tax on certain payments to employees in the public sector whose employment was terminated. Consequently, severance pay and other payments related to the termination of employment exceeding HUF 2 million became subject to a 98% tax. However, income tax and social security contributions already paid could be deducted from the tax. Notwithstanding the limit of HUF 2 million, the statutory provisions on the sum of severance pay – in some cases amounting to twelve months’ remuneration – were not modified. The bill preceding the Act justified the tax with reference to public morals and the unfavourable budgetary situation of the country.', '10. The Act entered into force on 1 October 2010; however, the tax was to be applied to the relevant revenues as from 1 January 2010. Simultaneously, the Constitution was also amended, establishing retroactive tax liability in respect of the given tax year concerning “any remuneration against good morals” paid in the public sector.', '11. The Act was challenged before the Constitutional Court within the framework of an abstract ex post facto control. This court found the relevant provisions unconstitutional in decision no. 184/2010. (X.28.)AB on 26 October 2010.', 'According to the Constitutional Court, revenues earned solely on the basis of relevant statutory provisions (that is, the overwhelming majority of the revenues concerned by the disputed legislation) could not be regarded as being against good morals, and therefore not even the constitutional amendment justified a retroactive 98% tax. The Constitutional Court pointed out that it reviewed the rate or amount of taxes only exceptionally; however, it held that a pecuniary burden was unconstitutional if it was of a confiscatory nature or its extent was clearly exaggerated, i.e. was disproportionate and unjustified. Considering also the “fifty-percent rule” (Halbteilungsgrundsatz) set out by the German Federal Constitutional Court – according to which the overall tax load on assets must be limited to 50-60% of the yield on those assets – the court found that the 98% tax was excessive and punitive, yet it equally applied to severance pay earned in a fully untainted manner. The tax was levied on or deducted from the revenues concerned even if their morally doubtful origin could not be established. The Constitutional Court annulled the relevant provisions retroactively, that is, from the day of the Act’s entry into force. It relied on the above arguments, rather than on considerations about the protection of property, to which its scrutiny did not extend in the case.', '12. The Constitutional Court’s decision contained in particular the following considerations:', '“5.2. ... [The Act] applies to ... payments originating in unconditional statutory entitlements and defined by objective criteria, that is, to those ... received from any source specified in the Act and exceeding the [relevant] amount .... The Act does not apply only to budgetary institutions but to other, State-owned employers as well. The use of private resources depends on the citizens’ relatively free choices and autonomous decisions. However, decisions concerning public funds are different. [The impugned legislation] relates to public funds, and determines – at least indirectly – the use of public resources.', '5.3. ... Depending on the circumstances, [the] 98% tax may apply to payments which derive from the obligatory application of cogent legal provisions. ... In these cases, the special tax does not function as a regulatory instrument, given its inescapable factual basis. Nor does it aim to prevent abusive payments; its purpose is rather to levy almost the entire income [in question] for the central budget. ...', 'The volume of public duties is considered unconstitutional if they have a confiscatory nature or amount to an evidently excessive rate of the kind which can be regarded as disproportionate and unjustified. ...', 'The material case concerns a substantial punitive tax which also applies to payments which are received, by virtue of law and within the limits of the proper exercise of rights, upon the termination of employment in the public sector. The Act would be applied also in cases where no infringement of law can be established in connection with the payments concerning the termination of a legal relation. It would deprive the taxable persons of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. ...', 'To increase budgetary revenues and secure a general and proportionate distribution of public burden is only the secondary and eventual purpose of the legislator when introducing such a tax. The direct purpose of the legislator in this case is to set a certain barrier on incomes by using the means of tax law. However, imposing a tax or other similar duty is no constitutional means to achieve such purpose. Several constitutional instruments are at the disposal of the legislator to accomplish its objective. It may reduce or even abolish some State allowances falling under the scope of the Act for the future, or transform the allocation system so that in the future it should not be possible to acquire further entitlements to allowances above a certain limit. Nonetheless, the discretion of the legislator only prevails in the framework of international and European community law.”', '13. Upon a new bill introduced on the same day as the date of the Constitutional Court’s decision, on 16 November 2010 Parliament re-enacted the 98 % tax with certain modifications, according to which this tax applied from 1 January 2005; however, for the majority of those affected (excluding some senior officials) it only applied to revenues above HUF 3.5 million. The new legislation was published in the Official Gazette of 16 November and entered into force on 30 December 2010.', '14. At the same time, Parliament again amended the Constitution, allowing retroactive taxation going back five years. Furthermore, the Constitutional Court’s powers were limited: the amended articles of the Constitution contained a restriction on the Constitutional Court’s right to review legislation on budgetary and tax issues. This restriction – which has also been maintained in the new Basic Law in force from 1 January 2012 – allows for constitutional review only in respect of violations of the right to life and human dignity, the protection of personal data, freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the rights related to Hungarian citizenship.', '15. Upon a petition for an abstract ex post facto control, on 6 May 2011 the Constitutional Court annulled – notwithstanding its limited powers – the five-year retroactive application of the 98% tax in decision no. 37/2011(V.10.)AB, relying on the right to human dignity. However, the reasoning of the decision underlined that only the taxation of revenues gathered before the 2010 tax year constituted a violation of the right to human dignity. The Constitutional Court did not find unconstitutional as such the Act’s presumption that the relevant revenues infringed good morals; however, it ruled that this presumption should be susceptible to a legal challenge. In view of its limited jurisdiction, it did not consider the substantive aspects of the tax.', '16. The Constitutional Court’s decision contained in particular the following considerations:', '“1. ... The Constitutional Court has held that the retroactive effect of the Act does not only apply to incomes earned contra bonos mores, but also to incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. Payments of statutory amounts [which have not been abolished] cannot be regarded as being contra bonos mores.', 'As regards the prospective provisions of the Act, the Constitutional Court has pointed out that the tax in issue is also applicable to payments received legally and within the limits of proper exercise of rights upon termination of employment in the public sector, and that it deprives the persons concerned of incomes originating in unconditional statutory entitlements. However, in this case the legislator interpreted the “special rate” as an entire withdrawal of the income, by which it overstepped its constitutional mandate and breached the amended constitutional rule of distributing public burden.', '2. In pursuit of decision [no. 184/2010 (X.28.)AB], Parliament amended the rules on the Constitutional Court’s competence as well as the provision of the Basic Law determining the distribution of public burden, and re-enacted the special tax. ...', '2.2. ... [The new legislation] contains no reference to the notion “contra bonos mores”, and allows for retroactive law-making with regard to the fifth tax year in arrears as well as for [any] imposition falling short of [the total] deprivation of income. ...', '4.1.1. ... The legal relations falling under the scope of the special tax are typically regulated by the so-called “legal status” Acts [i.e. the Acts concerning the legal status of civil servants]. [In this context, the] salary is specified by the so-called “pay scale”, which is independent from the parties and obligatory for them.', '[Moreover,] the personal scope of the special tax also includes employers and employees, mainly those who belong under the Labour Code, who can significantly influence the amount of the allowance received upon the termination of employment. ...', 'In this respect, the special tax is a tax whose purpose is not to generate [State] revenue. It is, in this connection, a regulatory instrument. ... Certain taxes may serve not only the purpose of increasing State revenue, but also function as regulatory instruments. Secondarily, but not insignificantly, [this] taxation can be also seen as part of the State’s economic policy. In this regard the legislature is afforded an exceptionally broad constitutional margin of discretion. ...', '4.1.4. ... The special tax is not a general income tax applicable to all types of income, but rather a particular tax levied on non-repetitive, non-regular payments which relate to certain factual circumstances (i.e. the termination of a legal relation) and which exceed a certain limit. ...', 'Such a tax with ex nunc effect cannot be considered to violate the right to protection of human dignity or to constitute an improper interference by the State with individual autonomy. Taking into account its base, the incomes not belonging in that base and their amounts, the special tax cannot be considered as completely dispossessing the tax subjects. ...', 'The individual’s acquisition of the income subject to the special tax is restricted by a public-law limitation originating in that tax ...', '4.2.4. ... In case of misuse of public resources, the limitation on payments might even have retroactive effect, [under] section 70/I (2) of the Constitution. The Constitutional Court has already emphasised in its decision [no. 184/2010 (X.28.)AB] that a retroactive special tax may be imposed on unfairly high payments, on certain types of severance pay or on compensation for significant periods of unused vacation time accumulated over years; the Act aiming at preventing abuses and endorsing the society’s sense of justice is not unconstitutional in itself, but must remain within the framework of the amended Constitution.', '4.2.5. However, to impose tax on incomes [lawfully] acquired during the tax year ... cannot be considered as the implementation of the new paragraph (2) of section 70/I of the Constitution, but rather interference by a public authority with individual autonomy going to such lengths that cannot have constitutional justification, and therefore violates the taxpayers’ human dignity. ...', 'The special tax does not provide for a fair and just assessment of individual circumstances; its retroactive rules apply to everyone [with two exceptions mentioned above] without differentiation. Nor does it take into account objective circumstances concerning a wide range of taxpayers, such as the economic crisis or emergency situations, which may disadvantageously influence the individuals’ circumstances. ...”', '17. On 9 May 2011 Parliament again re-enacted the retroactive application of the 98% tax. The amendment to Act no. XC of 2010 was published in the Official Gazette on 13 May and entered into force on 14 May 2011. It provided that only relevant revenues earned after 1 January 2010 should be subject to the tax. The amended legislation did not contain any remedy available to those affected.', '18. The Act, as in force as of 14 May 2011, provides (in sections 8-12/B) that the special tax rules are applicable to incomes received on 1 January 2010 or after. Incomes shall be subject to a 98% special tax where the private individual has worked at an economic operator or an organisation operating from public money, the payment is effected on account of the termination of the private individual’s work relationship, and the amount of the income exceeds HUF 3.5 (in certain cases 2) million. Incomes received between 1 January 2010 and 29 December 2010 were declared by private individuals by means of self-assessment, in tax returns submitted by 25 February or 10 May 2011 (depending on the taxpayer group). The tax was payable by the same dates.', 'Members of Parliament, vice mayors and Members of the European Parliament declared their income earned in 2010 and subject to the special tax in a different manner, in a separate tax return submitted by 31 July 2011. They paid the special tax by the same date. Persons subjected to the payment of special tax declared their taxable incomes earned between 1 January 2011 and 13 May 2011 by way of tax returns submitted by 25 February or 20 May 2012 (depending on the taxpayer group), and paid the tax by the same dates. In all other cases, the special tax is deducted by the payment issuer as withholding tax, and the deduction is indicated in the private individual’s tax return for the given revenue year.', 'Any charges paid by or deducted from the private individual including, in particular, personal income tax or individual contributions shall be regarded as tax advances paid on the special tax.', '19. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union provides as follows:', '“1. The Union recognises and respects the entitlement to social security benefits and social services providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, dependency or old age, and in the case of loss of employment, in accordance with the rules laid down by Community law and national laws and practices.”', 'The European Court of Justice held in Case C-499/08 Andersen v Region Syddanmark, [2010] ECR I-09343 as follows:', '“29. The aim pursued by the severance allowance of protecting workers with many years of service in an undertaking and helping them to find new employment falls within the category of legitimate employment policy and labour market objectives provided for in Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/78.”', 'European Commission Recommendation of 30 April 2009 on remuneration policies in the financial services sector (2009/384/EC) provides as follows:', '“1. Excessive risk-taking in the financial services industry and in particular in banks and investment firms has contributed to the failure of financial undertakings and to systemic problems in the Member States and globally....', '5. Creating appropriate incentives within the remuneration system itself should reduce the burden on risk management and increase the likelihood that these systems become effective. Therefore, there is a need to establish principles on sound remuneration policies.”', 'In the case Michel Bourgès-Maunoury, Marie-Louise Heintz v Direction des services fiscaux d’Eure-et-Loir concerning the compatibility with European Union primary law of a national provision on the procedure for calculating a wealth tax, Advocate General Cruz Villalón reiterated that the principle that rules governing tax law and the exercise of fiscal power must not have confiscatory effects is a “well-known and widely-recognised idea” (Case C558/10, Michel BourgèsMaunoury, Marie-Louise Heintz v. Direction des services fiscaux d’Eure-et-Loir 12 Dec 2011, OJ C-46, 12, Opinion of AG Villalón).', '20. In a judgment of 22 June 1995, the Federal Constitutional Court held that, according to Article 14 of the Basic Law, the use of property served the purpose of private gain and the public good. In that sense, property tax, combined with other taxes, might take no more than 50% of the income from property (Halbteilungsgrundsatz). The overall tax burden should moreover not run counter to the principle of equality demanding the division of burden depending on the contributing capacity (BVerfG, 2 BvL 37/91, 22.6.1995).', 'In its subsequent decision of 18 January 2006 (BVerfG, 2 BvR 2194/99, 18.01.2006), the Federal Constitutional Court found that even though tax load fell within the ambit of Article 14 of the Basic Law, that is, the protection of property, the overall burden through business and personal income tax, in the particular circumstances, did not infringe the complainant’s right to property. In the instant case the overall tax burden in business and personal income tax combined amounted to 57.58%. The Federal Constitutional Court noted in this regard that it was permissible to charge high income with higher tax burden, as long as the taxable person, after deduction of the relevant tax, disposed of a remaining income representing his private performance.', '21. In decision no. 2007-555 DC (16 August 2007; Act pertaining to work, employment and purchasing power), the Conseil constitutionnel held as follows:', '“24o The requirement deriving from Article 13 of the declaration of 1789 would not be complied with if taxation were to be of a confiscatory nature or subjected a certain category of taxpayers to an excessive burden in comparison with their ability to pay taxes. The principle of the capping of the proportion of a tax household’s income allocated to paying direct taxes, far from infringing the principle of equality before public burden sharing, is intended to avoid a patent infringement of this same principle;”', '22. The Federal Supreme Court held that a taxation scheme that is confiscatory in its effects and not limited in time would infringe the essence of the right to property (Decisions of the Federal Supreme Court, BGE 106 Ia 342, 349; BGE 128 II 112, 126). To date, the Federal Supreme Court has not found that any taxation scheme was confiscatory.', 'Decision no. BGE 128 II 112, 126 contains the following passage:', '“10 bb) ... In taxation matters, however, it [the guarantee of property, as set out in Article 26 of the Federal Constitution] does not go beyond the prohibition of confiscatory taxation. Therefore, a tax to be levied may not damage the very essence of private property. It is the task of the legislative branch to preserve the substance of the taxpayer’s assets and to allow him the chance to create new ones. In fact, a tax rate expressed in percentages is not the only decisive criterion in order to determine whether a taxation scheme has a confiscatory effect. It is necessary to examine the burden of the imposition for a rather long period and by not taking into account extraordinary circumstances. In order to accomplish this, all specific facts must be taken into consideration: the length and the gravity of the interference as well as the accumulation with other taxes or charges and the possibility to shift the tax to another person ...”.', 'Decision of the Federal Supreme Court no. 2P.139/2004 contains the following passage:', '“4.2 The Federal Supreme Court has held that it is not compatible with Article 26 of the Federal Constitution if an annuity for life, inherited by bequest, of initially CHF 2200 per month is – regardless of the ability to pay other taxes of the person in receipt of the pension –taxed at 55 % in total, in terms of inheritance and income taxes as well as other expenses, which (taking into account of the tax sum due for over CHF 200,000) were necessary for their financing (Decision P.1704/1984, published in: ASA 56 p. 439 et seq.). In that specific case the specific circumstances were relevant because the heir could not secure her own existence after paying the taxes for the annuity for life.”', '23. In United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 315 (1946) the Supreme Court dealt with the following problem: According to the provisions of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, after 15 November 1943 no salary or compensation was to be paid to certain individuals, who were then government employees, out of any moneys then or thereafter appropriated, except for services as jurors or members of armed forces unless they were prior to that date again appointed to jobs by the President with advice and consent of the Senate. In the background of the statute challenged lay the House of Representatives’ feeling that in the late 1930s many ‘subversives’ were occupying influential positions in the Government and elsewhere and that their influence must not remained unchallenged. In 1943 the respondents, Lovett, Watson and Dodd, were and had been for several years working for the Government. The Government agencies which had lawfully employed them were fully satisfied with the quality of their work and wished to keep them employed in their jobs. The Supreme Court held that the purpose of the provision challenged was not merely to cut off the petitioners’ compensation through regular disbursing channels, but permanently to bar them from government service and it was designed to force the employing agencies to discharge respondents and to bar their being hired by any other governmental agency. The Supreme Court reiterated that the Constitution barred such legislative acts by providing that “no Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed”. It found that the relevant provision was designed to apply to particular individuals and operated as a legislative decree of perpetual exclusion from a chosen vocation. It ruled that this permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government was punishment of those individuals without a judicial trial and thus carried the usual characteristics of bills of attainder. The Supreme Court found that “legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial, are ‘bills of attainder’ prohibited by the Constitution”.', 'The subject matter of the case Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960) was as follows: The petitioners (Armstrong and al.) furnished various materials to Rice for use in construction of boats. Upon Rice’s default, the Government exercised its option as to ten of the boat hulls still under construction and removed these properties to out-of-state naval shipyards for use in the completion of the boats. When the transfer occurred, the petitioners had not been paid for their materials and they were not paid afterwards, either. The petitioners therefore contended that they had liens. The Supreme Court held “that there was a taking of these liens for which just compensation is due under the Fifth Amendment. It is true that not every destruction or injury to property by governmental action has been held to be a ‘taking’ in the constitutional sense. This case and many others reveal the difficulty of trying to draw the line between what destructions of property by lawful governmental actions are compensable ‘takings’ and what destructions are ‘consequential’ and therefore not compensable... The Fifth Amendment’s guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. A fair interpretation of this constitutional protection entitles these lienholders to just compensation here.”', 'In Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998) the Supreme Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act 1992 amounted to an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property. It held that the economic impact of the Act was substantial as to the petitioner, in that it required Eastern Enterprises to contribute large sums of money to a pension fund for employees employed in the 1950s and 1960s solely because those payments could not be allocated to other coal companies that were currently operating in the coal industry. The retroactive effect of the Act imposed a substantial economic injury on Eastern Enterprises that could not have been anticipated. Moreover, the challenged statute interfered with Eastern Enterprises’ expectations in that in 1987 the company sold off its remaining holdings in coal operations and completely quitted this industry. The statute’s requirement for Eastern Enterprises to undertake the obligation at issue clearly interfered with the expectations of Eastern when it sold off its interest in coal operations. Lastly, the nature of the government action was unusual because it retroactively applied a substantial economic burden on Eastern Enterprises. For the Supreme Court, the character of the government action was substantial and invasive. The balance of the factors resulted in the finding of an unconstitutional taking requiring just compensation.']",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

In July 1972 the applicant was engaged as an official employed under an individual contract (agent contractuel) by the Economic Development Department of the Ministry for Economic Affairs.

Under the authority of the chief commercial adviser of the New York office, who was himself responsible to the chief commercial adviser at the French embassy in Washington, to whom the agricultural attaché was also answerable, he was placed in charge of the wines, beers and spirits sector, where he had dealings with exporters and importers and, in particular, the SOPEXA company (Société pour l'expansion des ventes des produits alimentaires et agricoles)."", ""8. In accordance with Decree no. 69-697 of 18 June 1969 on the general terms and conditions of service of persons working overseas for the State under individual contracts, the applicant was employed on a series of thirty-month contracts which were to be automatically renewed unless expressly terminated. The State could terminate any contract on three months' notice for, inter alia, inadequate performance."", '9. In a letter dated 10 December 1985, which was served on the applicant on 27 December 1985, the Minister for Economic Affairs informed the applicant that, owing to his inadequate performance, he did not intend to renew his contract when it expired on 13 April 1986. In a letter dated 9 January 1986, served on the applicant on 21 January 1986, the Minister informed him of his final decision not to renew the contract, on the ground that, among other matters, the applicant had shown a marked lack of initiative towards importers.', ""10. By letters of 28 February, 3 March and 13 June 1986, the applicant lodged three applications for judicial review of this decision with the Paris Administrative Court. The first sought to have the Minister's first letter of 10 December 1985, which was in the nature of a preliminary to a final decision, set aside. The second was aimed at having the final decision to dismiss the applicant, contained in the letter of 9 January 1986, quashed.

They must also participate in various surveys or special projects and in all economic events organised or run by the various ministries or official groups, defend the country's general economic interests and on that account provide direct assistance, in overseas markets, to French businessmen, industrialists and agricultural producers."", 'The Overseas Economic Development Department has an establishment of 128 staff. Commercial attachés second class are recruited from among graduates of the National College of Administration (ENA); commercial advisers of the various classes may in addition be recruited from the State civil service. All commercial advisers and attachés are posted abroad by order of the Minister for Economic Affairs, made after the agreement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been obtained.', '14. In addition, by Law no. 50-340 of 27 March 1950, five posts of agricultural attaché have been created. Agricultural attachés are responsible to the head of the relevant economic development office. Their duties are described in Article 3 of Decree no. 56-1242 of 3 December 1956: they study, from the technical point of view, problems affecting French agricultural development, particularly by seeking outlets in the local market for imports of French agricultural produce, and act as advisers during the preparation of negotiations on international commercial agreements and their application, assisting the head of office in his relations with the public administrative authorities dealing with foreign trade matters.', '15.

The provisions of the decree are not applicable to technical assistance or cooperation staff placed at the disposal of foreign States. The different types of post are defined in orders made by the ministries concerned. They may be filled either by non-established employees or by established civil servants.', '16. The relevant provisions of the decree are worded as follows:', ""“Persons to whom Article 1 applies shall sign a contract of service. The contract, which must refer to the provisions of this decree, shall specify its duration, the date on which it is to take effect, the staff member's category, grade and duties, the appropriate residence allowance group, the country of the posting and, where applicable, the family allowance group.”"", '“Where the staff member was recruited in the country of the posting, the contract must be for a period of at least three years.

Article 48(4) of the Treaty of 25 March 1957 instituting the European Economic Community (“the EEC Treaty”) provides for a derogation from the principle of freedom of movement for workers within the Community in respect of “employment in the public service”. The Court of Justice of the European Communities has developed a restrictive interpretation of this derogation. In its judgment of 17 December 1980 in the case of Commission v. Belgium (C-149/79, ECR 3881) it decided that the derogation concerned only posts which involved direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State or of other public authorities, and which thus presumed on the part of those occupying them the existence of a special relationship of allegiance to the State and a reciprocity of rights and duties which formed the foundation of the bond of nationality.', '18. The European Commission, to which the EEC Treaty assigned responsibility for ensuring the correct application of Community rules, noted that a large number of posts likely to be caught by the derogation had in reality no bearing on the exercise of powers conferred by public law or protection of the general interests of the State.', '19. In a communication of 18 March 1988 it set itself the task of listing separately those activities which were covered by the derogation and those which were not. It thus established two distinct categories of activities according to whether or not they involved “direct or indirect participation in the exercise of powers conferred by public law and duties designed to safeguard the general interests of the State”.', '20. These categories were defined as follows:', '“Exclusion of specific activities in the national public service [from freedom of movement for workers]', 'On the basis of current Court of Justice rulings, and bearing in mind the present conditions for establishing the single market, the Commission considers that the derogation in Article 48(4) covers specific functions of the State and similar bodies such as the armed forces, the police and other forces for the maintenance of order, the judiciary, the tax authorities and the diplomatic corps. This derogation is also seen as covering posts in State Ministries, regional government authorities, local authorities and other similar bodies, central banks and other public bodies, where the duties of the post involve the exercise of State authority, such as the preparation of legal acts, the implementation of such acts, monitoring of their application and supervision of subordinate bodies ...', 'Activities concerned by action in the public service sector', 'The Commission considers that the functions involved in certain forms of public employment are for the most part sufficiently remote from the specific activities of the public service as defined by the Court of Justice that they would only in very rare cases be covered by the exception in Article 48(4) of the Treaty.', 'The Commission proposes therefore to implement its action in the following areas by order of priority:', '– bodies responsible for administering commercial services (e.g. public transport, electricity and gas supply, airline and shipping companies, posts and telecommunications, radio and television companies),', '– public health care services,', '– teaching in State educational establishments,', '– research for non-military purposes in public establishments.', 'Each of these activities also exists in the private sector, to which Article 48(4) does not apply, or may be exercised in the public sector without the imposition of nationality requirements ...”']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants, Mr Cumpănă and Mr Mazăre, were born in 1951 and 1968 respectively and live in Constanţa.', '16. In decision no. 33 of 30 June 1992, Constanţa City Council, implementing government decision no. 147 of 26 March 1992, introduced a fine for drivers of illegally parked vehicles and entrusted the task of removing, towing away and impounding such vehicles to S.C. CBN, a company based in Constanţa.', '17. By order no. 163 of 30 June 1992, the mayor of Constanţa authorised a private company, Vinalex, to perform the services of removing, towing away and impounding illegally parked vehicles.', '18. A partnership contract was signed on 16 December 1992 by the city authorities and the company in question, the signatories on behalf of the authorities being the deputy mayor (hereinafter “D.M.”) and the council’s legal expert (“Mrs R.M.”). In a letter of 1 April 1994, the mayor of Constanţa requested Vinalex to cease its activities under the contract and informed it that it was considering terminating the contract.', '19. On 12 April 1994 the applicants, who are journalists by profession, published an article in the local newspaper Telegraf, of which the second applicant was the editor, with the headline “Former Deputy Mayor [D.M.] and serving judge [R.M.] responsible for series of offences in Vinalex scam”. The names of the former deputy mayor and of the city council’s former legal expert, Mrs R.M., who had subsequently become a judge, were printed in full in the headline and in the article itself.', '20. The article, which appeared under the byline of both applicants, was worded as follows:', '“In decision no. 33 of 30 June 1992 Constanţa City Council entrusted a commercial company, S.C. CBN S.r.l., with the task of impounding illegally parked vehicles or trailers ... It was the duty of the city authorities’ specialist departments to lay down the practical arrangements for implementing the council’s decision. But things did not turn out that way. Six months after decision no. 33 was adopted, the city authorities, knowingly breaching the provisions of Law no. 69/1991, illegally concluded a partnership contract ... with S.C. Vinalex S.r.l., a company having no connection with the one initially chosen. It is worth noting, however, that the contract in question was signed by the deputy mayor, [D.M.], in place of the mayor, ... and by a certain [M.] instead of the legal expert [M.T.].', 'By what miracle did S.C. Vinalex enter into a partnership with the city authorities when, in decision no. 33 of 30 June 1992, the city council had authorised CBN S.r.l. to provide a straightforward service? What is striking is that there is no evidence that CBN agreed to give up the task of towing away illegally parked vehicles! ... The crook [D.M.] (the former deputy mayor, now a lawyer) granted Vinalex’s irresponsible employees the power to decide when a vehicle is illegally parked – in other words, to treat citizens and their property with contempt. What form did the fraud take? Sections 89 and 29 of Law no. 69/1991 provide that no partnership contract with a commercial company may be signed without a prior decision by the local council, adopted by a two-thirds’ majority of the total number of councillors. Before a contract is signed, it must be referred to all the local council’s specialist committees for their opinion ... The contract with Vinalex was negotiated and signed illegally, as the signatories based it on the decision [of 30 June 1992], which, as has already been shown, referred to a different company without envisaging any other partnership.', 'Given that the city authorities had already signed four other contracts before that one, the signatories cannot claim ignorance of the law, but only an intentional breach of it! And because any intentional breach of the law pursues an end in itself – generally that of securing material advantages – it is clear that in this case the former deputy mayor, a lawyer by profession, received backhanders from the partner company and bribed subordinates, including [R.M.], or forced them to break the law.', 'The Constanţa Audit Court detected this blatant fraud, which has generated considerable profits for the briber (S.C. Vinalex) ... The offending company [S.C. Vinalex] has never shown that it had adequate means to impound illegally parked vehicles. This explains why large numbers of privately owned vehicles have been damaged and, as a result, thousands of complaints have been made on the subject.', 'Furthermore, the alleged partnership contract was valid for one year, until 16 December 1993. From that date [S.C. Vinalex] no longer had any right to interfere with citizens’ private property! It has nevertheless continued to tow vehicles away and illegally collect money ... It is incomprehensible how the police could have provided it with assistance for the past four months.', 'Let us briefly consider the conduct of the council’s former legal expert, [R.M.], who is now a judge. Either she was ignorant of the law when she signed the contract, in which case it is hard to understand how she can subsequently have been appointed as a judge (delivering justice on the basis of the same laws which she does not know), or she accepted bribes and may continue to do so in future! It is no surprise that the same judge should have been investigated by the Audit Court for a further illegal act, also committed while she was at the city council (as we reported at the time). Ironically, the Court’s president did not take any action against her on the ground that the sum received was not ... large enough.', 'Apparently becoming aware that the matter was likely to be uncovered, the city authorities’ coordination department ... notified S.C. Vinalex in writing of the possibility of the contract being terminated on the following grounds: ... ‘You have not supplied any documents showing that you have purchased the platform-type equipment necessary for carrying out the activity properly’ (as stipulated in clause 3 of the contract ...). In the same letter the city authorities informed S.C. Vinalex: ‘As you have not proved that you have the appropriate equipment, we would assess your contribution to the partnership at the level of your company’s capital, that is 110,000 lei. Your share in the partnership’s net income will have to be recalculated in relation to the parties’ contributions.’', 'Facts are facts, and the documents in our possession speak for themselves of the illegal Vinalex scam.”', '21. The article was accompanied by a photograph of a police car on the scene as an illegally parked vehicle was being towed away, photocopies of extracts from the partnership contract and from Constanţa City Council’s decision of 30 June 1992, and certain passages of Law no. 69/1991 concerning the responsibilities and powers of mayors, prefects and city and county councils.', '22. The article was also accompanied by a cartoon showing a man and a woman arm in arm, carrying a bag marked “Vinalex” which was full of banknotes. The two characters were depicted as saying to each other:', '“Hey, [R.] [diminutive form of Mrs R.M.’s first name], you’ve done a good job there! When I was deputy mayor we made quite a bit, enough to go to America ...”', '“[D.] [diminutive form of the former deputy mayor’s first name], if you become a lawyer, I’ll become a judge and we’ll have enough to travel round the world ...”', '23. In June 1994 the Financial Control Department of the County Audit Court examined a report submitted on 26 May 1994 by several auditors who had conducted a review of Constanţa City Council’s budget for 1992 and had made the following findings:', '(a) The city council’s decision of 30 June 1992 to award S.C. CBN the contract for towing away illegally parked vehicles had not been justified by any bid submitted in writing by the company or by the company’s aims as set forth in its articles of association.', '(b) The city council had not given its opinion on the partnership contract signed between the city authorities and Vinalex, and no expert valuation of Vinalex’s assets had been carried out or submitted to the council for approval, contrary to the provisions of the Local Public Administration Act (Law no. 69/1991).', '(c) The distribution of the proceeds among the parties as agreed in the contract – 70% to Vinalex and 30% to the city council – had not corresponded to the partners’ respective contributions on the date on which the contract had been signed – 76.4% by the city council and 23.6% by Vinalex – resulting in a loss of income for the city council.', 'The Financial Control Department considered it necessary to urge the mayor of Constanţa, as the official responsible for authorising appropriations, to “ensure compliance with the law” as regards the parties’ obligations under the contract and to be more efficient when entering into such partnerships with private entities in future. A formal decision to that effect was adopted on 8 June 1994 by the head of the department.', '24. The applicants produced to the Court a report dated 17 March 1994 by the same Audit Court auditors, which likewise referred to the irregularities described in paragraph 23 above in the signing of the partnership contract between the city authorities and Vinalex, and indicated that the contract should be terminated. The applicants did not mention the existence of such a report during the criminal proceedings instituted against them following the publication of the impugned newspaper article.', '25. On 14 April 1994, following the publication of the article, Mrs R.M. instituted proceedings against the applicants in the Constanţa Court of First Instance for insult and defamation, offences under Articles 205 and 206 respectively of the Criminal Code. She complained, in particular, of the cartoon accompanying the article, which had depicted her as a “woman in a miniskirt, on the arm of a man with a bag full of money and with certain intimate parts of her body emphasised as a sign of derision”. She submitted that the article, the cartoon and the dialogue between the characters had led readers to believe that she had had intimate relations with D.M., and pointed out that she and the former deputy mayor were both married.', '26. At a hearing on 13 May 1994, the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present and, scheduling a further hearing for 27 May 1994, directed that they should be brought before the court on that date.', '27. On 27 May 1994 the second applicant stated at the hearing that, as editor, he assumed full responsibility for what had been published in the newspaper. He explained that cartoons were frequently used in the press as a medium for criticism and that he had not intended to damage the claimant’s reputation. In reply to a question from the court, he admitted having known that, by order of the mayor of Constanţa, Vinalex had been authorised to tow away illegally parked vehicles. He stated, however, that he had not thought it necessary to publish that information. Lastly, he stressed that he did not intend to reach a settlement with the injured party and that he was prepared to publish an article in her favour provided that she could prove that what he had published was untrue.', '28. On 10 June 1994 the applicants applied to have the case transferred to a court in another county. They also requested an adjournment of the proceedings, arguing that because the claimant was a judge it was impossible for them to find a member of the Constanţa Bar who would agree to represent them.', '29. On an unspecified date the Constanţa Bar, in reply to a question from the court, attested that the applicants had not met with a refusal on the part of all of its members and that, in any event, the matter had not been referred to its executive.', '30. On 15 June and 1 July 1994 the court adjourned the case as the applicants were not present.', '31. In an interlocutory decision of 21 July 1994, the Supreme Court of Justice ordered the referral of the case to the Lehliu-Gară Court of First Instance.', '32. On 15 November 1994 the case was entered on that court’s list of cases for hearing. Public hearings were held on 21 December 1994 and on 25 January, 27 February, 20 March, 17 April and 17 May 1995.', '33. On 21 December 1994 and 25 January 1995 the applicants did not attend the hearings, although they had been duly summoned. The court summoned them to appear at the hearings on 25 January and 27 February 1995. The applicants did not comply with the summonses.', '34. At the hearings on 27 February and 20 March 1995, representatives of Telegraf applied for an adjournment on behalf of the applicants, who were not present. The court allowed the application.', '35. On 20 March 1995 a member of the Bucharest Bar, N.V., agreed to represent the applicants.', '36. At the hearing on 17 April 1995 in the morning, N.V. asked the court to consider the case after 11.30 a.m. The court granted his request. However, when it sat to examine the case at 12 noon and, subsequently, at 2.30 p.m. it noted that neither the applicants nor their counsel were present in the courtroom. It accordingly adjourned the case until 17 May 1995.', '37. At the hearing on 17 May 1995 the court reserved judgment, after noting that neither the applicants – despite their having been duly summoned – nor their counsel had appeared. In a judgment delivered on the same day, the court found the applicants guilty of insult and defamation – offences under Articles 205 and 206 respectively of the Criminal Code. It sentenced them to three months’ imprisonment for insult and seven months’ imprisonment for defamation, and ordered them both to serve the heavier sentence, namely seven months’ immediate imprisonment. As well as this main penalty, the court imposed the secondary penalty of disqualification from exercising all the civil rights referred to in Article 64 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 58 below).', 'It also prohibited the applicants from working as journalists for one year after serving their prison sentences, a security measure provided for in the first paragraph of Article 115 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 59 below).', 'Lastly, it ordered them to pay Mrs R.M. 25,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL) (equivalent to 2,033 euros at the exchange rate applicable at the material time) for non-pecuniary damage.', '38. In stating its reasons for the judgment, the court observed, firstly:', '“The Court notes that the injured party has always been present, both in the Constanţa Court of First Instance and in the Lehliu-Gară Court of First Instance, whereas the defendants have generally been absent without justification, despite having been lawfully summoned. In support of her prior complaint, the injured party, Mrs [R.M.], sought leave to produce documentary evidence. Mrs [R.M.] submitted a copy of the 12 April 1994 edition of the local newspaper Telegraf, containing the article referred to in her complaint and the cartoon in which she was ridiculed.', 'The Court notes that the defendants and the party liable to pay damages, despite being lawfully summoned, have not attended any hearings, and that only the injured party has been present.', 'The Court notes that the defendants R. Mazăre and C. Cumpănă were informed of the charges against them and of the hearing dates, and that they were assisted by a lawyer of their choosing (who asked the Court first for an adjournment and subsequently for consideration of the case to be postponed until the second sitting, after 11.30 a.m.).', 'The Court observes that the defendant R. Mazăre gave evidence to the Constanţa Court of First Instance at a public hearing on 27 May 1994, and notes the following from his testimony: the defendant considered that it was not compulsory to have studied at journalism college to work as a journalist; he refused to reply when asked whether he had had access to any other documents on which Constanţa City Council’s decision no. 33 had been based; he understood by ‘series of offences’ the fact of committing several offences; he understood by ‘a multiple breach of the criminal law’ the commission of several offences; he considered that the injured party, in signing the contract in her capacity as a legal expert at the city council, had infringed a number of the provisions of Law no. 69/1991; he pointed out that he could not give the precise legal classification of the offences committed by the injured party, as that did not come within his sphere of competence; he stated that he had said everything there had been to say about the injured party in the newspaper article; he submitted that cartoons were used everywhere and maintained that he had not (through the cartoon) damaged anybody’s reputation (specifically, that of the injured party).', '[The Court] notes that the defendant R. Mazăre stated that he assumed full responsibility for everything published in his newspaper, as its editor; ... that he stated that he was aware of the constitutional provisions on the right of journalists to impart information to the public; that he had read the government decision in its entirety but had not published it for lack of space; that he also stated that he had read the full text of the partnership contract entered into by the city authorities and signed by the injured party, Mrs [R.M.], but that he did not know whether the government decision had referred to partnership contracts; ... that the defendant had been aware that the Vinalex company had been authorised by order of the mayor of Constanţa to provide the service of towing away illegally parked vehicles, but that he had not thought it necessary to publish that information in the newspaper; and, lastly, that he stated: ‘In view of the seriousness of the offences committed, I do not think that it was necessary to discuss the matter with the injured party beforehand. Should any documents prove that my statements are unfounded, I am prepared to publish an article in the injured party’s favour.’ ”', '39. With regard to the documentary evidence on which the injured party intended to rely in support of her allegations, the court observed:', '“Apart from the article published in Telegraf, the injured party, Mrs [R.M.], produced Constanţa City Council’s decision no. 33 – adopted in accordance with government decision no. 147 of 26 March 1992 – in which it was decided to tow away illegally parked vehicles; order no. 163 of 30 June 1992 by the mayor of Constanţa ... authorising the Vinalex company to remove, tow away and impound illegally parked vehicles (‘The conditions for the performance of these services shall be laid down in the partnership contract to be drawn up’); government decision no. 147 of 26 March 1992, in which mayors were empowered to order the removal, towing away and impounding of illegally parked vehicles by duly authorised specialist companies; and order no. 369 of 1 July 1994 by the mayor of Constanţa, in which Vinalex was authorised to provide such services.”', '40. With regard more particularly to the article and cartoon in issue, the court held:', '“... the article, by the defendants R. Mazăre and C. Cumpănă, was directed at the injured party, tarnishing her honour, dignity and public image and injuring her own self-esteem by means of the (written) accusations conveyed through signs and symbols targeted specifically at her.', 'The Court considers that these acts took place, that they are punishable under the criminal law, and that they posed a danger to society, not so much because of their practical effect (physical distortion of outward reality) but above all because of the psycho-social consequences resulting from the provision of misleading or incorrect information to the public, giving rise to inaccurate judgments about facts and individuals, establishing a false scale of values in view of the role and public impact of the media, and causing psychological trauma to the injured party. In making its assessment, the Court has had regard to the particular status of the parties to the proceedings: the injured party, Mrs [R.M.], being a lawyer and a representative of the judiciary, and the defendants, Mr R. Mazăre and Mr C. Cumpănă, being representatives of the media.', 'The Court notes that the defendant R. Mazăre, while realising the seriousness of the acts he had committed, irresponsibly stated that he had been ‘aware of the fact that Vinalex had been authorised by order of the mayor, but did not consider it necessary to publish that order (as well)’...', 'The Court considers that publication of the article in the newspaper cannot have been justified by a ‘legitimate interest’ in that it was not based on actual facts and the provision of accurate information to the public. It concludes that the defendants ... ‘forgot’ the content of Article 30 § 6 of the Constitution: ‘Freedom of expression shall not be prejudicial to a person’s dignity, honour and private life or to the right to one’s own image’, and of Article 31 § 4 of the Constitution: ‘Public and private media shall be required to provide the public with accurate information.’', 'It follows from the written submissions filed by the injured party ... that it was always her wish that the criminal proceedings be terminated by a friendly settlement, provided that the defendants agreed to retract the allegations made in the article.', 'The Court notes that the injured party is a public figure and that, following the publication of the article, her superiors and the authority above them asked her to explain herself regarding the trial, particularly in view of the fact that she was due to take the professional examination to obtain permanent status.”', '41. On an unspecified date the applicants appealed against the first-instance judgment of 17 May 1995.', '42. At a hearing on 2 November 1995, the Călăraşi County Court reserved judgment, having noted that the case was ready for decision and that the applicants had not appeared in court, despite having been duly summoned, and had not stated any grounds for their appeal.', '43. In a judgment of 2 November 1995, the court, after examining all the aspects of the case against the applicants, as required by Article 3856 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, upheld the first-instance judgment, finding it to have been correct. The County Court’s judgment, sent to the archives on 23 November 1995, was final and binding and no ordinary appeal lay against it.', '44. On 10 April 1996 the Procurator-General applied to the Supreme Court of Justice to have the judgments of 17 May 1995 and 2 November 1995 quashed. He submitted the following arguments.', '(a) The courts’ legal classification of the facts had been incorrect. Pointing out that in the cartoon the applicants had simply highlighted their allegations of corruption on the part of certain city council officials, he accordingly submitted that the facts in issue did not constitute the actus reus of insult as defined in Article 205 of the Criminal Code.', '(b) The amount the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages had been extremely high and had not been objectively justified.', '(c) Lastly, the requirements of the first paragraph of Article 115 of the Criminal Code, by which the courts could prohibit persons who had committed unlawful acts from practising a particular profession on account of their incompetence, lack of training or any other ground making them unfit to practise the profession, were not satisfied in the applicants’ case, as there was no unequivocal proof that the applicants were incompetent to continue working as journalists or that their doing so entailed a potential danger.', '45. In a final judgment of 9 July 1996, the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the Procurator-General’s application as being manifestly ill-founded, for the following reasons:', '“It has been established from the evidence adduced in the present case that on 12 April 1994 the accused, R. Mazăre and C. Cumpănă, published an article in the Constanţa newspaper Telegraf entitled ‘Former Deputy Mayor [D.M.] and serving judge [R.M.] responsible for series of offences in Vinalex scam’, in which it was asserted that in 1992, while she was employed as a legal expert at Constanţa City Council, the injured party, Mrs [R.M.], had been involved in fraudulent activities on the part of a commercial company, Vinalex.', 'The Supreme Court further notes that, alongside the above-mentioned article, the accused published a cartoon in which the injured party was depicted in the company of a man carrying a bag full of money on his back, and that this was likely to tarnish the injured party’s honour, dignity and public image.', 'It follows that in publishing the article in Telegraf, the accused attributed specific acts to the injured party which, had their allegations been made out, would have rendered her criminally liable; the two lower courts were therefore correct in finding the accused guilty of defamation under Article 206 of the Criminal Code.', 'The fact that the accused published alongside the above-mentioned article a cartoon in which the injured party was depicted in the company of a man carrying a bag full of money, in such a way as to tarnish her honour and reputation, constitutes the offence of insult as defined in Article 205 of the Criminal Code ...”', '46. With regard to the amount which the applicants had been ordered to pay in damages, the Supreme Court held:', '“... the requirement for the accused to pay 25,000,000 lei for non-pecuniary damage was justified, since it is beyond dispute that in publishing the article on 12 April 1994 in a mass-circulation newspaper, the accused seriously offended the dignity and honour of the injured party.”', '47. The Supreme Court held, lastly, in relation to the alleged unlawfulness of the temporary prohibition on the applicants’ working as journalists:', '“... since the application of security measures in circumstances other than those provided for by law does not feature on the exhaustive list of cases in which the law permits the Procurator-General to apply to have a decision quashed, it cannot form a legal basis for quashing the judgments in issue.”', '48. The applicants did not serve the prison sentence they had received in the judgment of 2 November 1995, since immediately after the judgment had been delivered the Procurator-General suspended its execution for eleven months by virtue of Article 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 61 in fine below).', '49. In a letter of 30 September 1996, the Procurator-General at the Supreme Court of Justice informed the applicants that he had extended the stay of execution until 27 November 1996.', '50. On 22 November 1996 the applicants were granted a presidential pardon dispensing them from having to serve their prison sentence. By virtue of Article 71 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the pardon also waived their secondary penalty of disqualification from exercising their civil rights (see paragraph 58 in fine below).', '51. It appears from the first applicant’s employment record (cartea de muncă), of which he submitted a copy to the Court, that, following the Călăraşi County Court’s judgment of 2 November 1995:', '(a) he continued to work for Telegraf as editor of the “Events” section until 1 February 1996, when he was transferred for administrative reasons to the C. company, occupying the same position and receiving the same salary as before;', '(b) while working for C., he was awarded a pay rise;', '(c) he ceased to work for C. on 14 April 1997 on account of staff cutbacks by his employer, a ground for dismissal provided for in Article 130 (a) of the Labour Code as worded at the material time;', '(d) thereafter, he was not gainfully employed until 7 February 2000, when he was recruited on a permanent contract by the A. company as deputy editor.', '52. Following the final and binding judgment of 2 November 1995, the second applicant continued to work as editor of Telegraf, as indicated in a letter he sent to the Court on 19 January 2000.', '53. Between 1 September 1997 and 30 November 1999, while he was a member of the Romanian parliament, the sum of ROL 25,000,000 was deducted from his parliamentary allowance and transferred to Mrs R.M.’s bank account, pursuant to the Lehliu-Gară Court of First Instance’s judgment of 17 May 1995 (see paragraph 37 in fine above).', '54. On an unspecified date after that judgment, he was elected mayor of Constanţa, a position he still holds.', '55. At the material time the relevant provisions were worded as follows:', '“Anyone who tarnishes the reputation or honour of another through words, gestures or any other means shall be liable to imprisonment for between one month and two years or to a fine.”', '“Anyone who makes any statement or allegation in public concerning a particular person which, if true, would render that person liable to a criminal, administrative or disciplinary penalty or expose them to public opprobrium shall be liable to imprisonment for between three months and three years or to a fine.”', '56. In Resolution no. 1123 of 24 April 1997 on the honouring of obligations and commitments by Romania, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe observed that Articles 205 and 206 of the Romanian Criminal Code were unacceptable and seriously compromised the exercise of fundamental freedoms, in particular the freedom of the press. The Assembly therefore called on the Romanian authorities to amend those provisions without delay.', '57. Following a process of legislative reform, the New Romanian Criminal Code Act (Law no. 301 of 28 June 2004) provides that the offence of defamation is punishable solely by a fine (Article 225 of the New Criminal Code) and no longer classifies insult as a criminal offence. These legislative amendments will come into force on 29 June 2005.', '58. The relevant provisions are worded as follows:', '“Disqualification from exercising one or more of the rights mentioned below may be imposed as an additional penalty:', '(a) the right to vote and to be elected to bodies of a public authority or to public elective office;', '(b) the right to occupy a position entailing the exercise of State authority;', '(c) the right to perform a duty or practise a profession or activity by means of which the convicted person carried out the offence;', '(d) parental rights;', '(e) the right to act as a child’s guardian or statutory representative.”', '“The secondary penalty shall consist in disqualification from exercising all the rights listed in Article 64.', 'A life sentence or any other prison sentence shall automatically entail disqualification from exercising the rights referred to in the preceding paragraph from the time at which the conviction becomes final until the end of the term of imprisonment or the granting of a pardon waiving the execution of the sentence ...”', '59. The relevant provision is worded as follows:', '“Anyone who has committed an [unlawful] act through incompetence, lack of training or for any other reasons rendering him or her unfit to perform certain duties or to practise a certain profession or activity may be prohibited from performing those duties or practising that profession or activity. Such a measure may be revoked on request after one year if the grounds on which it was imposed are no longer valid.', '...”', '60. The relevant provisions are worded as follows:', '“A pardon shall have the effect of waiving the execution of a sentence. ... A pardon shall have no effect on security measures or educational measures.”', '“A person sentenced to a term of imprisonment of less than one year shall be legally rehabilitated if he does not commit any further offences for three years.”', '61. The relevant provisions are worded as follows:', '“The Procurator-General may, of his own motion or on an application by the Minister of Justice, apply to the Supreme Court of Justice for any final decision to be quashed.”', '“An application to have a final conviction ... quashed may be made:', 'I. ...', '...', '4. where the penalties imposed fell outside the limits prescribed by law;', '...', '7. where the offence was incorrectly classified in law ...”', '“Before applying to have a decision quashed, the Procurator-General may order a stay of its execution.”']",['10'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1920 and lived in Kyiv, Ukraine, and in Yerevan, Armenia.', '7. From 1947 to 1966 the applicant was married to M. Mrs Sardaryan was born during the marriage. The applicant and M. divorced in 1966. On 11 August 1984 they remarried.', '8. On 12 January 2007 the applicant died and Mrs Sardaryan inherited her rights and obligations.', '9. On 2 April 2007 M. died and Mrs Sardaryan inherited his rights and obligations.', '10. On 22 November 1996 M. instituted divorce proceedings in the Moskovskiy District Court of Kyiv against the applicant.', '11. On 6 May 1997 M. amended his claims and requested a declaration that the marriage of 1984 was void. Subsequently he modified and withdrew his claims on several occasions.', '12. On 24 March 1998 the court declared the marriage void. The applicant appealed.', '13. On 29 April 1998 the Kyiv City Court (since 2001 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal) quashed this judgment on the ground that the lower court had failed to examine the initial claims of M. and to establish crucial facts, and remitted the case for fresh consideration.', '14. On 26 June 1998 the applicant submitted a counterclaim, seeking a divorce.', '15. On 27 July 1998 the Moskovskiy District Court granted the divorce petition in respect of M. and the applicant. M. appealed.', '16. On 9 September 1998 the Kyiv City Court quashed this judgment on the lower court’s failure to assess properly the evidence and remitted the case for fresh consideration.', '17. On several occasions the Kyiv City Court transferred the case from one trial court to another for further examination: in September 1998 to the Zaliznychniy District Court of Kyiv; in October 1999 to the Starokyivskiy District Court of Kyiv; and, eventually, on 20 January 2000 to the Kharkivskiy District Court of Kyiv (in 2001 this court was reorganised into the Dniprovskiy and Darnytskiy District Courts of Kyiv).', '18. On 4 July 2001 the court found for M. and declared the marriage with the applicant void. The applicant appealed.', '19. On 4 December 2001 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed this judgment and remitted the case for fresh consideration to the Dniprovskiy District Court of Kyiv. It noted, inter alia, that although the trial court had examined the case in the applicant’s absence, it had failed to take into account her written pleadings, which were important for a fair examination. M. appealed in cassation against this decision but on 7 March 2002 the Supreme Court of Ukraine dismissed his appeal.', '20. On 26 April 2002 the Dniprovskiy District Court resumed the proceedings.', '21. On 23 May 2003 the court granted divorce to M. and the applicant. The hearing was held in M.’s absence. M. appealed.', '22. On 18 November 2003 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed the judgment on the ground that the trial court had failed to examine whether the absence of M. was for good reasons or not and remitted the case for fresh consideration.', '23. On 12 December 2003 the Dniprovskiy District Court resumed the proceedings.', '24. On 17 March 2005 the court rejected M.’s claim to have the marriage declared void and dismissed the applicant’s claim because she had failed to attend the hearing.', '25. On 28 July 2005 and 21 May 2007 respectively, the Kyiv City Court of Appeal and the Donetsk Regional Court of Appeal, acting as a court of cassation, dismissed M.’s appeals.', '26. A substantial number of the approximately seventy hearings in this set of proceedings were adjourned following the parties’ requests, referring to their poor state of health or their failure to appear before the court. In her requests to adjourn the hearings the applicant, who, it appears from the available documents, was represented, requested the trial courts either not to hold hearings in her absence or to stay the proceedings till her recovery. The trial courts stayed the proceedings several times pending the parties’ recovery. The courts further warned the parties that they would examine the case in the respective party’s absence; on one occasion the court fined the applicant for non-attendance, but this decision was later quashed upon the applicant’s appeal.', '27. According to the applicant, she did not appeal against the judgment of 17 March 2005 but in August 2005 she instituted new and separate divorce proceedings in the Golosiyivsky District Court of Kyiv. On 14 March 2006 the court divorced the applicant and M.', '28. In 1986 the applicant’s family was granted tenancy of a publicly owned two-roomed apartment. On 28 November 1991 M., with the applicant’s consent, bought the apartment from the local municipal authority.', '29. On 25 November 1996 the applicant instituted proceedings in the Moskovskiy District Court of Kyiv against M., seeking to declare the above sale contract void.', '30. On 15 November 1996 the court attached the apartment in question.', '31. In March 1997 the applicant amended her claims, claiming ownership of half of the apartment.', '32. In April 1997 M. forcibly evicted the applicant from the apartment. The applicant moved to Yerevan, Armenia, and resided there until her death.', '33. On 29 May 1997 the Moskovskiy District Court stayed the proceedings pending determination of the divorce proceedings.', '34. In the period between 22 October 1999 and January 2000 the case was transferred to the Starokyivskiy and Kharkivskiy District Courts of Kyiv, following the relevant decisions by the Kyiv City Court.', '35. On 31 January 2000 the Kharkivskiy District Court of Kyiv, having taken over the case, decided to stay the proceedings pending determination of the divorce proceedings.', '36. On 29 August 2002 the Golosiyivskiy District Court of Kyiv (before October 2001 the Moskovskiy District Court of Kyiv) lifted the attachment order on this apartment as “the main dispute had been resolved”. According to the applicant, neither she nor her representative were present at this hearing. She also contended that Judge U., the president of the court, who rendered this ruling, had intervened unlawfully in the proceedings as at that moment they were pending before the Darnytskiy District Court of Kyiv (formerly the Kharkivskiy District Court of Kyiv). The applicant further pointed out that in the ruling of 29 August 2002 Judge U. had referred to a judgment which did not exist.', '37. On 20 September 2002 M. made a gift of the apartment to K.N., a third person. On 21 February 2003 the latter sold the apartment to K.R. The applicant alleged that she only became aware of the ruling of 29 August 2002 in April 2003, when the apartment had been already sold.', '38. On 3 April 2003 the Darnytskiy District Court (formerly the Kharkivskiy District Court of Kyiv, see paragraph 17 in fine) made an attachment order in respect of the apartment in question. On 21 June 2004 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal amended the order so that it applied to half of the apartment only. According to the applicant, neither she nor her representative was summoned to the last-mentioned hearing. On 21 March 2006 the Supreme Court of Ukraine upheld the ruling of 21 June 2004.', '39. On 7 May 2003 the court rejected the applicant’s request to renew her the time-limit for appeal against the decision of 29 August 2002. There is no evidence that the decision of 7 May 2003 has been ever sent to the applicant. According to the applicant, she learned about it on 30 July 2004 at the latest from the letter of the Kyiv City Court of Appeal. There is no evidence that the applicant has ever tried to obtain a copy of the decision of 7 May 2003 and to appeal against it.', '40. On 17 February 2004 the Darnytskiy District Court inquired of the Dniprovskiy District Court as to the outcome of the divorce proceedings.', '41. On 26 June 2006 the Darnytskiy District Court resumed the proceedings.', '42. On 12 September 2006 the applicant submitted an additional claim to declare the gift contract of 20 September 2002 and the sale contract of 21 February 2003 (see paragraph 37 above) void.', '43. On 21 September 2006 the case was transferred for examination to the Golosiyivskiy District Court. On 18 January 2007 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal quashed this decision on an appeal by the applicant and remitted the case back to the Darnytskiy District Court.', '44. On 16 June 2007, both parties, the applicant and M., having died, the Darnytskiy District Court stayed the proceedings until the identity of the parties’ heirs had been determined.', '45. On 10 October 2007 Mrs Sardaryan joined the proceedings as the sole heir to both parties. She also modified the claims, seeking to have the contracts of 20 September 2002 and 21 February 2003 declared void and to have the court recognise that she owned the apartment outright. In this regard she indicated K.N. and K.R. as defendants.', '46. On 5 November 2007 the proceedings were resumed.', '47. On 26 June 2008 the Darnytskiy District Court found for Mrs Sardaryan. On 28 October 2008 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal upheld this decision. On 15 September 2010 the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed these decisions and remitted the case for a fresh consideration to the first instance court. The proceedings are apparently still pending.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1929 and lives in Vittoriosa.', '10. The applicant is the brother of Mrs M., who lived in an apartment above Mr F.', '11. On 17 July 1985 Mr F. applied for an injunction to restrain Mrs M. from hanging out clothes to dry over the courtyard of his apartment, thereby allegedly interfering with his property rights. Mr F. relied on the provisions of Article 403 of the Maltese Civil Code in this connection.', '12. On one occasion following a hearing on the injunction, and after Mrs M. and her lawyer, Dr A., had already left the courtroom, the presiding magistrate changed the date of a future hearing, which had already been fixed. As a consequence, Mrs M. was not aware of the new date and was not present at the hearing. In her absence, on 29 November 1985 the presiding magistrate issued the injunction in favour of Mr F.', '13. According to Maltese law as it stood at the time, Mr F. had to institute proceedings in respect of the property claim preserved by the warrant within four days of the issuing of the injunction; otherwise the injunction would cease to have effect. Accordingly, on 5 December 1985, Mr F. lodged a writ of summons to start proceedings.', '14. On 6 March 1992 the relevant court trying the merits of Mr F.’s civil action found against Mrs M. and issued a permanent injunction against her. On 24 March 1992, as no appeal had been lodged, the case became final.', '15. On 6 December 1985 Mrs M. instituted proceedings before the Civil Court (First Hall) in its ordinary jurisdiction, claiming that the injunction had been issued in her absence and without giving her the opportunity to testify (see paragraph 77 below).', '16. By a judgment of 15 October 1990, the Civil Court upheld her claim. It held that the audi alteram partem principle was applicable to the procedure for issuing an injunction. Referring to Article 873 § 2 of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, which stated that an injunction should not be issued unless the court was satisfied that it was necessary in order to preserve any right of the person seeking it (see paragraph 27 below), the Civil Court held that the relevant test was a matter for the court’s discretion. However, if the court found it necessary to hear the parties, they should be duly heard in accordance with the principles of natural justice. In the present case the court held that, through no fault of her own, Mrs M. had been denied her right to be heard and therefore the said warrant was null and void.', '17. Mr F. appealed against the judgment of 15 October 1990. In the first-instance proceedings Mr F. had been assisted by Dr U., while at the appeal stage he had appointed the latter’s son, Dr C. The Court of Appeal was presided over by the Chief Justice, who sat with two other judges. The Chief Justice was Dr U.’s brother and Dr C.’s uncle.', '18. At the appeal hearing of 12 October 1992, the Chief Justice, after asking some questions, alleged that the conduct of Dr A. was unethical, as he had impugned, without justification, the conduct of Mr F’s lawyer. When it was noted that in the first-instance proceedings Mr F. had been represented by the Chief Justice’s brother, the Chief Justice threatened to refer the case to “the competent authorities”. Furthermore, he dictated a note to this effect, which read as follows:', '“The court is asking Dr A., who himself is declaring that the date of the hearing at first instance had been changed when he and his client had already left the courtroom, why he insisted that the said change of date occurred consequent to a request by a lawyer. Dr A.’s reply is: ‘I deduce so, as there were two lawyers present: Dr U. and myself.’', '... Mrs M.’s lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge, after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom.”', '19. Dr A. said a few words in his own defence, but no oral submissions regarding the merits of the appeal were heard. The Chief Justice suspended the hearing and went to his chambers. A few minutes later the lawyers of both parties were called into the Chief Justice’s chambers. Explanations were heard and no further action appears to have been taken.', '20. By a judgment of 5 February 1993, the Court of Appeal found against Mrs M. and reversed the judgment of the Civil Court. It held that principles of natural justice were not mandatory and could not be invoked in preliminary proceedings that were essentially conditional and of a temporary nature. Moreover, the Court of Appeal did not agree with the issue of fact mentioned in the first-instance judgment, in respect of the change in date leading to Mrs M.’s absence at the hearing. In this respect the judgment repeated in part the note which had been dictated during the hearing – “Mrs M.’s lawyer asserts facts and has no problem hypothesising about the behaviour of another lawyer and the judge, after he and his client had walked out of the courtroom”. The Court of Appeal further ordered the removal from the records of the case of a report which supported Mrs M.’s claim, which had been drawn up by the judicial assistant appointed by the Civil Court.', '21. On 25 March 1993 Mrs M. instituted proceedings before the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction. Relying on Article 6 of the Convention, she alleged that the President of the Court of Appeal (the Chief Justice) lacked objective impartiality and that this had been manifest in the incident of 12 October 1992. Observing that the Court of Appeal had denied facts which had already been proved, she further submitted that her right to a fair trial had been violated.', '22. Mrs M. died on 20 January 2002, before her constitutional claim could be determined. On 22 May 2002 the applicant intervened in the proceedings before the Civil Court in his capacity as brother of the plaintiff.', '23. In a judgment of 29 January 2004, the Civil Court dismissed Mrs M.’s claim as frivolous and vexatious. Although it noted that the plaintiff had failed to request the Chief Justice to withdraw from the case before the pronouncement of the final judgment, it rejected the Government’s plea of non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies and decided to exercise its constitutional jurisdiction. As to the merits, it made a thorough analysis of the notions and rights emanating from Article 6 of the Convention, including equality of arms, but placed particular emphasis on the requirement of impartiality of the Civil Court. However, it was unable to find any link between the incident of 12 October 1992 and the content of the judgment of 5 February 1993. As confirmed by Dr A. himself, the incident had been defused; however, this could not have given Mrs M. or her lawyer any expectation that the Court of Appeal would rule in her favour. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal was composed of two other judges, who had not been involved in the incident, and there had been no doubt that the judgment, which appeared to be well-reasoned, had been delivered by the bench as a whole.', '24. The applicant appealed to the Constitutional Court.', '25. By a judgment of 24 October 2005, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible. It reiterated that in accordance with Article 46 § 5 of the Constitution, no appeal lay against a decision dismissing an application as frivolous and vexatious.', '26. Article 403 of the Civil Code reads as follows:', '“(1) Tenements at a lower level are subject in regard to tenements at a higher level to receive such waters and materials as flow or fall naturally therefrom without the agency of man.', '(2) It shall not be lawful for the owner of the lower tenement to do anything which may prevent such flow or fall.', '(3) Nor shall it be lawful for the owner of the higher tenement to do anything whereby the easement of the lower tenement is rendered more burdensome.”', '27. Article 873 of Title VI, Sub-Title V of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, regarding warrants of prohibitory injunction, reads as follows:', '“(1) The object of a warrant of prohibitory injunction is to restrain a person from doing anything whatsoever which might be prejudicial to the person suing out the warrant.', '(2) The court shall not issue any such warrant unless it is satisfied that such warrant is necessary in order to preserve any right of the person suing out the warrant, and that prima facie such person appears to possess such right.”', '28. Under Maltese law, as it stood at the time of the present case, a judge could be challenged or could abstain from hearing a case if one of the parties was represented by the former’s son or daughter, spouse or ascendant. Nothing prevented a judge from sitting in a case if the representative in issue was his or her brother or nephew. The pertinent Articles of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure, in so far as relevant, read as follows:', '“The judges may not be challenged, nor may they abstain from sitting in any cause brought before the court in which they are appointed to sit, except for any of the reasons hereinafter mentioned.”', '“(1) A judge may be challenged or abstain from sitting in a cause –', '...', '(e) if he, or his spouse, is directly or indirectly interested in the event of the suit;', '(f) if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the son or daughter, spouse or ascendant of the said judge; ...”', '29. The relevant Article of the Code of Organisation and Civil Procedure was amended in 2007 to include another ground:', '“(g) if the advocate or legal procurator pleading before a judge is the brother or sister of the said judge; ...”', '30. Article 39 § 2 of the Maltese Constitution, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:', '“Any court or other adjudicating authority prescribed by law for the determination of the existence or the extent of civil rights or obligations shall be independent and impartial; ...”', '31. On the basis of the material available to the Court in respect of the legislation of a relevant number of member States of the Council of Europe, it appears that there is widespread consensus on the applicability of Article 6 safeguards to interim measures, including injunction proceedings. This conclusion is inferred from constitutional texts, codes of civil procedure and domestic case-law. In the majority of States (Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, San Marino, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) legislation suggests that Article 6 procedural safeguards (particularly the impartiality requirement) apply to interim and injunction proceedings either because the legislation makes no distinction as to the stage or type of proceedings to which the safeguards apply (such as the Constitutions of Greece, Italy, Spain and Switzerland), or because specific provisions governing interim measures reflect in some way the main safeguards embedded in Article 6 – as, for example, legislation which specifies that provisions governing proceedings on the merits apply mutatis mutandis to injunction proceedings (such as Poland), or will do so, unless otherwise stipulated (such as Germany). The Belgian courts have explicitly dealt with the issue (see the judgments of the Court of Cassation in the cases of Greenpeace Belgium and Global Action in the Interest of Animals, of 14 January 2005) and held that Article 6 of the Convention was in principle applicable to interim proceedings (référé).', '32. Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union guarantees the right to a fair trial. Unlike Article 6 of the Convention, the provision of the Charter does not confine this right to disputes relating to “civil rights and obligations” or to “any criminal charge” and does not refer to the “determination” of such. In Bernard Denilauler v. SNC Couchet Frères (ECJ, Case C 125/79, 21 May 1980) the European Court of Justice (“the ECJ”) held that provisional measures given ex parte without hearing the defendant could not be recognised according to its case-law. This implies that such safeguards should apply also outside the context of final decisions.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

On 2 June 2004 the hearing was adjourned for the first time between 1.15 p.m. and 2.15 p.m. When it resumed, the President of the Assize Court ordered the photograph album in the case file to be shown to the parties, the jury and the other judges, then announced the questions the court and the jury would have to answer. Counsel for the accused objected to the wording proposed. The President called the civil party, the advocate-general, the defence and the accused, and the court then withdrew to deliberate. The hearing resumed at 2.40 p.m. Counsel for the applicant then filed submissions requesting that the court take formal note that unlawful communication within the meaning of Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure had taken place between certain members of the jury and the advocate-general during the adjournment when the court had withdrawn to deliberate, leaving the jury in the courtroom. The President heard evidence from the applicant's and the civil party's lawyers, the advocate-general and the accused.

In a judgment of 2 June 2004 the Assize Court of Appeal sentenced the applicant to fifteen years' imprisonment and eight years' social and judicial guidance, with the obligation to undergo treatment and not to approach the victim, her mother or her brother. Ruling on the civil claims, it ordered the applicant to pay the victim EUR 15,000 in respect of damage suffered prior to 23 April 2003 and EUR 4,000 in respect of damage suffered thereafter."", ""12. In a subsequent appeal on points of law the applicant relied on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, asserting that it imposed “an obligation on every national court to check whether, as constituted, it is 'an impartial tribunal' within the meaning of that provision where, as in the instant case, this is disputed on a ground that does not immediately appear to be devoid of merit”, and that “in refusing the defence's request for a formal note to be made in the record that certain jurors had communicated with the advocate-general during an adjournment, without ordering an investigation to establish the facts and, if appropriate, taking the action requested by the defence” the Assize Court had infringed the provisions of that Article."", '13. On 16 February 2005 the Criminal Division of the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal on points of law, holding, inter alia:', ""“The record of the proceedings states that the accused's lawyer filed submissions requesting formal note to be taken that unlawful communication, within the meaning of Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, had taken place between certain jurors and the advocate-general while the court was adjourned."", 'The Court refused that request on the grounds that it could not make a record of things alleged to have happened in its absence, and the evidence adduced and discussed inter partes had revealed no violation of the provisions of the above-mentioned Article 304.', 'That being so, there was no ground for appeal.', 'On the one hand the judges composing the court were not personally in a position to confirm what may have happened in their absence.', 'On the other hand, considering that the evidence adduced and discussed inter partes had revealed no violation of the provisions of Article 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court used its unfettered discretion without infringing the provisions of the law or the convention on which the accused relied.', 'It follows that the ground of appeal cannot be accepted. ...”', '14. The relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide:', '“The trial jury shall be formed of nine jurors when the Assize Court rules at first instance and twelve jurors when it rules on appeal.', 'The court shall make a ruling ordering, before the drawing of the list of jurors and separately from it, the drawing by lot of one or more additional jurors who shall attend the hearing.', ""Where one or more of the nine jurors are prevented from following the hearing up to the delivery of the Assize Court's judgment, they shall be replaced by the additional jurors."", 'The replacement shall be made in the order in which the additional jurors were drawn by lot.”', ""“The president shall give the following address to the jurors while they stand bare-headed: 'You shall swear and promise to examine with the most scrupulous attention the charges which will be brought against ...; to betray neither the interests of the accused nor those of society which accuses him, nor those of the victim; to refrain from communicating with anyone until after your finding; to heed neither hatred nor malice, nor fear nor affection; to remember that the accused is presumed innocent and that he has the benefit of the doubt; to decide according to the charges and defence arguments following your conscience and your innermost conviction, with the impartiality and resolution that befit a free man of integrity, and to preserve the secrecy of deliberations, even after the end of your service.'"", ""Each juror being called individually by the president shall answer, raising his hand: 'I swear it'.”"", ""15. Where an event likely to infringe the rights of one of the parties occurs during the trial, the party concerned may ask the Assize Court - composed in this instance of only the judges - to “take formal note” of it. This is the party's only means of having it recorded. The Court of Cassation cannot entertain complaints that have been raised if no application was made to the Assize Court to take formal note of them and they were not entered in the record of the trial (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 23 December 1899, Bulletin criminel (Bull. crim.) no. 380; 24 July 1913, Bull. crim. no. 365; 12 May 1921, Bull. crim. no. 211; 31 January 1946, Bull. crim. no. 40; 5 May 1955, Bull. crim. no. 28; 21 November 1973, Bull. crim. no. 427; 22 April 1977, Dalloz-Sirey 1978, p. 28)."", ""16.

In a judgment of 14 January 1988, however, the Court of Cassation held that the content of the impugned judgment should enable it to assess whether the impugned communication was such as to influence the jurors' opinion (Court of Cassation, Criminal Division, 14 January 1988, Dalloz-Sirey 1988, p. 206).""]",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

On several occasions (25 December 2002, 31 March 2003 and 2 September 2003) the Korolyovsky District Prosecutor's Office refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the applicant's complaints of illtreatment, having found no evidence of any wrongdoing by the police."", ""30. These decisions were subsequently annulled by the supervising prosecutorial authorities (on 14 March, 14 May and 3 September 2003), finding that: the enquiries had been insufficient; various important witnesses had not been questioned; inconsistencies between various testimonies had not been reconciled; medical evidence had not been duly collected and examined; and no plausible explanation for the applicant's injuries had been proposed."", ""31. On 11 September 2003 the Korolyovsky District Prosecutor's Office again refused to institute criminal proceedings. The applicant was not informed about this decision."", ""32. On 14 October 2004, following enquiries made by Mrs Kovalchuk, she obtained a full copy of the decision of 11 September 2003 and subsequently appealed against it on the applicant's behalf to the Bogunsky District Court of Zhytomyr."", ""33. On 9 November 2005 the Bogunsky District Court allowed the applicant's claims and set aside the decision of 11 September 2003. It found, in particular, that the investigation had failed to analyse the conclusions of the medical assessment completed in November 2003 and to question several important witnesses (specifically, the applicant's fellow inmates)."", ""34. On 27 December 2005 the Korolyovsky District Prosecutor's Office took a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings."", '35. On 16 November 2006 the Bogunsky District Court set aside the above decision, having found that its previous instructions had not been properly followed.', ""36. On 23 June 2008, having questioned several additional witnesses, the Korolyovsky District Prosecutor's Office decided that the applicant's injuries had been caused by a fall related to an epileptic seizure resulting from the excessive consumption of alcohol."", ""37. On 12 August 2008 the Bogunsky District Court set aside this decision, having found that several important witnesses (specifically, the applicant's fellow inmates) had still not been questioned."", ""38. On 18 September and 30 November 2008 the prosecutor's office took fresh decisions not to institute criminal proceedings into the applicant's alleged ill-treatment which were set aside by the supervising prosecutors on 30 September and 8 December 2008 respectively, each decision making reference to there having been insufficient investigation of the matter."", '39. On 26 January 2009 a fresh decision not to institute criminal proceedings was taken, relying, in particular, on the impossibility of collecting further evidence because of the death or relocation of numerous witnesses, the inability of the remaining witnesses to recall details and the destruction of relevant documentary records.', ""40. On 30 March 2009 the Bogunsky District Court set aside this decision following an appeal by Mrs Kovalchuk. The court noted, in particular, that the case file contained two reports concerning the applicant's arrest on 7 September 2002 which had been made by two different police officers and instructed the investigator to clarify the situation."", ""41. On 1 October 2009 the Bogunsky District Court annulled a further decision of the prosecutor's office not to institute criminal proceedings, dated 28 May 2009, having found that the situation relating to the arrest reports had not been clarified and that no determination of why the applicant had been questioned about Mr K.'s murder during his detention and the circumstances in which he had suffered bodily injuries had taken place."", ""42. On 26 November 2009 a fresh decision was taken not to institute criminal proceedings. The investigating authorities noted, inter alia, that the applicant's accounts of the relevant events had been inconsistent and that on several occasions he had changed his story. In particular, he had initially alleged that he had been beaten by a rubber truncheon but subsequently insisted that the officers had punched and kicked him. In addition, on 17 March 2003 he had asserted that he had no claims against the police at all and did not share his mother's view about the necessity of an investigation."", '43. On 12 March 2010 the Bogunsky District Court upheld the above decision.', ""44. Mrs Kovalchuk appealed, noting, in particular, that in addition to its failure to establish those responsible for her son's injuries, the investigation had failed to reconcile a number of factual inconsistencies. For instance, according to the relevant records, an ambulance was first called to the police station to assist the applicant at 4.05 p.m. on 7 September 2002, whereas according to both the reports concerning the applicant's arrest and the court decision of 9 September 2002, the applicant had not been arrested until 6 p.m. Furthermore, according to statements by Mrs T.I., the applicant's acquaintance, she had already seen the applicant in the police station at noon on 7 September 2002 and had also witnessed an ambulance arriving to help him twice on that day."", ""45. On 31 March 2010 the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal quashed the Bogunsky District Court's ruling, set aside the decision of 26 November 2009 and remitted the complaint of ill-treatment for further investigation. The court noted that previous instructions of judicial authorities had not been followed and ordered that the investigation determine, in particular: (i) where, in what circumstances, and by whom bodily injuries had been inflicted on the applicant “having regard to the fact that on 7 September 2002 he had been examined by a doctor who had not recorded any injuries”; (ii) why there were two different reports on the applicant's arrest; (iii) why the applicant had been questioned as a witness about Mr K.'s murder while detained in custody for an unrelated administrative offence; and (iv) why he had confessed to a killing of which he had been innocent. The Court of Appeal also ordered that the statements of Mrs T.I. concerning the circumstances in which she had seen the applicant on 7 September 2002 be re-examined."", ""46. According to the case file, the investigation of the applicant's complaint of ill-treatment is currently pending."", '47. The relevant domestic law can be found in the judgment in the case of Kozinets v. Ukraine (no. 75520/01, §§ 39-42, 6 December 2007).']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1949 and is currently in Clairvaux Prison.', '10. The applicant, who claims to be a revolutionary by profession, was taken into custody on 15 August 1994. He was placed under judicial investigation in connection with a series of terrorist attacks in France and was given a life sentence on 25 December 1997 for the murder of two police officers and an acquaintance on 27 June 1975.', '11. He was held in solitary confinement from the moment he was first taken into custody in mid-August 1994 until 17 October 2002, notably in La Santé Prison (Paris).', '12. According to his lawyer, this entailed his being held in a 6.84 square metre cell that was run-down and poorly insulated, with an open toilet area. The applicant was prohibited all contact with other prisoners and even prison warders and was only allowed to leave his cell once his fellow inmates had returned to theirs. His sole permitted activity outside his cell was a two-hour daily walk in a triangular area that was 15 metres long and 7.5 metres wide at the base, receding to 1 metre at the vertex. This area was walled in and covered with wire mesh. His only recreational activity was reading the newspapers or watching television on a rented set. The only visits he received were from his lawyers and, once a month, a priest. The prison authorities ignored his requests to be allowed visits from anyone else. Mail intended for the applicant had gone missing, although it had not been officially confiscated, and he had not received a winter jacket that had been brought to the prison for him in October 1999 until 16 February 2000.', '13. The Government did not dispute these facts. They said that the cell was lit by natural light, a ceiling light and a reading lamp. None of the members of the applicant’s family had ever applied for permission to visit. Only two requests to visit had been turned down, both from journalists.', '14. The documents in the case file show that the applicant has received visits from 58 different lawyers during his time in prison.', 'His current representative, who is also his wife under Islamic law, visited him more than 640 times between 27 June 1997 and 29 April 2002.', '15. The parties have produced a series of decisions requiring the applicant to be held in solitary confinement for successive three-month periods.', '16. The first was taken when the applicant was first detained (15 August 1994). It consists of a form on which the following boxes were ticked: “Need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and “Undermining of order and discipline in the prison”. There were no observations by the applicant. The same day, a doctor issued a medical certificate stating:', '“[The applicant’s] health is compatible with solitary confinement. However, he must, if possible, have complete rest for eight days.”', '17. A decision dated 3 November 1994 to prolong the applicant’s solitary confinement from 15 November 1994 to 15 February 1995 was approved by the Regional Director’s Office of the Prison Service. The reasons stated were the same, but the applicant made the following observations:', '“I consider that these solitary-confinement measures, especially the disturbances at night, indicate a desire to harass a political prisoner.”', 'In a medical certificate issued the same day, a doctor', '“certif[ied] that [the applicant’s] health [was] compatible with his continued solitary confinement”.', '18. A decision of 20 January 1995, which was applicable from 15 February to 15 May 1995, cited the same reasons and was approved by the Regional Director’s Office. The applicant refused to sign the notice informing him of the decision. In a medical certificate issued the same day, a doctor', '“certif[ied] that [the applicant’s] health [was] compatible with his continued solitary confinement for administrative reasons”.', '19. A decision dated 25 April 1995, which was approved by the Regional Director’s Office and was applicable from 15 May to 15 August 1995, spoke of the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and a “security measure”. The applicant was transferred that day to Fresnes Prison.', '20. A proposal to prolong the measure dated 26 July 1995 cited the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”.', 'On 27 July 1995 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating:', '“Health currently compatible with continued solitary confinement.”', '21. On 11 August 1995 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 August 1995.', '22. On 10 November 1995 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a medical certificate stating that the applicant’s health was satisfactory and compatible with solitary confinement.', 'A further proposal to prolong the measure dated the same day referred to “the undermining of order or discipline in the prison”.', '23. On 20 November 1995 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 November 1995.', '24. A proposal of 24 January 1996 for a further extension referred to “the need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”.', 'On 25 January 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was satisfactory.', '25. On 4 March 1996 the measure was prolonged for a period of three months starting on 15 February 1996.', '26. On 19 April 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention in the segregation unit.', 'On 7 May 1996 the measure was extended for a period of three months commencing on 15 May 1996. A proposal dated 17 April 1996 mentioned a “precautionary or security measure required for one or more of the following reasons: need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”.', '27. It was not until 31 October 1996 that the applicant was notified of the measure applicable for the period from 15 May to 15 August 1996. He made the following observation:', '“I do not think it right that I should be asked to sign more than five months late.”', '28. On 15 July 1996 the applicant was notified of a measure which referred to the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners” and to “international terrorism”.', '29. On 22 October 1996 a doctor from Fresnes Prison issued a certificate stating that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention in solitary confinement.', '30. A decision dated 31 October 1996, which was applicable from 15 November 1996 to 15 February 1997, referred only to the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. The applicant made the following observations on the notification slip:', '“I note that Mr ..., the director, has already replied to these observations, even before I have made them, it is stated below: 07.11.1996 before the Sentence Enforcement Board in the prison. Consequently, the remarks I am required to make have become superfluous. Even so, my solitary confinement is a form of torture.”', 'This measure was authorised by the head of the Prison Service at the Ministry of Justice on 14 November 1996, as were those that followed.', '31. On 17 January 1997 a doctor from the Paris Regional Health Authority certified that he had examined the applicant and found his health to be compatible with solitary confinement.', '32. A proposal made on 20 January 1997 referred to the “need to protect [the applicant] from the rest of the prison population” and the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”. The applicant made the following remarks:', '“I note that I am increasingly subject to this base harassment and am being singled out as a political prisoner. I reject the reasons given for keeping me in solitary confinement.”', '33. On 23 April 1997 a doctor from the Paris Regional Health Authority certified that solitary confinement was not contraindicated for the applicant.', '34. The following reasons were given for a proposal for a further extension dated 25 April 1997:', '“Precautionary or security measure for one or more of the following reasons:', '(i) need to protect you from the rest of the prison population;', '(ii) need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners.”', 'The applicant made the following comments:', '“I have not had a check-up, been weighed or had my blood pressure taken, etc. ... I note that the lower section of the questionnaire has already been filled in, thus making a mockery of the observations which I have been asked to make. Please give me a further complete medical check-up.”', '35. A decision of 21 July 1997 referred in addition to “the undermining of order and discipline in the prison” and “potential dangerousness linked to acts of terrorism”. The applicant made the following comments:', '“I have not had a medical certificate following a medical examination and you are using forged documents which you do not even dare to show me. I request an immediate interview with the governor.”', '36. A decision of 13 August 1997 again cited the “need to prevent communication with one or more other prisoners”.', '37. On 14 October 1997 a doctor at Fresnes Prison issued a certificate certifying that the applicant’s health was satisfactory.', 'Proposals of 21 October 1997 and 23 January 1998 were in the same terms as the decision of 13 August 1997. On signing the proposal of 21 October, the applicant stated:', '“I sign under protest against an unjust repressive measure (decision) against a political prisoner held hostage by the French State.”', '38. On 23 January 1998 a Fresnes Prison doctor issued a certificate certifying that the applicant’s health was satisfactory.', '39. It was followed by a further certificate on 22 April 1998 stating that the applicant was fit enough to remain in solitary confinement and a certificate of 23 July 1998 stating that solitary confinement was not contraindicated. A further certificate drawn up on 21 October 1998 stated that the applicant was in satisfactory health and fit enough to remain in solitary confinement.', '40. Proposals made on 22 April, 23 July and 19 October 1998 cited the need for “precautionary and security measures in view of the prisoner’s character and record”.', 'The applicant commented as follows on the proposal of 22 April 1998:', '“I acknowledge receipt of notice but protest against the renewal of this unjustified measure of vile political repression that has been imposed on me. Please provide me with a copy.”', 'On the proposal of 19 October 1998, he noted:', '“The signature on this notice by the disloyal deputy director Mr V. further attests to the unfairness of repressive measures imposed by a prison service that acts unlawfully against political inmates such as me.”', '41. The measure dated 19 October 1998 referred to “precautionary and security measures in view of the prisoner’s character and record”.', '42. On 15 January 1999 a doctor from La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate in which he stated:', '“The applicant’s health is currently compatible with his continued detention in solitary confinement subject to his receiving psychiatric treatment.”', 'Proposals made on 14 January and 8 April 1999 stated:', '“The prisoner must remain in administrative solitary confinement on order and security grounds, in view of his character and record and the nature of his court cases.”', '43. The Ministry of Justice stated in decisions of 20 January and 20 April 1999:', '“The character of this prisoner, who is an HSP [high-security prisoner] and objectively dangerous, in particular because of the nature and length of the sentence he faces, justifies his continued solitary confinement on order and security grounds.”', '44. On 9 April 1999 the senior doctor at La Santé Prison issued a certificate which read:', '“The circular of December 1998 on solitary confinement states that the opinion of a doctor will only be sought after a year’s confinement. Last certificate issued on (illegible). I do not, therefore, need to append a certificate regarding prolongation to this note.”', '45. On 23 April 1999 another prison doctor certified that the applicant’s health was compatible with his detention or continued detention in solitary confinement.', '46. A further certificate dated 20 July 1999 confirmed that the applicant’s health was compatible with his continued detention in solitary confinement.', '47. A decision of 22 July 1999 cited the following reasons:', '“You must remain in solitary confinement for a further period of three months on order and security grounds, in view of your character, your classification as an HSP, and the nature of your convictions and of the cases currently pending.”', '48. A decision of 25 October 1999, which took effect on 15 November 1999, read as follows:', '“It is necessary to prolong your solitary confinement for a further period of three months in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given the substantial aid potentially at your disposal.”', 'The applicant made the following observations:', '“I note that the infamous masquerade by the Zionist militant Elisabeth Guigou, who runs the French Ministry of Justice on behalf of the imperialist forces that are seeking to reduce France to the level of a suzerain of the United States, continues. To heck with Human Rights and with Law itself. ALLOUHA AKBAR.”', '49. On 1 February 2000 the authorities relied on', '“order and security grounds, in view of your character, your classification as an HSP and the offences for which you have been imprisoned”.', '50. The decisions of 27 April, 20 July and 20 October 2000 were couched in identical terms to the decision of 25 October 1999, save that the end of the sentence read “given your access to outside help”.', '51. On 13 July 2000 the senior doctor at La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate which read:', '“I, the undersigned, ... declare that [the applicant] is in quite astounding physical and mental condition after six years in solitary confinement.', 'However, it is not proper for a patient’s doctor to be required to issue a certificate that ought to be a matter for expert opinion. It is very difficult for a doctor to sanction solitary confinement on administrative, rather than medical, grounds.”', '52. On 3 October 2000 another doctor issued a certificate in the following terms:', '“I, the undersigned, ... certify that I have today examined [the applicant].', 'No clinical examination was carried out. However, in view of his current mental condition, I am unable to give a medical opinion on whether he is fit to remain in solitary confinement.”', '53. On 5 January and 23 January 2001 the Ministry of Justice ratified decisions by the governors of Fleury-Mérogis and La Santé Prisons, dated 30 December 2000 and 22 January 2001 respectively, to place the applicant in solitary confinement after previous orders had automatically lapsed following his transfer.', '54. The following reasons were stated in the decision of 22 January 2001:', '“Regard has been had to your personality, your classification as an HSP, the length of your sentence (LI [life imprisonment]), the nature of the offences and your involvement in an international terrorist network. All these objective indicators of dangerousness make your continued solitary confinement necessary on security grounds.”', '55. On 20 March 2001 a doctor from La Santé Prison certified that she had seen the applicant but had not been able to carry out a physical examination. She added:', '“However, in view of his current mental state, I am unable to give a medical opinion on whether he is fit to remain in solitary confinement.”', 'On 28 March 2001 the applicant commented as follows:', '“I have once again filled in this form, having already done so on 19 March ... I denounce ‘the white torture’ of perpetual solitary confinement which, following the ‘serious provocation of 28 December 2000’, has been aggravated by the obstruction of the fanlight, which now only opens to an angle of 30o (7.5 cm), preventing fresh air getting in. This is on top of the ban on my receiving visits or French lessons, in breach of the undertakings. You are committing a crime of ‘lese-humanity’.”', '56. On 28 March 2001 a doctor from the Cochin Hospital practising in La Santé Prison issued the following certificate:', '“I, the undersigned, ... state that the doctors from the medical service at Paris La Santé Prison are not qualified to judge whether the physical and mental condition of the prisoner Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, who is currently being held in La Santé, is compatible with his continued solitary confinement.”', '57. On 22 April 2001 it was decided to prolong the solitary confinement', '“in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given your access to outside help”.', 'The same reasons were cited in a further extension of 18 June 2001, while a decision of September 2001 was worded in almost identical terms.', '58. On 23 May 2001 the doctor in charge of the Outpatient Consultation and Treatment Unit (“the OCTU”) wrote to the governor of La Santé Prison in these terms:', '“I have met Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez ... as I was asked for an opinion on whether there is any contraindication to this patient’s remaining in solitary confinement.', 'Even though Mr Ramirez Sanchez is in reasonable physical and mental condition, strict solitary confinement for more than six years and nine months is ultimately bound to cause psychological harm.', 'It is my duty as a doctor to alert you to these potential consequences so that you may take an informed decision.', '...”', '59. On 20 June 2001 the doctor who issued the certificate of 20 March 2001 issued a second certificate in similar terms.', '60. The following reasons were stated in a decision that was applicable from 22 July 2001:', '“... in order to preserve order and security in the prison in view of your dangerousness, your ability to influence fellow inmates and the risk of your escaping given your access to outside help.”', '61. On 20 September 2001 the doctor in charge of the OCTU issued a medical certificate after examining the applicant “for the purposes of the medical opinion required for continued solitary confinement”. He stated that the applicant presented', '“a physical and mental condition that was entirely reasonable after seven years in solitary confinement”,', 'adding, however, that', 'this opinion does not constitute an expert opinion, which I am not qualified to give”.', '62. The following reasons were given for prolonging the solitary confinement in a decision of 4 October 2001:', '“It is necessary to prolong your solitary confinement in order to preserve order and security in the prison and to avoid your exerting an influence over your fellow inmates or attempting to escape.”', 'In his observations, the applicant noted in particular:', '“More than seven years of strict solitary confinement, a ban on receiving visits or French lessons and a steady reduction in the amount of fresh air in the isolation cell from which even the old wooden school desk has been removed all serve to demonstrate the unfairness of the repressive measures that have been taken against a revolutionary political leader who will not be broken.”', '63. On 20 December 2001 the measure was renewed for a further three months on the following grounds:', '“Regard has been had to your character, your classification as an HSP, the length of your sentence (LI), the nature of the offences and your involvement in an international terrorist network. All these objective indicators of dangerousness make your continued solitary confinement necessary on security grounds.”', '64. Decisions of 10 January, 25 March and 8 July 2002 read as follows:', '“It is necessary for you to remain in solitary confinement in order to preserve order and security in the prison and to avoid your exerting an influence over your fellow inmates or attempting to escape. The fact that you have received a life sentence, your classification as a high-security prisoner and the nature of the offences for which you have been prosecuted militate in favour of your remaining in solitary confinement.”', '65. On 13 June 2002 an assistant doctor from the OCTU at La Santé Prison issued a medical certificate in the following terms:', '“I, the undersigned, Doctor ..., an assistant doctor from the OCTU at La Santé Prison in Paris, certify that I have examined Mr Ramirez Sanchez Ilich, who was born on 12/10/49, in connection with a request for him to remain in solitary confinement.', 'From the medical standpoint, the problem posed by prolonged solitary confinement over a number of years is that it may affect the prisoner’s physical and mental health.”', '66. On 29 July 2002 the doctor in charge of the OCTU at La Santé Prison provided the Ministry of Health with the following summary of the medical care the applicant was receiving:', '“This patient, who, as you are aware, is in the segregation unit, receives two mandatory medical visits from a member of the OCTU medical team every week, as required by the French Criminal Code.', 'He is currently in excellent somatic health. I am not qualified to express an opinion on his mental health.', 'In addition, Mr Ramirez Sanchez may on request consult members of the OCTU team independently of the mandatory medical visits to the segregation unit.', 'He has thus been able to consult an ophthalmologist ... and has been prescribed corrective glasses.', 'He has consulted a general practitioner several times independently of mandatory visits to the segregation unit on ...', 'Biological tests are performed regularly. ...', 'The treatment Mr Ramirez Sanchez has been receiving can be equated to comfort treatment: ...', 'It should be noted that Mr Ramirez Sanchez has refused any psychological help from the RMPS [Regional Medical and Psychological Service].', '...”', '67. In September 2002 a further decision to prolong the solitary confinement was taken “in order to preserve security and order, which are under serious threat owing to the applicant’s implication in terrorist networks, his dangerousness and the risk of his escaping”.', '68. On 17 October 2002 the applicant was transferred to Saint-Maur Prison (département of Indre), where his solitary confinement ended. On 13 May 2003 he lodged a fresh application with the Court, in which he complained of the new conditions in which he was being held and, in particular, of the distance from Paris.', '69. In June 2003 a book that had been written by the applicant with the help of a journalist was published under the title L’islam révolutionnaire (“Revolutionary Islam”).', '70. On 27 August 2003 the Indre Health Inspector wrote the following letter to the Ministry of Health:', '“Mr Ramirez Sanchez received a somatic and psychiatric medical examination on his arrival at the prison on 17 October 2002.', 'He has at no stage been placed in solitary confinement in Saint-Maur Prison.', 'As regards his somatic health, Mr Ramirez Sanchez receives the statutory care and may consult the OCTU on request.', 'As to his mental health, he was seen by an RMPS psychiatrist as part of the standard induction procedure. No follow-up was prescribed at the time and the patient has not asked to see a psychiatrist since. He was offered an examination and this took place on 26 August 2003. The RMPS have not recommended any follow-up to that appointment.”', '71. On 18 March 2004 the applicant was transferred to Fresnes Prison in the Paris area where he was again placed in solitary confinement. This followed a television programme in which, in the course of a telephone interview with a journalist, the applicant refused among other things to express any remorse for his crimes to the victims on the grounds that there were “no innocent victims”.', '72. On 6 August 2004 a doctor at Fresnes Prison issued a medical certificate in the following terms:', '“I, the undersigned, ... certify that the prolonged period of solitary confinement to which Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, who was born on 12 October 1949, is subject is detrimental to his mental health.', 'Bringing the solitary confinement to an end would go a long way to facilitating the monitoring of a chronic somatic pathology from which the patient has recently started to suffer which requires medical supervision and regular biological tests.”', '73. On 20 December 2005 another doctor issued a medical certificate which read:', '“I, the undersigned, ... regularly see Mr Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, a prisoner in the segregation unit.', 'His continued solitary confinement is damaging his health; it has now lasted for several years and it would appear desirable from the medical standpoint for it to cease.”', '74. On 24 January 2005 the applicant was transferred to Fleury-Mérogis Prison and on 24 November 2005 to La Santé Prison. In both institutions he was kept in solitary confinement with the measure being periodically renewed, including on 17 February 2005 (see below).', '75. On 30 June and 5 October 2005 the senior doctor at the OCTU at Fleury-Mérogis Prison issued two medical certificates in exactly the same terms:', '“I, the undersigned, ... certify that Mr Ramirez Sanchez Ilich, who was born on 12 October 1949, has been in my care since his arrival at the prison.', 'The problems which Mr Ramirez Sanchez has had with his physical health are now stable.', 'Mr Ramirez Sanchez continues to make the same complaints about the difficulties of being held in full solitary confinement.', 'Since he does not wish to be treated by the Regional Medical and Psychological Service at Fleury-Mérogis Prison and I am not qualified to determine the impact of the conditions in which he is detained on his mental state, a medical and psychological assessment would be desirable.', 'Certificate issued at the request of the prison authorities and delivered by hand for whatever purpose it may serve in law.”', '76. On 5 January 2006 the applicant was transferred to Clairvaux Prison, where he is held under the ordinary prison regime.', '77. On 14 September 1996 the applicant lodged an application for judicial review with the Paris Administrative Court, arguing that the decision of 11 July 1996 to place him in solitary confinement should be set aside.', '78. In a judgment of 25 November 1998, which was served on the applicant on 26 January 1999, the Paris Administrative Court rejected the application, holding that the impugned decision was an internal administrative measure which the administrative courts had no power to set aside.', '79. The applicant lodged an application for an order setting aside, on the grounds of formal invalidity, the decision of 17 February 2005 to keep him in solitary confinement. In a judgment of 15 December 2005, the Paris Administrative Court held as follows.', '“Although the authorities argue in their defence that the judge responsible for the execution of sentences gave an oral decision on 4 February 2005 in favour of prolonging Mr Ramirez Sanchez’s solitary confinement, there is no evidence in the file to show that the regional director obtained the opinion of the Sentence Enforcement Board before delivering his reasoned report to the Minister of Justice, even though, by virtue of the aforementioned provisions of Article D. 283-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Board is the only body empowered to decide whether solitary confinement should continue beyond a year. It follows that Mr Ramirez Sanchez’s argument that the decision of 17 February 2005 to prolong his solitary confinement was defective and must be set aside is well-founded.', 'As regards the submissions on the issue of compensation.', 'Although the formal invalidity of a solitary-confinement measure constitutes a fault capable of engaging the State’', 'The investigation shows that Mr Ramirez Sanchez has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of police officers. He has been placed under investigation in connection with various terrorist cases, inter alia, for voluntary homicide and using an explosive device to destroy movable property. The applicant might use communications in Fleury-Mérogis Prison or on the outside to re-establish contact with the members of his terrorist cell or seek to proselytize other prisoners and possibly prepare an escape. That being so, the circumstances of the instant case were such as to justify in law the decision taken to prolong the solitary confinement for a period of three months. The damage alleged by Mr Ramirez Sanchez, which included the loss of contact with other prisoners, cannot, therefore, be considered to have been a consequence of the procedural defect in the decision of 17 February 2005, so that his request for an order requiring the State to compensate him for the damage he claims to have sustained is unfounded. ...”', '“Save in the circumstances set out in Articles D. 136 to D. 147, prison staff must at all times be able to verify a prisoner’s presence.', 'At night it must be possible to light cells when necessary.

THE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT REGIME', '1. European and national recommendations', 'Following its visit to France of 6 to 18 October 1996, the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment recommended that ‘a balance [be struck] between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement type regime’, in view of the harmful consequences that that regime could have on the prisoner. It proposed organising the segregation unit in a way that would give prisoners continued access to better exercise areas and to activities, including outdoor activities.', 'These recommendations tie in with the findings of the working groups that have been set up by or at the request of the Prison Service.', '2. Implementation of the ordinary prison regime', 'In accordance with Article D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime.', '1o Prisoners must be permitted to make full use of their rights of defence, which are protected by instruments of constitutional or international rank, in accordance with the procedure set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure and the distinction it makes between convicted and remand prisoners. The prohibition on communication referred to in Article 145-4 cannot apply to communication with lawyers.', '2o The right to relations with members of one’s family and others are exercised through prison visits. Subject to the arrangements for individual access to the visiting room, there shall be no restrictions on prison visits unless a court has ordered solitary confinement.', 'There must be no restrictions on the right of prisoners in solitary confinement to send or receive correspondence. However, stricter monitoring of correspondence may be justified by court-imposed imperatives, the prisoner’s classification as a high-security risk in accordance with Article D. 276-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, or a recommendation for the prisoner to be placed on suicide watch.', 'Similarly, prisoners’ rights to make telephone calls in penal establishments in accordance with Article D. 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are not suspended by solitary confinement.', '3o There is no general restriction on the right of prisoners in solitary confinement to access to news, subject to the normal supervision prisoners receive throughout their term in prison. Prisoners in solitary confinement retain the right to buy newspapers of their choice, or to use a radio or television subject to the usual conditions.', 'If the library operates a direct-access system, it must arrange special opening hours for prisoners in solitary confinement or keep a separate stock for the segregation unit.', '4o Religious observance.', 'Religious observance in the segregation unit shall take place in accordance with the rules set out in Articles D. 437 to D. 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Since prisoners in solitary confinement are unable to attend the services habitually open to all prisoners, they may be authorised to attend special services arranged in agreement with the chaplain.', '5o Health.', 'The health of prisoners in solitary confinement is dependent on their being detained in conditions that allow them a healthy lifestyle:', '(i) Cells must receive natural light through a window which also affords adequate ventilation, as required by Article D. 350 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '(ii) The exercise yard must provide access to the open air. Consideration must be given to allocating specific times for prisoners in solitary confinement to exercise in an open yard. Exercise periods should be for the same length as for ordinary-regime prisoners.', '(iii) Sporting activities should be made available in the segregation unit, for example by the provision of an exercise bike, gym mat or table-tennis table.', '2.6. Activities in the segregation unit', 'Although access to communal activities provided for ordinary-regime prisoners is suspended during solitary confinement, prisoners in solitary confinement remain under the ordinary regime and special arrangements should be made within the segregation unit for most activities to continue, allowing prisoners to assemble in small groups at times.', 'Thus, whenever possible, the prison governor must permit prisoners in solitary confinement to assemble in groups of two or three for exercise or activities. A room, which may be multipurpose (sport, reading) should be set aside for this purpose. It is for the prison governor to assess how and when such groups may be organised and to tailor the measure to individuals in the light of the reason for the prisoner’s placement in solitary confinement, the aim pursued and the character and conduct of the prisoner or prisoners concerned.', 'Individual educational programmes or distance teaching offered by teachers or instructors should not be discouraged, as they ensure that activities are also directed towards training.', '...', '4. Monitoring of and dialogue with prisoners in solitary confinement', '4.1. Monitoring', 'A record of observation must be compiled for all prisoners in solitary confinement; it will be supplemented by any relevant comments by duty staff or the persons in charge of the unit on the prisoner’s behaviour in solitary confinement.', 'The record of observation acts as an early warning system if it appears that solitary confinement is having harmful effects on the prisoner.', 'Staff should consult it regularly and in any event if it is intended to propose prolonging the measure.', 'A summary of the record of observation will be sent to the regional director and the central authority with the proposal to prolong the measure or in the event of an internal appeal by the prisoner against the original decision or a decision to prolong the measure.', 'All prisons shall be responsible for creating a record of observation meeting the stated objective or, if one already exists, improving it.', '4.2. Dialogue', 'In order to avoid excessive social isolation, it is essential to maintain contact and encourage exchanges between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement. Not only does this reduce the degree of isolation, especially for prisoners who do not receive visits, it also assists in monitoring the prisoner’s character.', 'For the same reasons, senior prison officers and socio-educational staff should seek to meet prisoners in solitary confinement at least as regularly as they do ordinary prisoners.”', '82. 3. Case-law of the Conseil d’Etat', 'In a judgment of 30 July 2003, the Conseil d’Etat departed from its previous case-law when it held:', '“The aforementioned provisions and the evidence before the tribunal of fact show that it is in the very nature of solitary confinement to deprive persons subjected to it of access to the sporting, cultural, teaching and training activities and paid work that are available to other prisoners collectively. Such a measure may be imposed for a period of up to three months and may be prolonged. In these circumstances, even though Article D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states that solitary confinement is not a disciplinary measure, as the prisoners concerned are subject to the ordinary prison regime, a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement against his or her wishes will, in view of the effects it has on the conditions of detention, be amenable to judicial review. Accordingly, the Minister of Justice’s submission that the Administrative Court of Appeal erred in law in declaring admissible an application by Mr X for judicial review of a decision by the governor of Bois d’Arcy Prison to place him in solitary confinement is unfounded.', 'The Administrative Court of Appeal did not err in law when it held that a decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement was one of the decisions for which the first section of the Act of 11 July 1979 requires reasons to be stated. In finding that insufficient reasons had been stated in the impugned decision, the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal reached a decision in its unfettered discretion which, in the absence of any distortion of the facts, cannot be challenged in this Court.', 'It follows from the foregoing that the Minister of Justice is not entitled to make an order setting aside the impugned judgment.', 'It is appropriate in the circumstances of this case to make an order requiring the State to pay Mr X the sum of 2,300 euros he claimed under Article L. 761-1 of the Administrative Courts Code.”', '83. Extracts from the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and the responses of the government of the French Republic (unofficial translation)', 'Report on the visit of 6 to 18 October 1996', '“158. The CPT pays particular attention to prisoners held under conditions akin to solitary confinement. It reiterates that the principle of proportionality requires a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary-confinement regime, which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In any event, it should be as short as possible.', '159. The delegation visited the segregation units in ... and in the remand prisons of Paris-La Santé ... It met a number of prisoners who had been held in solitary confinement for long, and in some instances very long, periods.', '... Furthermore, the solitary-confinement cells in Paris-La Santé Prison could be described as reasonable (cf. paragraphs 100 and 101).', 'As regards the prison regime, which according to the Code of Criminal Procedure is an ordinary regime, the delegation found that the activities remained limited (reading, television, and in some instances in-cell educational or training activities). ... There continued to be little human contact and this took the form of any visits from close relatives or other authorised persons (such as religious representatives) and some daily contact with warders.', 'As regards outdoor exercise, the prison authorities said that a one to three hour walk was authorised every day, although conditions were less than satisfactory.', '160. The CPT pointed out in its report on its first visit that particular attention had to be paid to the mental and physical condition of prisoners in solitary confinement. In paragraph 380 of their interim report, the French authorities indicated that prisoners in solitary confinement were examined twice a week by doctors and that a doctor was called out whenever the condition of a prisoner in solitary confinement demanded. Doctors were required to inform the prison governor in writing if they considered the prisoner’s physical or mental health to be at risk.', 'In that connection, the French authorities informed the delegation that a draft decree (which is due to come into force on 1 December 1996) would establish new rules for gaining access to a doctor and assessing a prisoner’s condition.', '161. As to the other safeguards, it seemed to the delegation from an examination of the relevant files that the procedure for prolonging solitary confinement was rather summary. The manner of its implementation also appears to vary from one region to another. ... At Paris-La Santé Prison, the delegation heard allegations by prisoners in solitary confinement that this was no longer the case. These were credible allegations, since, unlike in Marseille, the delegation found no trace of annotations or headings indicating that prisoners had been informed of the proposal to prolong their solitary confinement. The delegation found virtually no evidence in the files it examined of reports being sent to the commission responsible for the execution of sentences or of the commission issuing opinions as required by the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Furthermore, the only medical certificates relating to the renewal procedure seen by the delegation were stereotyped and extremely brief.', '162. In the light of the foregoing, the CPT recommends that the French authorities:', '(i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact;', '(ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report;', '(iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is prolonged are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds).', 'The CPT would also like to know whether the decree announced by the French authorities has come into force and to receive a copy if it has.”', 'Responses of the government of the French Republic to the 1996 report', 'Observations (interim report)', '“(i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact (paragraph 162)', 'The rules governing solitary confinement are being revised. Articles D. 283-1 and D. 283-2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the circular of 12 July 1981, which are currently in force, need supplementing in order to improve the procedure and to limit the duration of the measure.', 'Draft Article D. 283-1 accordingly places particular emphasis on the need for the medical supervision of prisoners in the segregation unit. It also makes the director of the Prison Service responsible for deciding whether to prolong solitary confinement that has exceeded a year.', 'The entry into force of this Article, which will be included in a vast decree amending more than 300 Articles of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has been delayed, as the decree is part of a governmental programme of State reform.', 'It is intended that a draft circular will be issued when the decree comes into force. It will emphasise that prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime and will give instructions for continued dialogue between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement, in particular through the organisation of regular meetings. The provision of individual teaching or training programmes will also be recommended.', '(ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report (paragraph 162)', 'A draft circular is being prepared.', '(iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is renewed are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds) (paragraph 162)', 'A draft circular is being prepared.”', 'Follow-up report', '“(i) review the arrangements for solitary confinement with a view to providing prisoners with a wider range of activities and ensuring appropriate human contact (paragraph 162)', 'The draft decree referred to in the interim report, which brings the regulatory section of the Code of Criminal Procedure into line with a number of statutes that are already in force, is in the process of promulgation.', 'It will amend, inter alia, Article D. 283-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure by making the director of the Prison Service responsible for deciding whether to prolong solitary confinement that has exceeded a year. It will redirect the focus of medical supervision to its exclusive role of providing prisoner health care.', 'Pursuant to this provision, a draft circular has been drawn up confirming that prisoners in solitary confinement are subject to the ordinary prison regime, which entails, inter alia:', '(a) full compliance with prisoners’ ordinary rights to relations with their family, representatives and others;', '(b) continued dialogue between staff and the prisoner in solitary confinement through regular meetings;', '(c) the organisation, to the extent possible, of special activities in the segregation unit and of individual teaching and training programmes.', 'This draft was prepared after wide consultation of decentralised services. An information and exchange procedure on the issue has thus already been set in motion and will continue with the distribution of the circular, which could be available immediately after publication of the aforementioned decree.', '(ii) ensure that solitary confinement is as short as possible; in that connection, the quarterly review of the need for solitary confinement should entail a full assessment based, if appropriate, on a medical and social report (paragraph 162)', 'The draft circular establishes a mechanism for controlling the length of solitary-confinement measures: before a decision to prolong the measure beyond three months can be taken, the regional director must examine an observation report from the prison governor based, in particular, on his knowledge of the prisoner concerned and the information provided by the various prison departments on the basis of the personal record of observation.', 'Any event with suspensive effect that either entails release or is for a period exceeding fifteen days will result in the lapse of the solitary-confinement measure and the prisoner’s return to ordinary detention.', '(iii) ensure that all prisoners whose solitary confinement is renewed are informed in writing of the reasons for the measure (it being understood that there is no obligation to communicate data which it would be reasonable to exclude on security grounds) (paragraph 162)', 'The draft circular introduces an improved system for the provision of reasons and written notification of decisions to place a prisoner in solitary confinement. The prison governor will not, however, be required to disclose information to a prisoner that may put people or the prison at risk; this has been accepted by the CPT.”', 'report on the visit from 14 to 26 may 2000', '“111. In its reports of both 1991 and 1996 the CPT stressed that the principle of proportionality required that a balance be struck between the requirements of the case and the application of a solitary confinement type regime, which is a step that can have very harmful consequences for the person concerned. Solitary confinement can, in certain circumstances, amount to inhuman and degrading treatment. In any event, it should be as short as possible. Following its visits, the CPT advised of its concerns regarding various aspects of solitary confinement in France (cf. paragraphs 140 et seq., and 158-63 of the reports). Subsequently, in a circular dated 14 December 1998, the Minister of Justice issued instructions concerning, inter alia, the grounds on which prisoners could be placed in solitary confinement, the procedure to be followed and the regime for prisoners in solitary confinement. These instructions address some of the concerns expressed by the CPT in its reports on previous visits.', 'Nevertheless, during its visits the CPT delegation found serious shortcomings in the manner in which the earlier recommendations of the CPT and the ministerial instructions had been implemented in practice.', 'The CPT has serious reservations about the situation of a number of prisoners in solitary confinement for administrative reasons that the delegation met during its visit. Its reservations concern both the length of the confinement (which in some instances had been for years on end) and the highly restrictive regime to which such prisoners are subject (total lack of structured or communal activities).', '112. The physical conditions of detention of prisoners placed in solitary confinement for administrative reasons were globally acceptable. However, the cells accommodating such prisoners at the Paris-La Santé Prison had only limited access to natural light. In addition, in the four institutions visited, the exercise yards – which were often also used by prisoners in solitary confinement for disciplinary reasons – were uninviting.', '113. The ministerial instructions state: ‘The essential features of the ordinary prison regime must, so far as possible and subject to practical constraints, be retained in the segregation unit’ (point 4.1). They further state, inter alia: ‘there shall be no restrictions on prison visits’ (point 4.2.2) and ‘prisoners in solitary confinement remain under the ordinary regime and special arrangements should be made within the segregation unit for most activities to continue, allowing prisoners to assemble in small groups at times’, that ‘it is for the prison governor to assess how and when such groups may be organised’ and ‘individual educational programmes or distance teaching offered by teachers or instructors should not be discouraged’ (point 4.2.6). The instructions further require increased surveillance of prisoners and specify: ‘in order to avoid excessive social isolation, it is essential to maintain contact and encourage exchanges between staff and prisoners in solitary confinement’ (point 4.4.2).', 'From the information obtained by the delegation, it would seem that, with the odd exception (for instance as regards contact with the outside world), the vast majority of the aforementioned requirements have not been complied with. For example, the only establishment which allowed prisoners in solitary confinement for administrative reasons to associate was Lyon-Saint Paul Prison and even there association was restricted (to exercise outdoors and in the fitness room).', 'The CPT recommends that the authorities take measures without delay to give full effect to the Minister of Justice’s instructions of 14 December 1998 concerning solitary confinement for administrative reasons – under paragraphs 4.2.6, 4.2.7 and 4.4.2 in particular.', '114. The CPT also has reservations about the effectiveness of the procedural safeguards on solitary confinement for administrative reasons. The files that have been examined show that it is sometimes used as an alternative to solitary confinement as a disciplinary measure (for instance, in one case, the measure was imposed for: ‘serious damage to property belonging to the prison that put prison security at risk’) or to prolong such a measure and that the reasons stated for putting a prisoner in solitary confinement were often stereotyped (‘to maintain order in the prison’ or ‘risk of escape’). In one case the prisoner had been held in solitary confinement since 1997 ‘because of the nature of the offences of which he had been convicted’.', 'In summary, it would appear that the ministerial instructions, namely ‘Orders for solitary confinement as a precautionary or security measure must be based on genuine grounds and objective concordant evidence of a risk of the prisoner causing or being exposed to serious harm’, are not always fully complied with (cf. point 1.4.2).', 'The CPT recommends that the French authorities carry out a case-by-case review of compliance with the instructions issued in 1998 with regard to solitary confinement for administrative reasons.', '115. Lastly, the CPT understands that the issue of the nature and extent of available remedies has not yet been resolved (cf. paragraph 146 of the report on the 1991 visit). In practice this means that prisoners in solitary confinement currently have no real means of challenging decisions to place them in solitary confinement or to renew such a measure before an independent authority.', 'The CPT recommends the reinforcement of the safeguards provided for prisoners in solitary confinement in order to ensure they have an effective remedy before an independent authority, preferably a judge.

Extracts from the report by Mr Alvaro Gil-Robles, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, on the effective respect for human rights in France following his visit from 5 to 21 September 2005 (published on 15 February 2006)', '“123. ... At the same time, another administrative procedure, which comes fully under the responsibility of the prison administration, is totally lacking in transparency and calls for rapid action on the part of the legislature. This is the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement.', '124. When one visits prisons, and more specifically the disciplinary blocks, one can usually see the solitary confinement blocks close by. Every prison has them. Under the law, any prisoner may be placed in solitary confinement either at his/her own request or as a precautionary or security measure. In some cases, this regime is used to remove prisoners who are troublesome, under suspicion or ringleaders from the other inmates without their having committed a disciplinary offence.', '125. According to the legislation currently in force, solitary confinement is not a disciplinary measure. Prisoners in solitary confinement must be subject to the ordinary prison regime. However, they must not have contact with other prisoners, except by express decision of the prison director, to take part in one-off activities with other solitary confinement prisoners. The movements of solitary confinement prisoners within the prison are organised in such a way that they do not meet anyone on their way. In a few establishments, solitary confinement prisoners may engage in a gainful occupation by doing work in their cells. Usually, however, they do not have access to any gainful activity and are entirely dependent on any funds which may be sent to them from outside. All solitary confinement prisoners may, however, receive visits and exchange correspondence in the normal way.', '126. There is also a stricter solitary confinement regime for prisoners regarded as particularly dangerous ‘because of [their] involvement in organised crime or in a terrorist movement or [their] legal and criminal background’. It is for the prison director to determine which solitary confinement prisoners fall within this category. They are subject to particular security measures. Some are regularly transferred from one prison to another, roughly every six months. They remain constantly in solitary confinement and never mix with other prisoners.', '127. Solitary confinement is usually ordered by the prison director. It may also be ordered by an investigating judge in the course of an investigation. Here I should like to dwell on the administrative procedure for which the prison director is responsible, because I feel that it raises a number of issues likely to undermine respect for the fundamental rights of persons placed in solitary confinement.', '128. It emerged from most of my discussions with prisoners, lawyers, representatives of the prison administration and voluntary organisations that the procedure for placing prisoners in solitary confinement depends entirely on an administrative decision by the prison director. There are no legislative provisions or regulations governing this procedure which guarantee the rights of those subject to it, particularly by ensuring that they are given a hearing and the assistance of a lawyer.', '129. In principle, there is general legislation which should govern this situation. This is Article 24 of the Law of 12 April 2000 on the rights of citizens in their dealings with the public administration. Under this provision, representatives of government bodies who intend to take an administrative decision against an individual citizen must in principle notify the person concerned in writing with sufficient advance notice, specifying the reasons for the procedure. The person in question must have the opportunity to submit written observations or, if he/she so wishes, oral observations and has the right to be assisted by a lawyer or a representative (approved or not). He/she may also have access to his/her file.', '130. Clearly, the decision to place a prisoner in solitary confinement would normally be covered by this. However, we were told that this legislation has remained inoperative where solitary confinement is concerned. At present, therefore, the prison director retains sole discretion where solitary confinement is concerned.', '131. According to what we heard in the course of our discussions, at present the prisoners concerned are usually informed immediately before the hearing of the intention to place them in solitary confinement. They usually only have an hour in which to prepare their observations before being given a hearing, without any legal assistance, by the prison director. I believe that, as things stand, this procedure must be described as being contrary to the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT). Furthermore, the purely administrative and non-adversarial nature of this procedure greatly increase the risk of abuses of prisoners’ rights. I therefore feel that there is currently a real need to introduce legislation or regulations bringing this procedure into line with European standards.', '132. Furthermore, it is particularly disturbing to see that solitary confinement may be ordered for an indefinite period, despite its frequently harmful effects on the mental state of the persons subjected to it. The initial period of solitary confinement ordered by the prison director may not exceed three months. It may be extended beyond that period only after a report to the Sentence Enforcement Board and following a decision by the regional director of prisons. In exceptional cases, solitary confinement may be extended beyond one year following an initial decision by the Minister for Justice. In such cases, the prison director compiles a file including, among other things, the opinion of the prison doctor and of the Sentence Enforcement Board. The minister is responsible for subsequent extensions, for three months at a time, in accordance with the same procedure.', '133. As may be seen, this procedure is entirely administrative. At present, there is no judicial involvement whatsoever. Yet it is a particularly serious measure, because, although it is not recognised as punishment, the solitary confinement regime imposes significant material restrictions on prisoners’ rights, not to mention its psychological impact. During the visit, I had the opportunity to talk with persons placed in solitary confinement. Some complained about the harshness of their living conditions. According to them, being unable to communicate with anyone for long periods, sometimes well in excess of a year, is hard to bear. Prisoners placed in solitary confinement have no effective administrative remedy at their disposal, and most of those I spoke to regard solitary confinement as a disguised disciplinary punishment. In the course of the visit I met people who had been in total solitary confinement for several years.', '134. It is difficult not to agree with them when you see some of the restrictions placed on solitary confinement prisoners. In view of the fact that one of the requirements of the solitary confinement regime is that the prisoners concerned should have no contact with other prisoners, it is very difficult to allow them to exercise the rights vested in all prisoners not subject to a disciplinary punishment, which should clearly be the case for those in solitary confinement. For example, to allow them to use the library or a sports hall, care must be taken to ensure that no one else enters these premises at the same time. As we know, owing to prison overcrowding, it is already quite difficult to ensure access for ordinary prisoners to these services. Most of those I spoke to therefore complained that it was impossible for them to exercise the rights to which they should normally be entitled. The same applies to the possibility of engaging in a gainful occupation. In theory, prisoners in solitary confinement are entitled to that, but in practice they may only do so inside their own cell, which is highly problematical in view of the scarcity of work opportunities in general.', '135. Lastly, the exercise areas available to this category of prisoners are usually the same as those used by the prisoners in the disciplinary block. We visited one such area at Fleury-Mérogis short-stay prison. It is located on the roof of one of the prison buildings, closed in by concrete walls on all sides and covered by wire netting. It is so small that it is more a room in the open air than anything else.', '136. I should like to stress that we are talking here about people who are not subject to a disciplinary measure. Furthermore, the fact that a person is left deprived of the rights secured to every prisoner is purely the result of an administrative decision against which it is difficult to appeal. I therefore call on the French authorities to take rapid action to bring solitary confinement into line with European standards, in particular those upheld by the CPT. I think there is a need for legislative provisions or regulations to govern the solitary-confinement procedure. The adversarial system already introduced for disciplinary punishments should apply to the solitary-confinement procedure. Lastly, I think it would be in keeping with the spirit of the principle of legal certainty if a judicial body were henceforth able to participate in the procedure, for example the judge responsible for sentence enforcement.', '137. Furthermore, without waiting for legislative reform, the authorities should act to ensure that prisoners in solitary confinement are able to participate in organised activities, particularly as regards work, culture and sports. Their walks and outdoor sports activities should be organised as soon as possible in appropriate places intended for the prison population as a whole, and not for prisoners being held in disciplinary cells. Excluding prisoners from these activities amounts to a disguised punishment. Such changes are bound to lighten the already quite heavy atmosphere which I found in the places of detention visited.', '...”']",['13'],[],[],['3'],[],[],1

The applicant is a public limited company whose registered office is in Hamburg. It publishes the Bild, a daily newspaper with a large circulation. The present case concerns the publication by the newspaper of two articles about X, a well-known television actor. Between May 1998 and November 2003 X had played the part of Police Superintendent Y, the hero of a television series broadcast on a private television channel in the evenings, until 2005. By October 2004, 103 episodes had been broadcast, the last 54 of which had starred X in the role of Police Superintendent Y. The average audience rating was 18% (between 3 and 4,700,000 viewers per episode).', '10. On 14 June 2003 the applicant company revealed that X had been convicted of unlawful possession of drugs. After receiving a warning from X, it undertook, on pain of an agreed penalty, to refrain from publishing information according to which four grams of cocaine had been found at X’s home that he had had sent to him by post from Brazil and for which he had been given a prison sentence, suspended for five months, and fined 5,000 euros (EUR).', '11. At approximately 11 p.m. on 23 September 2004 X was arrested at the Munich beer festival (Oktoberfest) for possession of cocaine. In a sworn statement (eidesstattliche Versicherung) a journalist from the applicant company declared that she had asked the police present at the scene whether X had been arrested and, if so, on what grounds. The police had confirmed that X had been arrested in the Käfer tent in possession of cocaine, without giving any further details.', '12. According to that statement, the journalist had then contacted the public prosecutor, W., from the public prosecutor’s office of Munich Regional Court I, in charge of relations with the press, and had asked him for information. W. had confirmed that X had been arrested in the Käfer tent in possession of cocaine. According to W., plain-clothes police officers had arrested X because they had seen him making a suspicious movement with his hand when coming out of the toilets. The officers had searched him, and, having found him to be in possession of an envelope containing 0.23 grams of cocaine, had arrested him. According to W., the arrest had taken place at approximately 11 p.m. on 23 September and a criminal complaint was currently being investigated.', '13. In its 29 September 2004 edition, the applicant company’s daily newspaper, the Bild, published the following headline in large type on its front page:', '“Cocaine! Superintendent Y caught at the Munich beer festival.”', 'The article, which was printed in small type, read as follows:', '“He came out of the gents tapping his nose suspiciously and was arrested! At the beer festival the police caught X (... years old, Superintendent Y on television), in possession of a small envelope of cocaine. See page 12 for the details.”', 'The following headline appeared on page twelve of the daily:', '“TV star X caught in possession of cocaine. A bretzel (Brezn), a beer mug [containing a litre of beer – Maß] and a line of coke (Koks).”', 'The article, printed in small type, read as follows:', '“Thursday night, 11 p.m. At the beer festival there was drinking, partying, swaying arm in arm. And sniffing.... In the celebrities’ tent the TV star X (... years old, whose real name is ...) came out of the gents tapping his nose and attracting the attention of police officers. They searched the star actor from the TV series Y (of which, by June, there had been more than 60 episodes in five years). COCAINE! X had a packet on him containing 0.23 grams of coke, and was arrested. Public prosecutor W. from Munich told the Bild: “He was making suspicious movements with his hand, tapping his nose with his fingers. This of course attracted the attention of our officers. An investigation is under way. Only a small quantity of cocaine is involved though. W. : “Right in the middle of the festival grounds (Wiesn) – it might have been snuff tobacco, but our men have a flair for this sort of thing...”. X had already had a run-in with the law for possession of drugs. In July 2000 the Superintendent from the TV series had been given a five-month suspended prison sentence and two years’ probation and fined EUR 5,000. He was accused of illegally importing drugs. On a trip to Brazil X had arranged for four grams of cocaine to be sent to his address in Munich. His probation period ended two years ago. The quantity of the drug found in the tent ... is negligible. What can the actor expect? According to a legal expert questioned by Bild: “Even if the probation period is over the previous conviction is recent. X may get an unsuspended prison sentence – up to six months”. Why prison? “X has apparently not been sufficiently daunted by the suspended prison sentence”. The actor has probably had to submit to a forensic head hair examination. Each centimetre of hair will enable the expert to determine whether and how much cocaine was taken. Yesterday X refused to comment. P.S: “In every toilet cubicle in the tent ... there are signs saying: “The use of drugs is liable to prosecution!”', 'The article was accompanied by three photos of X, one on the first page and the other two on page twelve.', '14. On the same day, during the morning, press agencies and other newspapers and magazines reported on X’s arrest, referring in part to the article published in the Bild. That day the prosecutor W. confirmed the facts reported in the Bild to other written media and television channels, two of which (“RTL” and “pro7”) broadcast the same reports that evening. During one of the broadcasts the prosecutor W. made the following statement:', '“The police officers saw X making a suspicious movement with his hand while coming out of the men’s toilets and concluded that he had taken something. They searched him and found an envelope containing 0.213 grams of cocaine. He had already been convicted of importing drugs and given a suspended prison sentence. He is not a first offender (Ersttäter). He should have known that he should not touch drugs. He can now expect a further prison sentence, even if the quantity found on him is insignificant.”', '15. In its 7 July 2005 edition the Bild printed the following headline on its inside pages: “TV series Superintendent X confesses in court to having taken cocaine. He is fined 18,000 euros!”', 'The article read as follows:', '“Munich – On TV he plays a superintendent who puts criminals behind bars. Yesterday, it was the turn of the actor X (... years old, ...) to be hauled up in front of the court and confess! X, who had to explain himself to the Munich District Court [Amtsgericht] on charges of “unlawful possession of drugs”, has confessed to taking drugs! X’s counsel ... stated: “We fully acknowledge the offence with which we have been charged in the indictment”. X confessed to the court: “I have occasionally smoked cannabis and taken cocaine from time to time. This has not made me happy. It had not turned into a habit but is just something that I have done from time to time”. Question from the court ...: “Are you currently taking drugs?” Reply from X: “No, I smoke cigarettes.” The sentence: a fine of EUR 18,000. The court: “The accused’s full confession has counted in his favour.” On TV X continues investigating on the side of law and order. In Vienna he is in front of the cameras for the television series ... which should be starting on the second channel in the autumn.”', 'The article was accompanied by a photo of X.', '16. Immediately after the articles appeared, X. instituted proceedings against the applicant company in the Hamburg Regional Court. The applicant company attached to its initial reply the statement by its journalist (see paragraphs 11 and 12 above) and numerous press articles about X, including a number of interviews given by him, to Bunte magazine among others, together with photos of him.', '17. On 30 September 2004 the Hamburg Regional Court imposed an injunction on publication of the article, following a request lodged by X on 29 September 2004. In a judgment of 12 November 2004 it confirmed the injunction. That judgment was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 28 June 2005.', 'On 6 October 2004 the Regional Court also imposed an injunction on publication of the photos illustrating the article. It confirmed that decision in a judgment of 12 November 2004. The applicant company did not challenge that judgment, which became final.', '18. On 11 November 2005 the Hamburg Regional Court prohibited any further publication of almost the entire first article, on pain of an agreed penalty, under Articles 823 § 1 and 1004 § 1 (by analogy) of the Civil Code (see paragraph 47 below), read in the light of the right to protection of personality rights (Allgemeines Persönlichkeitsrecht). It ordered the applicant company to pay EUR 5,000 as a penalty under the agreement and to reimburse the procedural expenses (EUR 811.88, plus statutory interest accrued from 4 November 2004).', '19. According to the Regional Court, the article in question, which mentioned X’s name and was accompanied by photos of him, amounted to a serious interference with his right to the protection of his personality rights; the disclosure of his criminal conduct had, so to speak, resulted in his being pilloried and discredited in the eyes of the public. The court found that, despite those negative effects, reporting of that kind would nonetheless have been lawful in the event of serious crimes that were part of contemporary society and on which the press was entitled to report. Any interference with a criminal’s private sphere was limited, however, by the proportionality principle, which involved a balancing exercise between the competing interests. The court held that in the present case the right to protection of X’s personality rights prevailed over the public’s interest in being informed, even if the truth of the facts related by the daily had not been disputed. Neither the nature of the crime committed, nor the person of X, nor any other circumstances justified publication of the article at issue.', '20. The court observed that whilst a drugs-related offence was not a petty crime, particularly as in the present case it had been cocaine, which was a hard drug, X had been in possession of only a small quantity of that drug and had not been accused of drug trafficking. The type of offence involved was of medium, or even minor, seriousness, was a very common one and there was no particular public interest in knowing about it. The court added that, unlike serious crimes (such as spectacular robberies, or murders), there were no particular circumstances distinguishing the offence in question from ordinary crimes, even if there was an assumption that drug abuse was more widespread amongst key figures from the arts world and the media than in other circles. Furthermore, the way in which the report had been made by the applicant company confirmed that the offence itself was not an important one. The report had focussed more on X’s person than on the offence, which would probably never have been reported in the press if it had been committed by a person unknown to the public. Similarly, the court pointed out, whilst X’s previous conviction for a similar offence was such as to increase the public’s interest, it was his only previous conviction and, moreover, dated back several years.', '21. The court also found that publication of the articles in question was not justified by the person of X. The public did admittedly show an interest in Police Superintendent Y, a character in a relatively popular television series, but not in the actual person of the actor playing the part. There was nothing to suggest that X attracted the attention of the public on account of his performance as an actor or other activities bringing him within a circle of persons about whom the public had a need for regular information. The interest in X did not, in any event, go beyond the interest habitually manifested by the public in leading actors in German television series.', '22. The court observed that the applicant company had published many articles about X over a period of six years and particularly over the last three years. The vast majority of these publications had, however, merely mentioned X’s name – often without a photo – among the names of celebrities invited to various events. Whilst it was undisputed that X had taken part in over 200 national and international cinematographic and televised productions, that did not convey much of an idea of his public importance. Indeed, actors could have starred in hundreds of television series and still remain little known to the public. There was no evidence that X had made a name for himself on account of any particular performance or that he had occupied a prominent position in society which had brought him into the public eye.', '23. X had, to an extent, sought to attract the public’s attention by giving interviews to certain magazines between 2000 and 2003. He therefore had to be more tolerant towards reports published about him than other wellknown figures who avoided the limelight. According to the court, X had not, however, courted the public to a degree that he could be considered to have implicitly waived his right to the protection of his personality rights.', '24. The Regional Court conceded that the fact that the actor had broken the law whereas on television he played the role of a superintendent entrusted with crime prevention was more entertaining for the public than if the actor had played any other kind of role. However, that contrast between the television role and the personal lifestyle of the actor did not mean that the public confused the latter with the fictional character. The actor merely donned the persona of a superintendent, just as he could don that of any other character, without thereby adopting the conduct of the character in question in his daily life. The fact that an actor did not adopt the lifestyle of the character he played could not in any way be regarded as an extraordinary event worthy of being reported. In the court’s view, viewers could distinguish between the actor and his role, even where the actor was well known essentially for playing one particular character.', '25. The Regional Court found, further, that X had not sought to portray himself as an emblem of moral virtue; neither had he adopted a stand on matters relating to drug abuse. The interviews reported by the applicant company contained no comment by X on the subject. In issue no. 48/2003 of the magazine Bunte, X had stated, in passing, that he did not have any alcohol in the house and that he had become a big tea connaisseur. In the court’s view, the fact that X had briefly remarked on his previous conviction in two interviews with magazines in 2000 and 2001 did not mean that he had portrayed himself as an advocate or critic of the fight against drugs or as an expert in the field. That subject had been only marginally covered in the interview, which had mainly concerned the actor’s professional prospects and his difficulties in his relationships.', '26. Observing that when balancing the competing interests, the decisive criteria were how well known X was and the seriousness of the offence with which he was charged, the Regional Court found that the case concerned an actor who was not exceptionally well known and was accused of an offence which, while not insignificant, was not particularly spectacular and could be regarded as fairly common in the entertainment world. The public did not therefore have a great interest in being informed of an event that was actually fairly anodyne, whereas the information published amounted to a serious (gravierend) interference with X’s right to the protection of his personality rights.', '27. The Regional Court found, lastly, that the applicant company was not justified in arguing that the publication of the article was lawful because it pursued legitimate interests. Admittedly, the press officer from the public prosecutor’s office at the Munich Regional Court I had informed a large number of media reporters of the offence with which X had been charged and had disclosed his identity to them; nor was there any doubt that the public prosecutor’s office could be regarded as a “privileged source” (privilegierte Quelle) of information that did not, as a general rule, require verification as to the truth of its content. Moreover, three press agencies had disclosed similar details. However, even assuming that it had received all the information before publishing the article in question, the applicant company could only conclude that the published information was true and was not thereby absolved from the requirement to check whether its publication was justified in terms of X’s right to protection of his personality rights. In the court’s opinion, the question of the veracity of information issued by a public authority had to be distinguished from that of the lawfulness of the subsequent publication of that information by the press.', '28. The court found that it could be presumed that institutions providing a public service, and in particular the public prosecutor’s office and the police, made every effort, in accordance with the principle of neutrality, not to issue information unless the public interest in doing so had been carefully weighed against that of the persons concerned. However, such institutions were not necessarily in a better position than a publisher to weigh the conflicting interests at stake regarding the dissemination of the information through the media.', '29. In the instant case the applicant company was actually better placed than a member of the Munich public prosecutor’s office to judge the degree to which X was known and the question regarding whether the public had an interest in learning of his arrest. On that point the court considered that account also had to be taken of the context in which the information was published: the public services were not in a position to anticipate every possible form of dissemination of factual information in any foreseeable context or to foresee whether a report mentioning the person’s name was justified or not. Accordingly, publishers could not generally consider that the disclosure of a person’s identity by a privileged source would make any kind of report on the person concerned legal, without having first balanced the interests at stake.', '30. The Regional Court pointed out that there were situations in which there may be doubts regarding the assessment by the public authorities. Accordingly, in the case of X, the question arose as to whether it was appropriate for the public prosecutor’s office to have expressed an opinion on the sentence that X could expect to receive when the criminal investigation had only just started. The court concluded that the applicant company could not argue that it had relied on the disclosure of X’s name by the public prosecutor’s office.', '31. On 21 March 2006 the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company, but reduced the amount of the agreed penalty to EUR 1,000. It upheld the conclusions of the Regional Court, pointing out that the disclosure of a suspect’s name when reporting on an offence constituted, as a general rule, a serious infringement of the right to the protection of personality rights, even if it was a drug offence of medium or minor seriousness. In X’s case the fact of informing the public that he had taken cocaine could adversely affect his future prospects of securing acting roles and, in particular, of obtaining a role in an advertisement or in television series aimed at a young audience.', '32. The Court of Appeal reiterated the relevant criteria when balancing the rights of the press against the right to protection of personality rights, as established by the Federal Court of Justice (see paragraph 48 below). It confirmed that the nature of the offence and the exact circumstances in which it had been committed made it an everyday offence and would not have aroused any interest if the perpetrator had been little known. In the court’s opinion, the possession and consumption of low quantities of drugs did not have adverse effects on third parties or on the general public. As X had not taken cocaine in the tent in front of everyone, his conduct did not imperil a young audience that might be likely to imitate him on account of his being a well-known television star.', '33. The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the public had a particular interest in being informed and entertained because X was a well-known figure and had played the part of a police superintendent over a long period of time (längerer Zeitraum). However, even if X played that role, this did not mean that he had himself necessarily become an idol or role model as a law-enforcement officer, which could have increased the public’s interest in the question whether in his private life he actually behaved like his character. It was clear that the actor X could not be identified with the fictitious character of Superintendent Y that he played. The fact that X had his fan clubs and had made public appearances as the actor who played the part of Superintendent Y did not alter that finding. It could well be that X’s appearance, his manner of presenting himself, and the relaxed attitude portrayed in his films appealed to others, particularly a young audience. That did not mean, though, that others saw in him a moral role model whose image should be corrected by the newspaper report in question.', '34. The publications submitted by the applicant company were indeed evidence that X was hugely popular, but did not support the contention that he had used confessions about his private life to attract the public’s attention. Nor was the newspaper report justifiable on the ground that X had been arrested in public, in a tent, because the drug had actually been consumed in the men’s toilets, that is, in a place that fell within the protected private sphere, and out of public view. Lastly, even if it were to be established that X’s arrest was a matter of substantial public interest, the same could not be said of the description and characterisation of the offence committed out of public view.', '35. Lastly, while upholding the conclusions of the Regional Court regarding the role of the Munich public prosecutor’s office, the Court of Appeal stated that the applicant company’s liability did not extend beyond minor negligence given that the information disclosed by the public prosecutor’s office had led it to believe that the report was lawful. The illegal disclosure by the public prosecutor’s office did not, however, make publication by the applicant company legal. The Court of Appeal accordingly reduced the agreed penalty to EUR 1,000. It refused leave to appeal on points of law because its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice.', '36. On 7 November 2006 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law.', '37. On 11 December 2006 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions (Anhörungsrüge). It stated that when balancing the public’s interest in being informed about public criminal proceedings against an interference with the defendant’s private sphere, the Court of Appealcision in accordance with the criteria established in its case-law. There was no evidence that the relevant criteria for the balancing exercise had been disregarded. The Federal Court of Justice stated that the fact that the civil courts had found against the applicant company did not permit the latter to lodge an appeal on points of law and did not amount to a violation of the right to be heard.', '38. On 15 August 2005 the Hamburg Regional Court granted an application by X for an injunction against any further publication of the second article.', '39. By a judgment of 5 May 2006, the Regional Court granted X’s application in the main proceedings, ordered the applicant company to refrain from any further publication of the second article on pain of penalty and ordered it to pay EUR 449.96 in costs, plus statutory interest accrued from 22 September 2005. It based its decision on essentially the same grounds as those set out in its judgment of 11 November 2005 (see paragraphs 18-30 above). It stated that the case in question had to be distinguished from the one that had been the subject of the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice of 15 November 2005 (see paragraph 48 below) in that the person concerned in that case, Prince Ernst August von Hannover, was much more widely known than X, so the press had been entitled to report on the substantial penalty imposed in that case.', '40. On 12 September 2006 the Hamburg Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the applicant company on essentially the same grounds as those given in its judgment of 21 March 2006 (see paragraphs 31-35 above). On the subject of the relevant criteria for weighing the conflicting interests, it stated that, according to the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court of 13 June 2006 (see paragraph 49 below), the fact that a person was a prominent figure or one known to the public was not a sufficient factor in itself to justify the existence of an interest on the part of the public in being informed of his or her conduct. In the present case, the public’s interest in being informed and entertained, which derived from the fact that X was a well-known figure and starred as a superintendent in a television series, was insufficient to justify the interference with his right to decide for himself which information he was willing to disclose (informationelle Selbstbestimmung).', '41. The applicant company’s reliance on the high audience rating of the television series Y. did not, in the Court of Appeal’s opinion, prove that X. had served as a role model or a counter model. If a role model existed for millions of viewers, the role model in question was the character of the superintendent. The Court of Appeal reiterated that the fact that X. had been arrested in a public place did not make the newspaper article lawful because the offence itself had been committed out of public view, in the men’s toilets. The suspicious movement that X had made with his hand had admittedly attracted the attention of the police at the scene, but it had not been established that other persons present in the tent had noticed that X had taken cocaine.', '42. The Court of Appeal added that whilst the fact that the “quality press” had reported the case might indicate that there was a not insignificant (nicht geringes) interest in reporting it, that was not a basis on which to conclude that the interference with X’s right to the protection of his personality rights had been lawful.', '43. The Court of Appeal refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that its judgment did not conflict with the case-law of the Federal Court of Justice, in particular the latter’s judgment of 15 November 2005 (see paragraph 48 below).', '44. On 17 April 2007 the Federal Court of Justice refused the applicant company leave to appeal on points of law on the ground that the case did not raise a question of fundamental importance and was not necessary for the development of the law or to guarantee uniformity of the case-law. On 12 June 2007 it dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant company claiming that it had not had a sufficient opportunity to make submissions.', '45. On 5 March 2008 a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court declined to entertain constitutional appeals lodged by the applicant company against the court decisions delivered in the first and second sets of proceedings. It stated that it was not giving reasons for its decision.', '46. On 12 September 2006 and 29 January 2008 the Hamburg Regional Court ordered the applicant company to pay X two penalty payments of EUR 5,000, each one for having breached the order of 15 August 2005 (see paragraph 38 above). The court criticised the applicant company for, inter alia, publishing in the 7 July 2006 edition of the daily newspaper Die Welt and on the newspaper’s internet page (welt.de) on 22 March 2007 the following statement by one of its editors:', '“Accordingly, we had no right whatsoever to report on the trial of the popular actor X for possession of cocaine, even though he was a very well-known recidivist and the offence was committed at the beer festival in Munich.”', '47. Article 823 § 1 of the Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gestezbuch) provides that anyone who, intentionally or negligently, unlawfully infringes another’s right to life, physical integrity, health, freedom, property or other similar right, shall be liable to make compensation for the resulting damage.', 'In accordance with Article 1004 § 1, where another’s property is damaged otherwise than by removal or illegal retention the owner may require the perpetrator to cease the interference. If there are reasonable fears that further damage will be inflicted, the owner may seek an injunction.', '48. In its judgment of 15 November 2005 (no. Vi ZR 286/04) the Federal Court of Justice reiterated its established case-law according to which the decisive criteria for evaluating the lawfulness of a news report mentioning the name of the person concerned were the nature of the offence and the person of the suspect. The facts of the case were a fine and a prohibition on driving imposed by the French courts for speeding on a motorway (211 instead of 130 km per hour) on a person known to the public. The Federal Court of Justice found, firstly, that the speed limit had been exceeded to such an extent that it could be regarded as an expression of extreme contempt for the highway regulations, and, secondly, that the offence had put other motorists at considerable risk. Moreover, both the manner in which the person concerned had behaved in public in the past and his origins and the fact that he was the husband of a very well-known individual meant that the interest of the press in publishing a news report prevailed over the right to protection of the personality rights of the person concerned. The Federal Court of Justice pointed out that the Court’s judgment in the case of Von Hannover v. Germany of 24 June 2004 (no. 59320/00, ECHR 2004VI) allowed of no other conclusion. The articles (and photos) in that case had concerned only scenes from Caroline von Hannover’s daily life, and had aimed merely to satisfy the curiosity of a particular readership regarding her private life.', '49. In a decision of 13 June 2006 (no. 1 BvR 565/06), a three-judge panel of the Federal Constitutional Court decided not to entertain a constitutional appeal lodged against the judgment of the Federal Court of Justice and upheld the latter’s findings.', '50. The relevant passages of Recommendation (Rec(2003)13 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings, adopted on 10 July 2003 at the 848th meeting of the Ministers’ Deputies, read as follows:-', '“...', 'Recalling that the media have the right to inform the public due to the right of the public to receive information, including information on matters of public concern, under Article 10 of the Convention, and that they have a professional duty to do so;', 'Recalling that the rights to presumption of innocence, to a fair trial and to respect for private and family life under Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention constitute fundamental requirements which must be respected in any democratic society;', 'Stressing the importance of media reporting in informing the public on criminal proceedings, making the deterrent function of criminal law visible as well as in ensuring public scrutiny of the functioning of the criminal justice system;', 'Considering the possibly conflicting interests protected by Articles 6, 8 and 10 of the Convention and the necessity to balance these rights in view of the facts of every individual case, with due regard to the supervisory role of the European Court of Human Rights in ensuring the observance of the commitments under the Convention;', '...', 'Recommends, while acknowledging the diversity of national legal systems concerning criminal procedure, that the governments of member states:', '1. take or reinforce, as the case may be, all measures which they consider necessary with a view to the implementation of the principles appended to this recommendation, within the limits of their respective constitutional provisions,', '...', 'Appendix to Recommendation Rec(2003)13', 'Principles concerning the provision of information through the media in relation to criminal proceedings', 'Principle 1 - Information of the public via the media', 'The public must be able to receive information about the activities of judicial authorities and police services through the media.

Particular protection should be given to parties who are minors or other vulnerable persons, as well as to victims, to witnesses and to the families of suspects, accused and convicted. In all cases, particular consideration should be given to the harmful effect which the disclosure of information enabling their identification may have on the persons referred to in this Principle.”', '51. The relevant passages of this resolution, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly on 26 June 1998, read as follows:-', '“...', '6. The Assembly is aware that personal privacy is often invaded, even in countries with specific legislation to protect it, as people’s private lives have become a highly lucrative commodity for certain sectors of the media. The victims are essentially public figures, since details of their private lives serve as a stimulus to sales. At the same time, public figures must recognise that the special position they occupy in society - in many cases by choice - automatically entails increased pressure on their privacy.', '7. Public figures are persons holding public office and/or using public resources and, more broadly speaking, all those who play a role in public life, whether in politics, the economy, the arts, the social sphere, sport or in any other domain.', '8. It is often in the name of a one-sided interpretation of the right to freedom of expression, which is guaranteed in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights, that the media invade people’s privacy, claiming that their readers are entitled to know everything about public figures.', '9. Certain facts relating to the private lives of public figures, particularly politicians, may indeed be of interest to citizens, and it may therefore be legitimate for readers, who are also voters, to be informed of those facts.', '10. It is therefore necessary to find a way of balancing the exercise of two fundamental rights, both of which are guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights: the right to respect for one’s private life and the right to freedom of expression.', '11. The Assembly reaffirms the importance of every person’s right to privacy, and of the right to freedom of expression, as fundamental to a democratic society. These rights are neither absolute nor in any hierarchical order, since they are of equal value.', '12. However, the Assembly points out that the right to privacy afforded by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights should not only protect an individual against interference by public authorities, but also against interference by private persons or institutions, including the mass media.', '13. The Assembly believes that, since all member states have now ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, and since many systems of national legislation comprise provisions guaranteeing this protection, there is no need to propose that a new convention guaranteeing the right to privacy should be adopted. ...”']",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1920 and lives in Katowice, Poland.', '5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '6. Since 1965, the applicant’s relatives, Z.D. and L.D, have occupied a part of the applicant’s property, with the agreement of the applicant. It appears that Z.D. and L.D. carried out construction work on the property which provoked a conflict between them and the applicant.', '7. On 4 January 1994 the applicant lodged a civil action with the Katowice District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) in which he asked the court to order the eviction of Z.D. and L.D from his property.', '8. On 31 January 1994 the trial court held a hearing at which it gave a default judgment (wyrok zaoczny). The court allowed the applicant’s action and ordered that the judgement be immediately enforceable.', '9. The defendants lodged an objection against the judgment.', '10. On 7 March 1994 the Katowice District Court held a hearing at which it allowed the applicant’s motions to hear witnesses and to hold a viewing of the property. Subsequently, the trial court requested a copy of the casefile concerning another set of civil proceedings instituted by the defendants against the applicant.', '11. On 27 April 1994 the court decided to stay the proceedings until the termination of the second set of proceedings, instituted by the defendants, in which they claimed that they had acquired the title to the property in question by prescription (stwierdzenie nabycia własności poprzez zasiedzenie).', '12. The applicant appealed against the decision to stay the proceedings; however, on 6 July 1994 the Katowice Regional Court dismissed his appeal.', '13. Subsequently on several occasions, the applicant applied to resume the proceedings.', '14. In August 1994, February 1995, February, June, October and December 1996 and May 1997 the trial court requested the Second Division of the Katowice District Court to provide information concerning the state of the proceedings concerning the acquisition of property by prescription.', '15. On 10 October 1997 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings. He submitted that the second set of proceedings for acquisitive prescription had ended on 24 September 1997 with the secondinstance court’s decision.', '16. On 15 October 1997 the Katowice District Court allowed his application and resumed the proceedings.', '17. At the hearing held on 9 December 1997 the defendants informed the court that the second set of proceedings was still pending because they had lodged a cassation appeal. Consequently, on 12 January 1998, the District Court again decided to stay the proceedings.', '18. The applicant appealed against this decision, but on 23 March 1998 his appeal was rejected as he had failed to pay the fees for the appeal.', '19. Subsequently, the applicant applied to the court to issue a writ of enforcement of the default judgment of 31 January 1994. On 22 May 1998 the Katowice District Court dismissed his application on the grounds that the proceedings were stayed.', '20. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision.', '21. On 8 October 1998 the Katowice Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) quashed the decision of 22 May 1998 and remitted the application concerning the writ of enforcement for reconsideration.', '22.

On 12 January 1999 the court allowed the application and resumed the proceedings.', '24. On 26 February 1999 the Katowice District Court held a hearing and gave judgment. It upheld the default judgment of 31 January 1994 and suspended the enforcement order.', '25. The defendants lodged an appeal against the judgment with the Katowice Regional Court.', '26. On 17 December 1999 the appellate court stayed the proceedings because the defendants had instituted yet another set of proceedings against the applicant. They sought a judgment stipulating that the applicant was obliged to make a declaration of will (oswiadczenie woli) in the form of a consent to the sale of the property in question. The Regional Court found that the proceedings for eviction should be stayed as the determination of the case depended on the outcome of this third set of proceedings.', '27. In March 2001 the applicant applied to resume the proceedings.', '28. Several times in 2001 and 2002 the trial court requested information regarding the state of the third set of proceedings.

The school was owned by a limited liability company, G., of which the applicant and three other teachers were members and Mr G. the manager.', ""8. In July 1998 Mrs C. lodged a criminal complaint with the Revenue Police (Guardia di Finanza) about irregularities in the management of the school's affairs. She stated that she was a de facto member of G."", ""9. The Syracuse public prosecutor's office opened an investigation in respect of the members and manager. On 20 July 1998 the Revenue Police searched the company's head office and the members' homes. At that time the applicant received official notification that she was under investigation."", ""On an unspecified date the public prosecutor's office ordered the applicant to be questioned and informed her that she and the other persons charged were suspected of committing extortion, fraud and forgery. On 12 August 1998 the Revenue Police questioned the applicant."", ""10. On 17 November 1998 the public prosecutor's office asked the investigating judge to issue an arrest warrant against the applicant and certain other persons on charges of criminal association, tax evasion and forgery of official documents."", 'On 28 November 1998 the investigating judge ordered Mrs Sciacca and the other persons charged to be placed under house arrest.', ""11. On 4 December 1998 the applicant was served with the judge's decision. Like anyone placed under house arrest, she avoided being remanded in custody. However, the Revenue Police compiled a file on her; photographs and fingerprints were included in it. On the same day the deputy public prosecutor responsible for the investigation and officers from the Revenue Police gave a press conference."", '12. Two newspapers published articles about the investigation.', ""13. The first daily, Giornale di Sicilia, published two articles, on 5 and 6 December 1998. In the first one it referred to “alleged formal and substantive illegalities in the management of a private school”. After stating that the applicant and three others, who had been placed under house arrest, had been charged with very serious offences (criminal association, extortion, forgery, fraud and tax evasion), the newspaper indicated that other persons charged “were allegedly also” victims of acts of extortion committed by the four people who had been arrested. After outlining the measures taken by the investigators, the newspaper stated that the four people who had been placed under house arrest “were allegedly” the de facto managers of the school. The newspaper went on to explain what the extortion had consisted of. It added that “unofficial accounts had been found at the home of the four people concerned” and that “the investigators had found that the pupils enrolled” in two classes “were in fact the husbands and cousins of the women who had been arrested”. The only passage reporting the investigators' statements concerned someone other than the applicant."", '14. The other article – published on the following day together with a photograph of the four arrested women – was similar in content to the first one.', '15. On 5 December 1998 the second daily, La Sicilia, published on the front page a photograph (identity format) of the four people who had been placed under house arrest and stated that they “had set up a bogus school”. The contents of the article were comparable to those of the articles published in the first daily.', ""16. The applicant's photograph, together with that of the three other women who had been arrested, was published four times on 5 and 6 December 1998. Each time it was an identity photograph that had been taken by the Revenue Police when the file was compiled, at the time of the applicant's arrest, and released by them to the press."", '17.

On 8 March 2002 the case ended with the special procedure for imposition of the penalty agreed between the applicant and the prosecution (Article 444 of the Code of Criminal Procedure – “the CCP” (applicazione della pena su richiesta delle parti)), namely, one year and ten months' imprisonment and a fine of 300 euros."", '20. The parties did not provide the Court with any indication as to possible legislation governing the photographing of persons charged or arrested and placed under house arrest without being imprisoned and the release of such photographs to the press.', 'Presidential Decree no. 431 of 29 April 1976 sets forth the implementing regulations in respect of Law no. 354 of 26 July 1975 on the administration of prisons.', 'With regard to persons charged who have been arrested and imprisoned, paragraphs 1 and 2 of Regulation 26 of the implementing regulations provide as follows:', '“A personal file shall be compiled on anyone detained or confined as soon as he or she is imprisoned. The file shall follow the person concerned whenever he or she is transferred and shall be stored in the archives of the prison that releases him or her.

001-60736,ENG,SWE,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF SALOMONSSON v. SWEDEN,3,Violation of Art. 6-1;Pecuniary damage - claim dismissed;Costs and expenses partial award,Nicolas Bratza,"['8. On 17 October 1994 the applicant, who was born in 1937 and had been on early retirement since 1989, applied for disability benefits under the Social Insurance Act (Lagen om allmän försäkring, 1962:381; hereinafter “the 1962 Act”). He claimed that he had extra costs following an operation on his intestines in September 1994 due to, inter alia, an increased consumption of fluids.', '9. By a decision of 28 December 1994 the Social Insurance Office (försäkringskassan; hereinafter “the Office”) of the County of Stockholm rejected the application, finding that the applicant’s costs were not such as to make him eligible for benefits.', '10. The applicant later made a new application, which was rejected by the Office on 8 February 1995.', '11. The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court (länsrätten) of the County of Stockholm. On 16 May 1995 the court rejected his appeal. The court did not hold an oral hearing nor did the applicant request one.', '12. Following the applicant’s further appeal, the Administrative Court of Appeal (kammarrätten) in Stockholm, by a decision of 17 November 1995, refused him leave to appeal.', '13. On 5 December 1995 the applicant made yet another application for disability benefits. On 3 April 1996 the application was rejected by the Office, which again found that the applicant’s costs did not attain the required level. The Office had at its disposal three medical certificates issued by different physicians. They expressed differing opinions on the applicant’s need of extra consumption of fluids, two of them considering that there was no such need and the third one stating that the applicant was recommended, from a surgical point of view, an increased consumption of, for instance, mineral water.', '14. The applicant appealed to the County Administrative Court. In a decision of 23 July 1996 the court noted that the issue in the case was whether the applicant’s extra costs attained the level required for a disability allowance under the 1962 Act. Finding that the medical evidence in the case was inconclusive and did not provide the Court with a sufficient basis for a decision, the court ordered the National Social Insurance Board (Riksförsäkringsverket; hereinafter “the Board”) to submit observations in the case. The Board answered by a letter of 13 August 1996, in which it contested the applicant’s claims. The applicant made observations in reply.', '15. On 16 October 1996 the County Administrative Court gave judgment in the applicant’s favour. Having reiterated that the medical evidence was inconclusive, the court also noted that the calculations of the applicant’s extra costs made by the Office and the applicant himself were very close on either side of the level required for entitlement to a disability allowance. In these circumstances, it gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt and granted him an allowance. An oral hearing was not requested by the applicant, nor did the court hold one of its own motion.', '16. The Board appealed against the judgment to the Administrative Court of Appeal and submitted a medical certificate from a further physician, who stated that an increased consumption of fluids was necessary due to the applicant’s handicap but that there was no particular need for mineral water. On 2 April 1997 the appellate court granted the Board leave to appeal.', '17. By a letter of 23 April 1997 the applicant requested the appellate court to hold an oral hearing in the case. He did not state any reasons for his request. On 15 May 1997 it was rejected by the court. After having restated section 9 of the Administrative Court Procedure Act (Förvaltningsprocess-lagen, 1971:291; hereinafter “the 1971 Act”; see further paragraph 25 below), the court gave the following reasons:', '“Having regard to the subject-matter at issue and the information that has come to hand in the case, [the court] finds that an oral hearing is unnecessary and rejects the request to that effect. [The applicant] is invited to state the further circumstances he wishes to invoke and submit his final written observations in the case within two weeks after having been notified of this decision.', 'The case can be determined notwithstanding a failure to submit such written observations.”', '18. The applicant reiterated his request for an oral hearing on 22 May 1997. He now stated that he wished to be heard in person about his working conditions and the costs of his consumption of fluids. Further, representatives of the Board should be heard about the applicable levels for entitlement to and calculation of disability allowances.', '19. On 24 June 1997 the Administrative Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s renewed request for an oral hearing and gave judgment in favour of the Board. Thus, it quashed the County Administrative Court’s judgment and confirmed the Office’s decision of 3 April 1996. Without giving any further reasons, it considered that the information in the case did not show that the applicant met the conditions for a disability allowance.', '20. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Regeringsrätten). He requested that the case be referred back to the Administrative Court of Appeal for re-examination or, alternatively, that the Supreme Administrative Court confirm the County Administrative Court’s judgment. He complained about the lack of an oral hearing in the Administrative Court of Appeal and also requested the Supreme Administrative Court to hold an oral hearing.', '21. By a letter of 28 July 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court informed the applicant that it did not normally hold oral hearings and gave him the opportunity to complete his appeal in writing.', '22. On 26 August 1997 the Supreme Administrative Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.', '23. According to chapter 9, section 2 of the 1962 Act, a person who is ill or handicapped is entitled to disability benefits, provided that, before reaching the age of 65, he or she has become functionally impaired for a considerable time and to such a degree that he or she needs time-consuming assistance from another person in everyday life or continuing assistance in order to be gainfully employed or otherwise has considerable extra expenses. The total need of support and assistance determines the eligibility for disability benefits and the amount of compensation. It is thus necessary to look at the whole situation of the person in question and to add together the need for different types of assistance and the extra expenses. According to the Board’s guidelines, the total cost of all extra needs due to the disability should come to at least 28.5% of a basic amount geared to the price index (basbelopp) in order to make the individual eligible for an allowance. In 1995, when the applicant made his second application to the Office, this corresponded to 10,175 Swedish kronor (SEK).', '24. A decision by the Social Insurance Office under the 1962 Act may be appealed against to the County Administrative Court and from there on to the Administrative Court of Appeal and the Supreme Administrative Court.', '25. The procedure in the administrative courts is governed by the provisions of the 1971 Act. Section 9 provides:', '“The proceedings are in writing.', 'An oral hearing may be held in regard to a certain issue, when there is reason to assume that that would be to the benefit of the proceedings or the speedy determination of the case.', 'In the Administrative Court of Appeal and the County Administrative Court an oral hearing shall be held if requested by an individual party to the proceedings, unless it is unnecessary or there are particular reasons against holding a hearing.”', 'The possibility for an individual party to obtain an oral hearing on request under those circumstances is not available in the proceedings before the Supreme Administrative Court.', '26. According to the preparatory documents to the 1971 Act, an oral hearing can be a valuable complement to the written proceedings and may benefit the examination of a case in two situations in particular: firstly, when it is necessary to hear a witness, an expert or a party or when it is difficult for a party to present the case in writing and, secondly, when different positions in the case need to be sorted out in order to eliminate unnecessary or pointless issues of dispute. In the latter case, the oral hearing takes on a preparatory character. It was stressed, however, that an oral hearing should not to be seen as an alternative to the written procedure but as a complement to it (see Government Bill 1971:30, p. 535).', '27. It was further stated, in respect of the third paragraph of section 9, that a party’s request for an oral hearing should be given great consideration. However, such a request should not have a decisive influence on the matter, as the question whether an oral hearing is necessary is to be determined primarily on the basis of the available information in the case. Still, other circumstances may be of relevance, for instance the importance for the party of the matter at stake or the possibility that an oral hearing could enhance the party’s understanding of a future decision in the case. Nevertheless, if the case is of a trivial character or the costs of an oral hearing would be disproportionate to the values at stake in the case, there could be reason not to hold an oral hearing (p. 537).']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1
001-60668,ENG,DEU,CHAMBER,2002,CASE OF BOHMER v. GERMANY,3,Violation of Art. 6-2,Ireneu Cabral Barreto,"[""8. On 14 June 1991 the Hamburg Regional Court convicted the applicant, a German national born in 1966, on charges of receiving stolen goods and theft and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment. The execution of the sentence was suspended on probation for a period of four years."", ""9. On 18 March 1993 the Ahrensburg District Court convicted the applicant on charges of negligent drunken driving and negligent driving without licence and imposed a fine. Thereupon, the Hamburg Regional Court decided to prolong by two years the applicant's probationary period."", ""10. On 15 September 1995 the Hamburg Prosecutor's Office charged the applicant and two co-accused with several counts of fraud, committed between March 1993 and April 1994."", ""11. Moreover, on 28 September 1995 the applicant was issued with a penal order (Strafbefehl) by the Hamburg District Court in the framework of a summary procedure. He was sentenced to a fine of 30 German marks (DEM - approximately 15 Euro) per day for thirty days for an offence of fraud, committed in February 1994 to the detriment of Mr H. Upon the applicant's objection, lodged with the assistance of Mr Klingbeil, main proceedings were instituted before the District Court. On 24 November 1995 these proceedings and the proceedings concerning the charges of September 1995, were joined."", ""12. In May 2000 the Hamburg District Court convicted the applicant of fraud and sentenced him to ten months' imprisonment. The proceedings concerning the charge of fraud to the detriment of Mr H. were provisionally stayed pursuant to section 154 (2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it appeared unnecessary to sanction the offence in question separately, the applicant having been sentenced to ten months' imprisonment in respect of the other fraud offences."", '13. On 21 December 1995 the Kiel District Court issued a penal order against the applicant, convicting him of fraud, committed in August 1994. He was sentenced to a fine of DEM 20 per day for fifty days.', ""14. When the postman found nobody at the applicant's home, the order was served in accordance with the relevant legal provisions, by way of a notification in his letter-box on 10 January 1996 to collect the said decision deposited at the local post office in his absence. Since the applicant did not lodge an objection in time, the penal order acquired legal force as the final judgment in the matter on 25 January 1995. On 11 October 1996 the Rendsburg District Court granted the applicant's request for retrial."", ""15. On 2 April 1996 the Hamburg Regional Court informed the applicant of its intention to revoke the suspension of his sentence of 1991 and invited him to comment within a period of one week after service of the letter. Due to the applicant's absence from home, the letter was served by way of a notification in his letter-box on 6 April 1996 to collect the said letter at the local post office."", ""16. On 18 April 1996 the Hamburg Regional Court revoked the suspension of the applicant's sentence to two years' imprisonment, imposed on 14 June 1991."", '17. In the reasons given for its decision, the Regional Court, referring to section 56f (1)(1) of the Penal Code, found that the applicant had committed criminal offences during the period of probation and had thereby shown that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of the sentence was based.', ""18. The Regional Court noted that, subsequent to the said suspension, the applicant had been convicted of further criminal offences and that these convictions had become final. Thus he had been convicted of traffic offences by the Ahrensburg District Court on 18 March 1993 and of fraud by the Kiel District Court on 21 December 1995. The court considered that in particular the applicant's conviction of another offence relating to property had shown that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of his sentence was based. Taking into account that the period of suspension had already once been prolonged, other, more lenient measures than revoking the suspension were not possible."", ""19. Due to the applicant's absence, the order was also served by way of a notification in his letter-box on 23 April 1996 to collect the decision of 18 April 1996 deposited at the local post."", '20. On 17 May 1996 the applicant, assisted by Mr Klingbeil, submitted an application for the reinstatement of the proceedings against the decision of 18 April 1996 and lodged an appeal against the said decision.', ""21. By letter of 15 August 1996 the Hamburg Court of Appeal informed the applicant's counsel that, considering the Public Prosecutor's decision to stay the execution of the sentence (Vollstreckungsaufschub) until 4 August 1996, it would await the outcome of the proceedings before the Kiel District Court regarding his request for reinstatement."", ""22. On 22 August 1996 the Court of Appeal decided to grant the applicant's request for reinstatement and adjourned the appeal proceedings to await the final outcome of the Kiel proceedings relating to his request for reinstatement. The Court of Appeal considered that the question whether or not the applicant had committed a further offence of fraud was decisive for its decision on revoking his suspension. It noted that this request had been unsuccessful at first instance, but appeal proceedings were pending. The Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's request to await the outcome of the proceedings relating to his request for retrial."", '23. On 24 September 1996 the Court of Appeal informed the applicant that, following deliberations, the case remained adjourned to await the outcome of the Kiel proceedings for reinstatement.', ""24. On 14 October 1996 a hearing took place before the Court of Appeal, which heard the statements made by Mr H. and the further witness, police officer B., in the presence of the applicant's counsel. The applicant, waiting outside the court building, did not attend the hearing in order not to be seen in case of a confrontation with Mr H., as suggested by his counsel."", ""25. Following the hearing, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant's appeal against the decision of 21 December 1995 on the ground that the reasons given in that decision were correct in their conclusion."", '26. According to the Court of Appeal, the applicant “had not fulfilled the expectations upon which the suspension of his sentence ... was based, as he committed new offences during the period of suspension” (“hat die Erwartungen, die der ... Strafaussetzung zugrunde lagen, nicht erfüllt, weil er in der Bewährungszeit neue Straftaten begangen hat”).', ""27. In its reasoning, the Court of Appeal noted the applicant's final conviction by the Ahrensburg District Court on 18 March 1993."", ""28. As regards the penal order issued by the Kiel District Court on 21 December 1995, it considered that the applicant's pending request for retrial might result in the hearing of numerous witnesses. As the prolonged period of suspension had already expired four months ago, the Court of Appeal found that it could not await the outcome of these proceedings."", ""29. The Court of Appeal turned next to the proceedings pending before the Hamburg District Court. It noted that, following the applicant's successful appeal against the penal order of 28 September 1995, the District Court had joined these and further criminal proceedings involving the applicant and two other accused and relating to several charges of fraud. In the latter proceedings, trial proceedings had not yet been opened on account of difficult investigations. The Court of Appeal stated that it would not await the outcome of these proceedings either. Rather, it opted for a procedure under section 308 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to examine the question whether or not, in addition to the conviction by the Ahrensburg District Court of 1993, the applicant's criminal offence to the detriment of Mr. H. could constitute a reason for revoking the suspension of his sentence."", ""30. The Court of Appeal considered that, having questioned Mr. H. and a further witness, the police officer B., in presence of the applicant's defence counsel, “it had been able to obtain certainty that the applicant was guilty of fraud to the detriment of witness ... [H.] (section 263 of the Penal Code)” (“hat dem Senat ... die Gewissheit verschafft, dass sich der Beschwerdeführer gegenüber dem Zeugen ... [H.] des Betruges schuldig gemacht hat (§ 263 StGB)”)."", ""31. In this respect, the Court of Appeal took note of both witnesses' indications as to the circumstances of the offence in question as well as to the criminal information laid by the victim H. and the subsequent investigations. Thus, the Court of Appeal found that the applicant had offered H. a mobile phone and a video camera at a low price. When the transaction was to be carried out some time later at a parking place on the motorway, the applicant had taken H.'s money and disappeared without handing over the promised goods. While H. had not identified the applicant on police photographs shown to him at the police department the day after the offence, he did recognise him in a collection of police photographs which had been presented to him by the police officer B. The Court of Appeal considered that both witnesses' statements were true. The court argued that H. had openly talked about his bad conscience regarding the low price of the two objects and he had also admitted that, because he was ashamed, he had not told the truth as to the circumstances of the applicant's disappearance on the occasion of his questioning by the police. Moreover, police officer B. had remembered many details and had also explained an amendment to the minutes of H.'s questioning."", '32. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal indicated that it had inspected the files of the proceedings pending before the Hamburg District Court inasmuch as the collection of police photographs was concerned. The Court of Appeal noted that, when the scene of identifying the applicant had been re-enacted, the witness H., following an initial hesitation as to a photograph showing another person, had clearly recognised the photograph showing the applicant. In these circumstances, the Court of Appeal considered not necessary to re-enact the consultation of police photographs, which had been taken place at the police department one day after the offence.', ""33. The Court of Appeal did not take up the suggestion of the applicant's counsel for an open confrontation between the witness H. and several persons, including the applicant. It considered that so much time had elapsed since the offence that the applicant's appearance could have considerably changed. Furthermore, it had not been sure whether the applicant would have participated in such a confrontation. In this situation, it rather relied on the memory of the witness H."", '34. The Court of Appeal concluded that the strict conditions were met for considering an offence, prior to final conviction, as a reason for revoking a suspension. In cases as the present one, awaiting the final conviction would, on account of the considerable possibilities of delay, lead to the unbearable result that criminal offenders could commit further offences during the probationary period without any risk of suffering disadvantages.', ""35. According to the Court of Appeal, the applicant's conviction by the Ahrensburg District Court and his criminal offence against H. had shown that, contrary to the initial prognosis, the applicant was not able to live a law-abiding life. While the conviction by the Ahrensburg District Court merely disclosed a general lack of reliability and could not, taken alone, justify revoking the suspension, the applicant had proceeded in the case H. in a way similar to that followed for the offence underlying his 1991 conviction. Accordingly, the suspended prison sentences had had no impact on the applicant. More lenient measures could not therefore be envisaged."", ""36. The decision was served on the applicant's counsel on 18 October 1996."", ""37. On 22 January 1997 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant's constitutional complaint."", '38. Subsequently, the Pardon Division at the Hamburg Court of Appeal suspended the execution of the sentence pending the proceedings before the Court.', '39. Sections 56 to 58 of the Penal Code govern the suspended execution of sentences. Section 56 concerns the conditions for suspension and reads as follows:', '“1. Upon a sentence of imprisonment of no more than one year, the court shall suspend the execution of the punishment and grant probation if it can be expected that the sentence will serve the convicted person as a warning and he will commit no further crimes in the future even without the influence exerted by serving the sentence. Particularly to be considered are the personality of the convicted person, his previous history, the circumstances of his offence, his conduct after the offence, his living conditions and the effects which can be expected as a result of the suspension.', '(2) The court may also suspend the execution of a longer term of imprisonment which does not exceed two years under the provisions of subsection (1) and grant probation if a comprehensive evaluation of the offence and personality of the convicted person reveals the existence of special circumstances. In making the decision the efforts of the convicted person to make restitution for the harm caused by the offence should particularly be considered.”', '40. According to section 56a, the competent court determines the period of probation of between two and five years. It may subsequently be reduced to the minimum or prolonged to the maximum before its expiration. The court may impose conditions on the convicted person (section 56b), and may issue instructions to the convicted person for the duration of his period of probation (section 56c) or place the convicted person under the supervision of a probationary officer (section 56d). According to section 56e, such decisions may be taken or amended at a later stage.', '41. As regards the revocation of a suspension, section 56f of the Penal Code provides inter alia that', '“1. The court shall revoke the suspension of a sentence if the convicted person commits a criminal offence during the period of probation and, thereby, shows that he did not fulfil the expectations upon which the suspension of the sentence was based', '...', '2. The court shall, however, refrain from revocation when it suffices:', '(1.) to impose further conditions or instructions, in particular to place the convicted person under the supervision of a probation officer; or', '(2) to prolong the period of probation ...”', '42. Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for the provisional stay of the prosecution in the following terms:', '“1. The public prosecutor may decide not to prosecute', '(1) where the penalty or the corrective or preventive measure to be expected if a conviction is secured is almost negligible in comparison with a penalty or corrective or preventive measure imposed on the defendant - or which he must expect to be imposed - for another offence ... ...', '2. Once proceedings have been instituted, the court may provisionally stay them at any stage on an application by the public prosecutor. ....”', '43. Court decisions other than conviction and sentence may be challenged in proceedings instituted under section 304 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The applicant, Mr Halil İbrahim Okkalı (“Halil”), was born in 1983 and lives in İzmir. At the material time he was 12 years old and worked as an apprentice in a garage.', '10. On 27 November 1995, at around 5.30 p.m., the applicant was taken to the Çınarlı police station in İzmir by his employer, İ.G., who accused him of stealing 15 million Turkish liras (TRL) –approximately 275 United States dollars (USD) – he had asked him to take to the bank. On returning to the garage he claimed that he had been robbed. According to the police report signed at 6 p.m., the employer filed a complaint against Halil.', '11. At the police station the applicant was questioned by Superintendent İ.D. and Officer M.Y.', 'At 6.30 p.m. the police told the applicant’s father, Mr Mehmet Okkalı (“Mehmet”), what had happened and he went straight to the police station.', '12. At 7 p.m. Halil’s father and employer reached an agreement. İ.G. withdrew his complaint, and Mehmet signed the following statement:', '“... İ.G. has recovered his money and withdrawn his complaint. I am therefore taking my son from the police station. I have no demand or complaint to make concerning my son. I do not want him to have a medical check-up; my son was well treated at the police station and not ill-treated or tortured ... he was handed over to me in good shape and in good health ...”', '13. However, once outside the police station, Mehmet saw his son stagger, totter and vomit twice. Back at home, when Halil was undressed, his parents and the neighbours present saw numerous injuries and bruises on his body. Halil then told his father that he had been beaten by his interrogators. Mehmet took Halil to Tepecik Hospital.', '14. Officer İ.A., from the hospital’s police desk, sent him to the casualty department. In a provisional medical report the doctor who examined Halil made the following observations:', '“The subject is conscious ... He has 10 x 10 cm bruises on his arms and legs and large bruises (30 x 17 cm) on both buttocks ...”', 'Halil was admitted to the paediatric ward.', '15. On 28 November 1995 Mehmet returned to the police station to complain about the ill-treatment inflicted on his son and find out who had questioned him. He was given the name of Superintendent İ.D.', '16. On the same day Mehmet lodged a complaint against İ.D. and his subordinate officers with the public prosecutor of İzmir (“the prosecutor”). He asked for Halil to be examined by a specialist in forensic medicine.', '17. On 30 November 1995 the prosecutor interviewed the applicant, who had been discharged from hospital the previous evening. He stated:', '“... at the police station I was beaten by two policemen in the toilets; one was wearing glasses and the other had green eyes. One of them was a superintendent, at least that’s what they told me – I wouldn’t know the difference. I would recognise the officers who beat me ... Later on ... my father and my uncle sorted things out with my boss and came to fetch me from the police station. On the way home I was sick. Then, when we got home and they undressed me, they saw the truncheon marks and took me to Tepecik Hospital ...”', 'As his hand had been injured, Halil had to ‘sign’ the record of his interview with his fingerprint.', '18. That same day, at the prosecutor’s request, Halil was examined by a doctor from the Forensic Medicine Institute. In his preliminary report the doctor wrote:', '“Halil İbrahim Okkalı has been examined. At this time his ... right forearm is immobilised in a plaster cast. He has bruising on the outside of his left arm which is a light violet colour in the middle and pale green round the edges, a pale green bruise on the left elbow, large bruises on both buttocks which are violet in the middle and pale green round the edges, and a pale green bruise on the lower back of the left thigh. It is noted that the subject was admitted to the paediatric ward at Tepecik Hospital, where he received emergency treatment ... for a fractured elbow. The final report will be drawn up on receipt of the hospital diagnosis and treatment report, the X-rays and the radiologist’s report ...”', '19. On 1 December 1995 the applicant was re-examined by another doctor from the Forensic Medicine Institute, who reviewed the findings in the previous reports and stated:', '“Having noted the existence of yellowish bruises measuring 20 x 12 cm on the left buttock, 35 x 25 cm on the right buttock, 12 x 6 cm on the lower back of the left thigh and 8 x 7 cm on the left arm, and [also] a muscle tissue trauma on the left forearm (which has been bandaged with a splint), we conclude that as a result of these injuries, which are not life-threatening, the subject should take ten days off work ...”', '20. On 6 December 1995 the prosecutor questioned Superintendent İ.D. Denying the accusations, the superintendent said:', '“... I did not beat the complainant. Besides, hardly an hour went by between the time when his employer brought him in and the time when he was released ... I did not inflict any torture on the complainant. [Yes,] I always wear glasses and it was me who talked to the boy ...”', '21. Chief Superintendent A.K. was subsequently appointed reporting officer to assist the prosecutor in investigating the case. On 11 December 1995 İ.D. was brought before Halil, who recognised him. The reporting officer then interviewed Halil, who repeated what he had already said and added that İ.D. and M.Y. had hit him on the hands, “backside” and legs; when he collapsed under the blows, they apparently took him to a cell and threatened to “come back” unless he told them where he had hidden the money.', 'The reporting officer then questioned İ.D., who gave the following explanation:', '“... at 7 p.m. the boy was handed over to his father. According to [the complainant], the boy felt unwell at 9 p.m. and was taken to hospital, where a report was drawn up. This event was broadcast on the television channel Kanal 6. Following that broadcast, I was suspended as of 8 December 1995. Contrary to what the boy and his father say, neither Officer M.Y. nor myself hit [the applicant] with truncheons on the hands, backside or legs. ... He arrived at the police station at 6 p.m. and I stayed with him until he left at 7 p.m. When the boy was brought to the police station his face was dirty ...; Officer M.Y. only took him to the toilets so he could wash his face ... The allegations are false ... we are wrongfully accused ...”', '22. On the same day, 11 December 1995, the reporting officer also interviewed Halil’s employer, İ.G., and three officers from Çınarlı police station. İ.G. testified in favour of the accused, stating that on the day of the incident, from 6 to 7 p.m., he had sat with İ.D. and neither İ.D. nor M.Y. had touched Halil during that time. Two of the other police officers questioned said that there had been nothing wrong with the boy when he was handed over to his father, and the third said that he had seen no one ill-treat the boy.', '23. On 28 December 1995 the prosecutor showed Halil photographs of the police officers on duty at Çınarlı police station. He identified İ.D. and M.Y.', '24. On 4 January 1996 the prosecutor interviewed M.Y., who simply denied the accusations against him. The next day the reporting officer brought M.Y. before Halil, who recognised him. The reporting officer then questioned M.Y., who stated:', '“... I was with Superintendent İ.D. at the time; the boy was contradicting himself, he had dust and mud on his face; his [employer] was with him. At the superintendent’s request I took the boy to the toilets to wash his face, then took him back to the main office. Around 7 o’clock we telephoned his father, who came to fetch him. ... Nobody hit the boy; if you ask me, his father ... or someone else angry about losing the 15 million liras probably gave him a good hiding ...”', '25. On 8 January 1996 the reporting officer forwarded copies of the reports drawn up in the course of his investigations to the prosecutor; they were included in the prosecution’s case file no. 1995/50365.', '26. On 30 January 1996, on receipt of the medical file that had been requested from Tepecik Hospital, the preliminary medical report of 30 November 1995 was finalised. The final report confirmed all the earlier medical findings. It also mentioned other visible marks on Halil’s body: bruising on the upper and lower belly, a 4 x 6 cm bruise on the side of the left tibia, a bruise behind the left knee, wide bruises on the knees and the right tibia, and bruising on the left wrist, the right elbow, the back of the right hand, and in the groin area. The report indicated that Halil would probably take twenty-five days to recover.', '27. On 5 February 1996 the prosecutor indicted Superintendent İ.D. and Officer M.Y. before the second section of the İzmir Assize Court (“the Assize Court”) for violation of Article 243 of the Criminal Code (the obtaining of a confession by a public official by means of torture).', '28. Proceedings before the Assize Court commenced on 12 February 1996. All the parties attended the hearing on 20 March 1996. Their statements may be summarised as follows.', 'Superintendent İ.D.:', '“... I never left my office at any time; I did not strike the victim at all or order a police officer to hit or maltreat him to make him tell the truth ...; I only asked Officer M.Y. to take him to the washbasin and help him wash his face ... My mistake was not to have had the boy examined by a doctor before handing him over to his father; if I had done that, there would be no case against me ...; the complainant [Halil] said that the money had been taken from him by force, so he might have sustained the injuries at that time ... [Halil] was handed over to his father at 7 p.m., but the medical report was obtained at 9 p.m.; I even thought that the parents might be those [really] responsible for [Halil’s] condition, as, if ... he had shown any signs of the injuries described in the report, we would never have let him leave the police station [in such a state] ...”', 'Officer M.Y.:', '“I maintain what I said before [to the reporting officer and the prosecutor] ...; I do not know why the complainant and the victim have made these accusations against us.”', 'Mehmet, the complainant:', '“... When I arrived at the police station they had already questioned İ.G. ... and my son. ... Then they brought my son ... who said to İ.G., ‘There you are, did you get what you wanted?’; at the time I didn’t realise what he meant ...; it didn’t register until I got him home and saw the injuries ...; then they took my son to a cell; when I went to the toilet I saw him lying down in the cell and told him to sit up properly, but he said he couldn’t ... My son spent three days in intensive care at Tepecik Hospital ...; they told me they had given him nine bottles of serum ...”', 'Halil, the victim:', '“... at the police station that man (pointing at Superintendent İ.D.) said, ‘Think carefully, you are going to tell me where the money is’, then he ... took me into the toilets and hit me on the hands with a truncheon. At one point I tripped and fell and the dustbin above me fell on my head. While I was down [İ.D. started hitting me]; he put his boot over my mouth to stop me screaming; then he went away saying, ‘Think carefully; I’ll be back’; but he didn’t come back ... Then my father and uncle arrived; ... [my father] saw me in the cell and told me to sit up straight, but I couldn’t, because I was sore all over ... The superintendent beat me to find out where the money was ...; M.Y. held me so I couldn’t move, but he didn’t hit me. ... Neither my employer nor my father or my family beat me for losing the money ...”', '29. The applicant’s lawyer applied, under Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to join the criminal proceedings as a civil party and reserved his rights to compensation. He also filed a list of prosecution witnesses he wished to call. These included the neighbours who had been present when Halil returned from the police station and taken him to the hospital with his family. The court accepted these requests.', '30. The trial court also heard evidence from İ.G., who confirmed Superintendent İ.D.’s version of the facts. In addition to what he had told the investigating authorities, the superintendent said that on the day of the incident his colleagues at the police station had called him at around 11 p.m. to tell him that Halil had been admitted to hospital. He had gone to the hospital with another superintendent and other police officers, where he had been insulted by Halil’s friends and family, who allegedly even tried to attack him. He said he had not seen the applicant leave the police station with his father and had no idea what had possessed them to accuse the police when the matter had been settled between himself and Mehmet.', 'Mehmet gave evidence as follows:', '“Just before or after the new year someone by the name of Baki, the minister’s bodyguard ..., called me to fix an appointment; he turned up at the appointed place, together with Superintendent İ.D. ...; he explained that İ.D.’s wife was pregnant and that if we ‘said the right things’ in court, his sentence might not be executed for a year, until after the baby had been born. I refused, saying that if he [İ.D.] was so concerned about his unborn baby, how could I be expected not to worry about my own son?”', '31. At the hearing on 27 May 1996, the trial court heard three police officers from Çınarlı police station and seven prosecution witnesses. The police officers said that when Mehmet had gone to the police station to pick Halil up he had been asked if he wanted to have the boy examined by a doctor, but he had not deemed it necessary, as his written statement confirmed.', 'Mehmet replied that there had been no such offer and that he had signed the statement without thinking, as he had been worried about his son’s well-being.', '32. Most of the prosecution witnesses confirmed the complainant’s version of events and the applicant’s uncle added:', '“... I went to the police station with [Mehmet] ... Halil showed no visible traces of violence but he looked as if he had been [shaken up]; no one suggested that we might have him examined by a doctor before we left the police station ... We left the station at around 8 p.m. ...; as my nephew was getting into the car, he started to vomit; I went back [to the police station] and spoke to the policeman at the door; he said we could take [Halil] to a doctor ... Even at the police station I had noticed small marks on [Halil’s] hands, but I thought nothing of it; I knew ‘mishaps’ sometimes occurred at police stations, but I certainly didn’t expect to see what we [found] when we got home ... The same evening Chief Superintendent O.K. called my brother-in-law to the police station and I went with him. Chief Superintendent O.K. called in İ.D. and said to him, ‘Aren’t you ashamed of yourself? Brutalising a little boy?’; İ.D. said, ‘I have been in the police for ... years and I did my duty; what of it if I did hit him once or twice?’; then the chief superintendent said, ‘Let’s go to the hospital and see this little boy you say you hit once or twice’. So we went to the hospital together and they saw the victim; he was bleeding “top and bottom”, he had a tube in him ...”', '33. The defendants İ.D. and M.Y. denied all charges. At the hearing on 1 July 1996, their superior officer, O.K., told the court:', '“... I heard about the incident at around 9 p.m., when the boy’s family contacted me ...; I brought the parties face to face ..., but when the accused started to deny the accusations in front of [the family] ... I had to send them out of my office before something unpleasant happened; ... to investigate the matter, and at the family’s request, I went to the hospital, but without the doctors’ authorisation it was not possible for me to see the child, as he was in intensive care ... Back at the police station I questioned all the police officers on duty, who all maintained that they had seen nothing and knew nothing ... I went to see the victim once at his home. ... [Apart from that], the defendant İ.D. never went with me to the hospital. When I brought the parties together face to face, the only thing İ.D. said was that he had done his duty ...”', '34. After the next hearing, on 30 October 1996, the Assize Court pronounced judgment. It began by announcing its conviction that', '“... having regard to all the evidence, including the reports in the case file, the statements made by the victim and the reports concerning the complaint, the accused did beat the victim in the course of their duty in the manner described in the [medical] report, to make him say where he had hidden the money ...”', '35. However, the Assize Court decided, by a majority, to reclassify the offence as “assault and ill-treatment”, as defined in Article 245 of the Criminal Code, rather than the verdict requested by the prosecution. The court based its decision on the fact that Halil’s employer had withdrawn his complaint; he was therefore not accused of any crime and so it could not have been the defendants’ intention “to obtain a confession” within the meaning of Article 243, but rather simply “to find out what had happened to the money placed in his care”.', '36. The Assize Court decided to apply the minimum penalty and sentenced İ.D. and M.Y. to three months’ imprisonment and a three-month suspension from duty. Taking into account the defendants’ good behaviour during the trial and considering that they had confessed, albeit reluctantly, the Assize Court reduced the sentences to two months and two weeks, in conformity with Article 59 § 2 of the Criminal Code. Then, by virtue of sections 4(1) and 6(1) of Law no. 647, it commuted the prison sentences to fines of TRL 750,000 (about USD 8), then ordered a stay of execution as the defendants had no criminal record and the judges were convinced that they would not reoffend.', '37. The applicant’s counsel appealed against the judgment on various points of law, including violation of Article 3 of the Convention.', '38. By a decision of 5 November 1997, the Court of Cassation admitted the appeal and set aside the impugned judgment for misclassification of the offence, which the higher court considered amounted to extortion of a confession as defined in Article 243 of the Criminal Code. The case was accordingly referred back to the Assize Court.', 'In his written pleadings dated 25 February 1998, İ.D. submitted:', '“I maintain my previous submissions to the Assize Court and declare that I did not commit the offence of which I am accused; I did not subject the complainant to any violence or ill-treatment. I accordingly ask the Court to acquit me. In the alternative, and without admitting to any guilt, I beg the Court to uphold its initial classification if it decides to convict me, as the facts that constitute the offence defined in Article 243 of the Criminal Code have not been established in the present case ...”', '39. On 26 February 1998, after re-examining the case, the Assize Court complied with the decision of the higher court and convicted İ.D. and M.Y. of contravening Article 243 of the Criminal Code and, once again, sentenced them to the minimum penalties: one year’s imprisonment, enforceable immediately, and three months’ suspension from duty. These sentences were subsequently reduced to ten months’ imprisonment and two and a half months’ suspension from duty, under Article 59 § 2 of the Criminal Code. Then, for the reasons stated in the judgment of 30 October 1996, the sentences were suspended under section 6 of Law no. 647.', '40. The applicant’s lawyer again appealed to the Court of Cassation to set aside this judgment. Deploring that the defendants had been given the benefit of Article 59 § 2 of the Criminal Code and section 6 of Law no. 647, he submitted, in particular:', '“As to the application of the minimum penalty: ... on 27 November 1995, under suspicion of theft and misappropriation, the victim ... was taken to the police station, where he was beaten with a truncheon and kicked ... by police officers in an attempt to extort a confession ... The victim was 12 years old when he was subjected to this torture. When a child that age is tortured he suffers not only physical pain but also irreversible psychological damage that can affect his whole future ... Defendant İ.D., who was a superintendent at the material time and is [now] a chief superintendent, was a public official acting as the officer in charge. It was his duty not only to abide by the law but also to make sure the men under his orders did so ... The sentences handed down ... against the defendants are manifestly contrary to the public interest which underlies Article 243 of the Criminal Code. They are likely to undermine society’s confidence in the forces of law and order ...', 'As to the application of Article 59 § 2 of the Criminal Code: ... as mentioned above, the offence in issue here is generally considered to be one of the most serious. The [Court’s] view that the defendants felt remorse is unsubstantiated. Throughout the trial they constantly denied the charges; they even went as far as to suggest that the victim might have been beaten by [his parents]. It is inadmissible that someone who denies the charges should be considered to regret their misconduct ...', 'As to the suspension of the sentences: ... the enclosed newspaper article reveals that defendant İ.D. had previously been tried for assault on two people and abuse of office ... Even though he was acquitted for lack of evidence, it shows the defendant’s propensity to commit such offences ...”', '41. In a judgment of 24 March 1999, the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of 26 February 1998, without replying to the above points of law. As the applicant’s counsel was not notified of this judgment, he did not become aware of it until 6 September 1999.', '42. On 10 September 1999 the applicant’s lawyer claimed TRL 3 billion from the Ministry of the Interior in respect of non-pecuniary damage. When the Ministry refused to entertain the claim, the family lodged a claim for damages against the Ministry with the İzmir Administrative Court (“the court”) on 22 November 1999.', '43. In a judgment of 11 April 2000, the court dismissed the claim as being time-barred under section 13 of Law no. 2577 (see paragraph 51 below). As the starting-point of the one-year limitation period provided for in that law, the court took the date on which the applicant had obtained the medical certificate, that is, 30 January 1996, explaining that the subsequent criminal conviction of the police officers responsible had no bearing on the calculation of the time-limit.', '44. The applicant’s lawyer appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. In a judgment of 12 December 2001, the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of 11 April 2000.', '45. The lawyer then applied for rectification of the judgment, arguing, inter alia, that the way in which the limitation rule for actions against administrative acts had been interpreted and applied in this case was at variance both with administrative law and with international legislation on the prevention of ill-treatment, in so far as the treatment to which the applicant had been subjected amounted not to any ordinary administrative act but to torture. He submitted that the period during which his client was entitled to sue for damages had not started until the day he had been informed of the final conviction decision, namely, 6 September 1999, the date on which the criminal nature of the impugned act had been finally established.', '46. In a final judgment of 7 March 2005, the Supreme Administrative Court confirmed the judgment of 12 December 2001 by a majority of three judges to two.', '47. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code are as follows.', '“Any public servant ... who inflicts torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment on accused parties to make them confess their crimes shall be sentenced to up to five years’ imprisonment and temporarily or permanently barred from public service.”', '“Prison sentences:', 'Life imprisonment shall mean imprisonment until death. Unless explicitly provided otherwise [herein], other immediately enforceable prison sentences shall range from one to twenty-four years.”', '“Any law-enforcement officer ... who, in the course of duty ... and in circumstances other than those prescribed by law ..., ill-treats, injures or strikes a person or does them bodily harm shall be sentenced to between three months’ and three years’ imprisonment and temporarily barred from public service. ...”', '“The judge has full discretion to determine the principal sentence, which can vary between a minimum and a maximum, taking account of factors such as the circumstances in which the offence was committed, the means used to commit it, the importance and seriousness of the offence, the time and place at which it was committed, the various special features of the offence, the seriousness of the damage caused and the risk [incurred], the degree of [criminal] intent ..., the reasons and motives for the offence, the aim, the criminal record, the personal and social status of the perpetrator and his conduct following the act [committed]. Even if the minimum sentence is imposed, the reasons for that choice must be stated in the judgment.”', '“If the court considers that there are mitigating circumstances other than those prescribed by law ..., the death penalty shall be commuted to life imprisonment, and life imprisonment to thirty years.', 'Other penalties shall be reduced by a maximum of one-sixth.”', '48. Sections 19 and 41 of Law no. 2253, establishing youth courts and regulating their jurisdiction and the procedure before them, cover the preliminary investigation of juvenile delinquency.', '“The term minor, for the purposes of this law, shall mean persons under 15 years of age at the time when the offence was committed.”', '“The preliminary investigation of offences committed by minors shall be carried out by the public prosecutor in person or by a deputy appointed by him.”', 'Article 138 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as it stood at the material time stipulated that, from the time of their arrest, minors should have the assistance of an officially assigned counsel without having to ask for it.', '49. Sections 4(1) and 6(1) of Law no. 647 on the execution of sentences read as follows:', '“Short custodial sentences which do not have to be served immediately may, depending on the personality and situation of the defendant and the circumstances in which the offence was committed, be commuted by the court:', '(1) to a heavy fine ... of 5,000 to 10,000 Turkish liras per day;”', '“The court may decide to suspend the execution of a fine and/or a prison sentence of up to one year ... if it is convinced, taking into account the offender’s criminal record and potential to commit crime, that there is little risk of any further offence being committed, and provided that the offender has never been sentenced to anything other than a fine. The reasons for suspending the sentence must be stated in the decision.”', '50. Regulation 8, paragraph 39, of the disciplinary regulations of the security forces stipulates:', '“The following acts, actions and conduct shall be punished by expulsion from the public service:', '...', '39. Inflicting torture on any person ... on police premises;”', '51. Section 13 of Law no. 2577 states:', '“Before initiating administrative proceedings, people whose rights have been violated as a result of administrative acts shall submit a claim for damages to the administrative authority concerned within one year of the date on which they received notification of the impugned act, in writing or otherwise, and, in any event, within five years of the impugned act. An administrative action may be brought if that claim is rejected, in whole or in part, by the administration. The time-limit for such administrative action shall be calculated from the day after notification of the claim’s rejection was received or, if the claimant has received no reply, from the expiry of the sixty-day period the administration has in which to reply.”', '52. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages (Articles 41-46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal court on the issue of the defendant’s guilt (Article 53).', '53. In Turkish criminal-law practice a confession is said to be “tevilli” (“qualified”, a confession of a complex type) when the person confessing to the offence simultaneously invokes circumstances that may be considered to exonerate them or mitigate their guilt: examples are self-defence in a murder case, or something that cancels liability in a criminal case, such as having paid the price for the object one is accused of stealing. Such confessions are considered to be divisible, so the courts may distinguish between the part of the confession acknowledging the offence and the part explaining why it was committed, and choose to admit only the confession, not the reasons given.', 'At the Court’s request, the Government supplied the following information concerning the practical interpretation in criminal law of the legal definition of the tevilli confession, which they translate as “tacit” confession:', '“... The court must decide in what circumstances the offence may be attributed to a person who clearly denies all the charges. In criminal law the trial court may base its judgment on the incriminating evidence and convict a defendant who denies everything if there is a body of consistent evidence pointing ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ to his guilt. When the court evaluates the evidence, if the defendant cannot prove that he was not at the place where the offence was committed on the material date and at the material time and, according to the evidence in the case file, the offence could not have been committed by anyone else, the court may [find] the defendant guilty.”', 'As to judicial practice in respect of the application of minimum sentences, the Government were unable to present examples, as requested by the Court, of judgments explaining why the criminal-court judge had imposed a sentence heavier than the minimum prescribed by law. They simply explained that the courts had a certain discretion when it came to passing sentence between the upper and lower limits, the aim being to prevent repeat offences.']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant is a limited partnership under liquidation, with its seat in Pécs.', '6. In 1996 the Tax Authority established that the applicant owed some 10 million Hungarian forints (HUF) in outstanding taxes. To secure this claim, on 10 April 1997 it attached a 100%-share the applicant had in another company, which was nominally worth over HUF 103 million. Aware of the applicant’s own intention to sell the share by 30 June 1997, the Tax Authority forbade the transaction but did not proceed to auctioning it within the statutory two-month deadline or afterwards.', '7. In the ensuing two-year-long administrative procedure, the applicant’s tax debt was eventually cancelled and the asset unfrozen. However, by that time the company in which the share belonged had been liquidated – as of July 1997 – and the share had lost its value altogether.', '8. Some time in 1999 the applicant sued the Tax Authority for damages. On 12 December 2000 the Baranya County Regional Court awarded it HUF 103 million. On 13 June 2002 the Supreme Court quashed this decision. On 3 June 2003 the Regional Court again found for the plaintiff.', '9. On appeal, on 6 May 2004 the Pécs Court of Appeal reversed this judgment and rejected the applicant’s action. It held in essence that there had been no causal link between the Tax Authority’s unlawful omission to hold an auction to sell the attached asset within two months from its attachment, as required by section 116(1) of the Enforcement Act 1994, and the damage the plaintiff had sustained. In the court’s view, the burden of proof to show that had there been a timely auction the share could have successfully been sold to a buyer with the requisite liquidity lay with the applicant. However, the applicant could not prove this assertion. The court observed that the buyer suggested by the applicant had never had, according to its books, the capital needed for the acquisition; that the company in which the share belonged had lost all its own capital by early 1997 and been in liquidation as of July 1997; and that its manager had been convicted of fraudulent bankruptcy.', '10. On 16 March 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s petition for review. This decision was served on 22 April 2005. The applicant’s request for a re-opening was to no avail.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

TURKEY,3,Preliminary objection joined to merits and rejected (non-exhaustion of domestic remedies);No violation of Art. 2 in respect of killing of applicant's relatives;Violation of Art. 2 on account of lack of effective investigation;No violation of Art. 3;Not necessary to examine Art. 6-1;Violation of Art. 13;No violation of Art. 8;No violation of Art. 14,,"['9. The applicant, Ms Şemsi Önen, is a Turkish citizen, born in 1968. At the relevant time, she lived in the village Karataş near Mazıdağı (Mardin) in south-east Turkey. The application was brought by the applicant on behalf of her deceased parents and brother, on her own behalf and on behalf of her ten suriving siblings, namely Mekiye, Ishan, Ercan, Mehmet Nuri, Medine, Sultan, Sevgi, Iskender, Melek and Hamdullah. It concerns the killing of their parents and brother Orhan, allegedly by armed members of the Balpınar village guards, and the investigation thereof.', ""10. Since the 1980s, a violent conflict has been conducted in the south-eastern region of Turkey between the security forces and sections of the Kurdish population in favour of Kurdish autonomy, in particular members of the PKK (Kurdish Workers' Party). According to the Government, one of the main terrorist activities of the PKK was the killing of people who have acted contrary to the cause of this organisation or who have misused property of the PKK. At the time of the events in issue, ten of the eleven provinces of south-east Turkey had been under emergency rule since 1987."", '11. The facts of the case, in particular the circumstances of the killings and the efforts of the authorities to investigate the killings, are disputed.', '12. As the village of Karataş, where the applicant and her family lived at the time of the events in issue, had refused the village guard system, tension had arisen between Karataş and its neighbouring village Balpınar. This refusal had also resulted in pressure being applied to the villagers by the gendarmes.', '13. On or about 15 November 1992, four Balpınar village guards were killed in a clash with the PKK. On the same day, shortly after the clash, gendarmes and village guards attacked the village of Karataş. This attack lasted several hours. The following day, the Muhtar of Karataş complained to the Governor that his village was being subjected to pressure and violence from the gendarmes and village guards. No investigation of the attack took place.', ""14. Some weeks before 16 March 1993 the house of the Muhtar and the applicant's family house were both strafed by several rounds of bullets fired by Balpınar village guards. The Muhtar again complained to the Governor about the pressure exerted on his village by the Balpınar village guards and requested that steps be taken to put an end to it."", ""15. In the evening of 16 March 1993 the applicant's older brother, Orhan Önen, and her parents, Ibrahim and Mome Önen, were killed and the applicant suffered a wound to her foot as a result of a planned action by members of the Balpınar village guards to kill Orhan Önen. Before he was shot and killed, the applicant's father was able to pull the scarf from the head of one of the intruders and shouted that he recognised the gunmen as Ali Ertaş, head of the Balpınar village guards, and his nephew Orhan Ertaş, a former Balpınar village guard. The applicant's mother, who was seriously injured by a bullet, died on her way to hospital."", ""16. The Commander of the local Fosfat gendarme station, who had possibly been informed beforehand of the plan by the Balpınar village guards to kill Orhan Önen, seriously delayed the applicant's mother's access to medical treatment by refusing to provide a car to replace the defective minibus which was to transport her to a hospital and by unduly delaying the departure of this minibus for Mazıdağı."", '17. The subsequent investigation of these killings was not only ineffective and inadequate in professional terms, but was in fact designed to cover up the involvement of the Balpınar village guards and to prevent the conviction of Ali and Orhan Ertaş. From the very beginning of the investigation, and throughout the entire subsequent proceedings, the authorities blamed the PKK for the killings and failed to keep the applicant informed of any steps taken in the investigation.', '18. On 8 October 1992 PKK forces attacked Balpınar village guards on the slopes of the Kırmızıtepe hill close to the village of Balpınar. This clash lasted about twenty minutes. There were no casualties. To date, the perpetrators of this attack have not been found.', '19. On 15 November 1992 PKK forces ambushed nine Balpınar village guards on a road near the village of Karataş. In the course of this clash, which lasted about fifteen minutes, four village guards were killed and four others wounded. An investigation into the clash was carried out. The Fosfat gendarme station commander, Salih Kaygusuz, took statements from the five surviving village guards during the course of the investigation. To date, the perpetrators of this attack have not been identified.', '20. On 16 March 1993 at about 20.15 hours an armed PKK attack using rocket missiles and heavy weapons was carried out on a PTT radio link station in Mazıdağı-Kaletepe, at a distance of about one kilometre from Mazıdağı. The village guards present returned fire. The clash lasted about ten to fifteen minutes. There were no casualties. Shortly after the clash, gendarmes from the Mazıdağı Central gendarme station arrived at the scene. The next day, a land mine was found on the road leading to the PTT station. The initial investigation of this attack was carried out by Mazıdağı Central gendarme station under the responsibility of the public prosecutor at Mazıdağı.', '21. Also in the evening of 16 March 1993 the killing of three Karataş villagers was reported to the public prosecutor in Mazıdağı. For reasons of security, the public prosecutor only arrived at the scene of the incident at 08.00 hours the next morning. He conducted an investigation, including attendance at the post mortem examination of the bodies of the victims carried out by a medical doctor.', ""22. All necessary steps were taken to investigate the killing of the applicant's parents and brother, including the collection of evidence. After having completed his preliminary investigation, the public prosecutor of Mazıdağı issued on 7 July 1993 a decision of lack of jurisdiction and the investigation was referred to the public prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court. This referral resulted in the institution of proceedings against Ali and Orhan Ertaş before the Diyarbakır State Security Court."", 'On 6 May 1994, in the context of these proceedings and on the instructions of the Diyarbakır State Security Court, further statements were taken before a judge of the Mazıdağı Criminal First Instance Court from Ali Ertaş, Mahmut Denli and Mecit Kaya. No statements were taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye, since they no longer resided in Karataş and their new address could not be established.', ""23. On 28 December 1994 the Diyarbakır State Security Court acquitted Ali and Orhan Ertaş for lack of evidence. After this decision the investigation nevertheless continued but the perpetrators of the killing of the applicant's parents and brother have not been found."", ""24. The Government submitted that it appeared from information obtained that the PKK had provided the applicant's brother Orhan with a taxi, which he had put to his own private use. He had thus made his family a target of the PKK, a terrorist organisation which was in all likelihood responsible for the killing of the applicant's parents and brother."", '25. On 16 March 1993 an incident report was drawn up by the gendarmes of the Mazıdağı District gendarme station stating that at around 21.30 hours that day, a group of terrorists belonging to the outlawed PKK organisation entered the home of Ibrahim Önen and opened fire. Ibrahim and Orhan Önen were shot and killed. Mome and Şemsi Önen were injured and Mome Önen died on the way to hospital. The report also referred to nine empty Kalashnikov cartridges without further specifications.', ""On the same date NCO Salih Kaygusuz of the Fosfat Gendarme Station drew a sketch map of the interior of the Önen family's two-room house. It indicated in one room the location of the bodies of Ibrahim and Mome Önen, two blood stains between the body of Ibrahim Önen and the front door and five empty cartridges. In the other room the location of the body of Orhan Önen and four empty cartridges was indicated. No blood stains were recorded in the room where the body of Orhan Önen was indicated. The sketch map only recorded what had been found inside the house. It did not contain any information about the immediate surroundings of the house."", '26. According to a post mortem examination report dated 17 March 1993, due to security precautions, the team of experts only arrived on 17 March 1993 at about 08.00 hours in Karataş, acting on a report that three persons had been killed there on 16 March 1993 at 20.00 hours. This team consisted of the public prosecutor of Mazıdağı Yekta Çobanoğlu, the medical doctor Sedat İşçi of the Mazıdağı Health Centre, a clerk, an autopsy assistant and a driver. The report further indicated that Mome had died on the way to hospital and that her body had been brought back to the village. The bodies of Ibrahim, Mome and Orhan Önen had been identified by a relative, Mehmet Hadi Araç. The examination report contained information on bullet - entries and exits and concluded that the respective causes of death were haemorrhaging of the lungs, loss of blood and cessation of vital functions. Given the obvious nature of the cause of death, it was decided that there was no need to conduct an autopsy.', '27. On 1 and 5 April 1993 statements were taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye by the Fosfat gendarme station commander, Salih Kaygusuz, and by gendarme officer Cengiz Kesler of the Mazıdağı district gendarme station.', ""On 4 April 1993 Salih Kaygusuz took statements from the Balpınar village guards Ali Ertaş, son of Kasım and born in 1953, and Mecit Kaya, son of Mehmet and born in 1960, in relation to the events of 16 March 1993. Ali Ertaş stated that he was the Head of the Balpınar village guards and that on 16 March 1993 he had been on patrol duty on the Kırmızıtepe hill to the west of Balpınar. He denied any involvement in the killing of the applicant's parents and brother and stated that he felt slandered. His account was supported by Mecit Kaya who confirmed that he had been on patrol on the Kırmızıtepe hill together with Ali Ertaş until the morning of 17 March 1993. Mecit Kaya further declared that neither the village of Balpınar nor Ali Ertaş had any involvement in the killings."", 'On 5 April 1993 Mr Salih Kaygusuz took a statement from Orhan Ertaş, son of Şeyhmus and born in 1969, who stated that on 16 March 1993 he had not been in Balpınar. On that day he had been loading goods onto his lorry in the province of Mersin and had driven his lorry to Istanbul. He further declared that due to his work, he never stayed very long in Balpınar.', ""28. Between 7 April and 17 May 1993 a ballistics examination was carried out. According to a ballistics report of 29 April 1993 of the forensic laboratory in Diyarbakır, the nine empty 7.62 mm calibre Kalashnikov cartridges found at the scene of the killing had been fired from three different weapons with the same calibre, i.e. six from one weapon, two from another and one from a third weapon. In a report of 17 May 1993, transmitted to the Mazıdağı prosecutor, the forensic laboratory in Diyarbakır concluded that none of the nine cartridges found at the scene of the killings matched the five empty cartridges reportedly taken from the Kalashnikov rifle of Ali Ertaş and that, therefore, the nine cartridges had not been fired from Ali Ertaş' weapon."", ""29. On 7 July 1993 the Mazıdağı public prosecutor Yekta Çobanoğlu, decided that he lacked jurisdiction to deal with the case. The decision listed Ali and Orhan Ertaş as being suspected of the offence of “politically motivated murder” of the applicant's parents and brother. It noted that, following its investigation, the District gendarme command had concluded that unidentified members of the PKK terrorist organisation had committed the killings, but that, according to the respective accounts of the applicant and her sister Mekiye, their father had recognised the perpetrators as Ali and Orhan Ertaş. Concluding that the alleged offence fell within the scope of Law No. 2845, it was decided that the Mazıdağı prosecutor's office lacked jurisdiction and that the case-file should be transmitted to the prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court."", ""30. On 13 September 1993, following referral of the prosecution's case file to the prosecutor at the Diyarbakır State Security Court, the prosecutor at this court, Tanju Güvendiren, took certain additional measures with respect to the ballistics examination. He enquired as to why only five empty cartridge shells had been sent for examination, whereas six such cartridges taken from Kalashnikov weapons owned by six village guards had been required for a comparison. He further instructed the gendarmerie to provide him with a list of the Karataş village guards as well as the Kalashnikov delivery receipts of these village guards and to send the Kalashnikov delivered to Ali Ertaş and all other Kalashnikovs belonging to the village guards to the forensic laboratory in Diyarbakır for a ballistics examination. In the event of there being insufficient replacement rifles, he instructed that these rifles be discharged and the empty cartridges numbered in order to identify which cartridge was fired from which weapon and to send these cartridges to the forensic laboratory for a ballistics examination."", ""On 19 October 1993 the Mazıdağı District gendarme command sent to the prosecutor's office at the Diyarbakır State Security Court sixty-five weapon and ammunition delivery receipts of the Balpınar village guards and sixty-five numbered empty cartridges. No information was provided as to the circumstances of the firing of the weapons. On 27 October 1994 the Regional Criminal Police Laboratory in Diyarbakır submitted to the State Security Court a ballistics examination report which concluded that none of the sixty-five empty 7.62 mm Kalashnikov cartridges matched the nine cartridges found at the place where the applicant's parents and brother had been shot."", ""31. On 6 January 1994 prosecutor Tanju Güvendiren charged Ali and Orhan Ertaş with politically motivated murder of the applicant's parents and brother Orhan, under Articles 31, 33 and 448 of the Turkish Penal Code and Article 13/2 of the Law No. 6136."", 'On 21 January 1994 the State Security Court instructed the Mazıdağı Court of First Instance, inter alia, to take statements from Ali and Orhan Ertaş, Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli, and to take evidence from Şemsi and Mekiye Önen. It adjourned its further examination until 16 March 1994. On that date it noted that the results of its instructions had not yet arrived and that it appeared from the case-file that weapons seized from the suspects had been sent to the Diyarbakır Police Laboratory for a ballistics examination.', 'Pending the implementation of its above-mentioned orders for the hearing of witnesses and a request for the preparation of a further forensic laboratory report, the State Security Court adjourned the proceedings several times, on the last occasion until 28 December 1994.', '32. In the meantime, according to a statement dated 4 May 1994 and signed by the gendarmes Yusuf Kocer and Salih Günay and by the Muhtar of Karataş Muhittin Araç, the applicant and her sister Mekiye were living around Cezaevi in the Diyarbakır province, but their address could not be established. In another statement dated 4 May 1994 and signed by the same gendarmes and the Muhtar of Balpınar, Izettin Kaya, it was noted that the current whereabouts of Orhan Ertaş were unknown.', ""On 6 May 1994, in the presence of the Mazıdağı public prosecutor Yekta Çobanoğlu, the judge at the Mazıdağı Court of First Instance, Ayhan İstikbal, took statements from Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya and Ali Ertaş. It was noted that Orhan Ertaş had not appeared. Ali Ertaş stated that Orhan Ertaş had left Balpınar some time ago, that he was unaware of Orhan's whereabouts and, in any event, Orhan had not been in the village for a long time. As regards the applicant and her sister Mekiye, it was noted that they had not appeared and that the response to their summons indicated that they were not in the village and were residing in the Cezaevi neighbourhood in Diyarbakır. On 29 June 1994 the State Security Court noted that no statements had been taken from the applicant and her sister Mekiye as their address could not be established."", '33. On 28 December 1994 the State Security Court tried the case in the absence of the defendants as well as of the applicant and her sister. The prosecution submitted that the applicant and her sister had only heard their father state the names of the accused but that there was no other evidence supporting their account. The prosecution argued that, in these circumstances, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt and acquitted. By judgment of 28 December 1994 the State Security Court unanimously acquitted Ali and Orhan Ertaş of the charges against them.', '34. Since the facts of the case are disputed, particularly concerning the circumstances of the killings and the adequacy of the follow-up investigation, the Commission conducted an investigation with the assistance of the parties. The Commission obtained documentary evidence, including written statements. The oral evidence of the applicant and 12 witnesses was heard by three Delegates at a hearing in Ankara on 30 March and 1 and 2 April 1998.', ""35. As regards written evidence, the Commission had particular regard to the statements of both the applicant and his sister Mekiye Önen of 1 and 5 April 1993 (taken by the Fosfat gendarme station commander Salih Kaygusuz and by gendarme officer Cengiz Kesler of the Mazıdağı district gendarme station); a statement by the applicant of 9 June 1993 (taken by Mr Yekta Çobanoğlu, the public prosecutor of Mazıdağı); an undated statement taken by Mr Sedat Aslantaş of the Diyarbakır Branch of the Human Rights Association (submitted to the Commission on 18 October 1993); a statement by the applicant's sister of 6 July 1993 (taken by Yekta Çobanoğlu); statements by village guards Ali Ertaş and Mecit Kaya taken on 4 and 5 April 1993 (at Fosfat gendarme station by Salih Kaygusuz); a statement by Mahmut Denli (taken on 5 April 1993 by gendarme Cengiz Kesler at the Mazıdağı District gendarme station); a statement of 6 July 1993 of Ali Ertaş (taken by Yekta Çobanoğlu); statements taken on 6 May 1994 from Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya and Ali Ertaş by judge Ayhan İstikbal of the Mazıdağı Court of First Instance upon request of the State Security Court of Diyarbakır."", ""The Commission also had regard to an incident report and a sketch map, both dated 16 March 1993; an ambulance record of 16 March 1993; a post mortem examination report dated 17 March 1993; correspondence of the Mazıdağı public prosecutor; forensic ballistics inquiries and examinations; Yekta Çobanoğlu's decision of lack of jurisdiction dated 7 July 1993 and a number of minutes of the proceedings before the State Security Court; as well as other documents."", 'The latter included gendarme reports and statements related to the investigation of the attack on Balpınar village guards on 15 November 1992, according to which a group of nine Balpınar village guards travelling by tractor on the road from Balpınar to the Fosfat gendarme station were attacked by PKK forces on 15 November 1992 at around 16.00 hours. At the time of the attack, the village guards found themselves between the villages Arısu and Karataş. Four village guards were injured, amongst whom Ramazan Ertaş, son of Kasım and born in 1955. Four others were killed, amongst whom Nesrettin Ertaş, son of Şeyhmus and born in 1965, and Davut Ertaş, son of Kasım and born in 1944.', ""Account was also taken of letters of various dates between 30 June 1995 and 25 March 1998, from the Commander of the Mazıdağı District gendarme station to the office of the public prosecutor in Mazıdağı in which he informed the public prosecutor that the identities of the PKK members who had killed the applicant's parents and brother had not yet been established. A number of these letters, including one sent on 25 March 1998, stated that the investigation of the matter was still ongoing."", '36. The oral evidence included statements by the applicant herself, Mekiye Önen, Ercan Önen, Muhittin Araç, Tahir Önen, Mehmet Hadi Araç, Salih Kaygusuz, Mahmut Denli, Mecit Kaya, Yekta Çobanoğlu, Sedat İşçi, Cengiz Kesler and Tanju Güvendiren.', ""37. The verbatim record of the hearing held on 30 March 1998 contained the following passages of relevance to the Government's preliminary objection as to the authenticity of the application (see paragraph 71 below):"", '“Mr RESS: Did you make two statements at the station, and did you sign them?', ""Miss Şemsi ÖNEN: Yes. I went there a few times. They asked me questions. I answered them. They wrote them down. I put my fingerprint as I don't know how to write. But I don't know what they wrote. I answered the questions just as I'm doing here now. My brother was with me. I put my fingerprint to the statements."", ""Mr. RESS: Since you cannot read, I will only show you your fingerprint, and you will say whether it's yours or not."", 'A document is shown to the applicant.', ""Miss Şemsi ÖNEN: Yes, it's mine. That's how I put my fingerprint.”"", '38. In relation to the oral evidence, the Commission was aware of the difficulties in assessing evidence obtained orally through interpreters: it therefore paid careful attention to the meaning and significance to be attributed to the statements made by the witnesses appearing before its Delegates. The Commission was aware that the cultural context of the applicant and witnesses rendered it inevitable that there would be a certain degree of imprecision with regard to dates and other details. However it did not consider that this by itself detracted from the credibility of the testimony.', ""In a case where there were contradictory and conflicting factual accounts of events, the Commission was acutely aware of its own limitations as a first instance tribunal of fact. The problems of language were adverted to above; there was also an inevitable lack of detailed and direct familiarity with the conditions in the region. In addition, the Commission had no powers to take specific measures to compel witnesses to give oral or written evidence. In the present case, despite the Commission's specific request, the Government failed to submit certain relevant documents. The Commission was therefore faced with the difficult task of determining events on the basis of incomplete evidence."", ""The Commission's findings can be summarised as follows."", ""39. The villages of Balpınar and Karataş were situated in an area which was subjected to significant PKK activity in the early 1990's. It was undisputed that, prior to the events at issue, village guards from Balpınar had been attacked on two occasions by PKK forces and that, on 16 March 1993, PKK forces attacked a nearby PTT radio link installation."", 'The inhabitants of Karataş, Balpınar and about forty other villages belonged to the “Metina” clan. It appeared that, at the relevant time, all villages belonging to this clan, with the exception of the village of Karataş and one other village, had village guards and that pressure was exerted to join the village guard system. A number of witnesses stated that the refusal of Karataş to join the village guard system had resulted in tension between Karataş and Balpınar. Other witnesses denied such tension. The public prosecutor at Mazıdağı confirmed that he had heard rumours that the inhabitants of Karataş opposed the Turkish State and, therefore, the village guards were their enemies. The Balpınar village guards were not authorised to act on their own initiative. They received their orders from and had to report to the Commander of the nearby Fosfat gendarme station.', ""40. Although it could not make any definite findings on this point, the Commission did not consider it to be implausible that Karataş' refusal to join the village guard system during a period of significant PKK activity in the area, had resulted in tension between the village guards of Balpınar and the inhabitants of Karataş."", ""41. The Commission was satisfied from the evidence given by the applicant and her sister, that in the evening of 16 March 1993 after having introduced themselves as soldiers knowing that the Muhtar was absent from Karataş and wishing to conduct a house search, two armed and masked men entered their family home. One of the men immediately shot and killed their brother Orhan. In the course of their struggle with the intruders, the applicant's father was shot and killed by one of the intruders and the applicant's mother was seriously injured by a shot fired by the other intruder. There was no reason to doubt that both the applicant and her sister heard their father call out the names of the two perpetrators whom he had recognised as Ali and Orhan Ertaş from Balpınar."", ""The killings in question were the result of a premeditated plan to kill the applicant's brother. As to the possible motive for the killing it could not be excluded that there were tensions between the inhabitants of Karataş and the Balpınar village guards at the relevant time which had already resulted in armed attacks on houses in Karataş. Nor could it be excluded that Orhan Önen may have been a particular target because of his suspected involvement in the PKK killing of village guards from Balpınar. On the other hand, the Government's contention that the PKK had a motive for killing Orhan Önen because they had provided him with a vehicle which he had used for his own benefit rather than for services required by the PKK had not only remained unsubstantiated but was, moreover, contradicted by substantial evidence submitted by the applicant."", ""42. As to the circumstances of the killing itself, the Commission found it established that the killers were aware that the Muhtar of Karataş was absent from the village and that the applicant and her sister heard their father call out the names of the perpetrators, identifying them as Ali and Orhan Ertaş. Moreover, the evidence of Mahmut Denli and Mecit Kaya that the Balpınar village guards, including Ali Ertaş, had been on guard duty throughout the night of 16 March 1993 was at least open to question. In addition, the suspicion of the involvement of Balpınar village guards was reinforced by the identification of Ali and Orhan Ertaş by the applicant and her sister at the Mazıdağı gendarme station. Nevertheless, while the evidence was sufficient to give rise to suspicion as to the identity of the killers, it had not been established to the required standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant's brother, father and mother were killed by agents of the State."", 'In this connection, the Commission noted that the applicant had given the Delegates a description of the two men: the one who shot her brother Orhan and her mother had been described as a person with long fair hair, hazel eyes and a fair complexion, whilst the man who shot their father was described as having a moustache and black eyes. Her sister, Mekiye, confirmed that the man who shot Orhan had hazel eyes but stated that she had not seen the second intruder. The applicant had further given evidence that, on 5 April 1993, when she subsequently attended the Mazıdağı gendarme station, she saw Ali and Orhan Ertaş and recognised them as the same two men. This was confirmed by Mekiye in that, on the same occasion, she had recognised Orhan Ertaş as one of the killers from his height, build, hazel eyes, nose and complexion.', ""The Commission considered that this evidence should be treated with caution. In the circumstances of the sudden and traumatic events of that night, it was at least doubtful whether either the applicant or her sister would have had an opportunity to form a clear and accurate impression of the features of either man. In particular, Mekiye appeared only fleetingly to have seen her brother's killer, whose face had been masked with a scarf. The Commission noted that the description given by them of Orhan and Ali was contradicted by Muhittin Araç, who knew both men and who described Orhan as being lean with a dark complexion and black hair and Ali as being a more bulky man of the same height with a light complexion and chestnut brown hair."", 'As to the evidence of the subsequent identification of these two men, the Commission found no reason to doubt that the applicant and her sister did see Ali and Orhan Ertaş at the Mazıdağı gendarme station on 5 April 1993. What was, however, more doubtful was whether the identification of the two men was entirely spontaneous or whether the applicant and her sister were made aware that the men were Ali and Orhan, whose names had been called out by their father.', ""43. Finally, it had not been established that Salih Kaygusuz, the Commander of the Fosfat gendarme station, had considerably delayed the provision of medical treatment to the applicant's injured mother or that the gendarme forces failed to offer her available assistance. In this connection, the Commission had regard to its findings as regards the time of the armed attack and the moment at which the applicant's mother received medical care in Mazıdağı."", ""44. From the evidence of Salih Kaygusuz it appeared that, after the minibus transporting the applicant's mother had left for Mazıdağı, he reported the incident in Karataş to his superiors at the District gendarme station in Mazıdağı and stated that he suspected that the PKK was responsible for the killings. He was told that, for reasons of security, the public prosecutor would only come to Karataş the next morning. He then ordered a first gendarme team to secure the area around Karataş. A second team, led by himself, joined the first team some time later. Thereupon, he and one gendarme team went to Karataş. They arrived sometime after midnight and found the bodies of the three victims inside the applicant's house."", '45. Although the local gendarmes only arrived in Karataş at least three hours after the killings occurred, the Commission accepted that this delay had been caused by the fact that on the same evening an armed attack on a nearby radio link installation had taken place. However, once in Karataş, the gendarmes only secured the scene of the crime and, in the absence of any instructions, passively awaited the arrival of the competent investigation authorities, in the instant case the public prosecutor at Mazıdağı.', '46. According to Salih Kaygusuz, the villagers present were unwilling to provide the first team of gendarmes with any information about the killings. After having secured the scene of the killings, he and the other gendarmes merely awaited the arrival of the prosecutor since they had not been ordered to take any investigative steps.', '47. In the morning of 17 March 1993 an investigation team consisting of the public prosecutor of Mazıdağı, Yekta Çobanoğlu, and, amongst others, Dr. Sedat İşçi left Mazıdağı for Karataş.', ""After the investigation team had arrived in Karataş and before attending the post mortem examination of the victims' bodies, the public prosecutor briefly inspected the scene of the killings and ordered Salih Kaygusuz to draw a sketch map of the scene of the killings and to collect the empty cartridges lying there. Without having been numbered and without having recorded the exact location of each cartridge, the nine empty cartridges found were put together in a bag and handed to the public prosecutor. No photographs of the scene of the killings were taken by or on behalf of the investigation team."", ""48. The information recorded on the sketch map of the scene of the killings appeared to be incomplete. In contrast to a remark in the post mortem body examination report and the testimony of Dr. Sedat İşçi, the sketch map did not indicate a large blood stain on the spot where the body of Orhan Önen had been found. Furthermore, although both Salih Kaygusuz, who drew the sketch map, and Yekta Çobanoğlu were aware that the body of the applicant's mother had been moved, this fact had not been recorded on the sketch map. Although the Commission accepted that, at the time this sketch map was drawn, the members of the investigation team may have been unaware of the fact that the body of the applicant's father had also been moved from the outside of the house, the subsequent investigation could not have been assisted by the fact that the scope of the sketch map was confined to the inside of the house and did not contain any information about the immediate surroundings."", ""49. The Commission noted that, according to the post mortem examination report, the applicant's brother, lying in bed, was hit by numerous bullets in his face, by one bullet in his chest and by another bullet in his knee. The Commission found this recorded observation difficult to reconcile with the fact that, according to the sketch map, only four empty cartridges were found in the room where Orhan Önen was shot and with the evidence that not a single bullet had been found in that room. Furthermore, although there was strong evidence suggesting that the applicant's father had been shot and killed outside the house, the sketch map only contained information on what had been found inside the house. Although this was denied by Salih Kaygusuz, the Commission could not exclude that more than the nine recorded empty cartridges were in fact found and collected, including empty cartridges found outside the house."", ""50. After having conducted the examination of the bodies and released the victims' remains for burial, the investigation team left Karataş. Although the public prosecutor was aware that both the applicant and her sister were present in Karataş during the visit of the investigation team, neither the public prosecutor nor any other official took any statement's from them or any of the other inhabitants of Karataş on that day."", ""51. As early as 17 March 1993 the public prosecutor suspected that the PKK was responsible for the killings and, in a telegram sent the same day, informed the office of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court in Diyarbakır accordingly. Although in his evidence to the Commission's Delegates, Yekta Çobanoğlu stressed that this had only been a provisional opinion, his respective requests dated 17 March 1993 to the Census Directorate in Mazıdağı to issue death certificates in respect of the applicant's parents and brother simply state that they “were murdered by fire-armed members of the outlawed PKK terrorist organisation” and, consequently, their deaths were officially recorded as having been caused by the PKK terrorist organisation."", ""52. It was only on 1 April 1993 that the applicant and her sister Mekiye gave a statement about the events of 16 March 1993 to the commander of the Fosfat gendarme station Salih Kaygusuz. The applicant stated that she had heard her father call out the names of the intruders and she further gave a description of the intruders' physical appearance. Mekiye stated that she had heard her father call out only one name and did not give any description of the intruders' physical features. According to Salih Kaygusuz, this was the first time that he heard the allegation that Ali and Orhan Ertaş had committed the killings."", ""53. In his testimony to the Delegates, Salih Kaygusuz had a firm recollection that he had also taken statements from Muhittin Araç, Tahir Önen and Mahmut Denli. In reply to the request of the Commission's Delegates to submit these statements, the Government stated by letter of 21 January 1999 that Salih Kaygusuz had not participated in the interrogation of these three persons. The Commission further noted that its case-file did not contain any statement given by any of these three persons at the Fosfat gendarme station."", '54. The Commission further found it established that Yekta Çobanoğlu, from the outset, had a rather firm conviction that PKK forces had committed the killings. Although he stressed that this had only been a provisional opinion inspired by views expressed by the gendarmes and his own experience, the Commission found no support for the asserted provisional nature of this suspicion. In fact, it appeared from the contents of his written communications of 17 March 1993 that he had firm ideas about the identity of the perpetrators. This element, taken together with his failure to try to talk to the applicant and her sister on 17 March 1993, resulted in a loss of time in the initial phase of the investigation.', '55. As regards the encounter on 5 April 1993 between the applicant and her sister and Ali and Orhan Ertaş in the Mazıdağı District gendarme station, the Commission found that it could not be excluded that this encounter was in fact the result of a coincidence since Yekta Çobanoğlu had not ordered a confrontation. It did not appear from the evidence that the applicant and her sister had been invited by the investigation authorities to identify the perpetrators either from a collection of photographs or at an identity parade. The Commission found that no photographs of Ali and Orhan Ertaş had ever been shown to the applicant and her sister and that at no point in time had a formal confrontation been ordered.', 'The Commission further noted from the evidence submitted that, apart from the statement taken from Orhan Ertaş at the Fosfat gendarme station on 5 April 1993, hardly any attempts were made or seriously pursued to obtain any further evidence from him. Nor did it seem that any attempt had been made to verify his alibi by, for instance, checking his whereabouts on 16 and 17 March 1993 by seeking confirmation from those persons present when he was allegedly loading goods in Mersin or from those to whom he had delivered these goods. It did not appear from the statement he gave at the Fosfat gendarme station that he was in fact asked to give the names of persons who had seen him on 16 and 17 March 1993.', ""As regards the alibi advanced by Ali Ertaş, the Commission noted that his presence on Kırmızıtepe hill at the time of the killings was in fact only supported by the statements of Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli, whereas the latter had stated to the Commission's Delegates that he had not in fact been in the presence of Ali Ertaş at the time of the killings, but had only seen him shortly afterwards. Given the evidence that there were, in total, 65 village guards in Balpınar who were organised in teams of 12-14 persons, the Commission found it remarkable that, apart from Mecit Kaya, no evidence was taken from the other village guards who were on duty in the same team as Ali Ertaş at the relevant time in order to verify the respective positions of each team member on Kırmızıtepe hill that evening."", '56. After having received the case-file, Tanju Güvendiren, the public prosecutor at the State Security Court noted that the investigation had been incomplete. In order to complete the investigation, he issued a number of instructions to the Mazıdağı District gendarme station by letter of 13 September 1993 including that comparison cartridges be taken from the weapons held by the village guards from Karataş. On 19 October 1993 the Commander of the Mazıdağı District gendarme station transmitted 65 weapon delivery receipts and 65 empty cartridges taken from the Balpınar village guards to the office of the public prosecutor at the State Security Court. This letter contained no information as to when and in which manner these cartridges were obtained.', 'Although Tanju Güvendiren considered that there was no concrete evidence in support of the accusations made against Ali and Orhan Ertaş and was convinced that the PKK was responsible for the killings, he nevertheless brought proceedings against Ali and Orhan Ertaş on charges of politically motivated murder and indicted them on 6 January 1994 before the State Security Court, which had jurisdiction to determine murder charges linked to terrorism. He did not find it necessary to take any further statements or to order the arrest or pre-trial detention of the accused. In his opinion, it was excluded that the security forces would cover up a crime committed by village guards.', 'In the subsequent proceedings before it, the State Security Court in Diyarbakır requested, inter alia, that statements be taken from Ali and Orhan Ertaş, from the applicant and her sister Mekiye, and from Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli. They were all summoned to appear on 6 May 1994 before a judge of the Mazıdağı Court of First Instance in order to give statements, but only Ali Ertaş, Mecit Kaya and Mahmut Denli in fact did so. As the whereabouts of Orhan Ertaş, the applicant and her sister were not established, their summonses were returned to the State Security Court and, consequently, no further statements were taken from them.', ""The Commission noted that, although the gendarmes and the State Security Court were informed that the applicant and her sister were residing in the Cezaevi neighbourhood in Diyarbakır, it did not appear that any attempts were made or ordered to locate them. Nor did it seem that any further attempts were made or ordered to find Orhan Ertaş. The Commission noted that the Muhtar of Karataş, Muhittin Araç, testified that he had been aware of the exact address of the applicant and her sister in Diyarbakır, but that he had never been asked to provide the local gendarmes with this address. He explained his signature on a document dated 4 May 1994 by stating that it had been normal practice in the area for gendarmes to require Muhtars to sign blank documents for future use. No further clarification on this point could be obtained from Salih Kaygusuz, as he had left the Fosfat gendarme station in August 1993. In these circumstances, it was impossible for the Commission to make any findings in this respect. What was clear, however, was that the State Security Court was informed that the applicant and her sister were residing at that time in the Cezaevi neighbourhood of Diyarbakır. In this connection, the Commission had also regard to the evidence of the applicant's brother that, since their departure from Karataş and to date, the Önen family had always lived at the same address in Diyarbakır."", '57. The Commission accepted that the supplementary investigation measures ordered by the public prosecutor at the State Security Court, Tanju Güvendiren, in order to mend certain deficiencies in the preliminary investigation, were appropriate, although it was open to doubt whether, given the passage of time since the killings, these measures were as effective as they might have been in the initial phase of the proceedings. Moreover, he testified that he was convinced at the outset that the PKK was responsible for the killings, which might explain why he decided to indict Ali and Orhan Ertaş before the State Security Court, rather than referring the case to a court competent to try common crimes. This was supported by the fact that, apart from Ali Ertaş, none of the other vital witnesses gave evidence to the State Security Court.', '58. The principles and procedures relating to liability for acts contrary to the law may be summarised as follows.', ""59. Under the Turkish Criminal Code (TPC) all forms of homicide (Articles 448 to 455) and attempted homicide (Articles 61 and 62) constitute criminal offences. The authorities' obligations in respect of conducting a preliminary investigation into acts or omissions capable of constituting such offences that have been brought to their attention are governed by Articles 151 to 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Offences may be reported to the authorities or the security forces as well as to public prosecutor's offices. The complaint may be made in writing or orally. If it is made orally, the authority must make a record of it (Article 151)."", ""By Article 235 of the Criminal Code, any public official who fails to report to the police or a public prosecutor's office an offence of which he has become aware in the exercise of his duty is liable to imprisonment."", 'A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to the suspicion that an offence has been committed is obliged to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not there should be a prosecution (Article 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure).', '60. In the case of alleged terrorist offences, the public prosecutor is deprived of jurisdiction in favour of a separate system of State Security prosecutors and courts established throughout Turkey.', ""61. If the suspected offender is a civil servant and if the offence was committed during the performance of his duties, the preliminary investigation of the case is governed by the Law of 1914 on the prosecution of civil servants, which restricts the public prosecutor's jurisdiction ratione personae at that stage of the proceedings. In such cases it is for the relevant local administrative council (for the district or province, depending on the suspect's status) to conduct the preliminary investigation and, consequently, to decide whether to prosecute. Once a decision to prosecute has been taken, it is for the public prosecutor to investigate the case."", 'An appeal to the Supreme Administrative Court lies against a decision of the Council. If a decision not to prosecute is taken, the case is automatically referred to that court.', ""62. By virtue of Article 4, paragraph (i), of Legislative Decree no. 285 of 10 July 1987 on the authority of the governor of a state of emergency region, the 1914 Law (see paragraph 61 above) also applies to members of the security forces who come under the governor's authority."", '63. If the suspect is a member of the armed forces, the applicable law is determined by the nature of the offence. Thus, if it is a “military offence” under the Military Criminal Code (Law no. 1632), the criminal proceedings are in principle conducted in accordance with Law no. 353 on the establishment of courts martial and their rules of procedure. Where a member of the armed forces has been accused of an ordinary offence, it is normally the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure which apply (see Article 145 § 1 of the Constitution and sections 9 to 14 of Law no. 353).', ""The Military Criminal Code makes it a military offence for a member of the armed forces to endanger a person's life by disobeying an order (Article 89). In such cases civilian complainants may lodge their complaints with the authorities referred to in the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 59 above) or with the offender's superior."", '64. Under section 13 of Law no. 2577 on administrative procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation from them. If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings.', '65. Article 125 §§ 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides:', '“All acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review ...', 'The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.”', ""66. That provision establishes the State's strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people's lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities. Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons."", '67. Article 8 of Legislative Decree no. 430 of 16 December 1990, the last sentence of which was inspired by the provision mentioned above (see paragraph 66 above), provides:', '“No criminal, financial or legal liability may be asserted against ... the governor of a state of emergency region or by provincial governors in that region in respect of decisions taken, or acts performed, by them in the exercise of the powers conferred on them by this legislative decree, and no application shall be made to any judicial authority to that end. This is without prejudice to the rights of individuals to claim reparation from the State for damage which they have been caused without justification.”', ""68. Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47). The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal court on the issue of the defendant's guilt (Article 53)."", ""However, under section 13 of Law no. 657 on State employees, anyone who has sustained loss as a result of an act done in the performance of duties governed by public law may, in principle, only bring an action against the authority by whom the civil servant concerned is employed and not directly against the civil servant (see Article 129 § 5 of the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations). That is not, however, an absolute rule. When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an “administrative act” or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring an action against the authority on the basis of its joint liability as the official's employer (Article 50 of the Code of Obligations).""]","['13', '2']",[],[],"['14', '2', '3', '8']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1943 and lived in Chişinău. He did not have a family and lived alone.', '6. In 1987 the applicant was found guilty of criticising the Soviet authorities and of expressing the view that Moldova had been occupied by the Soviet Union and that it should reunite with Romania. On the basis of a medical report ordered by the Soviet courts, he was declared mentally unsound and sent for forced treatment in a psychiatric hospital in eastern Ukraine. He was held there for one year, after which he was released and obliged to continue out-patient treatment in Chişinău.', '7. In 1990 the sentence against the applicant was quashed and he was acquitted.', '8. On an unspecified date the applicant learned that he could obtain compensation for his illegal conviction and detention in a psychiatric hospital and that there was no time-limit for filing such an action.', '9. In September 2004 he initiated civil proceedings against the Ministry of Finance, claiming compensation. He argued, inter alia, that after the forced medical treatment administered to him in 1987-1988 he had started to experience health problems, in particular he had lost his memory, had become emotionally frozen and unstable and therefore had been forced to live on a very small disability allowance.', '10. During the proceedings the Ministry of Finance questioned his fitness to plead before courts in view of his medical background.', '11. The applicant disagreed with the defendant, but fearing that his action would not be examined, agreed to submit to a medical examination in order to prove the contrary.', '12. On an unspecified date the applicant underwent a medical examination by a specialised commission; however, the commission could not reach a conclusion. In a document dated 25 February 2004 it concluded that it would be impossible to reach a conclusion without a thorough examination of the applicant under conditions of hospitalisation.', '13. On 14 March 2005 Judge V.G. of the Râşcani District Court examined the possibility of committing the applicant for an in-patient examination. As the applicant agreed to be hospitalised, the court ordered on the same date an in-patient medical examination to be conducted by the Central Psychiatric Hospital, Department of Judicial Investigations.', '14. On 4 April 2005 the applicant went to the hospital, where, to his surprise, he was deprived of all his belongings and hospitalised together with persons of unsound mind with limited freedom of movement. According to him, the hospital was no longer heated in April, and since the clothes he was provided with were too thin for the season, he caught a cold and developed acute bronchitis. Two days after his hospitalisation he asked to be released in order to go home, change clothes and buy medicines for his cold. However, the doctors did not authorise him to leave the ward in which he was hospitalised.', ""15. It appears from the applicant's medical record that during his stay in the hospital he was not visited by anyone. According to him he could not complain to anyone about his detention and could not even make a telephone call or complain by other means to persons outside the hospital."", '16. He was seen by doctors for only several minutes per day, during the routine morning round. The rest of the day he was at the mercy of the paramedical staff who usually forced patients to carry out public utility work around the hospital. He was not obliged to work because of his age and poor physical condition.', '17. On 29 April 2005 the applicant was released from the hospital. According to him, it took a long time to recover but he preferred not to complain immediately for fear of adverse consequences. He submitted that he feared being placed in detention again or that the results of the examination would be falsified.', '18. On 16 May 2005 the psychiatric hospital issued a report in which it concluded that the applicant was suffering from a mental condition, but that his reasoning was unaffected and that he was fit to plead before courts.', ""19. On 9 June 2005 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Prosecutor's Office of the Centru District, asking it to prosecute the doctors who had held him in detention against his will. He described the conditions in which he had been detained and named two doctors who had refused his requests to be allowed to leave the hospital. He argued that those doctors had committed an offence under Article 166 of the Criminal Code – illegal deprivation of liberty – and asked for compensation."", ""20. On 30 June 2005 the Prosecutor's Office dismissed the applicant's complaint. The applicant challenged the dismissal before the Centru District Court."", ""21. On 21 July 2005 Judge A.B. of the Centru District Court upheld the applicant's appeal and found, inter alia, that the Prosecutor's Office had failed to clarify the conditions under which the in-patient medical examination was initially intended to be carried out, and also the conditions in which it had in fact been carried out. The Prosecutor's Office had also failed to examine the applicant's written request by which he had expressed his consent to be hospitalised and the manner of hospitalisation to which he had consented. Judge A.B. ordered a new investigation into the applicant's complaint."", ""22. On 12 October 2005 the Prosecutor's Office dismissed the applicant's complaint, again without giving any new arguments. It only stated that the instructions of the Centru District Court had been followed, but that this did not influence the initial decision not to institute criminal proceedings. The applicant again challenged the dismissal."", ""23. On 9 November 2005 Judge A.B. of the Centru District Court dismissed the applicant's appeal, finding that his detention had been carried out in accordance with the court order of 14 March 2005."", ""24. The Code of Civil Procedure provides for only one possibility for a person to be submitted to a psychiatric examination against his or her will. Chapter 28 of the Code deals with the proceedings intended to limit the legal capacity of a person. According to Article 302 such proceedings can be initiated by the State, by a prosecutor or by the family of a person of unsound mind or who makes abusive use of alcohol or drugs. Article 305 provides that a judge examining an action to limit a person's legal capacity can order the person concerned to undergo a psychiatric medical examination. If the person does not comply with the order, the judge can decide, during a hearing at which a psychiatrist is present, to oblige the person to undergo a psychiatric examination despite his or her opposition."", '25. Section 11 of the Law on Psychiatric Assistance provides that a person can be hospitalised in a psychiatric hospital for treatment against his or her will only in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code or in accordance with the provisions of section 28 of that law. In both cases, except for reasons of urgency, the hospitalisation must be ordered on the basis of a decision taken by a commission of psychiatrists.', 'Section 28 of the same law sets out the reasons which can be relied upon for hospitalising a person for treatment against his or her will. It provides that a person suffering from a mental disorder can be hospitalised against his or her will, before a court judgment for that purpose has been issued, when the mental disorder is particularly serious and constitutes a risk to himself or herself or to others, when the mental disorder is of such a nature that the person is incapable of meeting his or her vital needs alone, and if left untreated, the mental disorder could cause serious harm to the health of the individual concerned.', ""Pursuant to section 32 of the law the compulsory hospitalisation for treatment of a person in accordance with section 28 must be decided by a court. The hospital must apply to the court for permission, indicating in the application the reasons for which the hospitalisation is sought and attaching a copy of the decision of a commission of psychiatrists. Pursuant to section 33, the court examining the application must take a decision within three days from the date on which the application was lodged and the person concerned has the right to participate in the hearing. If the person's condition is serious and he or she cannot come to the court, the judge is obliged to hold the hearing at the hospital. The judgment issued at the end of the hearing constitutes the basis for compulsory hospitalisation."", 'Section 39 of the same law provides, inter alia, that a patient hospitalised in a psychiatric hospital with his consent can leave the hospital upon his or her request. On the other hand, a patient hospitalised against his or her will can leave the hospital only upon the decision of a commission of psychiatrists or on the basis of a court judgment.']",['5'],['5-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The first three applicants, Mr Gheorghe Straisteanu, Ms Natalia Straisteanu and Ms Daniela Straisteanu, are a family of Moldovan nationals who were born in 1954, 1957 and 1986 respectively. The fourth applicant, Codrana-Lux S.R.L., is a limited liability company incorporated in Moldova. Sixty percent of its stock belongs to the first three applicants’ family.', '6. The first applicant is a well-known businessman and a former member of the Moldovan Parliament, between 1998 and 2001. He was, inter alia, the founder of the first Moldovan private television company and owned a chain of petrol stations. After the Communist party won the general election in 2001 he retired from politics and had to wind up most of his businesses, including the television station and the petrol business.', '7. In May 2001 the fourth applicant bought a plot of land measuring 14.63 hectares from the Onesti Local Council. The land was later sold by the fourth applicant to the first two applicants. Subsequently, the first applicant donated a part of the land to the third applicant and an artificial lake was built on the family’s property.', '8. Also in May 2001, the fourth applicant concluded a contract of lease with the Onesti Local Council for a period of ten years concerning a natural lake measuring 5.63 hectares adjacent to the property which it had bought.', '9. The first three applicants settled on the above property and developed it with a view to using it for tourism and fishing. According to them, in 2005 Government officials started to exercise pressure on the first applicant to induce him to give up the property.', '10. On 20 July 2005 the first applicant was arrested in Chişinău together with his driver. At the police station, he was informed that he and his driver were being accused of carrying out a series of car thefts over the past year in Chişinău. It would appear that several criminal complaints concerning car thefts were joined in a single procedure, while others were joined later (see paragraph 14 below).', '11. On 22 July 2005 the Centru District Court issued a detention warrant in the first applicant’s name for a period of ten days. The grounds for detention were that he was suspected of committing a serious offence punishable by more than two years’ imprisonment, that the criminal case was complex, and that he might abscond, hinder the investigation and the finding of the truth. An appeal by the applicant was dismissed and his detention was subsequently extended on the same grounds.', '12. On 18 August 2005 Judge A.B. from the same court ordered the applicant’s release. The grounds for release were that there were no reasons to believe that the applicant would abscond or hinder in any way the investigation. However, the prosecuting authorities refused to comply with the order and continued to hold the applicant in detention. They applied a second time for an extension of the detention but Judge A. B. refused again on 19 August 2005 and found that the prosecutor had failed to comply with his previous decision and that therefore the applicant’s detention had been unlawful. The prosecutor refused again to comply with the order of release and ordered his further detention on account of charges of theft from a Volkswagen car, an episode which had not been joined to the main criminal case at that time. On the same date the prosecutor applied to another court, the Râşcani District Court, for a detention warrant. The charges against the first applicant were the same as before and no new reasons for detention were adduced. On 22 August 2005 that court upheld the application and ordered the continued detention of the applicant. It did not give any reasons for detention except that the prosecutor’s application related to another criminal case.', '13. On 25 July 2005 the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a press release which stated that the first applicant was a member of a criminal gang which was robbing car drivers in Chişinău. The major Moldovan media reported on the event the same day.', '14. On 24 August 2005 the episode concerning the theft from a Volkswagen car was joined to the main criminal proceedings against the applicant.', '15. On 25 August 2005 the applicant appealed against the detention warrant of 22 August 2005.', '16. On 29 August 2005 the criminal case in the applicant’s case was remitted to a court for examination and from that date on the applicant was detained without a detention warrant.', '17. On the same date the Chişinău Court of Appeal discontinued the appeal proceedings against the detention warrant of 22 August 2005 on the ground that the criminal case had been remitted to a court and that therefore no detention warrant was now needed.', 'His habeas corpus applications were dismissed and he remained in detention until 17 November 2005, when a judge ordered his release.', '18. During the first applicant’s detention he was held in the detention facility of the General Police Station (Comisariatul General de Poliţie). According to him, the cells in which he was detained were overcrowded, dark, damp, dirty and hot. There was no natural light, but instead there was a very weak light bulb which was switched on all the time. The ventilation was not working properly and the inmates were allowed to smoke in the cell. The cell was infested with vermin and rats and the inmates were allowed to take showers only once every twenty days with cold water. The cells measured approximately ten or eleven square metres and were occupied by at least eight people at all times. Because of the conditions of his detention the applicant contracted influenza.', '19. On 7 September 2005 Amnesty International organised action in support of the first applicant on its web page, stating, inter alia, the following:', '“Amnesty International is concerned that Gheorghe Straisteanu is being charged on the basis of evidence which has been extracted under torture. Amnesty International has information that a second individual gave evidence after being subjected to torture by investigating officers. However, he reportedly fears that he will be subjected to further ill-treatment if his name is mentioned. The organization is also concerned that Georghe Straisteanu is being detained arbitrarily.', 'On 18 August 2005 the central district court of Chişinău ordered the release of Gheorghe Straisteanu on bail, but police officers immediately re-detained him in the court room and took him back to the temporary detention facility despite the court decision. On 19 August, after his lawyer appealed against this arbitrary detention, the court declared that his detention was illegal. However, police officers again defied the court order and detained him in the court room. On 22 August Gheorghe Straisteanu was sentenced to ten days’ imprisonment by the court of Riscani district in Chişinău. The ten day period was due to expire on 31 August, but the investigating authorities have declared that the investigation is closed and that the case has now been transferred to the court. This effectively prolongs Gheorghe Straisteanu’s detention until the court hearing has been held.', 'Furthermore, Amnesty International is concerned about the conditions in which Gheorghe Straisteanu is being held at the temporary detention facility on Tighina Street. He is currently being held in a cell with ten to 12 other detainees. The only washing facility is a tap and a basin in the cell, and conditions are damp and badly ventilated. Georghe Straisteanu has contracted influenza since he has been in detention and his family report that he has difficulty breathing. He has not been given access to a doctor and he has only been able to receive the medicine that his daughter passed to him when she saw him in court....', 'Please send appeals to arrive as quickly as possible [to the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Ministry of Internal affairs and/or to Moldovan Embassies abroad]...:', '· expressing concern for the health of Gheorghe Straisteanu and asking for assurances that he will be given access to the medical care he requires in conformity with the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners;', '· expressing concern at allegations that some of the evidence that has been used to convict Gheorghe Straisteanu has been extracted from another individual under torture;', '· urging the authorities not to use any evidence extracted under torture in this case and reminding the authorities that as a party to the UN Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment they must ensure that any statement which has been made as result of torture is not used as evidence in criminal proceedings;', '· expressing further concern at allegations that the police did not respect court decisions regarding the illegal detention of Gheorghe Straisteanu and that he was arbitrarily detained by police twice in defiance of court orders;', '· urging an investigation into the allegations of arbitrary detention and asking for his release if the allegations are found to be correct.”', '20. On an unspecified date in October 2005 the President of Moldova, Mr V. Voronin, held a meeting with high ranking officials, among whom was the Prosecutor General, the head of the Anti-Corruption Department, the head of the Cadastral Authority and the prefect of the county where the applicants’ land was situated. During the meeting he expressed great dissatisfaction with the fact that in spite of his clear indications to numerous State bodies, the applicants’ property was still in their possession and had not been returned to the State and a monastery. He gave them a deadline of 17 November 2005 to solve the problem, threatened them with dismissal and left the room, slamming the door.', '21. A video of this event was broadcast by a television channel on 4 April 2006 in a programme entitled ‘The President’s working day’ which reported on the busy schedule of the President. A copy of it was sent to the Court by the applicant.', '22. According to the applicants, after the first applicant’s arrest their family started to experience harassment from law enforcement bodies such as the Department for the Fight against Organised Crime and Corruption, the police and the Prosecutor’s Office, who intimidated and pressured them to give up their property. While in detention the first applicant was approached by police officers, who proposed that he sell the property in exchange for his release. The second applicant was visited on numerous occasions by people claiming to be representatives of the above bodies. They requested her family to leave the property, failing which she would not see her husband again. The third applicant was contacted on numerous occasions by police officers and investigators in charge of her father’s case and ordered to sell the property.', '23. On 25 August 2006 the second applicant lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor General’s Office complaining about the actions of two police officers who had entered her property without any legal basis and ordered her, also in the absence of any legal basis, to take down a billboard at the entrance to the property.', '24. On 4 October 2006 the second applicant received a letter from the Prosecutor General’s Office, in which she was informed that the matters described by her had proved to be partially true; however, there were no sufficient reasons to justify the prosecutor office’s intervention.', '25. On 26 October 2005 the Prosecutor General filed an action with the Economic Court asking for the annulment of the contract of lease for 5.63 hectares of land concluded between the Onesti Local Council and the fourth applicant in May 2001, on the ground that the Local Council had failed to organise an auction.', '26. On an unspecified date the President of the Superior Council of Magistrates and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, Ms V.S., inquired with the Vice President of the Economic Court, Judge M.M., about the above case.', '27. In a letter of 30 October 2005 Judge M.M. wrote to Ms V.S. stating, inter alia, that the case was scheduled to be examined on 8 November 2005 and that she would be dealing with it. It appears that the hearing of 8 November was adjourned.', '28. On 14 November 2005 the fourth applicant was sent a registered letter informing it that the hearing in the case was scheduled for 17 November 2005. It appears that the fourth applicant was no longer at the address to which the summons was sent and therefore did not receive the summons.', '29. On 17 November 2005 Judge M.M. examined the case in the absence of the fourth applicant and upheld the Prosecutor General’s action relying on Article 50 of the old Civil Code, in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract. It found that the Onesti Municipal Council had contravened the law by failing to organise a public auction for the lease of the property.', '30. On an unspecified date in January 2006 the fourth applicant appealed against the above judgment and argued, inter alia, that it had not been summoned and that it did not even know about the prosecutor’s application before 25 November 2005. According to the law in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease, there was no obligation to hold an auction. That obligation referred only to sale of land by local authorities, but not to leases. In any event, the action was time-barred.', '31. On 19 January 2006 a panel of the Supreme Court of Justice presided over by Judge I.M. dismissed the applicant’s appeal and argued, inter alia, that it had been summoned at the address which appeared in the database of the Registration Chamber, and that therefore the applicant had been legally summoned. The court also found that the local council had been under an obligation to organise an auction before renting out the land in question. The Supreme Court did not refer to the applicants’ objection concerning the Statute of Limitations.', '32. On an unspecified date the fourth applicant lodged an action with the Economic Court claiming compensation for the investments it had made in respect of the leased property. It claimed 5,034,304 Moldovan lei (MDL).', '33. On 20 February 2006 the Economic Court refused to examine the application because the fourth applicant had not paid the court fees of three per cent of the amount sought.', '34. In March and April 2006 the fourth applicant paid a part of the court fees and applied again to the court. It argued that it did not have any more money because all its assets and bank accounts had been frozen by the Prosecutor’s Office.', '35. On 20 June 2006 the Economic Court refused again to examine the action on the same grounds. The fourth applicant’s appeal was dismissed.', '36. On 10 November 2005 the Prosecutor General brought an action with the Economic Court of Moldova seeking the annulment of the purchase of the plot of land of 14.63 hectares by the fourth applicant from the Onesti Local Council in May 2001 and of all the subsequent contracts by which the property had been transmitted to the first, second and third applicants. The Prosecutor General argued that the Onesti Local Council had acted ultra vires and had committed numerous irregularities in organising the auction, establishing the price of the property and selling the property.', '37. The applicants opposed all the Prosecutor General’s submissions. Their main arguments were that the Prosecutor General’s action was time-barred, that they had acquired the property in good faith and that the property could not be expropriated without compensation. At the same time the second and third applicants lodged a counter action in which they submitted that if the Prosecutor General’s action was upheld they should be entitled to compensation for the investments they had made in the development of the property in an amount of approximately 216,000 euros (EUR) and EUR 768,000 respectively.', '38. On 11 May 2006 the Economic Court requested the applicants to pay court fees in the amount of three percent of the claimed amounts. The applicants appealed and argued that all their accounts had been seized by the Prosecutor’s Office, that they were unemployed and that they could not pay the court fees. They asked, on the basis of the law on court fees, to be allowed to pay the fees after the adoption of a judgment in the case.', '39. On 29 June 2006 a panel of the Supreme Court of Justice presided by Judge I.M. dismissed the appeal.', '40. On 2 August 2006 the applicants’ counter action was dismissed on the ground of their failure to pay court fees. The applicants appealed against this decision. However, their appeal was dismissed on 21 September 2006 by a panel of the Supreme Court of Justice presided over by Judge I.M.', '41. On 18 December 2006 Judge B.B. from the Economic Court upheld the action lodged by the Prosecutor General, relying on Article 50 of the old Civil Code, in force at the time of the conclusion of the lease contract. Judge B.B. found that the Onesti Local Council had breached the rules concerning the conduct of public auctions, namely that it had failed to observe the rules concerning the advertising of the auction, the composition of the auction commission and the drafting of the auction record. The court did not refer to the applicant’s objection concerning the Statute of Limitations and considered all the prosecutor’s arguments well-founded. It ordered that the parties be put in the same position as they had been prior to the conclusion of the contract.', '42. The applicants appealed and argued, inter alia, that they had been punished for errors of the local authorities which were not imputable to them, that the court was not independent and impartial, that the action was time-barred and that the actions against them had been orchestrated by President Voronin, submitting a copy of the video in which the President was shown instructing State officials to take away their property.', '43. On 15 February 2007 the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the applicants’ appeal. It held that according to the Code of Civil Procedure claims filed in the State’s interest were exempt from the requirement to observe time-limits.', '44. On 3 August 2006 a bailiff came to the applicants’ property, accompanied by the mayor of Tiganesti village, in order to enforce one of the civil judgments concerning the applicants’ property. A quarrel took place between the first applicant and the mayor and two weeks later the latter lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor’s Office, complaining that the first applicant had made death threats against him. In particular, he submitted that during the quarrel the first applicant had said that he would feed him (the mayor) to the fishes.', '45. On 21 August 2006 the applicant was arrested and placed in detention. On 23 August 2006 the Straseni District Court issued an order for him to be detained for ten days. That was extended on numerous occasions and the first applicant’s appeals and habeas corpus requests rejected.', '46. He was detained in the detention centre of the Straseni Police Station until 24 September 2006 and then in Chişinău no. 13 prison. According to the applicant, the conditions of detention in both detention facilities amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.', '47. The applicant’s detention under the new charges continued until 28 November 2006, when he was placed under house arrest.', '48. On an unspecified date in 2007 the first applicant initiated civil proceedings against the Government claiming compensation for poor conditions of detention in 2005 and in 2006 and for detention contrary to Article 5 of the Convention. He relied, inter alia, on the Court’s findings in respect of conditions of detention in Ostrovar v. Moldova (no. 35207/03, 13 September 2005), Sarban v. Moldova (no. 3456/05, 4 October 2005), and Holomiov v. Moldova (no. 30649/05, 7 November 2006) in which the applicants had been detained in the same detention facilities.', '49. On 27 June 2007 the Centru District Court dismissed the applicant’s action, upholding the Government’s position and finding that the conditions of detention on both occasions were acceptable. The court accepted several of the applicant’s submissions, such as that his cell window did not have glass for several days, that a person with scabies was placed in his cell on one occasion, that there was no linen or mattresses in the cell, and that there was no sewerage in one of the detention facilities. Nevertheless, it considered that these shortcomings were not sufficient for the application to be upheld, because the applicant did not have to share a bed with the ill prisoner, the latter had been receiving treatment for five days and at the time of his placement in the cell he was no longer contagious. Moreover, the window cell was repaired after only four days and in any event the temperatures at the end of September were usually moderate. In addition, prisoners were allowed to bring their own mattresses and linen. In so far as the complaint under Article 5 was concerned, the court found that there were no civil remedies against the alleged breaches under Moldovan law. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal on 3 October 2007 and by the Supreme Court of Justice on 7 May 2008.', '50. On 18 May 2008 the applicant lodged another action with the Rascani District Court, again claiming compensation for his allegedly unlawful detention between August and November 2005. It appears that his action has not yet been determined.', '51. The relevant findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT, unofficial translation) read as follows:', 'B. Establishments visited', '... - EDP of Chişinău Police Inspectorate (Follow-up visit)', '... b. remand centres (EDPs)', '53. In its report on the 1998 visit (paragraph 56), the CPT was forced to conclude that material conditions of detention in the remand centres (EDPs) visited amounted in many respects to inhuman and degrading treatment and, in addition, constituted a significant risk to the health of persons detained. While recognising that it was not possible to transform the current situation in these establishments overnight, the CPT recommended a certain number of immediate palliative measures to guarantee basic conditions of detention that respect the fundamental requirements of life and human dignity.', '54. Unfortunately, during the 2001 visit, the delegation found barely any traces of such palliative measures, in fact quite the opposite. ...', '55. One can only regret that in their efforts to renovate these premises - which under the current economic circumstances deserve praise - the Moldovan authorities have paid no attention to the CPT recommendations. In fact, this state of affairs strongly suggests that, setting aside economic considerations, the issue of material conditions of detention in police establishments remains influenced by an outdated concept of deprivation of liberty.', '56. Turning to the other EDPs visited across Moldova, with very few exceptions the delegation observed the same types of disastrous and insalubrious material conditions. A detailed description is superfluous, since it has all been highlighted already in paragraphs 53 to 55 of the report on the 1998 visit.', 'In Chişinău EDP, these conditions were exacerbated by serious overcrowding. At the time of the visit, there were 248 prisoners for 80 places, requiring nine persons to cram into a cell measuring 7 m² and between eleven and fourteen persons into cells of 10 to 15 m².', '57. The delegation also received numerous complaints about the quantity of food in the EDPs visited. This normally comprised tea without sugar and a slice of bread in the morning, cereal porridge at lunch time and hot water in the evening. In some establishments, food was served just once a day and was confined to a piece of bread and soup. ...', '...Concerning the issue of access to toilets in due time, the CPT wishes to stress that it considers that the practice according to which detainees comply with the needs of nature by using receptacles in the presence of one or several other persons, in a confined space such as the EDP cells which also serve as their living space, is in itself degrading, not only for the individual concerned but also for those forced to witness what is happening. Consequently, the CPT recommends that clear instructions be given to surveillance staff that detainees placed in cells without toilets should – if they so request – be taken out of their cell without delay during the day in order to go to the toilet.', '59. The CPT also recommends that steps be taken to:', '- reduce the overcrowding in Chişinău EDP as rapidly as possible and to comply with the official occupancy level;', '- supply persons in custody with clean mattresses and clean blankets;', '- authorise persons detained in all EDPs to receive packages from the outset of their custody and to have access to reading matter.', 'In the light of certain observations made, particularly in the EDP of the Chişinău Police Inspectorate, the CPT also reiterates its recommendation concerning strict compliance, in all circumstances, with the rules governing separation of adults and minors.”', '4. Conditions of detention.', 'a. Institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs', '41. Since 1998, when it first visited Moldova, the CPT has serious concern for the conditions of detention in the institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.', 'The CPT notes that 32 out of 39 EDPs have been subjected to “cosmetic” repair and that 30 have been equipped with places for daily walks. Nevertheless, the 2004 visit did not allow lifting the concern of the Committee. In fact, most recommendations made have not been implemented.', '42. Whether one refers to the police stations or EDPs visited, the material conditions are invariably subject to the same criticism as in the past. Detention cells had no access to daylight or a very limited such access; artificial light – with rare exceptions – was mediocre. Nowhere did the persons obliged to pass the night in detention receive mattresses and blankets, even those detained for prolonged periods. Those who had such items could only have obtained them from their relatives...', '45. As for food ... in the EDPs the arrangements made were the same as those criticised in 2001 (see paragraph 57 of the report on that visit): generally three modest distributions of food per day including tea and a slice of bread in the morning, a bowl of cereals at noon and tea or warm water in the evening. Sometimes there was only one distribution of food per day. Fortunately, the rules for receiving parcels have been relaxed, which allowed detainees with relatives outside to slightly improve these meagre daily portions.', '47. In sum, the material conditions remain problematic in the police stations; they remain disastrous in EDPs, continuing in many aspects to amount, for the detainees, to inhuman and degrading treatment.”', 'II. Institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs', 'In so far as the conditions of detention in the police establishments are concerned, it appears that this is the field in which the least progress has been achieved. It is not necessary to enumerate here in detail all the shortcomings observed by the delegation, which are more or less the same as those observed during past visits (and of which the Ministry of Internal Affairs is perfectly aware). ... Numerous persons are still detained overnight in police establishments, in cells which should not be used to detain persons for more than a few hours. It is high time to remedy these problems, in particular by placing accused persons under the supervision of institutions of the Ministry of Justice and building new prisons corresponding to CPT standards and to the norms laid down by the Moldovan legislation.”', '52. Article 25 of the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, in so far as relevant, states as follows:', '“(4) Detention takes place on the basis of a warrant issued by a judge for a maximum period of thirty days. The lawfulness of the warrant may be challenged, in accordance with the law, before a hierarchically superior court. The period of detention may be extended only by a court, in accordance with the law, to a maximum of twelve months.”', '53. The relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:', '(2) The application for a detention warrant... shall be examined without delay by the investigating judge... at the place of the conduct of the criminal investigation, at the place of arrest or at the place of residence of the detainee’s representative.', '(5) A repeated application for a detention warrant... in respect of the same person and in the same proceedings, after the dismissal of a previous application, shall be possible only if new reasons for detention have appeared.', '54. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code, in force at the relevant time, provide:', 'The general limitation period for protection through a court action of the rights of a [natural] person is three years; it is one year for lawsuits between State organisations, collective farms and any other social organisations.', 'The competent court ... shall apply the limitation period whether or not the parties request such application.', 'Expiry of the limitation period prior to initiation of court proceedings constitutes a ground for rejecting the claim.', 'If the competent court ... finds that the action has not commenced within the limitation period for well-founded reasons, the right in question shall be protected.', 'The limitation period does not apply:', '...', '(2) to claims by State organisations regarding restitution of State property found in the unlawful possession of ... other organisations ... and of citizens;”.', '55. The relevant provisions of the new Civil Code, in force after 12 June 2003, read as follows:', '“(1) The civil law does not have a retroactive character. It cannot modify or suppress the conditions in which a prior legal situation was constituted or the conditions in which such a legal situation was extinguished. The new law cannot alter or abolish the already created effects of a legal situation which has extinguished or in the process of execution.”', '56. In a judgment of 20 April 2005 (case nr. 2ra-563/05) the Supreme Court of Justice dismissed the plaintiff’s contentions based on the provisions of the new Civil Code on the ground that the facts of the case related to a period before the entry into force of the new Civil Code and that, therefore, the provisions of the old Civil Code were applicable.']","['13', '3', '5', '6', 'P1']",['P1-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant is a Cypriot citizen born in 1936. He is a retired civil servant. On 1 May 1967 he rented from the Cypriot State a house in which he has been living ever since with his wife and four children. The tenancy agreement had many of the features of a typical contract for the lease of property with provisions on the payment of rent by the applicant, the use and maintenance of the property, the giving of notice and a termination date. The agreement provided that the tenancy would come to an end in the event of the applicant being transferred to a district other than the one in which the property was situated.', '7. On 3 December 1986 the Ministry of Finance informed the applicant that the permission by virtue of which he occupied the premises was revoked and that he had to surrender the property by 30 April 1987. He failed to do so and on 3 June 1987 the Attorney-General notified him that if he did not vacate the house before 31 July 1987 legal action would be taken against him.', '8. On 3 July 1987 the applicant replied that he had been living together with his family in the house for twenty years. He had been obliged to spend significant sums of money on the maintenance and improvement of the house since the competent public authorities had shown no interest in its upkeep. He claimed that he was a “statutory tenant” within the meaning of the Rent Control Law 1983 (Law no. 23/1983 – see paragraphs 14 and 15 below) and stated that he would continue to occupy the premises as long as he was protected by law.', '9. On 9 March 1989, replying to a second letter from the Attorney-General dated 5 January 1989, the applicant reiterated his earlier position.', '10. On 3 February 1990 the government of Cyprus instituted proceedings against the applicant before the District Court of Nicosia to have him evicted. The government submitted, inter alia, that the applicant did not occupy the house under a tenancy agreement within the meaning of the Rent Control Law 1983, but that the premises had been allocated to him by administrative order because of his position in the civil service.', '11. On 5 February 1992 the District Court of Nicosia gave judgment against the applicant. The court did not pronounce on the issue of the title under which the applicant occupied the premises. The court’s interpretation of the Rent Control Law 1983 led it to conclude that its protection did not extend to the applicant since it only bound private owners of property and not the Cypriot State. A person who rented premises owned by the State could not therefore be considered a “statutory tenant” protected by that Law.', 'The applicant was ordered to vacate the premises before 30 June 1992.', '12. The applicant appealed against the judgment to the Supreme Court relying on Article 14 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1. At the hearing before the Supreme Court the applicant relied essentially on the following argument: his rights as a tenant were “property rights” within the meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and he was the victim of discrimination in the enjoyment of these rights because the Rent Control Law 1983, as interpreted by the District Court of Nicosia, gave no protection to tenants of the State whereas the same Law protected the State as a “statutory tenant” when it rented premises owned by a private individual. The applicant also submitted that he was the victim of a further act of discrimination in that he enjoyed less protection under the relevant Law than tenants of private persons.', '13. On 22 May 1995 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal, considering that he could not claim any property rights under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 as a tenant. The court also found that, in any event, the notion of equality did not require that a person who enjoyed the protection of the Rent Control Law 1983 as a tenant should be automatically required to grant the same protection to his or her tenants if that person happened to own property. Finally, the court considered, in an obiter dictum, that even if the case concerned the different treatment reserved by the law to property rented out by private owners and to property rented out by the State, there would be no violation of the Constitution or the Convention because “it would be reasonable to consider that it is not necessary to grant protection [to tenants] vis-à-vis the [State] which [is] not in the same position as a private owner and [is] not expected to administer the property of the State according to criteria similar to those guiding a private owner”.', 'Further to this decision, the applicant has been threatened with imminent eviction.', '14. According to section 3(1), the Rent Control Law 1983 applies only to dwellings and shops in areas designated “regulated areas”, which are defined in section 2 as every area which was declared as such under the previous rent control legislation and includes every other area so declared by order of the Council of Ministers. Section 3(1), which has been unaffected by subsequent amendments to the 1983 Law, sets out the circumstances under which an order may be made.', 'Section 3(1) provides as follows:', '“Whenever it is considered by the Council of Ministers to be necessary or expedient for the purpose of securing the availability of dwellings and shops for reasonable rents and the security of possession thereof, or whenever the public interest otherwise so requires, the Council of Ministers may by Order published in the Official Gazette of the Republic declare any area in Cyprus as a regulated area, and thereupon the provisions of this Law shall apply to all dwellings or shops within such area.”', '“Οσάκις το Υπουργικόν Συμβούλιον κρίνη ότι είναι αναγκαίον ή σκόπιμον προς τον σκοπόν της εξασφαλίσεως της διαθεσιμότητος των κατοικιών ή καταστημάτων αντί λογικών ενοικίων και της ασφαλείας της κατοχής τούτων, ή οσάκις το δημόσιον συμφέρον ούτως άλλως απαιτή, το Υπουργικόν Συμβούλιον δύναται δια διατάγματος δημοσιευομένου εις την επίσημον εφημερίδα της Δημοκρατίας να κηρύξη οιανδήποτε περιοχήν εν Κύπρω ως ελεγχομένην περιοχήν, τούτου δε γενομένου θα ισχύουν αι διατάξεις του παρόντος Νόμου δι’ οιασδήποτε κατοικίας ή καταστήματα ενός της τοιαύτης περιοχής.”', '15. According to section 11 tenants of dwellings situated within a “regulated area” who, upon the expiry or termination of the first term of their tenancy agreement, remain in occupation of the dwelling (“statutory tenants”) cannot be evicted save in certain specified circumstances set out in the Rent Control Law. These circumstances include the non-payment of rent, unauthorised use of the property and where the dwelling is reasonably required by the landlord for occupation by him or his wife, children or other dependants.', '16. Under Article 54(e) of the Constitution, it is for the Council of Ministers to supervise and dispose of property belonging to the Republic of Cyprus. This power of supervision and disposal must be exercised in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and the law.']","['14', '8']",[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1946 and lives in Khabarovsk.', '6. On 19 May 1997 the applicant lent the Khabarovsk Office of the Trade Counsellor of the Embassy of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“the DPRK Trade Counsellor”) 1,500 United States dollars (USD). The money was to be repaid by 29 May 1997. A receipt of 19 May 1997 on the letterhead of the DPRK Trade Counsellor signed by Mr Chkhe Gym Cher reads as follows:', '“[This] receipt is given to the President of the private company Lord BV Oleynikov to the effect that the Khabarovsk Office of the Trade Counsellor of the DPRK Embassy has borrowed 1,500 (one thousand five hundred) US dollars converted into roubles.', 'We undertake to repay the debt not later than 29 May [and] we pledge the Toyota Camry car, registration plate no. KhBB 1799 (ХББ 1799), engine no. 0073653, chassis no. 0062459, [together] with a complete set of documents for the car. In case of a failure to repay [the debt] within the indicated term, we shall pay 1% for each day of the delay.”', '7. After the DPRK Trade Counsellor failed to repay the debt, in 19992000 the applicant sent several letters of claim which went unanswered. The applicant’s counsel also sent a letter of claim to the DPRK Trade Counsellor on 13 April 2001 and to the DPRK Embassy on 27 April 2001, which also went unanswered.', '8. On 11 September 2001 the applicant’s counsel wrote to the Russian Ministry of External Affairs asking for assistance in settling the matter.', '9. On 29 January 2002 the Ministry of External Affairs replied to the applicant that the DPRK Trade Counsellor was a constituent unit of the DPRK Embassy and, therefore, an organ of the DPRK which acted on its behalf. The DPRK Trade Counsellor thus enjoyed immunity from suit and immunity from attachment or execution in accordance with Article 435 of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure. The Ministry of External Affairs advised the applicant that, should he decide to lodge a claim with a court, he would have to obtain consent to the examination of the case from a competent North Korean authority.', '10. On 8 July 2002 the applicant wrote to the DPRK Embassy and asked for its consent to the examination of his claim against the DPRK Trade Counsellor by the domestic courts. The letter was received by the Embassy on 19 July 2002. It appears that the applicant received no reply.', '11. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged a claim with the Supreme Court of Russia. On 21 February 2003 the Supreme Court returned the claim without examination on the grounds that it should have been lodged before a district court.', '12. On 9 February 2004 the applicant lodged a claim against the DPRK with the Khabarovsk Industrialniy District Court. He sought repayment of the debt with interest. He claimed, furthermore, that Russia was responsible for the actions of foreign diplomats within its territory.', '13. On 12 February 2004 the District Court returned the claim without consideration on the grounds that under Article 401 of the 2002 Code of Civil Procedure a claim against a foreign State could only be brought upon the consent of its competent authorities. The applicant appealed.', '14. On 16 March 2004 the Khabarovsk Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal. The court held:', '“[The DPRK Trade Counsellor] is a subdivision of the trade representation of the DPRK in Russia the legal status of which is governed by the Annex to the Treaty on Trade and Navigation between the USSR and the DPRK of 22 June 1960. According to Article 2 of the Annex, the trade representation is an organ of the State (the DPRK) acting in its name. Therefore, taking into account the equality of States as a principle of international law, the trade representation as an organ of public authority of a sovereign State is entitled to judicial immunity as well as to immunity from measures of securing a suit and execution. The said immunities are based on State sovereignty, which does not allow a State to be subject to coercive measures of any kind. The principle of judicial immunity of a foreign state is enshrined in Article 401 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, according to which lodging a claim in a court of the Russian Federation against a foreign State, the involvement thereof in court proceedings in the capacity of a defendant or of a third party, the seizure of property belonging to a foreign State and situated within the territory of the Russian Federation, taking other measures for securing of a suit, and levying execution upon such property by means of enforcement of judicial decisions, are allowed only upon the consent of the competent agencies of the State in question, unless otherwise provided by an international treaty of the Russian Federation or by a federal law.', 'Therefore, [a] person may only lodge a claim against a foreign State upon the prior consent of the State. If [a] claim against a foreign State is not supported by ... documents confirming its consent to the examination of the case in court, [court] proceedings will not be instituted. As [Mr] V.B. Oleynikov failed to furnish [documents confirming] the consent of the [DPRK] to the examination of the dispute in court together with [his claim], the judge could not accept the claim because of the bar to [lodging such a claim before] a court. As the said bar is [not absolute], the judge returned the claim to [Mr] V.B. Oleynikov on valid grounds, having indicated how the circumstances that prevented the institution of the proceedings could be remedied.', '[Mr] V.B. Oleynikov’s arguments that the DPRK Embassy does not wish to reply to his and his counsel’s requests [and] is evading payment of the debt, on the basis of which [he submits that] it is for the court or the judge to request the DPRK’s consent to the examination of the case, may not be considered as grounds for setting aside the [decision of the District Court], as they contravene the provisions of the international treaty between the USSR and the DPRK of 22 June 1960 and Article 401 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure.”', '15. Article 127 of the Civil Code refers to the Law on State Immunity, which has not been adopted to date. The question is thus resolved by the courts on the basis of the relevant Codes of Procedure, with reference to the provisions of various bilateral and multilateral treaties.', '16. Article 435 of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure in force until 1 February 2003, based on absolute immunity, provided, in so far as relevant:', '“[F]iling a suit against a foreign State, securing of a suit or levying execution upon the property of a foreign State situated in the USSR may only be allowed upon the consent of the competent agencies of the respective State.”', '17. Article 401 § 1 of the 2002 Code of Civil Procedure in force from 1 February 2003, reinstated absolute immunity of a foreign State. It reads as follows:', '“Filing a suit against a foreign State in a court of the Russian Federation, the involvement thereof in court proceedings in the capacity of a defendant or of a third party, the seizure of property belonging to a foreign State and situated within the territory of the Russian Federation, taking other property measures for securing of a suit, and levying execution upon such property by means of enforcement of judicial decisions, shall only be allowed upon the consent of the competent agencies of the State in question, unless otherwise provided by an international treaty of the Russian Federation or by a federal law.”', '18. Article 213(1) of the 1995 Code of Commercial Procedure in force until 1 September 2002, provided for absolute immunity:', '“Filing a suit in a commercial court against a foreign State, the involvement thereof in court proceedings in the capacity of a third party, the seizure of property belonging to a foreign State and situated within the territory of the Russian Federation, and taking against it other measures for securing a suit, and levying execution upon such property by means of enforcement of a decision of a commercial court, shall only be permitted with the consent of the competent agencies of the respective State, unless otherwise provided by federal laws or by international treaties of the Russian Federation.”', '19. Article 251 of the 2002 Code of Commercial Procedure in force from 1 September 2002, endorsed restrictive immunity. It reads as follows:', '“1. A foreign State, acting in the capacity of a bearer of authority [emphasis added], shall enjoy judicial immunity with respect to a suit filed against it with a commercial court in the Russian Federation, its involvement in court proceedings in the capacity of a third party, the seizure of property belonging to a foreign State and situated on the territory of the Russian Federation, and the taking against it by the court of other measures of securing a suit and property interests. Levying execution upon such property by means of enforcement of a judicial act of a commercial court shall only be permitted with the consent of competent agencies of the respective State, unless otherwise provided by international treaty of the Russian Federation or by a federal law.', '2. The judicial immunity of international organisations shall be determined by international treaty of the Russian Federation and by federal law.', '3. A waiver of judicial immunity shall be effected according to the procedure provided for by the law of the foreign State or by the rules of the international organisation. In this instance, the commercial court shall consider the case according to the procedure established by the present Code”.', '20. Article 15 of the Constitution provides, insofar as relevant:', '“4. The generally recognised principles and norms of international law and the international treaties of the Russian Federation shall be an integral part of its legal system. If an international treaty of the Russian Federation establishes other rules than those provided for by the law, the rules of the international treaty shall apply.”', '21. Article 435 of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure was examined by the Constitutional Court in its ruling of 2 November 2000. The claimant, Ms Kalashnikova, a former employee of the information service of the United States Embassy in Russia, was dismissed under Article 33 section 1(2) of the 1971 Labour Code of the Russian Federation (non-conformity of the employee with the post held due to insufficient qualification or state of health, preventing further fulfilment of the work). Following her dismissal she instituted court proceedings seeking reinstatement and damages. In a ruling of 27 March 2000 the court of first instance rejected the claim, having applied Article 435(1) of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure, as the claimant had failed to present any evidence of the United States’ consent to submit to the jurisdiction of the court. The Moscow City Court upheld the ruling on appeal. In her complaint to the Constitutional Court, Ms Kalashnikova argued that Article 435 of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure had violated her constitutional right to judicial defence.', '22. The Constitutional Court noted that the right to engage in individual labour disputes was provided in Article 37(4) of the Constitution and the procedure for the examination of claims for reinstatement was governed by Chapter XIV of the Labour Code, while application of the provisions of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure was of subsidiary nature, intended to fill in gaps in the procedural rules of labour legislation. It further observed that the purpose of Article 435(1) was to ensure State immunity in accordance with generally recognised principles and norms of international law and international treaties of the Russian Federation.', '23. The Constitutional Court found that “when considering the case of [Ms] Kalashnikova, the courts of general jurisdiction did not pay attention to the fact that the employer – the Embassy of the United States as an agency of the accrediting State – applied the legislation of the Russian Federation ..., and without requesting necessary documents refrained from investigating the issue of whether such an application could be regarded as the United States’ waiver of jurisdictional immunity in this particular case”. On these grounds it reached the conclusion that: “the formalistic application of Article 435(1) of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure by the courts of general jurisdiction, which refused to accept the claim of [Ms] Kalashnikova on the basis of this article, led to an inadmissible limitation of the claimant’s rights with regard to an individual labour dispute ... and thus to a violation of the right to judicial defence provided for in Article 46(1) of the Constitution of the Russian Federation”.', '24. However, the Constitutional Court did not examine Ms Kalashnikova’s complaint on the merits. It found that her rights had not been violated by Article 435(1) of the 1964 Code of Civil Procedure, but rather by its application by the domestic courts, which fell outside its competence. At the same time, the Constitutional Court stated that the Article was to be applied henceforth “taking into account the legal position set forth by the Constitutional Court in the present ruling”.', '25. The application of the State immunity rule in commercial proceedings was addressed by the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court in an Information Letter of 18 January 2001. By way of information letters the Supreme Commercial Court provides lower courts with instructions on the interpretation and application of domestic law.', '26. The Information Letter firstly referred to a case where a Russian construction company had filed a claim against a foreign embassy for recovery of a debt arising under a contract concerning the construction of a hotel attached to the embassy in Moscow. The commercial court had granted the claim. However, the Supreme Commercial Court had set aside the decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. The commercial court was instructed to review the issue of State immunity, taking into account that construction of the hotel was for the public, and non-commercial, activity of the foreign State in Russia, and was therefore instructed to consider termination of the proceedings under Article 213(1) of the 1995 Code of Commercial Procedure.', '27. On the basis of its findings in the above case, the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court made the following general recommendation: “A commercial court shall terminate proceedings in a case concerning an investment dispute, the defendant in which is a foreign State acting in the capacity of a sovereign”.', '28. The second case referred to in the Information Letter also concerned a foreign embassy and a Russian construction company involved in a dispute arising out of a construction contract. However, in this case the proceedings had been initiated by the embassy and the construction company had filed a counter-claim. The Court of Cassation had held that bringing a claim constituted an implied waiver of immunity and therefore that the embassy of a foreign State was not immune with respect to a counter-claim.', '29. The recommendation of the Presidium of the Supreme Commercial Court based on the above case reads as follows: “A commercial court shall accept a claim in a commercial dispute, the defendant in which is a person entitled to international immunity”.', '30. State immunity was touched upon in the Opinion on the Draft Federal Law on the Administration of State Foreign Financial Assets Inherited by the Russian Federation, sent by the President of the Russian Federation, B N Yeltsin, to the Chairman of the State Duma, G N Seleznev, and published in the Rossiyskaya Gazeta on 13 May 1998 (“the Opinion”).', '31. With regard to certain provisions relating to State immunity which were included in the Draft Federal Law under discussion, the Opinion states that “foreign State property enjoys functional immunity”. The statement is further detailed as follows:', '“If a State uses its ownership for the purposes of ensuring its sovereignty or fulfilling State political functions, that is, as a subject of international law, for example, for the maintenance of diplomatic and consular representations, this property always enjoys immunity against the jurisdiction of the State of its location. However, if the State (through specially empowered agencies) takes part in property turnover or in commercial activity, then it is regarded as a foreign private person and its State ownership does not enjoy immunity. The turnover of such property is regulated by norms of international private law and by legislation of the country where the property is located, the foreign State with respect to the country of location of the property acting on the basis of equal rights with other participants of these relations – with foreign juridical and natural persons. This approach has been consolidated in the European Convention on State Immunity, 16 May 1972, which, in accordance with generally recognised international practice, the Russian Federation may regard as a codified digest of customary norms of international law.”', '32. State immunity was also referred to in letter no. Pr-795 of 23 June 1999 sent by the President of the Russian Federation, B N Yeltsin, to the Chairman of the Federal Assembly, E S Stroev (“the Letter”). The Letter substantiates the rejection by the President of the Federal Law on the Administration of the Russian Federation’s Property Located Abroad. Paragraph 6 of the Letter states:', '“The Civil Code of the Russian Federation (Article 127) provides that the specific responsibilities of the Russian Federation and the subjects of the Russian Federation in relations regulated by civil legislation with the participation of foreign juridical persons, citizens and States are to be determined by the Law on the Immunity of the State and of its Property.', 'Therefore, it is hardly legitimate to include Article 8 on the immunity of the Russian Federation’s property located abroad in the Federal Law. Moreover, it should be noted that the concept of absolute immunity of a foreign State and of its property was reflected in Article 8 of the Federal Law.', 'This concept does not find recognition in either the legislation of the Russian Federation (Article 213, 1995 Code of Commercial Procedure of the Russian Federation, Articles 22 and 23, Federal Law on Production Sharing Agreements), or in international treaties of the Russian Federation (treaties on the encouragement and mutual protection of capital investments).', 'It should be taken into consideration that in modern circumstances absolute immunity may not be realised in practice and its adoption in the legislation of the Russian Federation will only impede the development of civil law relations with State participation.”', '33. Following the establishment of the foreign trade monopoly in the Soviet Union by the Decree on Nationalisation of Foreign Trade of 22 April 1918, the State, through the USSR Ministry of Foreign Trade and its predecessors, carried out and controlled foreign trade. It established the types of entities entitled to participate in foreign trade and set limits on their participation, such as the nature of transactions they could enter into, the goods they could trade and import and export volumes. Trade with foreign States was to be carried out by Trade Representations, which constituted agencies of the Ministry of Foreign Trade.', '34. In the exercise of the foreign trade monopoly, the Soviet Union entered into numerous treaties on the legal status of Soviet Trade Representations in other States. Treaties concluded by the USSR with socialist States provided for the mutual establishment of Trade Representations, such as the following treaty concluded with the DPRK.', '35. According to Article 13 of the Treaty on Trade and Navigation between the USSR and the DPRK of 22 June 1960, either party can open a trade representation in the capital of the other party. The legal status of the representation is governed by the Annex to the Treaty.', '36. The Annex on the Legal Status of the USSR Trade Representation in the DPRK and the DPRK Trade Representation in the USSR contains four Articles. Article 1 provides that the Trade Representations would contribute to the development of trade between the two States. According to Article 2 the Trade Representation is a constituent part of the Embassy of its State. The trade representative and his/her deputies enjoy full diplomatic immunities and the premises of the Trade Representation enjoy extraterritoriality. The Trade Representation may open branches upon the parties’ agreement.', '37. The Annex further provides:', '“The Trade Representation acts on behalf of its Government. The Government is only responsible for the foreign trade transactions concluded or guaranteed by the Trade Representation in the State of sojourn and signed by a competent person.', 'Names of persons competent to perform legal acts on behalf of the Trade Representation, as well as the scope of the competence of each such person, shall be published in an official organ of the State of sojourn.”', '“The Trade Representation shall enjoy all immunities belonging to a sovereign State which relate to foreign trade, with the following exceptions agreed upon by the parties:', '(a) disputes arising out of foreign trade transactions concluded or guaranteed by the Trade Representation in accordance with Article 3 within the territory of the State of sojourn, in the absence of an arbitration agreement or an agreement [to submit to] a different jurisdiction, are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of that State. At the same time, the courts cannot apply preliminary attachment measures;', '(b) enforcement of final judgments that have entered into force against the Trade Representation with regard to such disputes is only allowed in respect of goods and claims outstanding to the credit of the Trade Representation.”', '38. The Treaty and the Annex remain in force for the Russian Federation.', '39. The relevant provisions of the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity (“the Basle Convention”) read as follows:', '“1. Subject to the provisions of Article 5, a Contracting State cannot claim immunity from the jurisdiction of the courts of another Contracting State if the proceedings relate to an obligation of the State, which, by virtue of a contract, falls to be discharged in the territory of the State of the forum.', '2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply:', 'in the case of a contract concluded between States;', 'if the parties to the contract have otherwise agreed in writing;', 'if the State is party to a contract concluded on its territory and the obligation of the State is governed by its administrative law.”', '40. Russia is not a party to the Basle Convention.', '41. In 1979 the United Nations International Law Commission was given the task of codifying and gradually developing international law in matters of jurisdictional immunities of States and their property. In 1991 the International Law Commission adopted the Draft Articles on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property based on restrictive immunity, that is a distinction between acts of sovereign authority (acte jure imperii) and acts of a private law nature (acte jure gestionis). The Draft Articles that were used as the basis for the text adopted in 2004 dated back to 1991. The relevant part of the text then read as follows:', '“1. ...', '(c) “commercial transaction” means:', '(i) any commercial contract or transaction for the sale of goods or supply of services;', '(ii) any contract for a loan or other transaction of a financial nature, including any obligation of guarantee or of indemnity in respect of any such loan or transaction;', '(iii) any other contract or transaction of a commercial, industrial, trading or professional nature, but not including a contract of employment of persons.', '2. In determining whether a contract or transaction is a “commercial transaction” under paragraph 1 (c), reference should be made primarily to the nature of the contract or transaction, but its purpose should also be taken into account if, in the practice of the State which is a party to it, that purpose is relevant to determining the non-commercial character of the contract or transaction. ...”', '“1. If a State engages in a commercial transaction with a foreign natural or juridical person and, by virtue of the applicable rules of private international law, differences relating to the commercial transaction fall within the jurisdiction of a court of another State, the State cannot invoke immunity from that jurisdiction in a proceeding arising out of that commercial transaction.', '2. Paragraph 1 does not apply:', '(a) in the case of a commercial transaction between States; or', '(b) if the parties to the commercial transaction have expressly agreed otherwise.', '3. The immunity from jurisdiction enjoyed by a State shall not be affected with regard to a proceeding which relates to a commercial transaction engaged in by a State enterprise or other entity established by the State which has an independent legal personality and is capable of:', '(a) suing or being sued; and', '(b) acquiring, owning or possessing and disposing of property, including property which the State has authorized it to operate or manage.”', '42. In December 2004 the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property. It was opened for signature on 17 January 2005. The final versions of Article 2 § 1(c) and 2 and Article 10, as set out in the Convention, read as follows:', '“1. ...', '(c) “commercial transaction” means:', '(i) any commercial contract or transaction for the sale of goods or supply of services;', '(ii) any contract for a loan or other transaction of a financial nature, including any obligation of guarantee or of indemnity in respect of any such loan or transaction;', '(iii) any other contract or transaction of a commercial, industrial, trading or professional nature, but not including a contract of employment of persons.', '2. In determining whether a contract or transaction is a “commercial transaction” under paragraph 1 (c), reference should be made primarily to the nature of the contract or transaction, but its purpose should also be taken into account if the parties to the contract or transaction have so agreed, or if, in the practice of the State of the forum, that purpose is relevant to determining the non-commercial character of the contract or transaction.”', '“1. If a State engages in a commercial transaction with a foreign natural or juridical person and, by virtue of the applicable rules of private international law, differences relating to the commercial transaction fall within the jurisdiction of a court of another State, the State cannot invoke immunity from that jurisdiction in a proceeding arising out of that commercial transaction.', '2.

The applicants were born in 1983, 1946 and 1936 respectively. The first and the third applicant live in Diyarbakır and the second applicant resides in Manisa. The application concerns the wounding of the first applicant, who was eleven years old at the time, and the death of the second and third applicants' sons, Çetin Alican and İlhami Alican, who were fourteen and thirteen years old respectively, as a result of the explosion of an RPG-7 (anti-tank grenade launcher) grenade outside the applicants' village, Kıyıdüzü, in Van."", '5. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties and as they appear from the documents submitted by them, may be summarised as follows.', '6. On 22 April 1994 Kamuran Alican, Çetin Alican and Ilhami Alican took their animals out to graze. When the animals returned to the village without the children, the villagers launched a search party and informed the military nearby; the Van 6th Armoured Brigade Barracks. A search was also unsuccessfully conducted within the military confines. The next day, the dead bodies of Çetin Alican and Ilhami Alican were found in a wheat field between the army barracks and Nemrut Mountain. The first applicant, who had injuries to his eyes and legs, was found a few hundred metres away. He was immediately taken to Tatvan State Hospital for treatment. As a result of the explosion, the first applicant suffered partial loss of the sight of one eye and the total loss of sight in the other.', ""7. According to the first applicant's testimony, given to a prosecutor on 10 June 1994, the children were grazing their sheep in the field when they found an object with an iron head which looked like a bullet. The first applicant left the other two children to find water while they were trying to hit the iron head with pieces of metal. At that moment the bullet exploded."", '8. On 23 April 1994 the Tatvan public prosecutor instigated an investigation into the incident. The prosecutor noted that there were numerous trenches around the area for tank and gun practice. The remains of the ammunition at the scene were secured. Reports and sketches were drafted and a postmortem examination was conducted on the deceased. The cause of death was attributed to hemorrhagic shock and the doctor deemed it unnecessary to conduct a classic autopsy of the deceased.', ""9. On 4 May 1994 the Tatvan public prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the incident and forwarded his decision to the military prosecutor's office at the Van 21st gendarmerie border brigade commandership (“the military prosecutor”)."", '10. The military prosecutor instigated an investigation into the incident. In particular, he requested the official records regarding the use of grenade launchers by the military during training, and medical reports regarding the health of the first applicant.', '11. In the course of the investigation evidence was gathered from the first applicant, the third applicant, the head of the village, Mr M. M. Alican, a fellow villager, the soldiers on patrol duty on the day of the incident and a higher-ranking military official.', '12. On 6 May 1997 the military prosecutor gave a decision that there was no need to initiate criminal proceedings on the ground that there was no fault or negligence attributable to anyone except Kamuran Alican, Çetin Alican and İlhami Alican. In his decision, the prosecutor noted that the children, while they were grazing their animals, had collected, near the trenches, a grenade from an RPG-7 grenade launcher and parts of a rocket, and that the incident had occurred while they were trying to explode them. He further noted that the incident had occurred 2,200 metres away from the Armoured Brigade Barracks where three fields met and that it was not a military area. In this connection, the prosecutor held that, according to the official military records, no unexploded grenades or rockets had been found after military training exercises, that the origin of these artefacts could not be established and that, even assuming that they were launched from the military training field, their range made it impossible for them to have landed 2,200 metres away from it.', ""13. The decision of the military prosecutor was served on 29 May 1997 on Ahmet Alican, on 7 July 1997 on Kamuran Alican and on 19 July 1997 on Ramazan Alican. The applicants did not object to the military prosecutor's decision."", ""14. On 20 February and 20 May 1995 the applicants made applications to the Ministry of the Interior for compensation on account of the injury sustained by the first applicant and the death of the other applicants' sons. They received no positive reply."", '15. On 4 May 1995 the first and the second applicants, and on 17 April 1995 the third applicant, brought actions for compensation against the Ministry before the Van Administrative Court. They were represented by the same lawyers. In their petitions, the applicants claimed that Kamuran Alican had been injured and Çetin Alican and Ilhami Alican had died as a result of a mine which had been placed there by the gendarmerie police station. The first applicant requested the court to award 1,000,000,000 Turkish liras (TRL) for pecuniary damage and TRL 100,000,000 for nonpecuniary damage. The second and the third applicant each requested TRL 500,000,000 for loss of income on account of the death of their sons.', ""16. On 26 January 1998 the Van Administrative Court, basing its decision on the doctrine of “social risk”, awarded the applicant's claim in full. Although the amount determined by experts for pecuniary damage was significantly higher, the court was bound by the amount requested by the applicant."", '17. The Ministry appealed.', '18. On 8 February 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to determine which administrative entity, that is either the Ministry of the Interior or the Ministry of Defence, had responsibility for compensating the applicant.', '19. On 28 September 2001 the Van Administrative Court, deciding that the Ministry of the Interior had responsibility, gave its judgment. The court held as follows:', '“ ...', 'According to the report of the public prosecutor, the incident took place 1,500 metres from the Van 6th Armoured Brigade Barracks. (According to the sketch plan the distance is 2,200 metres.) It was a grenade for a rocket launcher called RPG-7, which exploded. The explosion occurred in an area where rockets are launched. Yet the origin of the grenade which caused the explosion is unknown. According to the inventory of the Turkish Military Forces, this type of weapon (RPG-7) is used by the military. However, it was included in the inventory of the 6th Armoured Brigade after the date of the incident in question. The maximum shooting range of the RPG-7 is 700 metres. The results of an investigation into the military units deployed in the region prior to the incident revealed that only one of these units had engaged in shooting practice. According to the records of that unit they had left no unexploded grenades. The rocket launcher in question is frequently used by members of the PKK terrorist organisation. Furthermore, the incident took place 1,500 metres from the barracks, in an area, which according to the attached map, has been declared to be a 2nd degree military security zone.', ""Although it is established that the explosion occurred in the vicinity of the rocket launching zone, since the distance from the barracks was 1,500-2,200 metres it cannot be accepted that the unexploded grenade which caused the explosion was one used during a military unit's training. The investigation conducted by the military prosecutor at the 21st Gendarmerie Division Commander's office resulted in the same conclusion. Moreover, the conditions in the region are particular: the weapon in question is frequently used and hidden by the terrorist organisation. The grenade might have been left by terrorists who attacked the barracks. It should therefore be concluded that the damage in the present case was not caused by the activities of military forces but rather by terrorist activities. Nevertheless, taking into account the fact that a state of emergency was in force in the region at the time and the extraordinary nature of the damage, compensation should be awarded by the administration in accordance with the theory of “social risk”."", '... The plaintiff should therefore be paid his claim in full, TRL 1,000,000,000 for pecuniary damage... although according to the expert reports, pecuniary damage in the present case could amount to TRL 19,237,229,000.', '... As regards non-pecuniary damage, the plaintiff should be awarded TRL 100,000,000.', '20. The Ministry appealed.', '21. On 23 May 2002 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.', '22. On 19 March 1998 the Van Administrative Court, basing its decision on the doctrine of “social risk”, awarded the applicant a certain amount of compensation.', '23. The Ministry appealed.', '24. On 22 December 1998 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to determine which administrative entity, that is either the Ministry of the Interior or the Ministry of Defence, had responsibility for compensating the applicant.', '25. On 16 November 1999 the Van Administrative Court, basing its decision on the doctrine of “social risk”, on the same ground as above, awarded the second applicant TRL 366,954,367 in respect of pecuniary damage together with legal interest running from the date of the incident, 23 April 1994.', '26. The Ministry appealed.', '27. On 9 April 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment as regards the amount of compensation awarded but quashed the judgment of the first-instance court in respect of the date from which the interest should run.', '28. On 28 November 2001 the Van Administrative Court held that the date of interest would start to run from the date when the applicant lodged an application with the Ministry, i.e. 20 February 1995.', '29. On 19 March 1998 the Van Administrative Court, basing its decision on the doctrine of “social risk”, awarded the applicant a certain amount of compensation.', '30. The Ministry appealed.', '31. On 15 March 2001 the Supreme Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the first-instance court on the ground that the latter had failed to determine which administrative entity, either the Ministry of the Interior or the Ministry of Defence, had responsibility for compensating the applicant.', '32. On 9 October 2001 the Van Administrative Court, basing its decision on the doctrine of “social risk” on the same ground as above, awarded the third applicant TRL 305,135,146 in respect of pecuniary damage together with legal interest running from 20 May 1995.', '33. The Ministry appealed.', '34. On 31 December 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.', '35.

The applicant was born in 1953 and lives in Plovdiv. He used to work as a shunter at the Bulgarian State Railways. On 15 August 1995 he was dismissed from his work for having breached disciplinary regulations.', '9. On 5 February 1996 the applicant filed with the Plovdiv District Court an action for wrongful dismissal against his former employer.', '10. On 12 March 1996 the District Court heard the applicant and his lawyer and rejected the case, ruling that the applicant’s dismissal was not amenable to judicial review. It based its decision on section 9(3) of the Decree No. 9 of 6 January 1981 and the Supreme Court’s practice, according to which employees of the State Railways dismissed for breach of disciplinary regulations could only appeal to a higher administrative body, not to a court.', '11. On 18 March 1996 the applicant appealed to the Plovdiv Regional Court against the District Court’s decision. He argued that Decree No. 9 was contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. He also relied on an amendment to the Labour Code of 1993, stating that it vested with the courts power to examine all appeals for wrongful dismissal, despite the provisions of Decree No. 9.', '12. By decision bearing the date 8 April 1996 the Regional Court, sitting in private, dismissed the applicant’s appeal, holding that in accordance with Decree No. 9 a judicial appeal against the applicant’s dismissal was not possible.', '13. The Regional Court’s decision was not pronounced publicly and was not served.', '14. On 4 June 1996 the case file was transmitted by the judge-rapporteur to the Regional Court’s clerical staff which made an entry in the court’s register.', '15. On 5 June 1996 the case file was transmitted to the District Court and an entry was made in its register.', '16. On 13 June 1996 the applicant submitted a petition for review (преглед по реда на надзора) to the Supreme Administrative Court.', '17. The parties were summoned for a hearing but none of them appeared.', '18. On 18 July 1997, sitting in private, the Supreme Administrative Court rejected the petition for review as time barred. It held that the Regional Court’s decision had entered into force on 8 April 1996 and that the two months’ time-limit for submission of a petition for review had expired on 8 June 1996 whereas the petition had been submitted on 13 June 1996.', '19. At the relevant time, in accordance with Decree No. 9 of 6 January 1981, employees of the State Railways were subject to a special legal regime. They had ranks, wore uniforms and were subject to strict hierarchy and discipline, under the control of the Ministry of Transport. Decree No. 9 set out the special rules governing service in the State Railways. The Labour Code had subsidiary application.', '20. Section 9 of the Decree, as in force at the relevant time and until February 1997, provided, inter alia, that disputes about wrongful dismissal of employees of the State Railways were amenable to review by the higher administrative authority only. As a result, until August 1996 the courts’ practice was to reject actions for wrongful dismissal of railways’ employees.', '21. In a judgment of 19 August 1996 the Supreme Administrative Court, departing from earlier practice, held that the prohibition of judicial review under Decree No. 9 was to be considered abandoned since 1 March 1993, the date on which an amendment to the Labour Code had entered into force (опр. no. 641 от 19.8.1996 г., Бюлетин на ВС, кн. 10-1996 г., стр. 17).', '22. The relevant part of section 9 of Decree No. 9 was eventually repealed by the Constitutional Court by decision of 18 February 1997 as unconstitutional and contrary to Article 6 of the Convention. The Constitutional Court held that dismissal from work could not be excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts, regard being had to the fact that the right to work is one of the fundamental constitutional rights (реш. no. 5 от 18.2.1997 по конст. дело no. 25/96 г. на КС на РБ, Държавен вестник, бр. 20/97).', '23. In November 2000 the remainder of Decree No. 9 was repealed and the special legal regime of State Railways employees abandoned.', '24. Under the Code of Civil Procedure as in force at the relevant time, service was required only in respect of judgments and certain types of procedural decisions issued by a first level of jurisdiction.', '25. Judgments or decisions delivered by a court acting as a second level jurisdiction were not served despite the fact that most of them were amenable to review (преглед по реда на надзора), within particular time limits, before the Supreme Court (which was later reconstituted into the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Cassation).', '26. As a result, whenever second instance cases were decided in private (which was the rule in appeals against procedural decisions), the parties could only learn whether or not their case had been decided by visiting the respective court and checking its register periodically.', '27. Article 226 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as in force at the relevant time, provided that a petition for review could be submitted within two months from the impugned decision’s entry into force. At that time judgments and decisions issued by a second level of jurisdiction entered into force on the date on which they were made (opr. 3022-95-III).', '28. According to the applicant, the courts nevertheless would normally count the two-month time-limit from the date on which the second instance judgment or decision was entered in the respective register. No relevant case-law has been cited by the parties.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

On 2 October 1998 the Preobrazhenskiy District Court of Moscow upheld this extension order.', '9. In September 2000 the criminal case against the applicant was listed for trial. On 29 September 2000 the Moscow City Court held that the measure of restraint in respect of defendants, including the applicant, had been lawful and should remain unchanged.', '10. The City Court subsequently issued further extension orders on 3 July, 30 September, 18 December 2002, 24 March, 30 June and 30 September 2003, referring to the fact that the applicant and his co-defendants had been charged with particularly serious criminal offences. The Supreme Court of the Russian Federation rejected appeals against these remand orders, endorsing the City Court’s reasoning.', '11. On 30 December 2003 the City Court extended the defendants’ detention on remand until 1 April 2004, noting the gravity of the charges against them and the possibility that they might abscond or obstruct justice.', '12. On 30 March 2004 the City Court extended the defendants’ detention on remand until 1 July 2004, indicating that:', '“...[the defendants] have been charged with several counts of serious and particularly serious criminal offences committed by an organised gang in conspiracy with unidentified persons, against whom separate criminal proceedings are pending, and with another person, against whom criminal proceedings were disjoined because his whereabouts are not known; if released, [they] may abscond or obstruct justice”.', '13. On 1 July 2004 the City Court extended the defendants’ detention, reproducing verbatim the reasoning of its earlier decision.', '14. On 22 July 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the decision of 30 March 2004 and endorsed the City Court’s reasoning.', '15. On 19 July 1999 the Moscow city prosecutor approved the bill of indictment and the case was submitted for trial to the City Court. The applicant was charged with multiple counts including conspiracy to commit murder. Similar charges were brought against fifteen other co-defendants.', '16. On 5 August 1999 the City Court noted that the majority of the defendants had opted to exercise their constitutional right to a trial by jury. However, as there were no juries in the City Court, it decided to send an inquiry to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation as to where the case should be tried. The Supreme Court referred the case to the Moscow Regional Court, where juries were available.', '17. On an unspecified date a judge of the Regional Court sent a request to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, inviting it to rule on the compatibility with the Russian Constitution of the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the jurisdictional rules. On 17 February 2000 she suspended the proceedings pending a decision by the Constitutional Court. She also held that the defendants were to remain in custody because they had been charged with criminal offences of high public danger, classified as serious or particularly serious.', '18. On 13 April 2000 the Constitutional Court held that the decision on the change of venue had been incompatible with the Russian Constitution.', '19. In compliance with that ruling, on 14 June 2000 the Regional Court returned the case file to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decided on 6 September 2000 that the City Court was competent to try the case.', '20. On 29 September 2000 the City Court scheduled the first hearing for 13 October 2000 before a panel consisting of a professional judge and two lay judges, but on that date the hearing was adjourned because the presiding judge was sitting in another case.', '21. In 2001 and 2002 the presiding judge was replaced by other judges of the City Court. Lay judges were replaced several times.', '22. Numerous hearings were scheduled between 2001 and early 2003. All of them were adjourned on various grounds, mainly because the prosecutor, the interpreter and some of the defendants’ lawyers had defaulted, and also owing to the presiding judge’s involvement in other proceedings in May and October 2001, and then in May, September and October 2002.', '23. It appears that consideration of the merits began in March 2003. The absence of several lawyers, including the applicant’s counsel, was one of the reasons for adjourning the hearings listed for 4 March and 29 April 2003.', '24. The illness of the applicant’s counsel was one of the reasons for adjourning the hearings scheduled for 26 January and 2 February 2004. On 10 March 2004 the trial judge ordered the bailiffs to bring the defaulting witnesses and victims to a hearing on 16 March 2004, which was not done in respect of certain witnesses and victims. On a number of occasions between March and July 2004 the judge reiterated his request.', '25. On 12 August 2004 the trial court closed the trial and started deliberations.', '26. On 27 October 2004 the City Court found the applicant guilty of multiple counts including conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. On 10 November 2004 the judgment was pronounced in public.', '27. The applicant and the other defendants lodged an appeal. On 15 November 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment.', '28. According to the applicant, from 2 October 2004 to 5 June 2005 and from 11 June to 26 June 2005 he shared a cell with a Mr K. On an unspecified date, the latter tested HIV positive. He was informed so six months later and had another blood test, which was also positive. According to the applicant, on 11 June 2005 Mr K. told him that he had tested HIV positive.', '29. It appears from a report of 20 March 2006, submitted by the Government, that HIV-positive detainees were not segregated from the other detainees in remand centre no. 77/1; the applicant “was informed of the rules for detention of HIV-positive detainees”, including a prohibition of such segregation.', '30. The applicant submitted the following description of the relevant circumstances of his transport and confinement.', 'Between 2001 and 2004 the applicant had been transported to the Moscow City Court and back to the remand centre no. 77/1 on no less than one hundred days (normally, three days per week). He had been taken out of his cell at 6 a.m. and placed alone in a cell measuring 70 by 70 centimetres, awaiting departure at 9 or 10 a.m. On the day of a court hearing he had not been given any food before departure; nor had he received any meal at the courthouse or in the remand centre upon his return. Since early 2004 the authorities had started to supply a dry ration for the day which he, however, could not consume because no hot water had been provided at the convoy premises in the City Court.', 'The applicant had been transported in overcrowded vans; the journey from the remand centre to the City Court had normally taken one to three hours.', 'At the City Court premises the applicant had been held together with several other detainees in a cell measuring 1.2 by 2 metres. After the hearing he had been taken back to that cell where he had waited until 6 to 8 p.m. without any food or drink or access to a toilet.', 'On the way back the prison van had never gone directly to remand centre no. 77/1, it made a detour to bring detainees to another remand centre where it sometimes stayed for four or five hours. Thus, the return journey had normally taken two to three hours. Upon arrival at facility no. 77/1, the applicant had had to wait for one more hour before being taken to his cell at about midnight.', '31. The Government contested the applicant’s description of his conditions of confinement and transport. According to them, the applicant was taken out of his cell at 6 a.m. and provided with hot breakfast. He was then kept at the assembly section which had eight cells measuring between 12.7 and 17.9 square metres. Each cell had a bench, sanitary facilities, artificial lighting and a window. The applicant remained there for about one hour and a half awaiting departure for the courthouse. He was given a dry ration consisting of two courses for the remainder of the day.', 'Between 2001 and 2003 the applicant was transported in vans GAZ-2207(3309) and ZIL-4331. The detainees’ section of the GAZ van measured 3.8 m (length) by 2.35 m (width) by 1.6 m (height). Such a van had one individual compartment and two compartments for twelve persons each. The detainees’ section of the ZIL van measured 4.7 m by 2.4 m by 1.64 m and had two individual compartments and two compartments for seventeen persons each. Both types of vans also had three or four seats for convoy officers.', 'Vans were equipped with fixed benches so that each detainee was provided with individual seating. Van walls had insulating lining. Van heaters and lights were powered by the van engine so that the heating and lighting systems were operational when the engine was running. Vans were naturally ventilated through the emergency hatch and additional hatches with controlled airflow. Given the security considerations, from December 2003 onwards the applicant and his co-defendants were carried by direct transfer between the remand centre and the courthouse.', 'At the City Court the applicant was kept at the convoy premises which had three compartments with seventeen cells each and a toilet, which detainees could access upon request. Each cell measured 1 m by 1.95 m by 3.1 m. Each cell had seating and was equipped with systems of ventilation, heating and artificial lighting. At the courthouse he was provided with hot water with which to consume the dry ration. He was also allowed to bring food purchased in the prison shop or received from his relatives.', '32. In 2003 the applicant complained about unsatisfactory conditions of transport and confinement at the courthouse.', '33. It appears from the report of the Moscow Department of the Interior dated 16 December 2003, submitted by the Government, that the applicant was taken to court for criminal proceedings which “were dragging on”. Between July and October 2003 he was transported eight times in the prison van ZIL-4331 together with, at times, fifteen to twenty-seven other detainees; the direct transfer from the courthouse did not normally exceed thirty minutes and ended no later than 8 p.m., except on 30 September 2003. From December 2003 onwards the applicant and his co-defendants were taken by direct transfer on account of security considerations. Convoy premises at courthouses were not equipped for catering purposes and “the detainees ate their dry rations when they returned to the remand centre from the courthouse”.', '34. By a letter of 17 December 2003 the Moscow Department of the Interior stated that the time taken for transportation had been “objectively justified”.', '35. For a summary of the applicable national legislation relating to detention on remand, see the Court’s judgment in the case of Khudoyorov v. Russia (no. 6847/02, §§ 76-93, ECHR 2005).', '36. On 4 May 2001 the Ministry of Justice adopted the Rules on food supply for convicts and persons detained in remand centres. According to Annex no. 3 to these Rules, a daily dry ration (bread, tinned beef or fish, sugar, tea and salt) is provided to the following categories of persons: convicts on their way to a prison, a remand centre or colony; persons released from custody on the way to their place of residence; persons during their stay in patient care institutions or convicted juveniles. Those Rules were amended in 2004 and repealed in 2005.', '37. On 4 February 2004 the Ministry of Justice adopted the Rules on supply of dry ration, according to which persons suspected or accused of criminal offences should be supplied with a dry ration (bread, precooked first and second courses, sugar, tea, tableware) during their presence at a courthouse. Detainees should be supplied with hot water with which to consume the ration.', '38. Limitation of a citizen’s rights and freedoms because of his or her HIV status may be authorised only by federal law (section 5 of the Law on Prevention of Propagation of HIV infection, 38-FZ of 30 March 1995). Detainees are subject to a compulsory medical examination (section 9 of the Law). A person who has tested HIV-positive must be informed thereof, be informed of the need to take precautions for preventing propagation of the HIV infection and warned that contamination of others or exposing others to a risk of contamination is a criminal offence (section 13 of the Law; Article 122 of the Criminal Code).', '39. According to the Rules on Compulsory Testing of Prisoners for HIV infection (adopted by the Russian Government on 28 February 1996), the prison administration must take measures preventing propagation of the HIV infection; medical and other staff must not disclose information relating to the detainee’s HIV status (Rules 11 and 13).', '40. Section 101 § 2 of the Penitentiary Code provided that medical penitentiary establishments should be organised for treatment and detention of drug addicts, alcoholics, HIV and tuberculosis infected prisoners. Federal Law No. 25-FZ of 9 March 2001 repealed that provision in so far as it related to HIV-infected prisoners.', '41. The relevant extracts from the 11th General Report [CPT/Inf (2001) 16] prepared by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) concerning transmissible diseases read as follows:', '“31. The spread of transmissible diseases and, in particular, of tuberculosis, hepatitis and HIV/AIDS has become a major public health concern in a number of European countries....', '...[T]he act of depriving a person of his liberty always entails a duty of care...', 'The use of up-to date methods for screening, the regular supply of medication...constitute essential elements of an effective strategy...to provide appropriate care to the prisoners concerned.', '...[T]he prisoners concerned should not be segregated from the rest of the prison population unless this is strictly necessary on medical or other grounds. In this connection, the CPT wishes to stress in particular that there is no medical justification for the segregation of prisoners solely on the grounds that they are HIV-positive.', '...[I]t is incumbent on national authorities to ensure that there is a full educational programme about transmissible diseases for both prisoners and prison staff. Such a programme should address methods of transmission and means of protection as well as the application of adequate preventive measures. More particularly, the risks of HIV or hepatitis B/C infection through sexual contacts and intravenous drug use should be highlighted and the role of body fluids as the carriers of HIV and hepatitis viruses explained...”', '42. The relevant parts of the Appendix to Recommendation no. R (98) 7 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison read as follows:', '“13. Medical confidentiality should be guaranteed and respected...', '38. The isolation of a patient with an infectious condition is only justified if such a measure would also be taken outside the prison environment for the same medial reasons.', '39. No form of segregation should be envisaged in respect of persons who are HIV antibody positive, subject to the provisions contained in paragraph 40.', '40. Those who become seriously ill with Aids-related illnesses should be treated within the prison health care department, without necessarily resorting to total isolation. Patients, who need to be protected from the infectious illnesses transmitted by other patients, should be isolated only if such a measure is necessary for their own sake to prevent them acquiring intercurrent infections...”', '43. The relevant part of the Appendix to Recommendation no. R (93) 6 of the Committee of Ministers to Member States concerning prison and criminological aspects of the control of transmissible diseases including Aids and related health problems in prison reads as follows:', '“9. As segregation, isolation and restrictions on occupation, sport and recreation are not considered necessary for seropositive people in the community, the same attitude must be adopted towards seropositive prisoners.”', '44. Detention of HIV-infected persons was also examined in the following Recommendations of the Committee of Ministers to Member States: no. R (89) 14 on the ethical issues of HIV infection in the health care and social settings; and no. R (98) 7 concerning the ethical and organisational aspects of health care in prison.', '45. Similar recommendations were made by the 1993 World Health Organisation in the Guidelines on HIV infection and AIDS in prisons:', '“27. Since segregation, isolation and restrictions on occupational activities, sports and recreation are not considered useful or relevant in the case of HIV-infected people in the community, the same attitude should be adopted towards HIV-infected prisoners.

Isolation for limited periods may be required on medical grounds for HIV-infected prisoners suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis in an infectious stage. Protective isolation may also be required for prisoners with immunodepression related to AIDS, but should be carried out only with a prisoner’s informed consent.

The case concerns the killing on 19 July 1996 of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov by a member of the military police who was attempting to arrest them.', '11. All the applicants are Bulgarian nationals of Roma origin.', ""12. Ms Anelia Kunchova Nachova, who was born in 1995, is Mr Angelov's daughter. Ms Aksiniya Hristova, who was born in 1978, is Ms Nachova's mother. Both live in Dobrolevo, Bulgaria. Ms Todorka Petrova Rangelova and Mr Rangel Petkov Rangelov, who were born in 1955 and 1954 respectively and live in Lom, Bulgaria, are Mr Petkov's parents."", '13. In 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov, who were both 21 years old, were conscripts in the Construction Force (Строителни войски), a division of the army dealing with the construction of apartment blocks and other civilian projects.', ""14. Early in 1996 Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were arrested for being repeatedly absent without leave. On 22 May 1996 Mr Angelov was sentenced to nine months' imprisonment and Mr Petkov to five months' imprisonment. Both had previous convictions for theft."", ""15. On 15 July 1996 they fled from a construction site outside the prison where they had been brought to work and travelled to the home of Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, in the village of Lesura. Neither man was armed."", ""16. Their absence was reported the following day and their names put on the military police's wanted list. A warrant for their arrest was received on 16 July 1996 by the Vratsa Military Police Unit."", '17. At around twelve noon on 19 July 1996, the officer on duty in the Vratsa Military Police Unit received an anonymous telephone message that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were hiding in the village of Lesura. On at least one of the previous occasions when he had been absent without leave, it was there that Mr Angelov had been found and arrested.', '18. The commanding officer, Colonel D., decided to dispatch four military police officers, under the command of Major G., to locate and arrest the two men. At least two of the officers knew one or both of them. Major G. apparently knew Lesura because, according to a secretary who worked at the town hall and was heard later as a witness, his mother was from the village.', '19. Colonel D. told the officers that “in accordance with the rules” they should carry their handguns and automatic rifles and wear bullet-proof vests. He informed them that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were “criminally active” (криминално проявени) – an expression used to denote persons with previous convictions or persons suspected of an offence – and that they had escaped from detention. The officers were instructed to use whatever means were dictated by the circumstances to arrest them.', '20. The officers immediately left for Lesura in a jeep. Two officers wore uniforms while the others were in civilian clothes. Only Major G. wore a bullet-proof vest. He was armed with a personal handgun and a 7.62 mm calibre Kalashnikov automatic rifle. The other men carried handguns. Three Kalashnikov automatic rifles remained in the boot of the vehicle throughout the operation.', '21. The officers were briefed orally by Major G. on their way to Lesura. Sergeant N. was to cover the east side of the house, Major G. the west side and Sergeant K. was to go into the house. Sergeant S., the driver, was to remain with the vehicle and keep watch over the north side.', ""22. At around 1 p.m. the officers arrived in Lesura. They asked a secretary at the town hall and one of the villagers, Mr T.M., to join them and show them Mr Angelov's grandmother's house. The vehicle drove into Lesura's Roma district."", '23. Sergeant N. recognised the house since he had previously arrested Mr Angelov there for being absent without leave.', '24. As soon as the jeep drew up in front of the house, between 1 and 1.30 p.m., Sergeant K. recognised Mr Angelov, who was inside, behind the window. Having noticed the vehicle, the fugitives tried to escape. The officers heard the sound of a window pane being broken. Major G. and Sergeants K. and N. jumped out of the vehicle while it was still moving. Major G. and Sergeant K. went through the garden gate, the former going to the west side of the house, and the latter entering the house. Sergeant N. headed towards the east side of the house. Sergeant S. remained with the car, together with the secretary who worked at the town hall and Mr T.M.', ""25. Sergeant N. later testified that, having noticed Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov escaping through the window and running towards a neighbour's yard, he had shouted: “Stop, military police!” He had pulled out his gun, but had not fired any shots. The two men had carried on running. Sergeant N. had run out on to the street in an effort to intercept them by cutting past several houses. While running, he had heard Major G. shout: “Freeze, military police, freeze [or] I'll shoot!” It was then that the shooting had started."", '26. Major G. stated in his testimony:', ""“... I heard Sergeant N. shouting: 'Freeze, police' ... I saw the conscripts; they were running and then stopped in front of the fence between Ms Tonkova's and the neighbour's yards ... I saw that they were trying to jump over the [chain-link] fence, so I shouted: 'Freeze, or I'll shoot!' I released the safety catch and loaded the automatic gun. Then I fired a shot in the air, holding the automatic rifle upwards with my right hand, almost perpendicular to the ground ... The conscripts climbed over the [chain-link] fence and continued to run, I followed them, then I fired one, two or three more times in the air and shouted: 'Freeze!', but they continued running. I again fired shots in the air with the automatic and shouted: 'Freeze, or I will shoot with live cartridges.' I warned them again, but they continued running without turning back. I fired to the right [of the two men] with the automatic after the warning, aiming at the ground, hoping that this would make them stop running. I again shouted 'Freeze!' when they were at the corner of the other house and then I aimed and fired at them as they were scaling the fence. I aimed at their feet. The ground where I stood was at a lower level ... [B]y jumping over the second fence they would have escaped and I did not have any other means of stopping them. The gradient there was a bit steep, [I] was standing on lower ground ... the second fence was on the highest ground, that is why when I fired the first time I aimed to the side [of the two men], as I considered that nobody from the neighbouring houses would be hurt, and the second time I aimed at the conscripts, but fired at their feet. Under Regulation 45 we can use firearms to arrest members of the military forces who have committed a publicly prosecutable offence and do not surrender after a warning, but in accordance with paragraph 3 of [that regulation] we have to protect the lives of the persons against whom [we use firearms] – for that reason I fired at [the victims'] feet – with the intention of avoiding fatal injury. The last time that I shot at the conscripts' feet, I was twenty metres away from them and they were exactly at the south-east corner of the neighbouring yard. After the shooting they both fell down ...They were both lying on their stomachs, and both gave signs of life, ... moaning ... then Sergeant S. appeared, I called him ... and handed him my automatic rifle ...”"", '27. According to the statements of the three subordinate officers, Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were lying on the ground in front of the fence, with their legs pointing in the direction of the house from which they had come. One of them was lying on his back and the other on his stomach.', ""28. A neighbour, Mr Z., who lived opposite Mr Angelov's grandmother, also gave evidence. At about 1 or 1.30 p.m. he had seen a military jeep pull up in front of Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had heard somebody shout: “Don't run, I am using live cartridges.” He had then heard shots. He had looked into the next yard and seen Mr Angelov, whom he knew, and another man leap over the chain-link fence between Ms Tonkova's and another neighbour's yards. He had not seen the man who had shouted as he was hidden from view behind Ms Tonkova's house. Then he had seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov fall to the ground and the man who had shot them emerge, holding an automatic rifle. Mr Z. further stated:"", '“The other men in uniform then started remonstrating with [the man who had shot Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov] telling him that he should not have fired, that he should not have come with them. Of those who came in the jeep, only the senior officer fired ... I know him by sight, he has relatives in Lesura.”', '29. Sergeant S. stated that on arriving at the house he had remained with the vehicle and had heard Sergeant N. shouting from the east side of the house: “Freeze, police!” He had also heard Major G. shout “Freeze, police!” several times from the west side of the house. Then Major G. had started shooting with his automatic weapon, while continuing to shout. Sergeant S. had then entered the yard. He had seen Major G. leap over the chain-link fence and heard him shouting. He had gone up to him, had taken his automatic rifle and seen Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov lying on the ground next to the fence. They were still alive. At that moment Sergeant K. had come out of the house. Major G. had gone to get the jeep and had reported the incident over the vehicle radio. When they returned, Sergeant N. had appeared from the neighbouring street and helped them put the wounded men in the vehicle.', '30. The head of the Vratsa Military Police Unit and other officers were informed of the incident at around 1.30 p.m.', ""31. Sergeant K. testified that he had entered the house and had been speaking to Mr Angelov's grandmother and another woman when he heard Major G. shouting at Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov to stop. In the house, he had noticed that a window pane in the room overlooking the yard had been broken. He had been on the verge of leaving the house when he heard shooting coming from behind the house. On his way to the yard he had met Major G., who had told him that the fugitives had been wounded. Sergeant K. had then climbed over the chain-link fence and approached the wounded men, who were still alive and moaning. He had found himself holding the automatic rifle, but could not remember how it had come into his possession. He had opened the magazine and seen no cartridges in it. There was only one cartridge left in the barrel."", '32. Immediately after the shooting, a number of people from the vicinity gathered. Sergeant K. and Sergeant S. took the wounded men to Vratsa Hospital, while Major G. and Sergeant N. remained at the scene.', '33. Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov died on the way to Vratsa. They were pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.', ""34. Mr Angelov's grandmother, Ms Tonkova, gave the following account of the events. Her grandson and Mr Petkov had been in her house when they had noticed a jeep approaching. She had gone outside and seen four men in uniform. They had all entered the yard. One of them had gone round the house and started shooting with an automatic rifle for a very long time. The other three men were also armed but had not fired any shots. She had been in the yard, pleading with the man who had been shooting to stop. However, he had walked towards the back of the house. Then she had heard shooting in the backyard. She had followed and then seen her grandson and Mr Petkov lying in the neighbours' yard with bullet wounds."", '35. According to another neighbour, Mr M.M., all three policemen were shooting. Two of them had fired shots in the air and the third officer – who had been on the west side of the house (Major G.) – had been aiming at someone. Mr M.M. had heard some fifteen to twenty shots, perhaps more. Then he had seen the military policemen go to the neighbouring yard, where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. That yard belonged to Mr M.M. and his daughter. On seeing his grandson – a young boy – standing there, Mr M.M. had asked Major G. for permission to approach and to take him away. Major G. had pointed his gun at him in a brutal manner and had insulted him, saying: “You damn Gypsies!” (“мамка ви циганска”).', '36. On 19 July 1996 all the officers involved made separate reports on the incident to the Vratsa Military Police Unit. None of them was tested for alcohol.', ""37. A criminal investigation into the deaths was opened the same day, and between 4 and 4.30 p.m. a military investigator inspected the scene. In his report he described the scene, including the respective positions of Ms Tonkova's house, the first chain-link fence, and the spent cartridges and bloodstains found there. He indicated that the structure of the first chain-link fence was damaged and the fence had been torn down in one place."", ""38. A sketch map was appended to the report. It showed the yard of Ms Tonkova's house and the neighbouring yard where Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had fallen. The places where spent cartridges had been found were indicated. The sketch map and the report gave only some of the measurements of the yards. The gradient and other characteristics of the terrain and the surrounding area were not described."", ""39. Nine spent cartridges were retrieved. One cartridge was found in the street, in front of Ms Tonkova's house (apparently not far from where the jeep had stopped). Four cartridges were discovered in Ms Tonkova's yard, behind the house, close to the first chain-link fence separating her yard from the neighbour's yard. Three cartridges were found in the yard of the neighbour (Mr M.M), close to the place where the bloodstains were found. The exact distance between those cartridges and the bloodstains was not given. A ninth cartridge was found subsequently and handed in to the military police by Mr Angelov's uncle. There is no record of where it was found."", '40. The bloodstains were a metre apart. They were marked on the sketch map as being slightly more than nine metres from the first chain-link fence. The distance between the bloodstains and the second fence that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had apparently been trying to scale when they were shot was not indicated. Samples of the bloodstains were taken by the investigator.', '41. On 21 July 1996, a pathologist carried out an autopsy.', ""According to autopsy report no. 139/96, the cause of Mr Petkov's death was “a wound to the chest”, the direction of the shot having been “from front to back”. The wound was described as follows:"", '“There is an oval-shaped wound of 2.5 cm by 1 cm in the chest, at a distance of 144 cm from the feet, with missing tissues, and jagged and compressed edges in the area of the left shoulder. There is an oval-shaped wound of 3 cm in the back, to the left of the infrascapular line at a distance of 123 cm from the feet with missing tissues, jagged and torn edges turned outwards.”', '42. As regards Mr Angelov, the report found that the cause of death had been “a gunshot wound, which [had] damaged a major blood vessel” and that the direction of the shot had been “from back to front”. It was further stated:', '“There is a round wound on the left of the buttocks at a distance of 90 cm from the feet ... with missing tissue, jagged walls and edges, and a diameter of about 0.8 cm ... There is an oval wound of 2.1 cm with jagged torn edges and walls turned outwards and missing tissues on the border between the lower and middle third [of the abdomen], at a distance of 95 cm from the feet, slightly to the left of the navel.”', '43. The report concluded that the injuries had been caused by an automatic rifle fired from a distance.', ""44. On 22, 23 and 24 July 1996 the four military police officers, two neighbours (M.M. and K.), the secretary who worked at the town hall, and Mr Angelov's uncle were questioned by the investigator. Mr Petkov's mother was also questioned subsequently."", ""45. On 1 August 1996 Major G.'s automatic rifle, a cartridge that had been found in it and the nine spent cartridges found at the scene were examined by a ballistics expert from the Vratsa Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs. According to his report, the automatic rifle was serviceable, all nine retrieved cartridges had been fired from it and the last cartridge which had not been fired was also serviceable."", ""46. A report by a forensic expert dated 29 August 1996 found an alcohol content of 0.55 g/l in Mr Petkov's blood and 0.75 g/l in Mr Angelov's blood (under Bulgarian law it is an administrative offence to drive with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.5 g/l)."", ""47. On 20 September 1996 a forensic examination of the bloodstains found at the scene was carried out by an expert from the Vratsa Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs and they were found to match the victims' blood groups."", ""48. On 20 January and on 13 February 1997 another neighbour (Mr T.M.) and Ms Hristova (one of the applicants) were questioned. On 26 March 1997 Mr Angelov's grandmother and a neighbour, Z., were questioned."", '49. On 7 January 1997 the families of Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov were given access to the investigation file. They requested that three more witnesses, T.M., Ms Tonkova and Z.H. be heard. Their request was granted. The witnesses were heard by the investigator on 20 January and 26 March 1997. The applicants did not ask for any other evidence to be obtained.', ""50. On 31 March 1997 the investigator completed the preliminary investigation and drew up a final report. He noted that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had escaped from detention while serving a prison sentence, and had thus committed an offence. Major G. had done everything within his power to save their lives: he had instructed them to stop and surrender and had fired warning shots. He had aimed at them only after seeing that they were continuing to run away and might escape. He had not sought to injure any vital organs. The investigator therefore concluded that Major G. had acted in accordance with Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations and made a recommendation to the Pleven regional prosecutor's office that the investigation should be closed as Major G. had not committed an offence."", ""51. On 8 April 1997 the Pleven military prosecutor accepted the investigator's recommendation and closed the preliminary investigation into the deaths. He concluded that Major G. had proceeded in accordance with Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations. He had warned the two men several times and fired shots in the air. He had shot them only because they had not surrendered, as there had been a danger that they might escape. He had sought to avoid inflicting fatal injuries. No one else had been hurt."", ""52. When describing the victims' personal circumstances, including details of their family, education and previous convictions, the prosecutor stated in the order that both men originated from “minority families”, an expression mainly used to designate people from the Roma minority."", ""53. By an order of 11 June 1997, the prosecutor of the armed forces prosecutor's office dismissed the applicants' subsequent appeal on the grounds that Mr Angelov and Mr Petkov had provoked the shooting by trying to escape and that Major G. had taken the steps required by law in such situations. Therefore, the use of arms had been lawful under Regulation 45 of the Military Police Regulations."", ""54. On 19 November 1997 the prosecutor from the investigation review department of the armed forces prosecutor's office dismissed a further appeal on grounds similar to those that had been relied on by the other public prosecutors."", ""55. In its country reports of the last few years, the Council of Europe's European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) has expressed concern regarding racially motivated police violence, particularly against Roma, in a number of European countries including Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia."", '56. The report on the situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its member States in 2002, prepared by the European Union network of independent experts in fundamental rights at the request of the European Commission, stated, inter alia, that police abuse against Roma and similar groups, including physical abuse and excessive use of force, had been reported in a number of European Union member States, such as Austria, France, Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal.', '57. In its second report on Bulgaria, published in March 2000, ECRI stated, inter alia:', '“Of particular concern is the incidence of police discrimination and mistreatment of members of the Roma/Gypsy community. ... [T]he Human Rights Project documents in its Annual Report for 1998 numerous ... cases of police misconduct towards ... Roma ... It cites as the most common violations: use of excessive physical force during detention for the purposes of extorting evidence; unjustified use of firearms ... and threats to the personal security of individuals who had complained against the police to the competent authorities. ... The Human Rights Project notes ... that the majority of complaints filed by this non-governmental organisation on behalf of Roma victims of police violence have not been followed up by the authorities. ... [V]ictims seem unwilling to come forward with complaints, particularly when they are awaiting court sentences ... [There is apparently also] some unwillingness on the part of the authorities to admit that problems of police misconduct do exist. ...', 'ECRI [reiterates its recommendation] that an independent body be set up – acting at central and local level – to investigate police, investigative and penitentiary practices for overt and covert racial discrimination and to ensure that any discrimination perpetrated be severely punished. ...', 'ECRI is concerned at the persistence of widespread discrimination against members of the Roma/Gypsy community in Bulgaria. ... It is reported that local authorities are sometimes involved in the illegal administration of justice as regards Roma/Gypsy communities, often with the silent collusion of local police.”', '58. In its third report on Bulgaria, published in January 2004, ECRI stated, inter alia:', ""“[Since ECRI's second report,] there have been no changes in the Criminal Code [to ensure that criminal law provisions fully allow any racist motivation to be taken into account]. ... ECRI recommends that the Bulgarian authorities insert a provision in the Criminal Code expressly stating that racist motivation for any ordinary offence constitute[s] an aggravating circumstance. ..."", 'ECRI is concerned about allegations of instances of excessive use of firearms by the police, which have sometimes led to the death of Roma. ... ECRI strongly recommends that the Bulgarian authorities take steps to restrict the use of firearms by the law enforcement agencies to cases where their use is really necessary. In particular, it urges the Bulgarian authorities to amend the law to this end and ensure that international standards are conformed to in practice in this field.', 'ECRI is particularly concerned about the findings ... that the proportion of people of Roma origin who state that they have been subjected to physical violence in police stations is three times higher than the proportion of people of Bulgarian origin. ... So far, the Bulgarian authorities have not set up an independent body to investigate illtreatment or acts of discrimination committed by members of the police force. ...', 'ECRI is pleased to learn that a specialised human rights committee was set up in the National Police Department in August 2000 ... Numerous schemes have been launched to provide human rights training for police officers ...', '...', 'The Framework Programme for Equal Integration of Roma in Bulgarian Society is unanimously considered, including by Roma representatives, to be well structured and fairly comprehensive ... There is, however, a unanimous feeling within the Roma community and among non-governmental organisations, that, apart from the few initiatives mentioned in this report, the programme has remained a dead letter ... The view in certain quarters is that the government lacks the political resolve to carry through such a programme ... ECRI is very concerned to learn that, four years after the adoption of the Framework Programme, its implementation is still in its early stages. ...”', '59. Non-governmental organisations, such as Human Rights Project and Amnesty International have reported in the last several years numerous incidents of alleged racial violence against Roma in Bulgaria, including by law enforcement agents.', '60. Section 45 of the Regulations (Regulation 45), as in force at the relevant time, provided as follows:', '“(1) Military police officers may use firearms ... under the following circumstances:', '...', '2. to arrest a person serving in the army who has committed or is about to commit a publicly prosecutable offence and who does not surrender after being warned ...', '(2) The use of force shall be preceded by an oral warning and a shot fired in the air ...', '(3) When using firearms military police officers shall be under a duty, as far as possible, to protect the life of the person against whom they use force and to assist the wounded ...', '...', '(5) Whenever firearms have been used, a report shall be prepared describing the circumstances which occasioned their use; [the report] shall be transmitted to the superiors of the officer concerned.”', '61. In December 2000 Regulation 45 was superseded by Decree no. 7 of 6 December 2000 on the use of force and firearms by military police (published in Official Gazette no. 102/2000 and amended in 2001). According to Article 21 of the decree, firearms may be used, inter alia, for the arrest of any person who has committed an offence of the category of publicly prosecuted offences. The vast majority of offences under the Criminal Code fall within that category, including, for example, petty theft. According to Articles 2, 4 § 1 and 21 of the decree, the nature of the offence committed by the person against whom the force and firearms are used and the character of the offender are factors to be taken into consideration.', '62. Article 12 of the Criminal Code regulates the degree of force that may be used in self-defence. It requires essentially that any action in selfdefence or defence of another be proportionate to the nature and intensity of the attack and reasonable in the circumstances. The provision does not regulate cases where force has been used by a police officer or another person in order to effect an arrest without there being an attack on the arresting officer or any third party. Until 1997 there were no other provisions regulating this issue. However, the courts appear to have applied Article 12 in certain cases concerning the use of force to effect an arrest.', '63. To fill that vacuum, in its Interpretative Direction no. 12 issued in 1973, the Supreme Court proclaimed, without further clarification, that causing harm in order to effect an arrest should not lead to prosecution if no more force was used than was necessary (12-1973-PPVS).', '64. In its Decision no. 15 of 17 March 1995, the Supreme Court, while noting that the use of force in order to effect an arrest was not regulated by law and thus engendered difficulties for the courts, considered that the principles to be applied were those that had been identified by legal commentators. In particular, inflicting harm would be justified only where there was a reasonable suspicion that the person to be arrested had committed an offence, there were no other means to effect the arrest and the harm caused was proportionate to the seriousness of the offence. The Supreme Court also stated:', '“... [Causing harm to an offender in order to effect an arrest] is an act of last resort. If the offender does not attempt to escape or ... does attempt to escape, but to a known hiding place, causing harm will not be justified ...', 'The harm caused must be proportionate to the seriousness ... of the offence. If the offender has committed an offence representing insignificant danger to the public, his life and health cannot be put at risk. Putting his life or health at risk may be justified, however, where a person is in hiding after committing a serious offence (such as murder, rape or robbery).', 'The means used to effect the arrest (and the harm caused) must be reasonable in the circumstances. This is the most important condition for lawfulness ...', 'Where the harm caused exceeds what was necessary ..., that is to say, where it does not correspond to the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances obtaining during the arrest, ... the person inflicting it will be liable to prosecution ...”', '65. In 1997 Parliament decided to fill the legislative vacuum by adding a new Article 12a to the Criminal Code. It provides that causing harm to a person while arresting him or her for an offence shall not be punishable where no other means of effecting the arrest existed and the force used was necessary and lawful. The force used will not be considered “necessary” where it is manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offence committed by the person to be arrested or is in itself excessive and unnecessary. Few judgments interpreting Article 12a have been reported.', '66. Article 192 provides that proceedings concerning publicly prosecutable offences may only be initiated by a prosecutor or an investigator acting on a complaint or ex officio. Under Article 237 § 6, as worded until 1 January 2000, the victim had a right of appeal to a higher-ranking prosecutor against a decision not to proceed with pending criminal proceedings. The victim had no other means of challenging a refusal to prosecute.', '67. When military courts have jurisdiction to hear a case, as for example when it concerns military police officers, the responsibility for conducting the investigation and prosecution lies with the military investigators and prosecutors, whose decisions are open to appeal before the Chief Public Prosecutor.', '68. Article 63 entitles victims of crime to join the criminal proceedings, and in that connection to claim damages, to inspect the case file and take copies of relevant documents. They may also adduce evidence, raise objections, make applications and appeal against decisions of the investigating and prosecuting authorities.', '69. The Protection against Discrimination Act was passed in September 2003 and came into force on 1 January 2004. It is a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to create machinery to provide effective protection against unlawful discrimination. It applies mainly in the spheres of labour relations, State administration and the provision of services.', '70. Section 9 provides for a shifting burden of proof in discrimination cases. Under that section, where the claimant has proved facts from which an inference that there has been discriminatory treatment might be drawn, it is incumbent on the defendant to prove that there has been no violation of the right to equal treatment. The Act also provides for the creation of a Commission for Protection against Discrimination with jurisdiction, inter alia, to hear individual complaints.', '71. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials were adopted on 7 September 1990 by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders.', '72. Paragraph 9 provides:', '“Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.”', '73. According to other provisions of the Principles, law enforcement officials shall “act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence and the legitimate objective to be achieved” (paragraph 5). Also, “Governments shall ensure that arbitrary or abusive use of force and firearms by law enforcement officials is punished as a criminal offence under their law” (paragraph 7). National rules and regulations on the use of firearms should “ensure that firearms are used only in appropriate circumstances and in a manner likely to decrease the risk of unnecessary harm”.', '74. Paragraph 23 of the Principles states that victims or their family should have access to an independent process, “including a judicial process”. Further, paragraph 24 provides:', '“Governments and law enforcement agencies shall ensure that superior officers are held responsible if they know, or should have known, that law enforcement officials under their command are resorting, or have resorted, to the unlawful use of force and firearms, and they did not take all measures in their power to prevent, suppress or report such use.”', '75. The United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions, adopted on 24 May 1989 by the Economic and Social Council in Resolution 1989/65, provide, inter alia, that there shall be a thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions and that the investigation should aim at, inter alia, determining “any pattern or practice which may have brought about” the death.', 'Paragraph 11 states:', '“In cases in which the established investigative procedures are inadequate because of a lack of expertise or impartiality, because of the importance of the matter or because of the apparent existence of a pattern of abuse, and in cases where there are complaints from the family of the victim about these inadequacies or other substantial reasons, Governments shall pursue investigations through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure. Members of such a commission shall be chosen for their recognised impartiality, competence and independence as individuals. In particular, they shall be independent of any institution, agency or person that may be the subject of the inquiry. The commission shall have the authority to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry and shall conduct the inquiry as provided in these Principles.”', 'Paragraph 17 states:', '“A written report shall be made within a reasonable time on the methods and findings of such investigations. The report shall be made public immediately and shall include the scope of the inquiry, procedures, methods used to evaluate evidence as well as conclusions and recommendations based on findings of fact and on applicable law...”', '76. The relevant parts of Article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, ratified by Bulgaria in 1966, in force since 1969 and published in the Official Gazette in 1992, provide:', '“States Parties ... undertake to adopt immediate and positive measures designed to eradicate all incitement to, or acts of, [racial] discrimination and, to this end ...', '(a) Shall declare an offence punishable by law ... all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin ...”', ""77. In its views of 16 March 1993 in Communication no. 4/91, L.K. v. the Netherlands, which concerned racist threats uttered by private individuals against Mr L.K. and the inadequate reaction by the authorities to the victim's complaint, the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination stated, inter alia, that it was incumbent on the State to investigate with due diligence and expedition cases of incitement to racist discrimination and violence."", ""78. The relevant part of Article 6 of the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, in force in Bulgaria since 1999, provides:"", '“The Parties undertake to take appropriate measures to protect persons who may be subject to threats or acts of discrimination, hostility or violence as a result of their ethnic, cultural, linguistic or religious identity.”', '79. In its decision of 21 November 2002, the United Nations Committee Against Torture (“the CAT”), examining Complaint no. 161/2000 submitted by Hajrizi Dzemajl and others against Yugoslavia, found that a mob action by non-Roma residents of Danilovgrad, Montenegro, who destroyed a Roma settlement on 14 April 1995 in the presence of police officers, was “committed with a significant level of racial motivation”. That fact aggravated the violation of Article 16 § 1 of the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment found in the case. In assessing the evidence, the CAT noted that it had not received a written explanation from the State Party concerned and decided to rely on “the detailed submissions made by the complainants”.', '80. European Union Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation, provide, in Article 8 and Article 10 respectively:', '“1. Member States shall take such measures as are necessary, in accordance with their national judicial systems, to ensure that, when persons who consider themselves wronged because the principle of equal treatment has not been applied to them establish, before a court or other competent authority, facts from which it may be presumed that there has been direct or indirect discrimination, it shall be for the respondent to prove that there has been no breach of the principle of equal treatment.', '2. Paragraph 1 shall not prevent Member States from introducing rules of evidence which are more favourable to plaintiffs.', '3. Paragraph 1 shall not apply to criminal procedures.', '...', '5. Member States need not apply paragraph 1 to proceedings in which it is for the court or competent body to investigate the facts of the case.”', '81. In 2002 the European Commission published a Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia, Article 8 of which includes, among measures to be implemented by member States in that area, action to ensure that in criminal law racial motivation is taken into consideration as an aggravating circumstance.', '82. In April 2005 the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia published a comparative overview of racist violence and responses to it in fifteen of the member States of the European Union. It noted, inter alia, that traditionally the criminal law in most of the jurisdictions surveyed did not specifically refer to “racist violence”, the focus not being on the motivation behind acts of violence. However, that tradition was slowly changing as laws began to recognise that crime could be “racially motivated”. In particular, racist motivation was increasingly being considered as an aggravating factor for sentencing purposes under the legislation of some member States. The relevant legislation in the following countries specifically provided for that possibility: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. In particular, Article 132-76 of the French Criminal Code, which was introduced in February 2003, provides in its second paragraph for an “objective” definition of racism as an aggravating circumstance leading to an increase in sentence:', ""“The penalties incurred for a crime or major offence shall be increased where the offence is committed on account of the victim's actual or supposed membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion."", 'The aggravating circumstance defined in the first paragraph is constituted where the offence is preceded, accompanied or followed by written or spoken comments, images, objects or acts of any kind which damage the honour or consideration of the victim or of a group of persons to which the victim belongs on account of their actual or supposed membership or non-membership of a particular ethnic group, nation, race or religion.”']","['14', '2']",[],[],"['14', '2']",[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Tököl.', ""6. In 1999 the applicant was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for armed robbery by the Rimini Court in Italy. (The European Court of Human Rights subsequently held that the unfairness of the underlying proceedings gave rise to a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention by the Italian authorities and awarded the applicant just satisfaction: Somogyi v. Italy, no. 67972/01, ECHR 2004IV). The end date of this sentence was 28 December 2007."", '7. On 19 May 2003 the applicant was transferred to Hungary. On 20 October 2003 the Budapest Regional Court in Hungary held that he was to serve the remainder of his sentence under a strict regime in a Hungarian prison (fegyház) and that he could be released on parole after serving four-fifths of the term, i.e. on 23 May 2006.', ""8. The applicant appealed. On 16 February 2006 the Attorney General's Office intervened in the case, filing a motion for remedy in support of the applicant. The Office argued that the service of the applicant's sentence under a strict regime constituted an undue aggravation of his penal situation, in breach of Article 11 of the Transfer Convention, which entailed that he could be released on probation only belatedly."", ""9. On 14 March 2006 the Supreme Court quashed the Regional Court's decisions concerning the regime of the applicant's transferred sentence and his conditional release, holding that they were unlawful. It held that the best approximation of the Italian sentence in Hungarian law was to have imposed a medium regime (börtön) on the applicant for the remainder of his prison term, release on parole then being possible after having served three-quarters of the sentence."", '10. On 17 March 2006 the applicant was released.', ""11. Subsequently, the applicant brought an official liability action against the Regional Court. He claimed compensation for the fact that, because of that court's wrong reconciliation of the Italian and Hungarian penitentiary rules, he had been released on parole only on 17 March 2006, whereas under the medium regime he could have already been released in November 2005. He also sought damages for having erroneously spent two years and five months in a strict-regime prison."", ""12. After divergent decisions, on 15 May 2008 the Supreme Court finally dismissed the action. Concerning the belated release, it held that, although the Regional Court's interpretation of the law had been overruled, there was no indication that it had carried out the complex task of reconciling the inconsistent Italian and Hungarian rules with gross negligence giving rise to tort liability. As to the period wrongly spent in a strict-regime prison, it noted that the applicant had not substantiated that he had sustained any actual damage."", ""13. From 1994 onwards, criminal proceedings were conducted against the applicant in Hungary for the abuse of firearms. On 6 February 2004 the Buda Central District Court sentenced him to four months' suspended imprisonment. The court observed that unlicensed firearms had been found in the applicant's car and, in so doing, it relied on the testimony of several witnesses. It took into account the extreme protraction of the case since 1994 as a crucial mitigating circumstance entailing a suspended sentence."", ""14. On 12 May 2005 the Budapest Regional Court upheld this judgment. On 15 November 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant's petition for review."", '15.

The applicants were born in 1981, 1979 and 1959 respectively and live in Harmanli.', '7. The first two applicants are the sons, and the third applicant is the widow, of Mr Todor Dimov Todorov (alias Chakara), who died on 10 or 11 December 2003 in the course of a police operation for his arrest.', '8. Between 1973 and 2001 Mr Todorov, born in 1955, was convicted six times of various offences. In 1973 he was convicted of inflicting bodily harm of medium severity. In 1974 he was convicted of forming a group intending to engage in sabotage, of trying to cross the border illegally, of stealing public and private property and a motor vehicle, and of unlawfully possessing firearms and ammunition. In 1983 he was convicted of inflicting minor bodily injury on an official in connection with the performance of the latter’s duties. In the same year he was convicted of stealing fiftythree lambs. In 1990 he was convicted of trying unlawfully to export valuables. In 1998 he was convicted of stealing two lambs and unlawfully possessing firearms.', '9. On 5 July 2001 Mr Todorov was convicted of systematically letting out his house for lewd acts, and sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. The conviction and sentence became final on 21 October 2003.', '10. On an unspecified date in November 2003 the Harmanli police were notified of that latest conviction and sentence, and dispatched two officers to arrest Mr Todorov with a view to sending him to prison to serve the sentence. The officers went to his house in Harmanli, informed him that he was due to be imprisoned, and asked him to come with them. Mr Todorov, visibly calm, asked the officers to wait for a few minutes, so that he could prepare his luggage. The officers waited for about ten minutes outside the house. When they went in to arrest Mr Todorov, they saw that he had fled. After that they went back to the police station and reported the incident to the head of the Harmanli police and to the Harmanli District Prosecutor’s Office.', '11. The account of the circumstances surrounding Mr Todorov’s death is based on the findings of the investigation carried out by the military prosecuting and investigating authorities (see paragraphs 3043 below).', '12. In early December 2003 the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor’s Office ordered the police to carry out a series of operations for the arrest of individuals with final convictions and sentences. As a result, in the morning of 10 December 2003 the head of the Harmanli Regional Police Department assembled three groups of officers to arrest Mr Todorov. The first group had to check his house in Harmanli, the second had to check the sheep pen of an associate of his, and the third had to check Mr Todorov’s country house, situated near Harmanli. All three groups were armed with their service pistols. They were told that Mr Todorov might try to escape or put up armed resistance, and instructed to use their weapons only as provided for by law.', '13. At about 7.15 a.m. the three groups set out to carry out their respective tasks. The first and the second group were unable to find Mr Todorov. The third group, which consisted of three officers, two of whom were in uniform (one wearing a bulletproof vest) and one in plain clothes, arrived near Mr Todorov’s country house at about 7.25 a.m. The house was surrounded by service buildings. All of those were erected on uneven terrain sloping steeply from the north-west to the south-east. The officers stopped their car in front of the gate, close to which they saw a big pile of used car tyres. They noticed that the gate was closed and started to whistle and shout. Several dogs in the yard started barking and Mr Todorov’s mother came out of one of the service buildings. One of the officers presented himself and told her that they were looking for her son. Then she opened the gate and held the dogs back. The officers moved towards the house, the one with the bulletproof vest walking in front, and went through another gate between several service buildings. At that point they spotted Mr Todorov on the steps outside the house, carrying an unidentified weapon. He also saw them, waved to them to go away and fired a shot, apparently in their direction. Two of the officers hid behind the service buildings and one behind some building materials scattered around the yard. He then ran back to the car and radioed the headquarters in Harmanli about the incident. At about 7.30 or 7.45 the head of the three officers ordered them to remain where they were and not to take further action.', '14. Shortly after that the head of Harmanli Regional Police Department directed all police teams in the town towards Mr Todorov’s country house and requested assistance from the police in two neighbouring towns, Haskovo and Svilengrad. The Haskovo police dispatched an emergency response team consisting of six officers, and the Svilengrad police sent eight officers divided into two teams. The head of the Svilengrad police also went to the scene of the incident.', '15. At about 9 a.m. the Harmanli police, some of whom had armed themselves with long barrel weapons, surrounded the house and cut off all access points, waiting for the emergency response team from Haskovo to arrive. It seems that Mr Todorov fired several shots at them, with one of the bullets hitting the mudguard of a police car. The police did not fire back.', '16. Shortly after that the Haskovo team arrived and positioned themselves around the house. The head of the team informed the Minister of Internal Affairs of the situation. The Minister decided to dispatch the special antiterrorism squad and psychologists of the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Psychology Institute. The Svilengrad police also arrived a few minutes later. Most of them took up position around the house. A fire engine also came to the scene.', '17. The head of the Haskovo team decided to try to establish contact with Mr Todorov through relatives of his. At about 9.30 a.m. Mr Todorov’s sister was called in and asked to help the police. At the same time Mr Todorov’s elder son (the first applicant) also arrived. He offered to take his father a mobile phone so that he could communicate more easily with the police. The head of the Haskovo police team refused, apparently for fear that the first applicant might be taken hostage by Mr Todorov. Some time after that the two officers hiding behind the service buildings managed to get out of the yard with the help of Mr Todorov’s mother.', '18. At about 11 a.m. Mr Todorov’s sister approached the house and brought her mother out. She spotted Mr Todorov, who waved at her. She understood the gesture to mean that he wished to talk to somebody on the phone, and asked the police to allow her to take a mobile phone or a megaphone to Mr Todorov. Her request was turned down with the explanation that the police were waiting for psychologists, who would try to establish contact with Mr Todorov, to arrive.', '19. Shortly after that two psychologists of the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Psychology Institute arrived. They started gathering information about Mr Todorov’s personal history, character and relations with his family, in order to decide whether his relatives might be able to exert a positive influence on him. The first applicant again asked for permission to take his father a mobile phone, but his request was turned down due to security concerns.', '20. Shortly after that the special antiterrorism squad arrived. They gathered information about the internal structure of the house from Mr Todorov’s relatives, with a view to determining safe ways of approaching the house.', '21. Around 11.30 a.m. the psychologists tried to make contact with Mr Todorov from a height situated at about one hundred metres from the house, using a megaphone. As communication from such a distance was difficult, at the suggestion of the first applicant they advanced to twentyfive or thirty metres from the house. They tried to persuade Mr Todorov to surrender. He requested to speak with his mother and his sister, but his request was denied. He then apparently said that if anyone was to get hurt, it would be him. As the psychologists believed that the first applicant would be able to exert a positive influence on Mr Todorov, they tried to continue the negotiations with his participation until 2.30 p.m. As Mr Todorov did not reply for about forty minutes, they gave up. According to the first applicant, the reason for the discontinuation of the negotiations was the fact that the megaphone’s battery had run out.', '22. Around 3.30 p.m. the police decided to attack the house, because they believed that Mr Todorov had prepared a secret escape route and might try to flee. The head of the anti-terrorism squad split his men into two groups. The first, consisting of six officers, was to attack from the northwest, from high ground, and the second from the service buildings. The first group was moving in a column, with the first officer carrying a protective shield. They fired about thirty smoke bombs at the house, with a view to forcing Mr Todorov out of it. However, as the windows and the doors were covered with linoleum, cardboard and blankets, most of the smoke bombs failed to penetrate. Mr Todorov started firing at the first group, and this forced them to take cover in a ditch. The head of the squad ordered the second group to fire at the house to divert Mr Todorov’s attention and Mr Todorov fired back at them. The skirmish lasted for about an hour, after which both groups of officers retreated. At about 5 p.m. the Haskovo police, who were hiding behind the pile of tyres, were also ordered to retreat to a safe distance.', '23. After that the police tried to resume the negotiations. A group of officers and the first applicant advanced to about ten or fifteen metres from the house and invited Mr Todorov to continue negotiating. He did not reply and the police gave the megaphone to the first applicant, who called upon his father to surrender. Again, there was no reply. At that point the police saw that as a result of the earlier attack a room on the first floor of the house had caught fire. The psychologists and the first applicant then retreated. The first applicant shouted towards the house “Father, please come out unarmed and surrender, so that this whole episode can be over”, but his supplication went unanswered.', '24. At about 6 p.m. the head of the antiterrorism squad ordered his men to blow up holes in the walls of the house. They used stunt grenades. According to his later statements, this led to explosions and a short skirmish. According to the first applicant, after 5 p.m. Mr Todorov did not talk or shoot back at the police, or react to their attacks in any other way.', '25. After that the head of the antiterrorist squad informed the Minister of Internal Affairs about the latest developments. The Minister called a halt to all actions pending the arrival of the Secretary General of the Ministry, general B.B., on the spot. In the meantime, police vehicles were placed on a height facing the house, so as to shed light on the scene with their headlights.', '26. The Secretary General arrived at about 8.30 or 9 p.m. and took command of the operation. He ordered the police to blow a hole in the walls of the house. The police carried out the order. According to a later statement by the Secretary General, after the first explosion there was a second one, coming from the upper levels. As a result, the roof caught fire and quickly burned down. Apparently several unsuccessful attempts were then made to enter the house, but it is unclear in what exactly they consisted. Meanwhile, an individual who had worked on the house and who had heard about the incident on the radio came to the police and told them that Mr Todorov had warned him that the house was booby-trapped.', '27. Around 10 p.m., on the orders of the Secretary General, a border police unit was called in to monitor the house and its surroundings with nightvision devices. The monitoring continued until the next morning.', '28. Later, following a discussion with other senior officers, the Secretary General ordered the police to use a rocket propelled grenade launcher, in order to diffuse any possible booby traps and speed up the search of the house. The launcher was brought at about 1.30 a.m. on 11 December 2003, and given to the antiterrorism squad. Between 2 and 2.30 a.m. an officer of the squad fired fifteen rocket propelled grenades at the lower parts of the house and a room on the first floor, which made a big breach in the wall. It was decided to await daylight to attack.', '29. Around 6 or 7 a.m. the police formed a thick cordon around the house. They started entering the house and checking the ground and the first floor. When they reached the attic floor, using a fireladder, they saw the legs of Mr Todorov’s charred body. The operation was then terminated, the house was sealed off, and the incident was reported to the military prosecuting authorities.', '30. The same day, 11 December 2003, the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office opened an investigation into the above events. An investigator carried out an inspection of the scene of the incident and took photographs.', '31. The next day, 12 December 2003, a doctor from the forensic ward of the Haskovo hospital performed an autopsy on Mr Todorov’s body. He noted the following:', '“The body is split in two and the vertebral column is severed at the fifth or the sixth vertebra. The body is as a whole charred. The configuration of the skull is intact. The hair is missing. There are remains of charred soft tissue on the calvaria and the face. The lower jaw is broken at the level of the right ramus mandibulae, with broken fragments and teeth. The skull bones are crumbly, charred. The configuration of the brain is intact, as if it has been parched. The brain tissue is not damaged and there are no haematomas in the cranial cavity. The skin at the neck is charred. Part of it, near the trachea and right part of the neck, is missing, which allows one to see the charred underlying neck muscles. The upper third of the thorax is preserved, but the soft tissue is fully charred. The lungs and the heart are still connected to their holders; they have shrunk, they are parched and dry with charred surfaces and hard to cut. The surrounding tissue of the section has no visible structure. The liver, shrunk and charred, reduced in size and parched, lies beneath. The vertebral column is segmented at the level of the fifth or the sixth vertebra, and what remains of it, including the lumbar part, has charred vertebrae covered with remains of charred tissue. The remaining two thirds of the abdominal wall are missing. The pelvis, including the wings of the iliums, the ischium and the pubic bone, is broken into pieces. The symphysis is separated. Parts of the intestines, charred, and remains of fatty tissue were found inside the pelvic cavity. Limbs: the right arm is strongly flexed at the elbow joint; the bones in the joint are apart. The wrist is flexed and the fist is clenched. A safetyloop from a hand grenade was found on the third finger, between the first and the second phalanges. The skin and the muscles of the hand are charred. The palm and two thirds of the forearm of the left hand are missing, and the remains have an uneven edge and are strongly flexed at the elbow joint. The soft tissue is charred. The skin and the muscles on the entire surface of the right thigh are charred. The skin on the front surface of the knee and on the front surface of the upper two thirds of the shank is preserved. The soft tissue on the back surface of the shank is charred to the bone, and the back surface of the heel is burned. The foot is encased in a [militarytype] shoe. One can see the remains of trousers and of woollen socks. The skin and the muscles of the left leg and of the thigh are charred. The left shank has been affected in the same way as the right one, with a [militarytype] shoe and a charred sock on. There are greyish metal pellets driven into the tissue and the bones of the pelvis area. Two such pellets were taken out of the left ilium and given to the investigator. We made Xrays of the body in the autopsy room... On the images one can see ovalshaped foreign bodies with similar diameters driven into the tissue, mostly in the pelvis and the thorax. One can see a metal safetyloop attached to the third finger of the right hand. ...”', '32. In the following months the authorities interviewed all officers who had taken part in the operation: thirtynine officers from the Harmanli Regional Police Department, six officers from the Haskovo Regional Directorate of Internal Affairs, sixteen officers from the Svilengrad Regional Police Department, thirtyone officers from the special antiterrorism squad, nineteen border police officers, three psychologists from the Ministry of Internal Affairs’ Psychology Institute, and the Secretary General of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. They also interviewed the applicants and other eyewitnesses, and commissioned a number of expert reports.', '33. On 3 August 2004 the investigator in charge of the case proposed that the prosecuting authorities discontinue the investigation. On 3 September 2004 the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office agreed to the proposal. It said that the investigation had categorically established that Mr Todorov’s death had been due to the explosion of a hand grenade which he had himself detonated close to his body. No officers were responsible for that. The actions of the police had fully complied with the applicable rules and had been the only actions possible under the circumstances, in view of the resistance put up by Mr Todorov and the fact that he had fired at them.', '34. On 17 September 2004 the applicants sought judicial review of the discontinuance.', '35. On 28 September 2004 the Plovdiv Military Court, sitting in private, set the discontinuance aside and referred the case back for additional investigation. It noted that the investigation had failed to establish the exact time of Mr Todorov’s death, which had prevented the prosecuting authorities from assessing fully the lawfulness of the actions of the police, including the use of explosives, smoke bombs and a grenade launcher. It went on to say that the prosecuting authorities had failed to analyse the evidence properly and give reasons why they believed that all actions of the police had been lawful. In particular, they had failed to give any reasons why they considered that the actions of the police after 9 or 9.30 p.m. on 10 December 2003, including the firing of fifteen rocket propelled grenades, had been warranted, especially in view of the fact that the evidence showed that after that time Mr Todorov had not resisted or fired at the police. Lastly, it could not be categorically concluded that Mr Todorov’s death had been caused by a hand grenade which he had had activated himself; a number of other explosive devices had been used by the police.', '36. Accordingly, on 5 October 2004 the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office sent the case back to the investigator, instructing him to (a) ask ballistics experts to identify all explosive devices which had been used, explain their mode of operation, and express their opinion on whether the smoke bombs fired at the house had been capable of creating a concentration of gases sufficient to cause the death of Mr Todorov; (b) seek the opinion of forensic and ballistics experts on the exact time of Mr Todorov’s death, on the origin of the metal fragments found in his body, and on whether the death had resulted from a hand grenade; (c) interview again the participants in the operation and ask them why it had been deemed necessary to use a grenade launcher and other explosive devices at a time when Mr Todorov had no longer been showing any signs of resistance; (d) establish whether boobytraps had indeed been planted in or around the house; and (e) identify the officers who had caused damage to the house and ascertain whether their actions had amounted to a criminal offence. It went on to note that Mr Todorov’s heirs had not been given an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the materials in the case file, which had been a serious breach of the rules of procedure.', '37. The investigator asked several experts to draw up the reports requested by the prosecuting authorities.', '38. In a report drawn up on 11 November 2004 an expert said that no devices which could be described as boobytraps had been found in Mr Todorov’s house or yard. Two fully operational defensive hand grenades had been found inside the house.', '39. In their report, drawn up on 23 November 2004, the ballistics experts described the characteristics of the weapons and ammunition used during the operation or found on the spot (Kalashnikov assault rifle and ammunition for it, antitank rocket propelled grenades, teargas grenades, small wallblasting explosives, a defensive hand grenade), and said that the wall of the house had been demolished by the antitank rocket propelled grenades fired during the operation. They also said that from the materials in the case file it appeared that no teargas grenades had fallen inside the house, and that the concentration of any such gas in the room where Mr Todorov had been standing had not been high enough to kill him.', '40. The combined forensic and ballistics expert report, drawn up by a forensic doctor, an army weapons specialist and an expert in automatic weapons, became ready on 2 December 2004. It said that the complete charring of Mr Todorov’s body prevented a medical determination of the time of his death. The explosive device which had killed him had been very close to his body at the moment of detonation, with the result that the body had suffered the impact of all components of the explosion: the detonation, the gases, parts of the explosive, soot, parts of the device’s casing and fragments of it. Mr Todorov’s body had been destroyed and had sustained deep burns, to the point of charring, and multiple wounds from the device’s casing and filling. The metal fragments found inside the body showed that the device was a hand grenade, of the type used in the Bulgarian army, consisting of a metal casing and, underneath it, plastic shells containing 200 to 400 pellets. All of those had impacted on Mr Todorov’s body. The mechanism of the grenade and the force needed to pull its lever were such as to prevent accidental detonation, including detonation resulting from the closeby detonation of another device, which meant that Mr Todorov had been fully conscious of his actions when activating the grenade. He had thus blown himself up, as could be seen from the safetypin loop found on the third finger of his right hand. However, it was probable that the charring of his body was due to a secondary fire in the room, and had occurred after his death.', '41. On 4 January 2005 the Plovdiv Regional Military Prosecutor’s Office again decided to discontinue the investigation. It set out its findings of fact and the conclusions of the expert reports, and reasoned as follows:', '“... The initial steps taken by officers of the Harmanli Regional Police Department with a view to [Mr] Todorov’s localisation and arrest were lawful. When he used firearms against them, they duly reported that to their superiors. They, in turn, lawfully decided to use firearms as a means of last resort, in accordance with section 80(1)(1) and (1)(4) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act [1997]. As [Mr] Todorov refused to obey their order to surrender and continued to fire at them, it was lawful to bring in the antiterrorism squad. This was in line with section 157(1)(2) of the [Act] and based on a decision of the Minister of Internal Affairs. The police were confronted with an individual who had committed numerous criminal acts and had numerous convictions and who, during an operation for his arrest to enforce a sentence ..., put up armed resistance. This was established on the basis of the statements made by the officers and by [Mr] Todorov’s relatives. The fact that he fired upon the police is also confirmed by the bullet-hole in the left mudguard of [a police car] and the asbestos cement sheets placed outside the house.', 'The steps taken by the officers of the [antiterrorism] squad after their arrival were also lawful. They were faced with an urgent special operation which required fast appraisal of the situation and decisionmaking. Their decisions were taken on the basis of the situation described above. After [Mr] Todorov failed to heed the advice of his relatives and the psychologists to turn himself in, it was lawful and in line with section 159(1)(1) of the [Act] and regulations 8(3), (5) and (7) to resort to the use of pyrotechnical devices and explosives. One of the walls of the ground floor of the house was blown up with a view to storming it and making a passage to the inside. However, in view of the explanations of [the individual who had worked on the house] about booby traps in various unknown locations in and around the house and the darkness, the attack was postponed. It was only at that point that a decision was taken to use antitank grenades, in line with regulation 8(3). The purpose was to diffuse any explosive devices and clear a passage for the storming party, which was supposed to attack in the morning. As a result of the firing of those grenades, part of the ground floor of the building was destroyed. When the goal had been achieved, the firing stopped. The attack began in the early morning of 11 December 2003 in order to protect the health and the lives of the police officers. Then they found the body of [Mr] Todorov.', 'In this case, there was overt resistance by [Mr] Todorov and refusal to obey police orders. Also, before using weapons the police officers and the members of the antiterrorism squad considered the specific situation, the nature of [Mr Todorov’s] act and [his] personality. They took all necessary safety measures and discontinued the use of weapons immediately after achieving their goal – opening a breach for the storming party.', 'The actions of the officers would be criminal only if they were socially dangerous, committed with mens rea, and punishable... The lack of any of those characteristics makes their actions not criminal. By Article 12a of the Criminal Code, it is not criminal to cause damage to a person who has committed an offence in order to effect his arrest and prevent him from committing further offences, if there is no other way to carry out the arrest and if the necessary and lawful measures are not exceeded. This equally fully applies to the house used by [Mr] Todorov as a shelter. Since there was no other way of entering it, it became necessary to demolish part of it. The available evidence shows that the actions of the police were not socially dangerous, but socially necessary, and, indeed, the only ones possible under the relevant provisions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act [1997] and the regulations. Therefore, there has been no criminal offence. All exculpating circumstances under Article 12a are in place. ...', 'Moreover, under section 159(3) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act [1997], the identities of the members of the special antiterrorism squad are to be kept secret, which means that they cannot be held criminally liable.', 'The investigation categorically and unequivocally found that [Mr] Todorov’s death was due to his blowing himself up with an offensive hand grenade which he detonated close to his body. No officers are responsible for that. No other offences committed by the officers in connection with the performance of their duties were established. ...”', '42. On 25 January 2005 the applicants sought judicial review of the discontinuance. They argued that not enough evidence had been gathered on the time and the causes of Mr Todorov’s death, and that only experts in pathology would be able to give an informed opinion on those points. It was also hard to believe that Mr Todorov had blown himself up with a hand grenade. He was a righthander and the grenade safetyloop was found on a finger of his right hand, whereas it was highly unusual for someone to draw the safetyloop of a hand grenade with his strong hand and hold the grenade itself with his weak hand. The investigation had not done enough to elucidate that paradox, which was central to its conclusions. It was also incomprehensible how the experts, none of whom was a psychologist, were able to give an opinion about Mr Todorov’s state of mind before his death. No explanation was provided about the type of explosives used at 9 p.m. on 10 December 2003 to blow up the hole in the wall of the house. This seriously weakened the prosecutor’s conclusion that the metal pellets found in Mr Todorov’s body were from a hand grenade. After 5 p.m. on 10 December 2003 the police were not acting in selfdefence because Mr Todorov had not fired any shots at them after that time. They clearly overstepped the limits set by Article 12a of the Criminal Code and did not try to contact him or arrest him without using force after that time. The conclusion that a grenade launcher was needed to diffuse possible booby traps could not withstand scrutiny. No such traps were found, and it was absurd to believe that trained police officers could suppose that such traps had been laid around a house whose yard was used by Mr Todorov, his family and domestic animals. The police apparently only resorted to using a grenade launcher to speed up the operation. It was also telling that the names of the officers who ordered the use of a launcher were not mentioned in the prosecutor’s decision. Lastly, the applicants pointed out that this Court’s caselaw under Article 2 of the Convention required that there should be an effective official investigation when individuals have been killed as a result of the use of force by the police.', '43. On 8 February 2005 the Plovdiv Military Court, sitting in private, decided to uphold the discontinuance in the following terms:', '“... After fully checking the materials in the case file, the court comes to the only possible conclusion, namely, that the decision to discontinue the proceedings was correct, wellfounded and lawful.', 'The investigation was objective, all-inclusive and comprehensive. The investigating and the prosecuting authorities have taken all necessary steps to establish the truth. All circumstances surrounding the main fact – the cause of [Mr] Todorov’s death – have been examined. The authorities have not committed serious breaches of the rules of procedure. The remitting of the case for additional investigation was a major factor in that respect. The prosecutor’s conclusions are correct, wellfounded, not internally inconsistent, accurate and fully correspond to the evidence and the facts. To come to them, the prosecutor, along with an assessment of the available materials, has taken into account the constant caselaw of the Supreme Court of Cassation and academic studies of criminal law.', 'The prosecutor’s conclusion that the proceedings should be discontinued corresponds to the totality of the evidence, which has been precisely analysed and assessed. The court finds that the prosecutor was right to conclude that the police were acting in a situation falling under Article 12a [of the Criminal Code]. They were aiming to arrest an individual who had committed an offence, and who had been convicted and sentenced by means of a final decision. He refused to obey their orders and put up fierce armed resistance. His actions consisted in an attack against the police that seriously endangered their lives. This leads to the incontestable and unequivocal conclusion that the police officers were acting in pursuance of their duties and that their actions were correct, lawful and adequate in a situation which was extreme, critical and gravely dangerous for their health and lives.', 'The court fully shares the remaining conclusions of the prosecutor ... which it considers correct and accurate.', 'On that basis, the court finds that the arguments raised in the application [for judicial review] are groundless and illfounded. Firstly, the arguments ... that the ‘prosecutor’s findings about the time of death are unconvincing and solely based on the conclusions of the medical expert’s report’ ... are groundless. If the [applicants’ lawyers] had bothered to acquaint themselves with [the] evidence ..., they would not have reached those conclusions. The prosecutor’s findings about the causes and the time of [Mr] Todorov’s death were based not only on the conclusions of the medical expert’s report and the complex ballistics and medical experts’ report, but also on the statements of all eyewitnesses. The lawyers should be aware that a fact, namely the time and the causes of death, can be established through all types of evidence allowed under the rules of criminal procedure, not solely expert reports. Since the experts’ conclusion, whose accuracy the court does not doubt, is supported by an abundance of other evidence, including eyewitness statements, the court finds this fact to be unequivocally established ... For that reason, the court finds that the time and the cause of [Mr] Todorov’s death have been unequivocally established, and that this has been accurately described in the prosecutor’s decision. The court therefore finds the [applicants’] arguments in that connection unfounded and not corresponding to the evidence in the case. For the same reasons, the court finds no force in the [applicants’] arguments relating to the lack of clarity of the prosecutor’s decision about the type of expert report to be ordered by the investigator. The court reiterates that if the [applicants’ lawyers] had read the complex medical and ballistics report, they would have understood this alleged lack of clarity ...', 'The [applicants’] assertion relating to the ‘strong’ and the ‘weak’ hand of [Mr Todorov] is also groundless and lacking legal logic. The safetyloop from the detonator of a grenade, the specific dismemberment of the body in the middle (near the stomach and the groins), and the remains of a defensive grenade (pellets and fragments) in the body lead to the only possible conclusion that [Mr Todorov] blew himself up in the way described in detail by the prosecutor ... This unequivocally proves that the grenade was not thrown, as asserted by the [applicants], because if that were the case there would be no pieces of a detonated grenade on the body of [Mr] Todorov. The court finds whether [Mr] Todorov was right or lefthanded irrelevant and for this reason shall not engage in further discussion on that point.', 'The complex medical and ballistics experts’ report gave a conclusion about [Mr] Todorov’s psychological state at the time of his ‘self-detonation’, which the court finds accurate and corresponding to the evidence analysed by the experts. It is necessary to note that the ‘psychological’ state of [Mr] Todorov has been analysed and assessed by the experts in the context of the grenade’s specificity as a type of weapon, the particularities of its construction and the manner in which it needs to be handled and detonated. On that basis, the court finds no force in the [applicants’] argument concerning the mandatory participation of a psychologist in the elucidation of the above fact.', 'The [applicants’] assertion that there is no explanation about types of explosives used again shows that [their lawyers] have not acquainted themselves with all the evidence. The court finds it illfounded and unsupported by any arguments. The experts have given an accurate, clear and comprehensive description of the type and character of all types of explosives and munitions used [in the operation].', 'The court does not share the [applicants’] arguments ... concerning the alleged incorrectness of the prosecutor’s decision. The above considerations lead it to the conclusion that the police were acting in a situation which falls within the ambit of Article 12a of the Criminal Code ... It must also be observed that the [applicants’] arguments are onesided and analyse solely the lawfulness of the actions of the police without commenting on the lawfulness of the actions of [Mr] Todorov. Basing itself on the rules of objectivity and impartiality, and analysing the direct and circumstantial evidence in isolation and jointly, the court finds the [applicants’] arguments incorrect and illfounded.', 'The court fully shares the [applicants’] assertion that, in view of the requirements of the [Convention] and the criteria developed by the European Court of Human Rights in its caselaw, there must be a thorough and comprehensive investigation whenever there has been an interference with a person’s right to life during a police operation. However, the court does not share the [applicants’] view that there has been no such investigation in the present case. On the contrary, in view of what has been said above, the court finds that the investigation was objective, comprehensive and full, that the authorities have taken all necessary steps to uncover the truth, and have taken their decisions freely and after assessment of relevant facts. The prosecutor’s conclusions are correct, accurate and wellfounded, and the court fully shares them.', 'In view of above, the court ... finds that the decision to discontinue the proceedings ... has to be upheld as lawful and wellfounded.”', '44. The case file contains no information on whether at the time of his death Mr Todorov had a valid title to the house or the plot of land on which it had been erected. It does not appear that he had applied for or obtained a building permit for the house. During the investigation is was established that on 15 June 2004 the Harmanli lands commission, in proceedings brought by the first applicant (Mr Todorov’s son) under the lands restitution laws, decided to restore the plot to the heirs of an ancestor of Mr Todorov.', '45. The applicants presented a notary deed showing that on 19 May 2006 the first applicant bought from third parties a plot of land in the area where the house is situated. From certificates issued by the cadastre authorities it appears that this plot is the same on which the Mr Todorov’s house had been built.', '46. The applicants also presented a certificate of 20 January 2007 in which the building control department of the municipality of Harmanli said that the house was a tolerable building within the meaning of the building control legislation. Under that legislation, tolerable buildings are those that have not been erected pursuant to a building permit but which nonetheless comply with the applicable zoning plans and building regulations, and have either been built before a certain date or been declared to the authorities within certain timelimits. Tolerable buildings are not subject to demolition.', '47. Section 80 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997, as in force at the material time, provided, in so far as relevant:', '“(1) The police may use firearms as a means of last resort:', '1. in cases of armed attack or threat to use firearms;', '...', '3. in selfdefence [or the defence of others];', '4. after giving a warning, to arrest a person who has committed or is committing a publicly prosecutable offence, if he or she resists or tries to escape;', '...', '(2) When using firearms the police are under a duty to protect, as far as possible, the life of the person against whom they use force, and not put in danger the life and the health of others.”', '48. The wording of section 74(1)(1), (1)(3) and (2) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 2006, currently in force, repeats verbatim that of section 80(1)(1), (1)(4) and (2) of the 1997 Act.', '49. On 30 May 2012 Parliament enacted a bill amending section 74 of the 2006 Act; the amendment came into force on 1 July 2012. The words “as a means of last resort” in section 74(1) were changed to “only where absolutely necessary”, and the words “to protect, as far as possible” in section 74(2) were replaced by “do everything possible to protect”. A new subsection 5 was added to section 74, providing that “[t]he police shall discontinue the use of firearms immediately after attaining its lawful aim”, as well as a new subsection 6, providing that “[i]t shall be prohibited to use firearms to arrest or prevent the escape of a person who is about to commit or has committed a nonviolent offence if that person does not pose a danger to the life or health of another”. A new section 74a was added, providing that “[t]he planning and control of the use of physical force, auxiliary means and firearms by the police ... shall include [the taking of] measures to attain the lawful aim at minimal risk to the life and health of the citizens”. In the explanatory notes to the bill the Government had referred to, inter alia, the need to bring domestic law fully into line with the applicable international standards and the Court’s caselaw.', '50. The special antiterrorism squad was a unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs whose task was to, among other things, combat terrorism and prevent and uncover serious offences (section 156 of the 1997 Act). It could arrest or neutralise persons who had committed especially dangerous offences and who were putting up or likely to put up armed resistance (section 157(1)(2)). The squad’s intervention had to be authorised in writing by the Minister of Internal Affairs in each case (section 157(2)). Its mode of operation was governed by regulations issued by the Minister (section 157(3)).', '51. Those regulations, which were apparently not published, were issued by the Minister on 27 May 2003. Under regulation 7, when carrying out a special operation the squad had to set up an appropriate organisational structure. However, the overall control of a given operation was to be ensured by the head of the authority which had requested the use of the squad or a person designated by him or her (regulation 26(1)). The squad’s plan of action in a given operation had to be included in the plan of the requesting authority (regulation 25). In its operations the squad could use, inter alia, firearms and grenade launchers (regulation 8(3)), pyrotechnical devices and explosives (regulation 8(5)) and chemical substances (regulation 8(7)).', '52. By section 159(3) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 1997, “in the performance of the squad’s tasks, the identity of its members [was] to be kept secret”. This rule currently features in section 91(3) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Act 2006 and extends to all police officers who take part in armed police operations for the arrest of dangerous offenders who put up armed resistance. Regulation 150s of the regulations for the application of the 2006 Act repeats it with reference specifically to the members of the special antiterrorism squad.', '53. Article 12a § 1 of the Criminal Code 1968, added in August 1997, provides that causing harm to a person while arresting him or her for an offence is not criminal where no other means of effecting the arrest exist and the force used is necessary and lawful. According to Article 12a § 2, the force used is not necessary when it is manifestly disproportionate to the nature of the offence committed by the person to be arrested or the resulting harm is in itself excessive and unnecessary.', '54. Under Article 237 § 1 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1974, public prosecutors were to discontinue a preliminary investigation if they found that, inter alia, the acts alleged did not constitute an offence. Article 237 §§ 3 and 4, as in force at the material time, provided that the decision to discontinue a preliminary investigation was reviewable by a firstinstance court whose decision was final.', '55. Section 1 of the State Responsibility for Damage Caused to Citizens Act 1988 (Закон за отговорността на държавата за вреди, причинени на граждани), in July 2006 renamed the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (Закон за отговорността на държавата и общините за вреди – “the 1988 Act”), provides that the State is liable for damage suffered by individuals (and since 1 January 2006 also legal persons) as a result of unlawful decisions, actions or omissions by civil servants, committed in the course of or in connection with the performance of their duties.', '56. The general rules of the law of tort are set out in sections 45 to 54 of the Obligations and Contracts Act 1951 (Закон за задълженията и договорите – “the 1951 Act”). Section 45(1) provides that everyone is obliged to make good the damage which they have, through their fault, caused to another. Section 49 provides that a person who has entrusted another with carrying out a job is liable for the damage caused by that other person in the course of or in connection with the performance of the job. Legal persons cannot incur liability under section 45(1), as they cannot act with mens rea. They may, however, be vicariously liable under section 49 for the tortious conduct of individuals employed by them (пост. № 7 от 30 декември 1959 г., ВС, Пленум). One of the prerequisites of the liability under sections 45 to 50 of the 1951 Act is wrongfulness of the impugned conduct (реш. № 567 от 24 ноември 1997 г. по гр. д. № 775/1996 г., ВС, петчленен състав). The Bulgarian courts have on occasion examined claims against the authorities under section 49 (see the domestic cases cited in First Sofia Commodities EOOD and Paragh v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 14397/04, § 17, 25 January 2011).']",['2'],['2-1'],[],[],[],[],1

On the night of 23 April 1992 the applicant went to a doctor, asking him to come to the aid of J.C. He alleged that the latter had been seriously battered by unknown persons. J.C., who suffered serious injuries to his head, was immediately taken to hospital. His life was saved. On 21 May 1992 the Białystok Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Wojewódzki) charged the applicant with aggravated theft, armed robbery and attempted homicide, and detained him on remand in view of the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature. The investigation was completed on 12 August 1992.', '8. Shortly after that date, the applicant asked for an order referring the case for a further investigation. In particular, he asked for evidence to be obtained from certain witnesses. The prosecutor dismissed his request for witnesses to be called but ordered that an expert report be obtained from psychiatrists in order to ascertain the applicant’s mental state.', '9. On 12 October 1992 the Białystok Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Białystok Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki). The applicant was indicted on charges of attempted homicide, armed robbery and aggravated theft.', '10. From October 1992 until the end of 1993 the applicant, who was at the material time detained in Białystok Remand Centre, was on hunger strike. On 26 October 1992 he apparently intentionally injured his left hand.', '11. On 1 September 1993 the Białystok Regional Court rejected the applicant’s request for release made on an unknown date. The court held that the reasons originally given for his detention, that is to say, the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and the serious nature of those offences, were still valid. On the other hand, the court found no reason to release the applicant on health grounds or on any of the grounds listed in Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see also paragraph 60 in fine below) because it considered that the applicant’s continued hunger strike was aimed at compelling the court to make a “favourable decision” on his detention.', '12. On 9 December 1993 the applicant was admitted to the hospital of the Faculty of Gastrology of the Białystok Academy of Medicine. He received treatment until 17 December 1993. An entry in the relevant medical record made on 17 December 1993 read, in so far as relevant:', '“[the applicant] was admitted to our hospital in a state of extreme exhaustion..., he complained about general weakness, pain in his chest and heart palpitations. Subsequent tests showed that there was an extremely low level of haemoglobin in his blood ... [4.1% and 6.7% according to the tests] ... resulting from a chronic deficiency of iron and vitamins. During the treatment he was given two transfusions and iron compounds were administered ... as a result his condition improved ... Recommendations: good food and further treatment. From the medical point of view, he should not now be kept in prison.”', '13. On 17 December 1993 the applicant was taken to and redetained in Barczewo Prison. He was placed in a ward for internal diseases, where he remained until 24 December 1993. He was diagnosed as having anaemia and gastritis. Since the applicant had not consented to any further medical tests and had refused to take medicaments, he was again placed in a prison ward.', '14. In the meantime, the trial court had listed hearings for 27 November 1992, 20 January, 2 June and 24 September 1993 but had cancelled all of them on the ground that the applicant had been on hunger strike. On 1 December 1993 the trial was adjourned because the applicant had refused to leave his cell.', '15. On 4 January 1994 the applicant wrote a letter to the Minister of Justice, requesting that he release him in view of the very bad state of his health. That letter was deemed to be an application for release under Article 214 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, referred to the Białystok Regional Court and dismissed by that court on 31 January 1994. The court found that the applicant’s detention should continue because there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the serious offences with which he had been charged. The court agreed that from the medical point of view the applicant should not be kept in prison. It stressed, however, that his poor health resulted from his behaviour, especially his hunger strike, and therefore refused to release him.', '16. On 14 February 1994, on an appeal by the applicant, the Białystok Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) upheld that decision and the grounds given for it.', '17. On 13 March 1994 the applicant inserted several pieces of metal into his right eye. On 20 and 27 March 1994 he inserted pieces of metal into his left eye. On 23 March 1994 he was examined by a psychiatrist who concluded that those acts of self-harm were a form of his protest against the prolongation of the criminal proceedings against him and his detention. Later, the applicant was placed in an ophthalmic ward of Bytom Prison Hospital where he received treatment from 25 April to 23 June 1994. After that treatment, three pieces of metal were left in the applicant’s eyes.', '18. On 29 April 1994 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed a subsequent application for release, originally addressed by the applicant to the State Council of Judiciary (Krajowa Rada Sądownictwa) and referred by the Council to the trial court. The court considered that the applicant should be held in detention for the following reasons:', '“... In the light of documentary evidence, it is beyond any dispute that the state of [the applicant’s] health is not the best one. However, he himself is responsible for that because he has brought himself [to this state] by his several-week long hunger-strikes, acts of self-harm and his further refusal to undergo medical treatment. ...', 'The court cannot lift the detention order because of the nature of the offences charged, the serious social danger created by them and the fact that [the applicant] is tried as a recidivist within the meaning of Article 60 § 1 of the Criminal Code, militate against it.', 'It must, however, be noted that the state of [the applicant’s] health, although not a good one, does not constitute a danger to his life within the meaning of Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure because he is under medical care and [his condition] has resulted from his own acts. ...”', '19. On an unknown date in June 1994 the applicant again asked the Białystok Regional Court to release him on health grounds. The application was dismissed on 29 June 1994. On 15 July 1994 the applicant made a further application for release, submitting that, in the meantime, he had received a letter from a civil hospital in Katowice confirming that he could be admitted to that hospital in order to undergo ophthalmic treatment. The application was dismissed at first instance on 15 July 1994 and, on appeal, by the Białystok Court of Appeal, on 11 August 1994. Both courts held that there was no valid reason to release the applicant as his condition, even though serious, had been aggravated by the injuries which he had inflicted on himself. The courts also relied on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature.', '20. On 31 August 1994 the applicant asked the Białystok Regional Court to obtain evidence from an expert in ophthalmology. He maintained that he was suffering from an unbearably severe pain in his eyes. The court referred the matter to the authorities of Białystok Remand Centre. On 28 September 1994 the Deputy Governor dealt with that application and refused to call an ophthalmologist on the grounds that in the opinion of the doctors who had previously examined the applicant there had been no need to treat him in a civil hospital and that the Chief Prison Doctor of Białystok Region did not consider it appropriate to call such an expert.', '21. On 5 October 1994 a hearing was to take place but was cancelled since, in the meantime, the applicant had inflicted certain unspecified injuries on himself. On 22 November 1994 the Regional Court cancelled the next hearing because the applicant, when leaving his cell had injured himself by hitting his head against a wall. He was then taken to Białystok Hospital and examined by a neurologist.', '22. On 5 December 1994 the court adjourned the trial hearing because it found that the applicant had again inflicted injuries on himself (he had injected saliva into his leg and had an abscess and boil on his knee).', '23. On 17 January 1995 the trial was adjourned because the applicant had taken an overdose of an unspecified medicine.', '24. From 17 to 22 February 1995 the applicant received treatment in Barczewo Prison Hospital. In view of that, the court cancelled a hearing listed for 21 February 1995.', '25. Subsequently, on an unknown date, the applicant swallowed two metal rods and three pieces of wire. He did not consent to undergo an operation in the prison hospital. Since he was not fit to be brought to trial, the court cancelled a hearing fixed for 27 April 1995.', '26. On 28 April 1995 the court asked the Governor of Barczewo Prison about the applicant’s health and when the applicant would be transferred to Białystok Remand Centre. On 10 May 1995 the Director of Barczewo Prison Hospital replied that the applicant had repeatedly inflicted injuries on himself (that is to say, he had swallowed pieces of metal) and had refused to undergo an operation. It was therefore impossible for the prison services to transfer him to Białystok Remand Centre (Białystok is some 150 kilometres distant from Barczewo).', '27. On 6 June 1995 the trial court again asked the authorities of Barczewo Prison about the state of the applicant’s health. The Director of Barczewo Prison Hospital replied on 23 June that the applicant should stay in the hospital because he had pieces of metal both in his eyes and in his alimentary canal.', '28. Later, the Białystok Regional Court asked the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy) to transfer the applicant’s case to another regional court, a court closer to the prison in which the applicant was being held in custody. The Supreme Court rejected that request on 17 August 1995.', '29. On 5 September 1995 the Deputy Governor of Barczewo Prison informed the Regional Court that the applicant was still unfit for a transfer because he had again swallowed a piece of metal.', '30. On 25 October 1995 the court asked the authorities of Barczewo Prison about the state of the applicant’s health. The Director of Barczewo Prison Hospital replied on 20 November 1995 that the applicant did not have to undergo on operation on his eyes but that it was recommended that he undergo an operation on his stomach.', '31. On 24 November 1995 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed a subsequent application for release made by the applicant on an unspecified date. In its decision, the court relied on the reasonable suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature. Finding that there were no special circumstances that might justify releasing him on health grounds, the court also took into account a medical certificate which stated that the applicant could receive medical treatment in prison.', '32. In the meantime, at the beginning of November 1995, the applicant had complained to the prison authorities about various ailments, in particular a cyst in his kidney and urinary problems. Several ultrasound examinations carried out at that time showed that the applicant had a cyst of a diameter of twenty millimetres in his kidney. He refused to undergo a kidney operation in the urological ward of Łódź Prison Hospital and requested to be released so as to enable him to receive medical treatment in a civil hospital.', '33. On 15 December 1995 the Białystok Regional Court asked the Governor of Barczewo Prison whether the applicant could be transferred to Białystok Remand Centre. The Governor replied on 15 February 1996. He stated that prison doctors considered that the applicant was unfit for a transfer.', '34. On 20 December 1995 the applicant made an application for release to the Supreme Court.', '35. On 29 December 1995 the Białystok Regional Court decided to apply to the Supreme Court for the applicant’s detention on remand to be prolonged until 30 December 1996. That application was made in view of the fact that an amendment to Article 222 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (setting maximum statutory time-limits for detention on remand) was to take effect on 1 January 1996 (see paragraph 61 below) and at the time the applicant’s detention had already exceeded the relevant time-limit. In that application, the court relied on the following, principal reasons:', '“The trial was set for 27 November 1992 but it did not take place because the accused went on hunger strike for several months. When the accused finished his hunger strike, he deliberately inflicted injuries on himself in order to compel [the court] to make a favourable decision to vary the preventive measure imposed on him. ...', 'That made it impossible for that court to continue, or even to start, the trial. In view of the state of his health, a state resulting from his own behaviour, [the applicant] was on several occasions examined by doctors of various specialities and was admitted to hospital for several months. It did not (and does not) emerge from the expert opinions that his state would endanger his life or health, especially as [the applicant] is under permanent medical care. At present, he is held in Barczewo Prison Hospital.', 'For these reasons the application for his detention to be prolonged is justified. His detention should be prolonged until 30 December 1996 because, given his acts of self-harm, it is not known when the accused will be brought to trial.”', 'Since the relevant amendment did not come into force until 4 August 1996, that application was never lodged with the Supreme Court.', '36. On 30 December 1995 the Supreme Court transferred the applicant’s application for release of 20 December 1995 to the Białystok Regional Court. On 15 January 1996 the President of the Białystok Regional Court transferred it to the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of that court.', '37. On 19 January 1996 the panel of three judges, sitting as the Białystok Regional Court dismissed that application, holding that there were no circumstances concerning the applicant’s health which might militate in favour of his release and that the bad state of his health had been caused entirely by his own conduct. The court considered that the applicant wanted to compel it to “make a favourable decision on his detention” and that the “impossibility of bringing him to trial had diminished the chances of resolving his complaints”.', '38. In the meantime, on an unknown date, the applicant had complained to the Supreme Court about the length of his detention, which had already exceeded three years. On 25 January 1996 his complaint was referred to the Białystok Court of Appeal. On 8 February 1996 the Vice President of that court replied to the complaint. He stated that hearings in the applicant’s case had been cancelled five times because the applicant had gone on hunger strike and then on the ground that he had inflicted injuries on himself. He also stressed that there had been no indication that the applicant should have been released on health grounds because he was, and had been, under medical care in prison.', '39. On 8 March 1996 the court asked the authorities of Barczewo Prison about the applicant’s health. The Director of Barczewo Prison Hospital replied on 19 March 1996. He stated that the applicant had some of the metal objects he had swallowed in his stomach but he had refused to undergo an operation in the prison hospital. In the Director’s opinion, the applicant was fit to participate in his trial but unfit to be transferred to Białystok.', '40. Later, the applicant asked the Białystok Regional Court to release him in view of his state of health. That application was dismissed on 29 March 1996. The applicant appealed against the refusal, arguing that his detention on remand had meanwhile exceeded four years and that his state of health was desperately bad.', '41. On 19 April 1996 the Białystok Court of Appeal dismissed that appeal, finding that even though the applicant had been held in custody for nearly four years, the prolongation of his detention had been attributable to his behaviour alone. The court considered that the grounds originally given for his detention were still valid. It pointed out that the further course of the proceedings exclusively depended on the applicant’s behaviour. It suggested that a change in the applicant’s attitude would result in the immediate examination of his case and that such a change might in turn have resulted in the court’s “altering its view on whether the detention should be continued”.', '42. On 24 April 1996 the court asked the authorities of Barczewo Prison whether the applicant could be transferred to Białystok. On 8 May 1996 the Director of Barczewo Prison Hospital informed the court of, inter alia, the following:', '“... [the applicant] repeatedly inflicts injuries on himself. The last instance of such behaviour took place on 7 February 1996. For that reason, he is unfit for a transfer. He can participate in his trial.”', '43. On an unknown date in May or June 1996 the applicant made a subsequent application for release. On 11 June 1996 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed it in view of the high probability that he had committed the offences with which he had been charged and their serious nature. The court also found no circumstances militating in favour of releasing the applicant on health grounds, as defined in Article 218 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In that context, it pointed out that the applicant’s health depended on himself, especially as its current state had resulted from his hunger strike and self-inflicted injuries. Finally, the court stressed that it emerged from medical evidence that his continued detention did not constitute a danger to his life or health.', '44. On 10 July 1996 the court asked the authorities of Barczewo Prison whether the applicant could be transferred to Białystok Remand Centre. They replied on 16 July 1996, stating that the applicant had refused to undergo an operation on his stomach. It was recommended that he be detained in a prison hospital ward. No obstacles to transferring the applicant to Białystok were mentioned.', '45. On 6 August 1996 the Białystok Regional Court requested the Supreme Court to prolong the applicant’s detention on remand until 30 July 1997 in view of the fact that he had attempted to obstruct the proper conduct of the proceedings. The court also stated:', '“... detention should be prolonged until 30 July 1997 ... since the accused has inflicted injuries on himself and therefore, it is not known when he will be fit to be brought to trial.”', '46. On 5 September 1996 the Supreme Court, sitting in camera, prolonged the applicant’s detention until 1 March 1997, finding that the applicant had in an exceptional manner obstructed the proper conduct of the proceedings and had intentionally contributed to their length. The court also held that it was not necessary to prolong his detention until 30 July 1997 and that by 1 March 1997 the Regional Court should be able to order an additional medical examination of the applicant, to list hearings and to give judgment. On 18 September 1996 a copy of the decision of the Supreme Court was served on the applicant.', '47. On 13 September 1996 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice about the length of his detention and the conduct of the proceedings in his case. This complaint was transferred to the Białystok Regional Court and, on 3 October 1996, the President of that court replied to it. He found that there had been no irregularities in the conduct of the proceedings. He stated that all the twelve hearings listed in the period from 27 November 1992 to 27 April 1995 had been cancelled because the applicant had inflicted injuries on himself.', '48. On an unknown date – apparently in September 1996 – the applicant again requested his release on health grounds. On 24 September 1996 the Białystok Regional Court dismissed his application, holding that there was a reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question and that the need to ensure the proper conduct of the proceedings militated against his release. The court also held that there was no reason to release the applicant on health grounds because the ailments from which he suffered did not constitute a danger to his life or health and had resulted from his own deliberate acts of self-harm.', '49. On 10 October 1996, on the applicant’s appeal, the Białystok Court of Appeal upheld that decision and held, inter alia:', '“It is true that the accused is sick, although most of his ailments result from self-inflicted injuries. For that reason he is under constant medical observation in prison. He also consults doctors. The prison authorities have not indicated that his condition worsened so significantly as to result in his detention in the prison hospital being a danger to him.', 'As to the second argument adduced by the accused, an argument which in reality amounts to his objection to evidence [against him], it has to be noted that the trial court has at its disposal evidence gathered by the prosecution but has been unable to scrutinise it because the accused has been obstructing the conduct of the trial. It would therefore be in the accused’s best interest to endeavour to have his case heard. ...”', '50. On 21 November 1996 the applicant was transferred to Białystok Remand Centre. On 9 December 1996 the Białystok Regional Court listed a hearing for 31 December 1996; however, that hearing was adjourned to 10 January 1997. On 24 February 1997 the trial was adjourned as most of the witnesses and the victim had failed to appear.', '51. During the hearings of 27 and 28 February 1997 the Regional Court heard evidence from witnesses and dismissed the applicant’s request for further evidence to be obtained. On 28 February 1997 the court gave judgment. It convicted the applicant of aggravated theft and attempted homicide and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment, deprivation of his civil rights for eight years and a fine of 400 Polish zlotys.', '52. The applicant appealed. Subsequently, on an unspecified date, he challenged J.D.-S. and J.Z.-L., two judges of the Białystok Court of Appeal assigned to sit on the appeal panel, submitting that both of them had previously dealt with his applications for release and that they did not, therefore, offer sufficient guarantees of impartiality. His challenge was dismissed by the Białystok Court of Appeal on 9 September 1997 as being ill-founded.', '53. On the same day the court held an appellate hearing and gave judgment dismissing the applicant’s appeal.', '54. On 18 September 1997 a copy of the judgment of the Białystok Court of Appeal was served on the applicant. On 1 October 1997 he filed a notice of cassation appeal, requesting the court to serve the statement of the reasons for the judgment on him. He submitted it to the authorities of Barczewo Prison on 3 October 1997.', '55. On 20 October 1997 the Białystok Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s notice of cassation appeal because he had lodged it outside the seven-day time-limit provided for by Article 464 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '56. On 1 November 1997 the applicant requested the Minister of Justice to lodge a cassation appeal on his behalf. The request was dismissed on 22 January 1998. Later, the applicant – also unsuccessfully – asked the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) to lodge a cassation appeal on his behalf. That application was rejected on 11 December 1998.', '57. During the entire period of the applicant’s detention the Polish prison authorities kept detailed medical records concerning his state of health. His records contained, among other things, entries relating to the injuries that he inflicted on himself.', 'An entry made on 16 May 1996 contains a doctor’s note, which read, in so far as relevant:', '“Objects in [the] stomach?”', 'An entry made on 20 November 1996 read:', '“refusal to undergo an X-ray examination; no confirmation as to the objects in his stomach.”', 'A doctor’s note of 28 December 1996 read, in so far as relevant:', '“Complaints by a detainee, previous ailments and operations: objects in eyes: no complaints at present; objects in his stomach: on 25 October and 20 November 1996 [the applicant] refused to undergo an X-ray examination; on 23 December 1996 [he] claimed that there were no further objects. ... I administer a further X-ray examination. [He] complains about a pain in his stomach. ... Psychiatric examination of 4 November 1996 disclosed an abnormal personality...', 'Diagnosis: objects in eyes; [as regards the] objects in the stomach, [to date] in the absence of results of the X-ray examination there is no confirmation that, as [the applicant] states, there are no such objects ... General condition: good; some peritoneal symptoms ... Conclusions: [the applicant] can be detained in prison. Doctor [name and signature illegible].”', 'A subsequent X-ray examination made in January 1997 did not disclose any objects in the applicant’s stomach; it confirmed a diaphragm hernia.', '58. At the material time the rules governing detention on remand were contained in Chapter 24 of the Law of 19 April 1969 – Code of Criminal Procedure (Kodeks postępowania karnego) – entitled “Preventive measures” (Środki zapobiegawcze). The Code is no longer in force. It was repealed and replaced by the Law of 6 June 1997 (commonly referred to as the “New Code of Criminal Procedure”), which entered into force on 1 September 1998.', '59. The Code listed as preventive measures, inter alia, detention on remand, bail and police supervision.', 'Article 209 set out the general grounds justifying imposition of the preventive measures. This provision read:', '“Preventive measures may be imposed in order to ensure the proper conduct of proceedings if the evidence against the accused sufficiently justifies the opinion that he has committed a criminal offence.”', 'Article 217 § 1 defined grounds for detention on remand. The relevant part of this provision, in the version applicable until 1 January 1996, stipulated:', '“1: Detention on remand may be imposed if:', '(1) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will abscond or go into hiding, in particular when he has no fixed residence [in Poland] or his identity cannot be established; or', '(2) there is a reasonable risk that an accused will attempt to induce witnesses to give false testimony or to obstruct the proper course of the proceedings by any other unlawful means; or', '(3) an accused has been charged with a serious offence or has relapsed into crime in the manner defined in the Criminal Code; or', '(4) an accused has been charged with an offence which creates a serious danger to society.', '...”', 'On 1 January 1996 sub-paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 217 were repealed and the whole provision was redrafted.

The Code set out the margin of discretion in maintaining a specific preventive measure. Articles 213 § 1, 218 and 225 of the Code were based on the precept that detention on remand was the most extreme preventive measure and that it should not be imposed if more lenient measures were adequate.', 'Article 213 § 1 provided:', '“A preventive measure [including detention on remand] shall be immediately lifted or varied, if the basis for it has ceased to exist or new circumstances have arisen which justify lifting a given measure or replacing it with a more or less severe one.”', 'Article 225 stated:', '“Detention on remand shall be imposed only when it is mandatory; this measure shall not be imposed if bail or police supervision, or both of those measures, are considered adequate.”', 'The provisions for “mandatory detention” (for instance, detention pending an appeal against a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three years) were repealed on 1 January 1996 by the Law of 29 June on Amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure and Other Criminal Statutes.', 'Finally, Article 218 stipulated:', '“If there are no special reasons to the contrary, detention on remand should be quashed, in particular when:', '(1) it may seriously jeopardise the life or health of the accused, or', '(2) it would entail excessively burdensome effects for the accused or his family.”', '61.

The Supreme Court’ decision on an application under Article 222 § 4 constituted a separate legal basis for continued detention. No appeal lay in law against such a decision.', 'In cases where the Supreme Court dismissed such an application, a detainee had to be released. As long as it had not reached a decision, an application under Article 222 § 4 was treated as a basis for the continued detention.', '63.

If an accused’s appeal had not been filed and signed by a lawyer, it had to be rejected. If an appeal had complied with the formal requirements, the case was forwarded to the Supreme Court. According to paragraph 4 of Article 467, if the Supreme Court found that the appeal was inadmissible, it gave a decision on “not taking cognisance of the merits of the cassation appeal” (postanowienie o pozostawieniu kasacji bez rozpoznania).']","['5', '6']","['5-3', '5-4', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1

On 27 November 1993 Strasbourg police officers spotted an occupied vehicle parked in a car park. It turned out that the vehicle had been stolen the previous day in Strasbourg.

The on-the-spot investigation established that other transactions had taken place and that the two arrested men used to meet in a hotel in Brumath (Bas-Rhin).

The investigators seized a German passport in the applicant's name, 7,700 German marks (DEM) and 2,150 French francs (FRF) found in C.E.'s handbag, bank documents, a vehicle registration certificate and various hand-written documents. Those items were sealed and deposited at the consignment of exhibits department at the Strasbourg tribunal de grande instance."", '11. After her release from police custody no court proceedings were brought against C.E. None were brought against the applicant either.', '12.

O.H. and S.B. were committed for trial at the Strasbourg Criminal Court where they were tried and convicted on 13 June 1994 without the applicant or his girlfriend having been informed.

The court in question did not have any power to reconsider a measure which had become res judicata. ...”', '21. In a letter of 12 February 1996 C.E. requested the public prosecutor to return the seized DEM 7,700 and FRF 2,150 on the ground that the money belonged to her and that she was not in any way involved in the criminal proceedings. In a letter of 29 April 1996 she renewed her request, stating among other things: “my ex-boyfriend has put me in a difficult position which has seriously changed my life ...

At the same time the Constitutional Court may return the case to the authority concerned for further proceedings, order that such an authority abstain from violating fundamental rights and freedoms ... or, where appropriate, order that those who violated the rights or freedoms set out in paragraph 1 restore the situation existing prior to the violation.', '3.

HADEP was a political party which had been established on 11 May 1994. At the time of its dissolution on 13 March 2003 its general secretary was the second applicant, Mr Ahmet Turan Demir, who had been elected to that post in February 2003.', '6. In the general election held on 24 December 1995 HADEP received 1,171,623 votes, which represented 4.17% of the total number of votes cast. In the general election held on 18 April 1999 HADEP received 1,482,196 votes. However, as HADEP did not succeed in passing the required threshold of 10%, it was unable to be represented in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey following these two general elections (see HADEP and Others v. Turkey (dec.), no. 51292/99, 13 November 2008). In local elections held on 18 April 1999 HADEP won control of 37 municipalities. It had branches in 47 cities and in hundreds of districts. In 2002 HADEP became a member of the Socialist International.', ""7. The applicants submitted that, during a National Security Council (Milli Güvenlik Kurulu) meeting held on 18 December 1996, a decision had been taken to dissolve HADEP. In support of this assertion the applicants submitted to the Court a report which, they claimed, had been adopted by the National Security Council and which had subsequently been leaked to the press. The report, which is classified 'Secret', details a number of recommendations including “the control and pursuit of HADEP by the State in order to quell its activities”. Following this decision HADEP branches had been raided and its administrators had been subjected to physical pressure. In support of this latter argument the applicants submitted to the Court two reports, detailing the physical attacks on and the killings and forced disappearances of dozens of HADEP members, some of which have been examined by the Court (see, inter alia, Tanış and Others v. Turkey, no. 65899/01, ECHR 2005–VIII)."", '8. On various dates criminal proceedings were brought against a number of members of HADEP who were holding executive positions within the party. Some of the proceedings were suspended while some ended in convictions. Some of them were convicted of spreading “separatist propaganda”, in breach of section 8 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, while others were convicted of “incitement to racial hatred and hostility in society on the basis of a distinction between social classes, races or religions”, in breach of Article 312 of the Criminal Code. A number of others were convicted of lending assistance to the PKK in breach of Article 169 of the Criminal Code, for making speeches, allowing hunger strikers to use HADEP premises and for possessing a number of documents prepared by PKK members in a law-firm owned by one of them. Some served their prison sentences while execution of the sentences of a number of others was stayed.', ""9. On 29 January 1999 the chief prosecutor at the Court of Cassation brought proceedings before the Constitutional Court and demanded that HADEP be dissolved. The chief prosecutor argued that HADEP had become a “centre of illegal activities against the integrity of Turkey”. In support of his allegations the chief prosecutor referred to the criminal proceedings pending against members of HADEP and a number of activities of its members. One incident relied on by the chief prosecutor was that during HADEP's annual general meeting in 1996 the Turkish flag had been taken down and replaced with a PKK flag."", ""10. On 25 February 1999 the chief prosecutor asked the Constitutional Court to render an interim decision banning HADEP from taking part in the forthcoming April general and local elections. The chief prosecutor's request was refused by the Constitutional Court on 8 March 1999."", ""11. On 5 April 1999 lawyers for HADEP submitted a written defence to the Constitutional Court. They alleged that the chief prosecutor's request for the dissolution of HADEP had been made as a result of the National Security Council's above-mentioned decision (see paragraph 7). They further argued, inter alia, that as it was not clear what the accusations against HADEP were, it was not possible for them to make full use of their defence rights. The lawyers relied on Articles 6, 9, 10, 11 and 14 of the Convention and Article 3 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, and asked the Constitutional Court to take into account the decisions and judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in cases concerning the dissolution of a number of other political parties in Turkey."", '12. The chief prosecutor maintained in his written submissions of 9 April 1999 that HADEP had close ties with the PKK, and alleged that the former was being controlled by the latter. The chief prosecutor also repeated his request for HADEP to be dissolved before the elections which were to be held on 18 April 1999. This request was not accepted by the Constitutional Court.', ""13. During the proceedings, in their submissions to the Constitutional Court HADEP's representatives drew attention to the fact that the person who had taken down the flag was not a member of the party. They further stated that, immediately after the incident the HADEP congress had publicly condemned the incident. Since then HADEP had been dissociating itself from the incident and condemning it as an attack on a common symbolic value of the people of Turkey."", '14. In its decision of 13 March 2003 the Constitutional Court decided unanimously to dissolve HADEP. The Constitutional Court based its decision on Articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution and sections 101 and 103 of the Political Parties Act (Law no. 2820). In arriving at its conclusion, the Constitutional Court took account of the activities of certain leaders and members of HADEP and concluded that HADEP had become a centre of illegal activities which included aiding and abetting the PKK.', ""15. The Constitutional Court noted, in particular, that during HADEP's annual general meeting in 1996 a non-HADEP member wearing a mask had taken down the Turkish flag and replaced it with a PKK flag and a poster of the then leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan. During the same meeting slogans had also been chanted in support of the PKK and its leader. The then general secretary of HADEP Mr Murat Bozlak, who was present during the meeting on that day, had done nothing to stop the Turkish flag being taken down and had stated during his speech that “the existence of the Kurds in Turkey, who were not allowed to speak their mother tongue, had been denied. The PKK, despite ongoing military operations, massacres and provocations, was holding its ceasefire. Nothing could be resolved with military operations or with occupation.” The Constitutional Court considered the taking down of the Turkish flag as proof of the links between HADEP and the PKK. It further considered that the references made by Mr Bozlak to Turkey's fight against terrorism as an “occupation” and portraying Kurds as a separate nation showed that Mr Bozlak was supporting the PKK."", '16. The Constitutional Court referred to Article 11 of the Convention in its judgment and stated that the rights guaranteed in that provision were not absolute and could be restricted in the circumstances listed in Article 11 § 2 of the Convention. It also referred to Article 17 of the Convention, and reached the following conclusion:', ""“Carrying out activities, by relying on democratic rights and freedoms, against the indivisible unity of the State with its nation is unacceptable. In such circumstances it is the duty and raison d'être of the State to prevent the abuse of these rights and freedoms. Allowing a political party which supports terrorism and which is supported by terrorism to continue to exist cannot be contemplated."", ""In statements and speeches made on behalf of the People's Democracy Party and in the course of various meetings, the party's general secretary Murat Bozlak, other party officials and chairmen and members of the party's provincial and district branches have stated that the Kurdish nation was a different nation from the Turkish nation; that the State of the Turkish Republic had been enforcing a policy of pressure and oppression on the Kurdish nation; that there was an ongoing war between the PKK terrorist organisation and the State of the Republic of Turkey; and that the Kurdish nation should take sides with the PKK in this war. Some of these activities have resulted in convictions. These persons have thus aided and harboured the PKK and its leader Abdullah Öcalan, whose aim is to destroy the indivisible unity of the State. The incidents, which are detailed in relevant parts of this judgment and which took place during the Second Congress of the People's Democracy Party on 23 June 1996 in Ankara, as well as the objects and documents found in the party headquarters and in the party's various branches confirm the [above-mentioned conclusion]."", ""Activities by members of the People's Democracy Party and the evidence [in our possession] clearly show the links between the respondent party and the PKK. The following incidents and activities – and many others and judgments rendered by courts – are proof of the connection and support between the People's Democracy Party and the PKK terrorist organisation:"", '– organisation of various activities – under instructions from the PKK – such as hunger strikes, demonstrations and issuing press releases with a view to protesting against the attempt to assassinate Öcalan and against the work that had been carried out by the State of the Turkish Republic to apprehend Öcalan, and against his subsequent arrest;', '– work to create, by referring to concepts such as freedom, brotherhood and peace, a sense of a different nation among the people who live in a certain part of the country or who claim to belong to a certain ethnic group;', ""– description of the State's struggle against the PKK terrorist organisation as a 'dirty war', as well as taking sides with the PKK in this war by carrying out certain activities and by displaying certain behaviour;"", ""– provision of training to a number of young people, in line with the PKK ideology but under the disguise of in-party training, with a view to recruiting them to the party first and subsequently to the PKK terrorist organisation in order for them to carry out activities on behalf of the PKK terrorist organisation and then sending them to the PKK's mountain camps as armed militants;"", ""– the keeping in the Party's headquarters and in its district and provincial branches, of objects, books, banners and photographs of members of the PKK as well as other PKK terrorist organisation propaganda documents for which the courts have issued confiscation orders;"", ""– the fact of allowing people to watch the organisation's media organ MED TV in these places for propaganda purposes; and"", ""– speeches and activities during HADEP's Second Congress."", 'In the light of the above, and in accordance with Articles 68 and 69 of the Constitution and section 101 (b) of the Political Parties Act, it is hereby decided to dissolve HADEP, which has become a centre of illegal activities against the indivisible unity of the State with its nation and which has aided and harboured the PKK terrorist organisation.', '...”', ""17. As an ancillary measure under Article 69 § 9 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court banned 46 HADEP members and leaders from becoming founder members, ordinary members, leaders or auditors of any other political party for a period of five years. The Constitutional Court also ordered the transfer of HADEP's property to the Treasury."", '18.

In its Guidelines on the prohibition and dissolution of political parties and analogous methods (published in January 2000) the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission) proposed the following:', '“1. States should recognise that everyone has the right to associate freely in political parties. This right shall include freedom to hold political opinions and to receive and impart information without interference by a public authority and regardless of frontiers. The requirement to register political parties will not in itself be considered to be in violation of this right.', '2. Any limitations to the exercise of the above-mentioned fundamental human rights through the activity of political parties shall be consistent with the relevant provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and other international treaties, in normal times as well as in cases of public emergencies.', '3. Prohibition or enforced dissolution of political parties may only be justified in the case of parties which advocate the use of violence or use violence as a political means to overthrow the democratic constitutional order, thereby undermining the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution. The fact alone that a party advocates a peaceful change of the Constitution should not be sufficient for its prohibition or dissolution.', '4. A political party as a whole can not be held responsible for the individual behaviour of its members not authorised by the party within the framework of political/public and party activities.', '5. The prohibition or dissolution of political parties as a particularly far-reaching measure should be used with utmost restraint. Before asking the competent judicial body to prohibit or dissolve a party, governments or other state organs should assess, having regard to the situation of the country concerned, whether the party really represents a danger to the free and democratic political order or to the rights of individuals and whether other, less radical measures could prevent the said danger.', '6. Legal measures directed to the prohibition or legally enforced dissolution of political parties shall be a consequence of a judicial finding of unconstitutionality and shall be deemed as of an exceptional nature and governed by the principle of proportionality. Any such measure must be based on sufficient evidence that the party itself and not only individual members pursue political objectives using or preparing to use unconstitutional means.', '7. The prohibition or dissolution of a political party should be decided by the Constitutional court or other appropriate judicial body in a procedure offering all guarantees of due process, openness and a fair trial.”', '27. Resolution 1308 (2002) of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on “Restrictions on political parties in the Council of Europe member states” states, in particular, as follows:', '“...', '10. ...[T]he Assembly believes that in exceptional cases, it may be legitimate for a party to be banned if its existence threatens the democratic order of the country.', '11. In conclusion and in the light of the foregoing, the Assembly calls on the governments of member states to comply with the following principles:', 'i. political pluralism is one of the fundamental principles of every democratic regime;', 'ii. restrictions on or dissolution of political parties should be regarded as exceptional measures to be applied only in cases where the party concerned uses violence or threatens civil peace and the democratic constitutional order of the country;', 'iii. as far as possible, less radical measures than dissolution should be used;', 'iv. a party cannot be held responsible for the action taken by its members if such action is contrary to its statute or activities;', 'v. a political party should be banned or dissolved only as a last resort, in conformity with the constitutional order of the country, and in accordance with the procedures which provide all the necessary guarantees to a fair trial;', 'vi. the legal system in each member state should include specific provisions to ensure that measures restricting parties cannot be used in an arbitrary manner by the political authorities.”', '28. On 13-14 March 2009 the Venice Commission, acting on a request from the Monitoring Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) asking it “to review the constitutional and legal provisions which are relevant to the prohibition of political parties in Turkey”, adopted the “Opinion on the Constitutional and Legal Provisions Relevant to the Prohibition of Political Parties in Turkey”. The relevant parts of the Opinion are as follows:', '“...', '105. The Venice Commission concludes that, when compared to the common European practice, the situation in Turkey differs in three important respects:', '1. There is a long list of substantive criteria applicable to the constitutionality of political parties, as laid down in Article 68 (4) and the Law on political parties, which go beyond the criteria recognised as legitimate by the ECtHR and the Venice Commission.', '2. There is a procedure for initiating decisions on party prohibition or dissolution which makes this initiative more arbitrary and less subject to democratic control, than in other European countries.', '3. There is a tradition for regularly applying the rules on party closure to an extent that has no parallel in any other European country, and which demonstrates that this is not in effect regarded as an extraordinary measure, but as a structural and operative part of the constitution.', '106. In conclusion, the Venice Commission is of the opinion that the provisions in Article 68 and 69 of the Constitution and the relevant provisions of the Law on political parties together form a system which as a whole is incompatible with Article 11 of the ECHR as interpreted by the ECtHR and the criteria adopted in 1999 by the Venice Commission and since endorsed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.', '107. The basic problem with the present Turkish rules on party closure is that the general threshold is too low, both for initiating procedures for and for prohibiting or dissolving parties. This is in itself in abstracto deviating from common European democratic standards, and it leads too easily to action that will be in breach of the ECHR, as demonstrated in the many Turkish cases before the European Court of Human Rights.', '108. Because the substantial and procedural threshold for applying the Turkish rules on party prohibition or dissolution is so low, what should be an exceptional measure functions in fact as a regular one. This reduces the arena for democratic politics and widens the scope for constitutional adjudication on political issues. The scope of democratic politics is further eroded by the constitutional shielding of the first three articles of the Constitution, in such a way as to prevent the emergence of political programmes that question the principles laid down at the origin of the Turkish Republic, even if done in a peaceful and democratic manner.', '109. The Venice Commission is of the opinion that within democratic Europe these strict limitations on the legitimate arena for democratic politics are particular to the Turkish constitutional system, and difficult to reconcile with basic European traditions for constitutional democracy.', ""110. The Venice Commission recognises and welcomes the fact that in recent years the rules on party prohibition in Turkey have been changed in such a way as to raise the threshold for dissolution. In the 2001 reform, Article 69 was amended to include the qualification that for a party to be in conflict with the criteria of Article 68 (4) the party must be a 'centre' for such activities. At the same time, the requirement of a 3/5 majority of the Constitutional Court for dissolving a political party was introduced into Article 149. This has shown itself to be an important reform, which was decisive for the outcome of the AK party case. While laudable, these reforms have not been sufficient to fully bridge the gap between the Turkish rules and the standards of the ECHR and the Venice Commission Guidelines."", '111. Consequently, the Venice Commission is of the opinion that, although the 2001 revision was an important step in the right direction, it is still not sufficient to raise the general level of party protection in Turkey to that of the ECHR and the European common democratic standards. Further reform is necessary in order to achieve this, both on the substantive and the procedural side.', '...”']",['11'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1936 and lives in Osijek.', ""7. The events at issue took place in Vukovar, a Croatian town near the Serbian border which was heavily attacked by the Yugoslav People's Army and paramilitary Serbian armed forces during the Homeland War from August to November 1991 and finally occupied at the end of November 1991. Between 1992 and 1996 Vukovar was a part of the United Nations Protected Area (the “UNPA”)."", '8. In 1996 the United Nations Security Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (the “UNTAES”), which included Vukovar. On 15 January 1998 the UNTAES mandate ceased and the transfer of power to the Croatian authorities began.', '9. According to the applicant, on 17 September 1991 several members of the Serbian paramilitary forces came to her home, took some money and ransacked the house looking for money and gold. The applicant recognised three of them as P.Z., S.Z. and V.Z.', ""10. On 3 October 1991 three men, dressed in Yugoslav People's Army uniforms, one of whom was M.S. and personally known to the applicant, came to the applicant's family house in Vukovar. They hit her husband, A.J., before taking him away. A few minutes later the applicant heard shots from an automatic weapon. The uniformed men then also took the applicant and her grandson, M.J., together with some other persons, including S.M., to the military headquarters. On the way there the applicant saw the dead body of her husband, his head battered, lying on a path in front of a house; the persons who had brought him out of the house were standing next to the body."", '11. In autumn 1991 the applicant reported the above-mentioned event to the Vukovar police station, which was located in Zagreb at that time.', ""12. On 18 March 1992 the Vinkovci Police Department lodged a criminal complaint with the Osijek Military Prosecution against ten alleged offenders (G.J., M.S., S.S., M.N., B.G., M.K., Z.R., P.N., S.Z. and V.Z.), alleging that on 3 October 1991 they had arrested several individuals and then killed two of them, one of whom was the applicant's husband, and had thus committed a war crime against the civilian population. Following a request of the Osijek Military Prosecution, dated 14 May 1992, the Osijek Military Court opened an investigation in respect of the ten suspects on 31 August 1992 on the criminal charge of armed rebellion. The Military Court also ordered the suspects' detention and issued a warrant to find and arrest them, as they had absconded."", ""13. On 9 February 1993 the Military Court heard evidence from the applicant and her son. The applicant said that in September and October 1991, after the Serbian forces had entered Vukovar, but before the city finally fell, several persons, including her former neighbours M.S., S.S. and three brothers Z., all dressed in Yugoslav People's Army uniforms and equipped with shotguns and Kalashnikovs, had been coming to the yard in front of her house daily, threatening her and asking for her sons. She further stated that one of the persons who had come to her house on 3 October 1991 and taken her husband away was M.S., but she did not know the names of the others. A few minutes later, while she was being taken to the military headquarters, the applicant had passed the dead body of her husband. Her neighbour, S.M., who had been with her at the time, knew the names of the men who had taken the applicant's husband away."", ""14. On 17 December 1996 the Osijek County State Attorney's Office requested that the investigation be extended to two further suspects, Đ. P. and A.G. The charge was changed to one of war crimes against the civilian population. It was also requested that two witnesses be called once the police had found out their addresses. On 29 December 1996 the Osijek County Court requested the police to inform them of the addresses of the two witnesses. On 9 January 1997 the Osijek County Court extended the investigation to Đ.P. and A.G. and issued arrest warrants against them. On 23 January 1997 the police gave the County Court the requested addresses."", '15. On 30 January 1997 the applicant and another witness gave evidence before the Osijek County Court. The applicant specifically named one of the perpetrators, and the witness S.M. said that she had seen all twelve suspects at the scene.', '16. On 16 May 1997 the Osijek County Court stayed the investigation on the ground that the suspects and some of the witnesses resided in the occupied territory of Croatia, where the Croatian authorities were not able to exercise their power.', '17. The Convention was ratified by Croatia on 5 November 1997.', '18. The territories of Eastern Slavonija, Baranja and Western Slavonija were re-integrated into Croatia in January 1998.', '19. On 27 November 2000 jurisdiction in the matter was transferred to the Vukovar County Court (Županijski sud u Vukovaru) and the investigation was resumed.', ""20. On 2 October 2001 one of the suspects, Đ.B., was arrested and gave evidence before an investigating judge of the Vukovar County Court. On 10 October 2001 the investigating judge heard evidence from three further suspects, B.G., Z.R. and S.Z. On 11 October 2001 Đ.B. again gave evidence before the investigating judge. All the suspects denied their involvement in the murder of the applicant's husband. On 5 December 2001 the applicant again gave evidence."", ""21. On 14 May 2002 the Vukovar County State Attorney's Office requested a further investigation. On 13 and 23 September 2002 the investigating judge again heard evidence from the witness S.M and two other witnesses. Witness D.K., who had been ordered to bury the body of the applicant's husband, stated that he had been arrested by members of the Serbian paramilitary forces and taken to the place where the dead body of the applicant's husband had been lying. The head had been battered and the body was riddled with bullets. The witness could not name any of the uniformed men who had been standing next to the body and had ordered him to bury it. The other witness, M.K., had no knowledge of the relevant facts."", '22.

On 21 May 2003 the investigating judge terminated the investigation following a general amnesty granted in respect of the criminal offence of armed rebellion. On 27 May 2003 a three-judge panel of the Vukovar County Court quashed that decision on the ground that, prior to the amnesty, the offence had already been reclassified as a war crime against the civilian population. On 17 September 2003 the case file was forwarded to the State Attorney's Office. On 31 October 2003 that Office requested a further investigation."", '24.

Further hearings were held before the investigating judge on 6 and 21 April, 15 June, 13 July, 8 August and 11 November 2005.', ""29. On 25 March 2006 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint of inactivity on the part of the investigating authorities.

At hearings held before the investigating judge on 11 May 2006 and 14 November 2007, further witnesses gave evidence.', ""31. Identification parades were held on 17 November and 9 December 2008 in order to verify the identity of the suspect M.S. None of the three witnesses called, including S.M., recognised him as one of the people who had taken the applicant's husband away.

Mr Giancarlo Lombardo, a former judge, lived in Rome until his death. The facts established by the Commission pursuant to Article 31 para. 1 (art. 31-1) of the Convention are as follows (see paragraphs 23-35 of its report):', '""23. As the pensions of public servants and judges are not indexed in Italy, successive adjustments produced a situation in which the amount of pension paid by the State to retired judges having the same grade and with the same number of years of service but having retired at different dates varied considerably, in a way which the applicant considered to be unjustified.', '24. Consequently, at the same time as a number of other retired judges, on 11 November 1980, the applicant appealed to the Italian Court of Audit against a decree of the Ministry of Justice rejecting his application for the amount of his pension to be increased; he argued that the provisions of the legislation on which the disparity of treatment was based were unconstitutional.', '25. On 18 November 1980 the secretariat of the Court of Audit asked the Ministry of Justice to forward the applicant’s file, which was done on 5 December 1980.', '26. On 31 December 1980 the file was sent to the principal public prosecutor attached to the Court of Audit, so that he could investigate the case and formulate his submissions. These submissions were added to the file on 19 January 1982.', '27. On 7 June 1982 the principal public prosecutor, considering that the case raised questions of principle, asked for it to be examined by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit.', '28. Subsequently, examination of the appeal was adjourned pending the outcome of an appeal to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit entered by the principal public prosecutor on 5 July 1982 against a decision of the division having jurisdiction over pensions, given in an analogous case.', '29. These appeal proceedings proved to be lengthy. At the first hearing, arranged to take place on 6 October 1982, a first objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The combined divisions of the Court of Audit held that the objection was not manifestly ill-founded and, in decision (ordinanza) no. 73 of the same date, referred the matter to the Constitutional Court.', '30. The Constitutional Court gave its decision in a judgment filed on 7 March 1984.', '31. The case was again submitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit after a request to that effect had been made by the avvocato dello Stato (counsel representing the State) on 7 January 1985. A hearing was arranged for 5 June 1985. At that hearing a second objection of unconstitutionality was raised. The Court of Audit held that the second objection was not manifestly ill-founded and once again referred the matter to the Constitutional Court in decision no. 104 of the same date.', '32. The file was sent to the Constitutional Court on 18 September 1985. The Constitutional Court arranged for the objection of unconstitutionality to be examined at a hearing on 21 April 1988. Its judgment was transmitted to the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 23 June 1988.', '33. The case was due to be heard by the combined divisions of the Court of Audit on 12 October 1988 but had to be adjourned by the court until 27 October 1988, following a strike by its staff. On that date the Court of Audit referred the case to the relevant division. Its decision was filed with the registry on 14 November 1988.', '34. The relevant decision arranged for this case and the numerous others pending, including the applicant’s, to be heard on 22 February 1989.', '35. In a judgment dated 13 March 1989, filed with the registry on 20 March, it partially upheld the applicant’s appeal and ordered the readjustment of his pension, re- evaluation of the sums due and payment of interest on those sums.""', '8.

On 15 April 1971 the Tirol Regional Government acting as the Agricultural Authority of First Instance (Landesregierung als Agrarbehörde 1.Instanz, “the Agricultural Authority”) received a motion dated 19 January 1971 for opening land consolidation proceedings at Kalkstein in the municipality of Innervillgraten, signed by the land owners concerned including the applicant.', '9. On 3 May 1971 the Agricultural Authority ex officio opened the Kalkstein land consolidation proceedings (Zusammenlegungsverfahren), involving property in Innervillgraten of which the applicant and his siblings are co-owners.', '10. On 28 May 1974 the Agricultural Authority held a hearing with the land owners concerned as regards the provisional transfer of land (vorläufige Übergabe). The majority of land owners accepted the authority’s proposal, whereas the applicant opposed it. At the close of the hearing the authority orally delivered the decision ordering the provisional transfer of land and informed the participants that no remedy was available against it under the Tirol Agricultural Land Planning Act 1969 (Flurverfassungs-Landesgesetz).', '11. On 7 May 1979 the Agricultural Authority issued the consolidation scheme (Zusammenlegungsplan).', '12. On 5 February 1981 the Provincial Board upon, inter alia, the applicant’s appeal, set aside the consolidation scheme on the ground that the Agricultural Authority had failed to carry out a proper valuation of the plots of land involved. Further, it declared that the area had to be cultivated as provided for in the provisional transfer of land of 28 May 1974 until a new consolidation scheme was issued.', '13. On 14 September 1982 the Administrative Court (Verwaltungs-gerichshof), upon the complaint of the applicant and his co-owners, quashed the Provincial Board’s declaration that the consolidation area had to be cultivated as provided for in the provisional transfer until a new consolidation scheme was issued. It found that the Provincial Board had not been competent to make such a declaration. It was only called upon to decide on the merits of the case which had been before the Agricultural Authority, i.e. in the present case it had to decide on the lawfulness of the consolidation scheme. In any event, the decision on the provisional transfer of land had become final long ago.', '14. After having held a hearing on 28 April 1983, the Agricultural Authority issued an occupation and valuation schedule (Besitzstandsausweis und Bewertungsplan).', '15. On 1 December 1983 the Provincial Board dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It noted that the applicant had not contested the occupation schedule and had not submitted any arguments as regards the valuation of specific plots of land. There were no reasons to depart from the Agricultural Authority’s findings.', '16. On 8 October 1984 the Constitutional Court (Verfassungs-gerichtshof) declined to deal with the applicant’s complaint and referred the case to the Administrative Court.', '17. On 28 May 1985 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint, finding that he had not submitted any specific objections against the occupation and valuation schedule.', '18. On 28 January 1990 the Agricultural Authority received further documents relating to a number of changes in the valuation of land.', '19. On 17 May 1991 the Agricultural Authority issued a new consolidation scheme. It found, having regard to the valuation of the land, that the difference in value between the plots the applicant had owned prior to the proceedings and the plots allocated to him was less then the 5% which were admissible under the Agricultural Land Planning Act. For this difference it ordered payment of compensation. The consolidation scheme was open to public inspection at the Innervillgraten local authority during two weeks in July 1991.', '20. The applicant did not appeal against the consolidation scheme which, following its publication, became final on 1 July 1991. However he appealed against the notification of 17 May 1991 by which the Agricultural Authority had informed the parties of the publication of the consolidation scheme.', '21. On 29 October 1992 the Provincial Board rejected the applicant’s appeal as being inadmissible. It noted that the said appeal was directed against the notification of 17 May 1991, which was in itself not subject to appeal.', '22. On 14 June 1993 the Constitutional Court declined to deal with the applicant’s complaint and referred the case to the Administrative Court.', '23. On 24 October 1995 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint.', '24. By decision of 12 April 1996 the Agricultural Authority closed the consolidation proceedings following the entry of all changes of property in the land register in 1993 and the final settlement of the costs in early 1996.', '25.

RUSSIA,2,Violation of Art. 3;Violation of Art. 5-3;Violations of Art. 5-4;Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses partial award - Convention proceedings,Christos Rozakis,"['6. The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Vladimir, Russia.', '7. On 20 July 2004 a criminal investigation into a financial fraud allegedly committed by the applicant in conspiracy with another person, was opened.', '8. On 22 July 2004 the applicant’s flat was searched and she was informed about the suspicion against her.', '9. On 23 July 2004 the applicant was arrested and charged with large-scale fraud, an offence under Article 159 § 3 of the Russian Criminal Code.', '10. On 24 July 2004 the Frunzenskiy District Court of Vladimir ordered the applicant’s detention on the ground that she was suspected of a serious criminal offence and that she would abscond because her accomplice had already absconded. She could also destroy evidence because some documents had not yet been seized.', '11. On 26 July 2004 the applicant sent her notice of appeal. She asked for a more lenient preventive measure and petitioned the court to take into account that she was charged with a financial crime, that she had no criminal record, had a permanent place of residence and employment in Vladimir, family ties, a stable way of life and two minor children aged four and three. If she wished, she could have absconded after the search in her flat. The fact that she had not fled from justice proved that she had no such intention. She also complained about inhuman conditions of her detention and sought leave to appear before the appeal court.', '12. On 10 August 2004 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the detention order of 24 July 2004, finding that it had been lawful, sufficiently reasoned and justified. In the Regional Court’s view, the District Court had correctly assessed the applicant’s “character” and other materials presented by the prosecutor. The appeal hearing took place in the presence of the prosecutor who repeated the arguments advanced before the District Court and two counsels for the applicant. The applicant’s request for leave to appear in person was refused because her arguments were clearly set out in her notice of appeal and did not require additional clarifications.', '13. On 22 September 2004 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 November 2004. The court grounded its decision on the gravity of the charge against the applicant and on the possibility that she could abscond or obstruct justice.', '14. On 27 September 2004 the applicant appealed. She complained that the decision of 22 September 2004 was not sufficiently motivated, that the court did not take into account her individual situation, that the conditions of her detention were inhuman. She asked for release on bail.', '15. The appeal hearing was scheduled for 19 October 2004. On that day the hearing was adjourned because the applicant had not been brought to the courthouse.', '16. On 3 November 2004 the Vladimir Regional Court found that there were no reasons to vary the preventive measure and upheld the decision of 22 September 2004.', '17. On 22 November 2004 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 December 2004, finding as follows:', '“... it is necessary to carry out many investigative actions with [the applicant’s] participation.', '[The applicant] is charged with a serious criminal offence. Besides, the prosecution submitted documents showing that, once released, [the applicant] can flee from justice and interfere with the establishment of the truth.', 'The court sees no reasons to vary or cancel the preventive measure applied to [the applicant].”', '18. On 1 December 2004 the applicant lodged a notice of appeal. On 27 December 2004 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the decision. It found that the decision had been lawful and sufficiently reasoned.', '19. On 22 December 2004 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 23 January 2005 with reference to the gravity of charges and the need for a further investigation. The court also mentioned that the applicant could abscond, obstruct justice or re-offend.', '20. On 27 December 2004 the applicant appealed. She referred, in particular, to inhuman conditions of her detention and asked for release on bail.', '21. On 1 February 2005 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the decision of 22 December 2004. In particular, the appeal court noted that “conditions of detention could not be taken into account when deciding on an extension of detention”.', '22. On 21 January 2005 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 20 March 2005. The reasoning was similar to that in the decision of 22 December 2004.', '23. On 24 January 2005 the applicant lodged her points of appeal. She submitted that she had already spent six months in custody and that a further extension was permitted under the domestic law only if the case was particularly complex. The prosecution failed to show that her case was particularly complex. Nor did they prove that she intended to abscond or interfere with the establishment of the truth. The prosecution searched the applicant’s flat and office and seized all the papers; for that reason she could not destroy any evidence. The applicant asked the court to take account of her personal situation – her being a mother of two minor children with a permanent place of residence and employment in Vladimir - and inhuman conditions of her detention on remand. She complained that she had not been afforded an opportunity to study the materials submitted by the prosecution in support of their request for extension.', '24. On 22 February 2005 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the decision of 21 January 2005. The appeal court endorsed the reasoning of the first-instance court. It further held:', '“The opinion of [the applicant’s] lawyer that when considering the extension of detention it is necessary to take into account the conditions of detention in remand centres has no basis in the domestic law...', 'The rules of criminal procedure (Arts. 108, 109 of the Russian Code on Criminal Procedure) do not provide for disclosure of the materials submitted by the prosecution in support of a request for extension. Nor do they require that the court should hear the opinion of the parties concerning [those materials].”', '25. On 18 March 2005 the Frunzenskiy District Court ordered the extension of the applicant’s detention until 20 May 2005. It held that the applicant was charged with a serious criminal offence, that it was necessary to conduct an additional investigation and that there were no reasons to vary the preventive measure.', '26. On 24 March 2005 the applicant lodged her appeal. On 19 April 2005 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the decision.', '27. On 19 May 2005 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 20 June 2005. It held that the extension was “objectively justified” because of the complexity of the case, the gravity of the charge and the risk of the applicant’s absconding or her interfering with the establishment of the truth.', '28. On 27 May 2005 the applicant appealed. She repeated the arguments set out in the points of appeal of 24 January 2005 and added that her father was seriously ill. On 21 June 2005 the Vladimir Regional Court rejected the appeal.', '29. On 17 June 2005 the Frunzenskiy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 20 July 2005. It referred to the complexity of the case (the case-file comprised 13 binders), the need for a further investigation, the gravity of the charge and the risk of the applicant’s absconding or interfering with the establishment of the truth.', '30. On 28 July 2005 the Vladimir Regional Court upheld the decision on appeal.', '31. On 14 July 2005 the investigation was completed and the applicant was committed for trial. The applicant’s lawyers petitioned the court for her release.', '32. On 19 July 2005 the Leninskiy District Court of Vladimir fixed the first hearing for 2 August 2005 and ordered that the applicant should remain in custody.', '33. On 2 August 2005 the Leninskiy District Court established that the case was not ready for consideration on the merits because the applicant had not had sufficient time to study the case file and remitted the case for additional investigation. It ordered that the applicant should meanwhile remain in custody.', '34. On 4 August 2005 the acting prosecutor of Vladimir varied the preventive measure. The applicant was released but ordered not to leave the town.', '35. The applicant was held in detention facility no. IZ-33/1 in the Vladimir Region.', '36. According to a certificate of 11 August 2005 from the facility administration, produced by the Government, the applicant was kept in four cells described as follows: cells nos. 73 and 74 (22 m², 18 bunks, 15 inmates on average), cell no. 69 (24 m², 21 bunks, 14 inmates on average) and cell no. 70 (25 m², 15 bunks, 10 inmates on average). The Government submitted that the applicant had at all times had a separate bunk.', '37. The applicant did not dispute the cell measurements and the number of bunks. She disagreed, however, with the number of inmates asserted by the Government. According to her, from July 2004 to March 2005 she was held in cell no. 73 together with 15 to 22 inmates; from 2 to 4 March 2005 she was kept in cell no. 69 which accommodated 14 detainees; thereafter and until 18 May 2005 she shared cell no. 74 with up to 20 inmates; in the night of 18 May 2005 she stayed in cell no. 70 with 10 other inmates; and on 19 May 2005 she was transferred back to cell no. 74 that accommodated up to 20 detainees. In cells nos. 73 and 74 she did not always have a separate bunk.', '38. The Government, relying on a certificate of 11 August 2005 from the facility administration, submitted that all cells were equipped with a lavatory pan. The pan had no cover but it was separated from the living area by a one-metre-high brick wall and an additional curtain of 1.2 metre in height. Once a week the inmates were provided with detergent (soda and chlorine). The dining table was situated three meters away from the pan. The inmates were allowed to take a shower once a week. The cells were naturally ventilated through the windows and the door vent. Fans were provided on request. There were no running hot water available but detainees were permitted to use immersion heaters. Besides, hot water for laundry and boiled drinking water was distributed. Once a week inmates were provided with clean bedding, towels and kitchenware. The cells were equipped with fluorescent lamps which functioned during day and night.', '39. The applicant disagreed with the Government’s description and submitted that the sanitary conditions were unsatisfactory. The cells swarmed with insects, rats and mice. Inmates had to do their laundry indoors, creating excessive humidity in the cells. There was no artificial ventilation system. A fan was provided only in June 2005. The windows were covered with thick metal bars that blocked access to natural light. The artificial light was never switched off disturbing the applicant’s sleep.', '40. The applicant contested the Government’s description of the toilet facilities. The pan was cleaned infrequently and it was very dirty and stinky. What is more, it had no cover: inmates stuck a plastic bottle in the hole in order to prevent smells from spreading. No curtains were provided and inmates had to hang a sheet which did not offer sufficient privacy. No toilet articles were distributed, save for 100 g of soda and chloride and 33 g of laundry soap per week.', '41. The applicant was allowed to take a shower once a week. The entire cell was afforded fifteen minutes to shower, although there was only four shower heads. Soap was distributed after a shower. It was extremely cold in the shower room in winter. On the court days or on the days of family visits the applicant missed her chance to take shower.', '42. The Government submitted that the applicant had an hour-long walk daily.', '43. The applicant conceded that an hour-long walk was organised every day. However, on shower days inmates were not allowed to go outdoors. The entire cell population was often left indoors as collective punishment for a disciplinary offence committed by one inmate. The exercise yards were fenced by brick walls of 2.5 metre in height with bars on the top. They were covered with a metal roof with a one-meter gap between the roof and the top of the walls. In summer it was extremely hot and stifling inside because the sun heated the roof. Most of yards measured 9 m², up to 10 people were brought into the yard at once.', '44. Since 1 July 2002 criminal-law matters have been governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (Law no. 174-FZ of 18 December 2001, the “CCrP”).', '45. “Preventive measures” or “measures of restraint” (меры пресечения) include an undertaking not to leave a town or region, personal surety, bail and detention (Article 98). If necessary, the suspect or accused may be asked to give an undertaking to appear (обязательство о явке) (Article 112).', '46. When deciding on a preventive measure, the competent authority is required to consider whether there are “sufficient grounds to believe” that the accused would abscond during the investigation or trial, re-offend or obstruct the establishment of the truth (Article 97). It must also take into account the gravity of the charge, information on the accused’s character, his or her profession, age, state of health, family status and other circumstances (Article 99).', '47. Detention may be ordered by a court if the charge carries a sentence of at least two years’ imprisonment, provided that a less restrictive preventive measure cannot be applied (Article 108 § 1).', '48. After arrest the suspect is placed in custody “pending the investigation”. The maximum permitted period of detention “pending the investigation” is two months but it can be extended for up to eighteen months in “exceptional circumstances” (Article 109 §§ 1-3). The period of detention “pending the investigation” is calculated to the day when the prosecutor sent the case to the trial court (Article 109 § 9).', '49. From the date the prosecutor forwards the case to the trial court, the defendant’s detention is “before the court” (or “during the trial”). The period of detention “during the trial” is calculated to the date the judgment is given. It may not normally exceed six months, but if the case concerns serious or particularly serious criminal offences, the trial court may approve one or more extensions of no longer than three months each (Article 255 §§ 2 and 3).', '50. An appeal may be lodged with a higher court within three days against a judicial decision ordering or extending detention. The appeal court must decide the appeal within three days after its receipt (Article 108 § 10).', '51. The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, adopted by the First United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, held at Geneva in 1955, and approved by the Economic and Social Council by its resolution 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977, provide, in particular, as follows:', '“10. All accommodation provided for the use of prisoners and in particular all sleeping accommodation shall meet all requirements of health, due regard being paid to ... minimum floor space, lighting, heating and ventilation...', '11. In all places where prisoners are required to live or work,', '(a) The windows shall be large enough to enable the prisoners to read or work by natural light, and shall be so constructed that they can allow the entrance of fresh air whether or not there is artificial ventilation;', '(b) Artificial light shall be provided sufficient for the prisoners to read or work without injury to eyesight.', '12. The sanitary installations shall be adequate to enable every prisoner to comply with the needs of nature when necessary and in a clean and decent manner.', '13. Adequate bathing and shower installations shall be provided so that every prisoner may be enabled and required to have a bath or shower... at least once a week in a temperate climate.', '14.

Prisoners shall be required to keep their persons clean, and to this end they shall be provided with water and with such toilet articles as are necessary for health and cleanliness...', '19. Every prisoner shall... be provided with a separate bed, and with separate and sufficient bedding which shall be clean when issued, kept in good order and changed often enough to ensure its cleanliness.', '21. (1) Every prisoner... shall have at least one hour of suitable exercise in the open air daily if the weather permits.”', '52. The relevant extracts from the 2nd General Report by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) read as follows:', '“46. Overcrowding is an issue of direct relevance to the CPT’s mandate. All the services and activities within a prison will be adversely affected if it is required to cater for more prisoners than it was designed to accommodate... Moreover, the level of overcrowding in a prison, or in a particular part of it, might be such as to be in itself inhuman or degrading from a physical standpoint.', '48. Specific mention should be made of outdoor exercise. The requirement that prisoners be allowed at least one hour of exercise in the open air every day is widely accepted as a basic safeguard... It is also axiomatic that outdoor exercise facilities should be reasonably spacious...', '49. Ready access to proper toilet facilities and the maintenance of good standards of hygiene are essential components of a humane environment...', '50. The CPT would add that it is particularly concerned when it finds a combination of overcrowding, poor regime activities and inadequate access to toilet/washing facilities in the same establishment. The cumulative effect of such conditions can prove extremely detrimental to prisoners.”', '53. The relevant extracts from the CPT’s 10th General Report, governing conditions of detention of women [CPT/Inf (2000) 13], read as follows:', '“21. ...in all Council of Europe member States, women inmates represent a comparatively small minority of persons deprived of their liberty. This can render it very costly for States to make separate provision for women in custody, with the result that they are often held at a small number of locations (on occasion, far from their homes and those of any dependent children), in premises which were originally designed for (and may be shared by) male detainees. In these circumstances, particular care is required to ensure that women deprived of their liberty are held in a safe and decent custodial environment...', '30. The Committee also wishes to call attention to a number of hygiene and health issues in respect of which the needs of women deprived of their liberty differ significantly from those of men.', '31. The specific hygiene needs of women should be addressed in an adequate manner. Ready access to sanitary and washing facilities, safe disposal arrangements for blood-stained articles, as well as provision of hygiene items, such as sanitary towels and tampons, are of particular importance.', 'The failure to provide such basic necessities can amount, in itself, to degrading treatment.”']","['3', '5']","['5-3', '5-4']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicants were participants in or were alleged to be organisers of the unauthorised demonstration of 16 October 2003, which escalated into violent clashes between the law-enforcement authorities and the demonstrators, as described below.', '6. The events of the present case occurred in the aftermath of the presidential elections of 15 October 2003. The main opposition candidate, Mr Isa Gambar, the chairman of the Müsavat Party, lost the elections of 15 October 2003.', '7. On the evening of election day a group of opposition supporters gathered in front of the Müsavat Party’s headquarters in the centre of Baku, claiming victory for their candidate in the election. Violent altercations between opposition supporters and the security forces took place at this time.', '8. At around 2 p.m. on 16 October a number of opposition supporters started gathering near the State Carpet Museum, in the centre of Baku, to protest against the election results. The crowd then started moving towards Azadliq Square, the main square in the city. It was reported that on the way some people in the crowd began damaging cars, buildings, benches and other urban constructions. It was also claimed that the organisers of this unauthorised demonstration and certain leaders of the opposition parties were inciting their followers to violence.', '9. It has been claimed that some police officers who had been deployed in Azadliq Square were attacked by some of the demonstrators. Shortly thereafter large numbers of riot police and military personnel, fully equipped with helmets, shields and truncheons, arrived in the square with the aim of dispersing the demonstration. The situation quickly escalated into public disorder, and violent clashes occurred between the crowd and the police. It was widely reported that the authorities used excessive force indiscriminately against anyone who happened to be in the area in question.', '10. At around 6 p.m. the demonstration was completely dispersed. Several hundred people were arrested during the events of 16 October and in their aftermath.', '11. On 16 October 2003 the Prosecutor General’s Office instituted criminal proceedings (case no. 80308) concerning the events of 15 and 16 October 2003. More than 100 people, of the several hundred arrested in connection with those events, were eventually prosecuted in connection with those proceedings. The proceedings concerned only the actions of the organisers of the demonstration and those participating in it, and it appears that no criminal or other form of investigation was carried out in connection with the allegations of excessive use of force by the police and military units during the dispersal of the demonstration (see Muradova v. Azerbaijan, no. 22684/05, §§ 23 and 114, 2 April 2009).', '12. Almost the whole pre-trial investigation, in respect of all the defendants, was conducted in the context of this single set of criminal proceedings. However, as the investigation drew close to completion, criminal case no. 80308 was gradually split into several cases, eventually dividing the accused into fifteen separate groups. It appears that the only reason formally given by the prosecution for splitting up the case was the concern that the sheer number of defendants involved (more than 100) would prolong the proceedings and that it would be impractical to hold a single trial involving so many defendants (see Huseyn and Others v. Azerbaijan, nos. 35485/05, 45553/05, 35680/05 and 36085/05, § 28, 26 July 2011). Furthermore, it appears that no significant investigative steps were taken after the cases were split (ibid., §§ 29 and 166). Each of the fifteen defendant groups thus created was tried separately. Fourteen of those trials concerned the events of 16 October 2003: they were all conducted by the Assize Court and were completed in March and April 2004 (one trial concerned the events of 15 October 2003, and this trial was conducted by the Sabail District Court). All the defendants in those trials, including the applicants in the present case, were found guilty and sentenced to either imprisonment, suspended prison terms or restriction of liberty.', '13. The circumstances relating to each individual applicant in the present case are summarised separately below.', '14. Mr B. Asadbeyli was the head of the Sumgayit branch of the Müsavat Party. Mr S. Hamidov, Mr E. Huseynli and Mr H. Mammadov held various positions within the Müsavat Party. Mr S. Aliyev and Mr E. Mammadov were students at a public university and had no formal affiliation to any political party.', '15. Applicant H. Mammadov died on 27 May 2008, after the events described below and after the present application had been lodged with the Court. His brother, Mr Islam Mammadov, expressed a wish to continue pursuing the application on his behalf.', '16. Mr S. Aliyev was arrested on 16 October 2003 during the dispersal of the demonstration by the police. He was charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials” under Articles 220 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code. On the same day the Nasimi District Court remanded him in custody for a period of three months.', '17. Mr E. Mammadov was also arrested on 16 October 2003. He states that the arresting police officers issued a “report on an administrative offence” (inzibati xəta barədə protokol), accusing him of non-compliance with police orders in Azadliq Square, an offence under Article 310.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”).', '18. It appears from the documents submitted by the Government that on 18 October 2003 Mr E. Mammadov was brought before the judge of the Narimanov District Court in connection with the charge under the CAO. According to the transcript of the hearing, the applicant admitted that he had not complied with police orders, and expressed remorse for his actions. On 18 October 2003 the Narimanov District Court convicted him under Article 310.1 of the CAO and sentenced him to fifteen days’ “administrative detention”.', '19. On 25 October 2003 Mr E. Mammadov lodged an appeal seeking a reduction of his sentence on the grounds of family circumstances and the fact that he was a student. On the same day, 25 October 2003, the Court of Appeal reduced the sentence to nine days’ detention and, having regard to the fact that he had already been in detention for nine days, ordered his immediate release.', '20. According to Mr E. Mammadov, no copies of decisions concerning these administrative proceedings were made available to him.', '21. However, soon after his release from “administrative detention”, Mr E. Mammadov was arrested again and charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials” under Articles 220 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code. In particular, he was accused of joining other participants in the demonstration in destroying public benches and asphalt and concrete revetments of pavements and roads, and of using stones as well as wooden and concrete debris obtained from the properties destroyed to assault police officers in Azadliq Square, in a manner posing a danger to their life and health.', '22. Mr E. Mammadov was then remanded in custody pending criminal trial.', '23. During their pre-trial detention, both Mr S. Aliyev and Mr E. Mammadov were expelled from the university.', '24. On 17 October 2003 Mr B. Asadbeyli, Mr S. Hamidov, Mr E. Huseynli and Mr H. Mammadov were taken from their homes to the Sumgayit City Prosecutor’s Office for questioning. Several hours later they were allowed to go home but were instructed to come back the next morning. On 18 October 2003 they were taken to the Prosecutor General’s Office in Baku. When they arrived in Baku they were held in a police car for around nine to ten hours outside the building of the Prosecutor General’s Office. In the evening they were taken into the building and questioned. On both days they were questioned in the absence of a lawyer.', '25. Following the questioning, the four applicants were charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials”. On the same day Nasimi District Court, issuing separate detention orders for each of the four applicants, remanded them in custody for three months. Some of the applicants were represented by Stateappointed lawyers at the hearings.', '26. On 15 November 2003 the court replaced Mr S. Hamidov’s detention with a written undertaking not to leave his place of residence, and he was released pending trial.', '27. According to the applicants, prior to their trial, several high-ranking state officials, including the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Internal Affairs, made public statements on television and in newspapers, referring to the participants in the demonstration of 16 October 2003 as “criminals” and promising that they would be punished.', '28. In the course of the investigation, following a request by the prosecution, the Nasimi District Court authorised the Prosecutor General’s Office to obtain from Azercell Telecom, a cellular network operator, detailed information on all mobile phone connections registered during the period from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on 16 October 2003 in the area around Azadliq Square, with the purpose of establishing whether various defendants were present in the square at the relevant time. However, according to Mr B. Asadbeyli, he subsequently discovered that the case file contained print-outs of a “call details report” concerning all his private phone calls made over a longer time span and a larger geographical area than those authorised by the court.', '29. All the applicants were tried together by the Assize Court (this trial was referred to as “Trial Group 8” in the OSCE report cited below). In total, there were nine defendants in the case, including the applicants.', '30. The court relied on statements from a number of police officers as witnesses, who testified against the demonstrators. During the pre-trial investigation several police officers were shown photographs of the applicants and recognised them as demonstrators who had been throwing stones at police officers during the events of 16 October 2003. According to the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to meet these witnesses during the pre-trial investigation or to cross-examine them during the trial. According to the Government, the applicants were able to question all the witnesses who testified in court.', '31. By a judgment of 24 March 2004, the Assize Court convicted all the applicants as charged under Articles 220.1 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code. Mr B. Asadbeyli, Mr S. Hamidov, Mr H. Mammadov and Mr E. Mammadov were given suspended sentences of four years and six months’ imprisonment and released immediately from the courtroom. Mr E. Huseynli and Mr S. Aliyev were sentenced to three and two years’ imprisonment respectively.', '32. All the applicants appealed against the Assize Court’s judgment of 24 March 2004. The Court of Appeal examined all six appeals together. According to the applicants, they were not notified in advance of the time of the hearing at the Court of Appeal. Only Mr B. Asadbeyli, Mr S. Aliyev and the latter’s lawyer were able to attend the hearing. Mr B. Asadbeyli learned of the examination of the appeal by chance on the day the hearing was held. On 8 June 2004 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the Assize Court’s judgment of 24 March 2004. That court reduced the sentences of Mr E. Huseynli and Mr S. Aliyev to two years and one year respectively.', '33. On 30 July 2004 Mr E. Huseynli lodged a cassation appeal against the Court of Appeal’s judgment. According to the Government, on 9 March 2005 the Supreme Court informed the applicant of the date of the hearing; however, the applicant failed to request the court to ensure his presence at the hearing and both the applicant and his lawyer failed to appear at the hearing. However, according to the applicant, he did not receive any response from the Supreme Court to his cassation appeal.', '34. After his release from prison, on 28 March 2005 Mr E. Huseynli sent an inquiry to the Supreme Court concerning his appeal. On 31 March 2005 the Supreme Court sent him a letter informing him that his appeal was still pending and stating, inter alia: “... your cassation appeal will be examined.”', '35. According to Mr E. Huseynli, his appeal was never examined.', '36. On an unspecified date, Mr S. Aliyev lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court. In reply, on 3 September 2004 the Supreme Court sent him a letter stating the following:', '“The Supreme Court has received your cassation appeal. We would like to inform you that if you disagree with the judgment of the Court of Appeal, you may lodge a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court in accordance with Articles 407-413 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.”', '37. According to Mr S. Aliyev, his appeal was never examined.', '38. The other four applicants, Mr B. Asadbeyli, Mr S. Hamidov, Mr H. Mammadov and Mr E. Mammadov, also lodged cassation appeals against the Court of Appeal’s judgment of 24 March 2004. The Supreme Court examined their appeals together and, on 19 October 2004, dismissed them, upholding the lower courts’ judgments. The full text of the Supreme Court’s decision was sent to the applicants on 2 November 2004.', '39. Mr S. Aliyev served his full one-year prison sentence and was released on 16 October 2004.', '40. Following a presidential pardon decree, on 21 March 2005 Mr E. Huseynov was released from serving the remainder of his sentence of two years’ imprisonment.', '41. The applicant was arrested on 16 October 2003 during the dispersal of the demonstration.', '42. After the arrest, he was taken to the Sabail District police station and later to the Baku Central police station. His family was not informed of his arrest. According to the applicant, at both police stations he was questioned in the absence of a lawyer. Interrogations were accompanied by illtreatment, in order to make him confess that he had actively participated in the disorder and had used violence against police, as well as to disclose the names of the organisers of the disorder.', '43. On 17 October 2003 the applicant was formally charged under Articles 220 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code. He was then taken to the Prosecutor General’s Office, where, he states, he was forced to sign selfincriminatory statements.', '44. On the same day, a district court in Baku remanded the applicant in custody for three months. This decision was taken in the applicant’s absence. He was not informed of the decision and was not given a copy of it. He was still unrepresented by a lawyer at this stage.', '45. On 18 October 2003 the applicant’s parents were informed about the applicant’s arrest. On 23 October 2003 he was allowed to meet his lawyer for the first time.', '46. The trial at the Assize Court began on 30 January 2004 (Trial Group 3). The applicant was tried with six others, including another applicant in this case, Mr Ramiz Guliyev. During the first hearing, the applicant declared that he was not guilty and claimed that he had been forced to give self-incriminatory evidence during his first days in detention. He asked the court not to admit in evidence his statements made during the pre-trial investigation. Some of the other defendants made similar complaints and requests.', '47. Following the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment in pre-trial detention, the court ordered a medical examination of the applicant. According to the forensic report of 14 February 2004, the forensic expert found no injuries which could have been inflicted at the time and in the circumstances alleged by the applicant. The applicant’s lawyer protested, claiming that he had not been informed about the time and place of the medical examination and was therefore unable to put questions to the medical expert. His request for a new medical examination was refused. The court found the applicant’s and other defendants’ allegations of ill-treatment unsubstantiated and admitted in evidence their statements given during pretrial investigation.', '48. During the trial, the court heard and relied on statements from over 100 prosecution witnesses (the great majority of whom were police officers and military personnel) who testified against all demonstrators in general, describing the public disorder which had taken place and characterising the demonstrators’ intentions and actions as violent. The court also heard two police officers who testified against the applicant in particular; they stated that they had seen the applicant throwing stones at police officers. The court also watched a video recording which allegedly identified the applicant as one of the demonstrators throwing stones and running around with a club and a shield in his hands. The court refused the applicant’s request for witnesses to be examined who would testify to violence by law-enforcement officers against peaceful demonstrators, and also refused to admit in evidence a video recording and photographs with scenes of police brutality against demonstrators. The court noted that this evidence did not contain any information specifically concerning the applicant, and was therefore irrelevant.', '49. On 4 March 2004 the Assize Court convicted the applicant of organising mass disorder and use of violence against the police, and sentenced him to four years’ imprisonment.', '50. The applicant lodged an appeal, complaining, inter alia, that the Assize Court had conducted the proceedings unfairly and had relied only on the evidence provided by police officers. On 29 April 2004 the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the Assize Court’s judgment. On 21 September 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments.', '51. The applicant was an active member of the Müsavat Party. He was an election observer during the presidential elections of 15 October 2003.', '52. On 17 October 2003 the applicant was taken from his home to a police station and questioned. He told the police that during the events of 16 October 2003 he had not been present in Azadliq Square but had been in another part of the city. He was then allowed to leave the police station.', '53. However, on 21 October 2003 he was arrested and accused of resisting the police when he had been called to the police station to testify about the events of 16 October. The applicant was brought before a judge of the Yasamal District Court who, on the same day, found the applicant guilty of resistance to the police under Article 310.1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, and sentenced him to fifteen days’ “administrative detention”.', '54. On the same day, the applicant was taken to the Organised Crime Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (“the OCD”) where he was asked questions about his role in the events of 16 October 2003. According to the applicant, the interrogators beat him and burned him with cigarettes. He was held in the OCD until 31 October. He stated that throughout his detention he was ill-treated by various means, such as beating, crushing his fingers and toes, and burning his skin with cigarettes.', '55. On 28 October 2003 the applicant was taken to the Prosecutor General’s Office for interrogation, but refused to testify because his lawyer was absent. He was taken back to the OCD.', '56. The applicant was charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials”. On 31 October 2003 the applicant was taken to an unspecified district court, which remanded him in custody for three months. The applicant was not represented by a lawyer during this hearing. Following this, the applicant was transferred from the OCD’s detention facility to Detention Facility no. 1.', '57. The applicant was tried at the Assize Court with six others (Trial Group 3), one of whom was another applicant in this case, Mr Shahin Gojayev (see section C. above). It appears that during the trial he was represented by a State-appointed lawyer. In his submissions to the court, the applicant maintained that he was not in Azadliq Square on 16 October 2003.', '58. Some of the facts concerning the trial and witnesses heard by the court have been described above (see paragraph 48 above). As to the applicant’s particular situation, the court heard statements from several police officers and one civilian witness, who had been shown a photograph of the applicant during the pre-trial investigation and had identified him as one of the demonstrators who had been throwing stones at the police officers during the events of 16 October 2003. According to the applicant, those statements were false and hearsay evidence. The witnesses gave the same statements during the trial. According to the applicant, he was not given an opportunity to confront the witnesses during the pre-trial investigation. According to the Government, he was given an opportunity to confront them at the trial hearings.', '59. According to the applicant, during the trial, he requested the court to hear three witnesses who could confirm that he was not in Azadliq Square on 16 October 2003. However, the court heard only one of these witnesses and refused to hear the other two.', '60. The applicant also complained before the Assize Court that he had been ill-treated during his detention in the OCD’s detention facility. The court requested that the applicant be medically examined by a forensic expert. The forensic report of 24 February 2004 found a dark bruise on one of the fingers of the applicant’s left hand and four dark spots on his belly. The expert estimated that the bruise on the finger had most likely been caused by a hard blunt object about one month before, while the dark spots on the belly could be considered marks of burns which had been inflicted about two months before. The court also had regard to a letter from Detention Facility No. 1, dated 24 February 2004, stating that no injuries had been observed on the applicant’s body when he was transferred to Detention Facility No. 1 on 31 October 2003. The court concluded that the applicant’s allegations that he had been ill-treated in the OCD’s detention facility during the period between 21 October and 31 October 2003 were not supported by the available evidence.', '61. On 4 March 2004 the Assize Court found the applicant guilty of both the charges against him and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment.', '62. Following an appeal by the applicant, on 29 April 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the Assize Court’s judgment of 4 March 2004. On 23 November 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments.', '63. Following a presidential pardon decree of 21 March 2005, the applicant was released from serving the remainder of his sentence.', '64. The applicant was a member of the Müsavat Party. During the presidential elections of 15 October 2003 he was the chairman of the Gabala regional headquarters for I. Gambar’s electoral campaign.', '65. The applicant was in Azadliq Square on 16 October 2003. He went back to Gabala on the same day, after the demonstration. In the morning of 17 October he was taken to a local police station and questioned. In the evening of 17 October he was taken to Baku, where he was detained in a police station until the next day.', '66. On 18 October 2003 the applicant was formally charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials”. On the same day Nasimi District Court remanded the applicant in custody for three months. During the court hearing, the applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer whom he had not met before. The lawyer did not introduce himself to the applicant and did not talk to him. The applicant did not meet this lawyer again after the hearing of 18 October 2003.', '67. The applicant was tried by the Assize Court with six others (Trial Group 5). It appears that he was represented by a lawyer during the trial. In his submissions to the court, the applicant denied that he had personally taken part in any violence during the events of 16 October 2003, and claimed that he had left Azadliq Square as soon as he saw the first signs of confrontation between demonstrators and police. The court relied on statements from more than 200 prosecution witnesses, mostly police officers and internal forces soldiers, who testified against all the demonstrators as a group, describing the public disorder which took place. During the pre-trial investigation, one police officer and one soldier were shown a photograph of the applicant and recognised him as one of the demonstrators who had been throwing stones at the police officers during the events of 16 October 2003. According to the applicant, he was not given the opportunity to meet these witnesses during the pre-trial investigation or to cross-examine them during the trial. According to the Government, the applicant’s lawyer had questioned them at the trial hearings.', '68. On 5 March 2004 the Assize Court found the applicant guilty of both the charges against him and sentenced him to four years and six months’ imprisonment.', '69. On 27 April 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. It appears from the case file that the applicant’s lawyer, but not the applicant himself, was present at the appellate hearings. On 21 December 2004 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments. The applicant was sent the full text of the Supreme Court’s decision on 5 January 2005. According to the applicant, neither he nor his lawyer were present at any of the appeal hearings.', '70. In accordance with a presidential pardon decree of 19 March 2005, the applicant was released from serving the remainder of his prison sentence. Despite his early release, in accordance with Article 83 of the Criminal Code, the applicant’s conviction would remain on his criminal record for a period of six years after he was released.', '71. In July 2005 the applicant made an application to the Gabala District Court for early expunging of the conviction from his criminal record, in accordance with Article 83.5 of the Criminal Code, taking into account his good behaviour in prison and after release. On 26 July 2005 the Gabala District Court refused this application. The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld this decision on 31 August 2005 and 22 March 2006 respectively.', '72. According to the applicant, he had intended to stand as a candidate in the parliamentary elections of 6 November 2005. However, under the electoral law, his recent conviction record precluded him from doing so.', '73. The applicant was the chairman of several non-governmental organisations dealing with issues of civil society and freedom of religion, a chief editor of a magazine and an information portal, and a religious leader of a small congregation of Muslims. During the presidential elections of 15 October 2003, he publicly supported I. Gambar.', '74. The applicant was in Azadliq Square on 16 October 2003. According to him, he left the square prior to the eruption of violence between the demonstrators and the police, and observed the subsequent events from a distant location.', '75. On 17 October 2003 the applicant was leading public prayers in Juma Mosque. During the prayers, a number of police officers surrounded the mosque with the intention of arresting the applicant. The applicant managed to avoid arrest with the aid of some “members of the international community” in Baku who, according to the applicant, included representatives of the OSCE, the Council of Europe and some foreign embassies. He was taken to the Norwegian embassy, where he remained for three days.', '76. According to the applicant, on the same day, state television reported that all the “organisers” of the public disorder of 16 October 2003 had been arrested, with the exception of the applicant and one other person.', '77. The applicant left the Norwegian embassy after receiving guarantees that “no unlawful actions would be taken against him”. Shortly thereafter, he attended a conference in Georgia. According to the applicant, during his stay in Georgia, it was reported on State television that “having committed a crime, he fled the country”. According to the applicant, a number of government officials, including the Prosecutor General, were featured in those television reports.', '78. On 1 December 2003 the applicant was summoned to the Prosecutor General’s Office. After some questioning, he was arrested in connection with the events of 16 October 2003.', '79. On 3 December 2003 the applicant was charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials”. On same day, at around 7 p.m., the Nasimi District Court remanded him in custody for three months.', '80. During the first three days of detention the applicant was kept in a cold single cell, where he had to sleep on a metal bed without a mattress. He was then transferred to a cell which had previously been used for convicts awaiting the execution of their death sentence.', '81. On 5 December 2003 the Prosecutor General sent a letter to the Head of the Baku City Executive Authority in connection with the alleged unlawfulness of the use of Juma Mosque by the applicant’s religious congregation, a matter which was not directly related to the criminal proceedings in the present case. However, among other things, the letter also contained the following statements:', '“The Prosecutor General’s Office is conducting a criminal investigation under Articles 220.1, 233 and 315.2 in connection with the mass disorder in the city of Baku on 15 and 16 October 2003 ...', 'It has been determined that Ilgar Allahverdiyev took part in the mass disorder in Baku.”', '82. The applicant was tried by the Assize Court with eight other defendants (Trial Group 13). The court relied on statements from a large number of police officers, who testified against the defendants and the demonstrators in general. Most of those statements did not relate specifically to the applicant. Two police officers testified that they had seen the applicant at Azadliq Square and that they had heard from someone that the applicant had instructed some of his followers to go to the square. The court also relied on the pre-trial deposition of a witness who failed to appear at the court hearings, despite the applicant’s requests to cross-examine him. According to the applicant, written depositions from some prosecution witnesses were identical, word for word. The court refused to hear the majority of witnesses who had been called by the applicant to testify on his behalf.', '83. On 2 April 2004 the Assize Court convicted the applicant under Articles 220.1 and 315.2 of the Criminal Code. He received a suspended sentence of five years’ imprisonment and was released immediately from the courtroom.', '84. On 25 May 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld this judgment. According to the applicant, the appellate hearing took place in the presiding judge’s office in the applicant’s absence, despite his request for the hearing to be postponed owing to his inability to attend because of illness. The hearing lasted a few minutes.', '85. On 5 April 2005 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s cassation appeal. According to the applicant, the hearing in the Supreme Court lasted six minutes.', '86. The applicant was in Azadliq Square on 16 October 2003. In the evening of the same day he was arrested after he had returned home from the demonstration, and was taken to a local police station. He was then questioned, with no lawyer present, and detained at the police station until the next day.', '87. On 17 October 2003 the applicant was formally charged with “organising or participating in public disorder” and “use of violence against public officials”. On the same day the Nasimi District Court remanded the applicant in custody for three months. During the court hearing the applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer he had not met before.', '88. The applicant was tried at the Assize Court with seven others (Trial Group 11). It appears that he was represented by another State-appointed lawyer during the trial. In his submissions to the court, the applicant denied taking part personally in any violence that had taken place during the events of 16 October 2003, and claimed that he had left Azadliq Square as soon as he saw the first signs of confrontation between demonstrators and the police.', '89. During the trial, the Assize Court relied on statements from a number of police officers and internal forces soldiers as witnesses who testified against the demonstrators. Several police officers testified that they had seen the applicant in Azadliq Square. During the pre-trial investigation two police officers had been shown a photograph of the applicant and recognised him as one of the demonstrators throwing stones at the police officers during the events of 16 October 2003. These police officers gave the same testimony during the trial. According to the applicant, he was not given the opportunity to meet these witnesses during the pre-trial investigation, or to cross-examine them during the trial.', '90. On 19 March 2004 the Assize Court found the applicant guilty of both the charges against him and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment, suspended, with a four-year probation period. The court ordered that he be released after the conviction became final following any appeals.', '91. Following an appeal by the applicant, on 24 May 2004 the Court of Appeal upheld the Assize Court’s judgment of 19 March 2004. On 30 August 2005 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments. The applicant was sent the full text of the Supreme Court’s decision on 13 October 2005.', '92. Although the applicant was released because the sentence was suspended, his conviction would remain on his criminal record for a period of six years. According to the applicant, he had intended to stand as a candidate for the parliamentary elections of 6 November 2005. However, under the electoral law, his recent conviction record precluded him from doing so.', '93. In July 2005 the applicant made an application to the Nasimi District Court for early expunging of the conviction from his criminal record. On 15 July 2005 the Nasimi District Court refused this application, noting that in accordance with the Criminal Code it was only possible for such a conviction to be expunged after the expiry of at least half the probation period, which in the applicant’s case had not yet happened. The Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court upheld this decision on 2 September 2005 and 23 March 2006 respectively. The full text of the Supreme Court’s decision of 23 March 2006 was sent to the applicant on 11 April 2006.', '94. Article 310 of the CAO provides:', 'Article 310. Deliberate non-compliance with the lawful order of a police officer or military serviceman', '“310.1.

Use of violence towards persons mentioned in Article 315.1 of this Code endangering their life or health –', 'is punishable by imprisonment for a period of three to seven years.”', '97. Under Article 455 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCrP”), the finding of a violation of the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms by the European Court of Human Rights is a ground for reopening the proceedings. Pursuant to Article 456, in this case, the Plenum of the Supreme Court examines the case exclusively on points of law. After the examination of the case, the Plenum of the Supreme Court may decide to quash the lower courts’ rulings and remit the case to the relevant lower court, or to vary the decision of the courts of cassation or other courts, or to quash the decision of the courts of cassation or other courts and deliver a new decision (Article 459 of the CCrP).', '98. According to Articles 13.3.1 and 13.3.2 of the Electoral Code, persons imprisoned pursuant to a final court judgment and persons convicted of criminal offences indicated in Articles 15.4 and 15.5 of the Criminal Code do not have a right to stand for election in parliamentary, presidential and municipal elections (see also paragraph 101 below).', '99. Article 15 of the Criminal Code classifies criminal offences by degree of gravity into offences which do not pose a major public threat, “less serious” criminal offences, serious criminal offences and especially serious criminal offences. According to Article 15.3, a “less serious criminal offence” is an offence committed deliberately or negligently for which the maximum punishment does not exceed seven years’ imprisonment. According to Article 15.4, a “serious criminal offence” is an offence committed deliberately or negligently for which the maximum punishment does not exceed twelve years’ imprisonment. According to Article 15.5, an “especially serious criminal offence” is an offence committed deliberately for which the punishment exceeds twelve years’ imprisonment.', '100. The maximum sentence for a criminal offence under Article 220 of the Criminal Code is twelve years’ imprisonment (see paragraph 95 above); accordingly, pursuant to Article 15.4 of the same Code, it is considered a “serious criminal offence”.', '101. According to Article 83.1 of the Criminal Code, a person convicted pursuant to a final court judgment is considered a “convicted person” from the date the judgment enters into force until the date the conviction is expunged from his or her criminal record. According to Article 83.4 of the Criminal Code, the criminal conviction of a person convicted of a “serious criminal offence” is expunged after the expiry of a period of six years from the date he or she completed serving the sentence imposed.

GERMANY (ARTICLE 50),2,Non-pecuniary damage - financial award;Costs and expenses award - domestic proceedings;Costs and expenses award - Convention proceedings,,"['8. The only outstanding matter to be settled is the question of the application of Article 50 (art. 50) in the present case. Accordingly, as regards the facts, the Court will confine itself here to giving some brief particulars; for the remaining details, reference should be made to paragraphs 15 to 81 of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978 (ibid., pp. 7-27).', '9. That judgment concerned the length of actions brought by Dr. König before the Frankfurt Administrative Court in 1967 and in 1971 to challenge, respectively, the withdrawal of the permit to run his clinic and the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise medicine.', 'In the second matter, the Administrative Court had dismissed the applicant’s action by a judgment delivered on 9 June 1976 which had been affirmed by the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal on 2 May 1978. Dr. König lodged an appeal (Nichtzulässigkeitsbeschwerde) and an application to quash (Revision) but these were rejected by the Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht), in two final decisions, on 10 September and 18 October 1979.', 'In the case concerning the clinic, the Frankfurt Administrative Court had dismissed Dr. König’s action on 22 June 1977. An appeal by him against that decision is still pending before the Hessen Administrative Court of Appeal which, with the agreement of the parties, stayed the proceedings on 21 February 1979 pending the outcome of the above-mentioned proceedings before the Federal Administrative Court.', '10. After delivery of the Court’s judgment of 28 June 1978, the Government and the applicant attempted, with the Commission’s assistance, to arrive at a friendly settlement of the latter’s claims, details whereof had been given by Mr. Hofferbert in his letter of 18 September 1978 (see paragraph 3 above). The attempt met with failure in November 1978: Dr. König found that the Government’s offer of DM 20,000 in full and final settlement was not sufficient.', '11. The applicant seeks pecuniary compensation for the two heads of damage allegedly caused to him by the violation of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1): he maintains that his financial and professional situation may have been permanently ruined and, secondly, that his personal and professional reputation had been indirectly lowered. Without quantifying his claims, he furnishes certain particulars – regarding notably the average annual income he could have anticipated as a medical practitioner and as the head of a clinic - on the basis of which he considers it possible to gauge the extent of his aggregate loss and to assess the fraction thereof attributable to the fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded. In addition, the applicant asks for reimbursement of the expenses he incurred both in Germany, in order to expedite the hearing of his actions, and before the Convention institutions.', 'Dr. König leaves the assessment of the sum to be awarded to him to the Court’s discretion, thereby confirming the position he had adopted in 1977 (Series A no. 27, p. 41, par. 113).', '12. In their observations of 6 October 1978 (see paragraph 3 above), the Commission’s Delegates stated that they did not wish to comment on the first of the applicant’s claims which they saw as being concerned with the consequences of the two withdrawals of authorisation; at the hearing, they submitted that in their opinion the attribution of specific material losses to the breach found by the Court was impossible, at least on the strength of the evidence before it. On the other hand, the Delegates suggest that account should be taken of the fact that the applicant was left in a prolonged state of uncertainty as to his professional future, and this at a time of life - between the ages of forty-nine (in 1967) and sixty (in 1978) - when a man is normally at the peak of his career. They also consider that the breach of Article 6 par. 1 (art. 6-1), taken by itself, may be another factor having a bearing on an award of just satisfaction.', 'As far as concerns the costs of the proceedings, the expenditure incurred by Dr. König in order to expedite the domestic litigation and to present his case in Strasbourg is regarded by the Delegates as a relevant item. They express no firm view as to whether the same applies to the expenditure arising from his applications to the German courts for restoration of the suspensive effect of his appeal against the withdrawal of the authorisation to practise; in their opinion, those applications were aimed not at speeding up the proceedings but at limiting the consequences of their excessive length. Neither do the Delegates comment on the justification for the figures given by the applicant.', '13. The Government’s position is as follows: there is no causal link between the breach found by the Court and the alleged damage to Dr. König’s professional career; on the other hand, ""reasonable"", ""necessary"" and proven costs resulting from the exercise of the domestic legal remedies can give rise to compensation to the extent that those remedies were aimed at accelerating the procedure; furthermore, the ""reasonable costs"" incurred in connection with the proceedings before the Convention institutions should be reimbursed; finally, it is for the Court to determine whether the applicant should be awarded monetary compensation for the ""non-material"" injury he suffered by reason of the mere fact that the ""reasonable time"" was exceeded.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

ROMANIA,4,Inadmissible,Alvina Gyulumyan;Corneliu Bîrsan;Egbert Myjer;Ineta Ziemele;Josep Casadevall;Kristina Pardalos;Luis López Guerra;Mihai Poalelungi,"['1. The applicants, Mr Cristian Ciubotaru, Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, Mr Vasile Vâtu, Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Ana Ciubotaru, Ms Ana Romaşcu, Ms Eva Ciubotaru, Mr Aurel Călin and Ms Elena Avădanii, are Romanian nationals who were born on 15 December 1980, 1 March 1978, 27 January 1987, 3 November 1950, 18 March 1930 and on other unspecified dates and who live in Buhuşi, Romania. Romani Criss is a Romanian nongovernmental organisation located in Bucharest. They were all represented before the Court by Mr I. Lazăr, a lawyer practising in Bucharest. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Răzvan-Horaţiu Radu, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '3. On 3 December 2002 the Bacău and Neamţ Police Departments set up an operation to capture six Roma people, including Mr Cristian and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr Florin Călin, who lived in the town of Buhuşi and were suspected of a number of unlawful acts, including a robbery a few days earlier. The police operation was set up on the basis of an order of 28 November 2002 issued by the Romanian General Police Department attached to the Romanian Ministry of the Interior concerning the identification and capture of, inter alia, the abovementioned individuals. The police officers were divided into six teams and instructed to surround the town in order to prevent the wanted individuals from fleeing, to identify the homes of the suspects and to descend on the suspects’ homes simultaneously.', '4. On 5 December 2002 fortyfive police officers from the Bacău and Neamţ Special Intervention Units and other regular police stations gathered and descended on the town of Buhuşi. After searching the suspects’ homes, the police discovered that some of them were hiding in an abandoned house in the town. The police units surrounded the house. At this point other Roma people started gathering in the street, some of them armed with stones, wooden posts and axes, and started a violent demonstration against the police officers. A further sixty police officers were called in support as a result of the violent behaviour of the crowd.', '5. The police asked the occupants of the house twice to give themselves up, and when they failed to respond the police started using tear gas to draw them out of the house. After tear gas had been used officer D.C. negotiated with the occupants of the house for approximately ten minutes, trying to persuade them to give themselves up, but one of the suspects attacked him with an axe. More tear gas was used and another attempt at negotiation was made by D.C., but the police officer was attacked once more by the occupants of the house. The police officers used tear gas for a third time and two of the applicants, Mr Cristian Ciubotaru and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, as well as another suspect, Mr Florin Călin, came out of the house. Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr Florin Călin attacked police officer D.C. with axes. Police officer D.C. and his colleague N.N. opened fire in the direction of Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr Florin Călin. As a result, Mr Florin Călin was shot in the thorax and stomach and died at the scene. Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru was shot in the back and taken to hospital.', '6. In the course of this incident two people in the crowd were also shot. The crowd became violent and some of the people in the crowd, including Mr Gelu Ciubotaru, started attacking the police officers. The officers launched verbal warnings and fired into the air to disperse the crowd and stop the attackers. Mr Gelu Ciubotaru attacked the police officers with a wooden post and grabbed police officer C.V.S. by the neck and hit him. Consequently, officer N.N., who had also been injured by the crowd, started firing at Mr Gelu Ciubotaru’s feet and then at his upper body. Mr Gelu Ciubotaru was shot in the thorax and died at the scene. Mr Vasile Vâtu, a minor at the time of the events, was also shot in the right side of the thorax and was taken to hospital. According to the forensic report, quoted by the prosecutor at the conclusion of the criminal investigation which followed the incident, some of the parties injured in the events required the following number of days of medical care: eighteen days for Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, twelve to fourteen days for Mr Vasile Vâtu, twenty four to twenty six days for officer N.N., and thirtyfive to forty days for officer C.V.S. Two other officers who were part of the support group called in to help the police officers who initiated the operation were also injured: E.I. had a serious eye injury which almost caused him permanent blindness, while D.C. received a leg injury.', '7. On 5 December 2002 Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Ana Romaşcu, Ms Eva Ciubotaru and Ms Ana Ciubotaru signed authorisations for Romani Criss, a Romanian nongovernmental organisation whose purpose is to defend the rights of the Roma community in Romania, to represent them before the state institutions, including, inter alia, the police, the prosecutors’ offices and the civilian and military courts in respect of the events of 5 December 2002. There is no evidence in the file that the remaining applicants signed similar authorisations. The signatures of the four applicants on the authorisations signed on 5 December 2002, on the criminal complaints lodged against the police officers involved in the events of 5 December 2002 and on the powers of attorney signed by them on 16 August 2006 authorising their lawyer Mr I. Lazăr to represent them before the Court, appear not to match.', '8. Romani Criss also authorised legal representatives of its own choice to assist and represent it throughout the entire proceedings.', '9. On an unspecified date in December 2002 the applicant Ana Romaşcu lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had shot Mr Vasile Vâtu, her son, who was a minor. Her complaint does not contain any indication that she would have liked to lodge a complaint on her own behalf.', '10. On unspecified dates the applicants Cristian and Ovidiu Ciubotaru also lodged criminal complaints against the police officers involved in the events of 5 December 2002. Mr Cristian Ciubotaru argued that he had been hit several times on the head and body and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru stated that he had been shot four times, although neither of them was resisting arrest. The applicants’ signatures on the complaints lodged against the police officers appear not to match their signatures on the powers of attorney of 16 August 2006 authorising Mr I. Lazăr to represent them before the Court.', '11. On an unspecified date Mr Vasile Călin also lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had shot and killed Mr Florin Călin, his son. His complaint does not contain any indication that he would have liked to complain against the police officers on his own behalf. A second power of attorney of 16 August 2006 available in the file on Mr Vasile Călin’s name authorising Mr I. Lazăr to represent him before the Court was signed by Ms Elena Avădanii. Apart from her signature, Ms Elena Avădanii’s name does not appear on any of the powers of attorney available to the file authorising Mr I. Lazăr to represent the applicants before the Court.', '12. On an unspecified date Ms Eva Ciubotaru lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had shot and killed Mr Gelu Ciubotaru, her husband. Her complaint does not contain any indication that she would have liked to make a complaint against the police officers on her own behalf.', '13. On an unspecified date the applicant Ana Ciubotaru lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers involved in the events of 5 December 2002. She stated that while she was trying to reach her dead son, Mr Gelu Ciubotaru, the police officers hit her on the back and head and pushed her into a ditch. She also stated that she was 75 years old at the time and could have not been seen as a threat by the officers.', '14. Between 5 December 2002 and 28 February 2003 the domestic authorities heard victims of the events and their relatives, people who had been in the crowd, and suspected offenders, as well as other police officers who had taken part in the operation. Approximately sixtyfive people were heard by the authorities.', '15. On 6 December 2002 the police officers provided the Forensic Service of the Neamţ Police Department with two axes, allegedly used by the applicants to attack them on 5 December 2002. The same axes were delivered on 13 December 2002 to the prosecutor investigating the case.', '16. On 6 December 2002 the Forensic Department of the Bacău County Hospital produced a forensic expert report on the bullet wounds sustained by Mr Vasile Vâtu and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and autopsy reports on the deceased, Gelu Ciubotaru and Florin Călin. According to the reports Mr Vasile Vâtu had been shot on 5 December 2002 from the right with a firearm, using balls as ammunition. Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru had been shot twice, once in the left cheek and once in the left thigh. The wounds were not lifethreatening to any of the applicants. Furthermore, according to the autopsy reports Mr Gelu Ciubotaru had been shot twice, first in the right thigh and then in the thorax, the latter wound causing his death. Mr Florin Călin had been shot five times, the first three times in the left thigh, then once in the right thigh and lastly, once in the thorax. The wounds to his thighs had been caused by metal bullets. The wound in the thorax was the only one responsible for his death and had been caused by a rubber bullet fired at close range from a distance equal to the length of the barrel of the gun it had been fired from.', '17. On 9 December 2002 the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office investigated the scene of the crime and gathered the evidence found, including stones, wooden posts or sticks, parts of the wall penetrated by bullets, traces of blood and bullet shells for further examination.', '18. On 20 January 2003 the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office ordered a ballistic expert report on the weapons fired on the day of the events.', '19. On 25 March 2003 Romani Criss informed the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office about the events of 5 December 2002 and complained that police officers had shot and injured members of the Roma community. On the same date they submitted testimonial evidence gathered from people who had witnessed the events.', '20. The investigation of the abovementioned incident was completed when the criminal investigation was discontinued by a Bacău prosecutor’s office order of 7 July 2003. The actions of officers D.C. and N.N were investigated on accusations of the crimes of murder and causing physical injuries, as were the actions of Mr Gelu Ciubotaru, Mr Florin Călin, Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr Cristian Ciubotaru for the crime of insulting behaviour towards a State agent. The investigating prosecutor held that the use of force by the two policemen against Mr Gelu Ciubotaru, Mr Florin Călin, Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru and Mr Cristian Ciubotaru was justified because of the behaviour of the victims, which resulted in the policemen having to resort to legitimate self-defence. The investigating prosecutor, although he referred to Mr Vasile Vâtu’s case, did not identify the person responsible for shooting him and did not state whether or not the proceedings would be discontinued in respect of his injury. The investigation in respect of Mr Gelu Ciubotaru and Mr Florin Călin was terminated because of their deaths, and that in respect of the applicants Mr Cristian and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru was terminated because it was held that their behaviour did not constitute a crime. The prosecutor’s decision quotes the results of the forensic reports conducted in respect of all the victims of the incident but did not mention the evidence which led to the non-indictment conclusion.', '21. On 24 July 2003 Mr Vasile Călin, the father of the deceased Florin Călin, lodged a complaint with the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office concerning unreasonable length of the criminal investigation launched in respect of the events of 5 December 2002, and challenged the outcome of the investigation.', '22. The Bacău Prosecutor’s Office dismissed Mr Vasile Călin’s complaint by an order of 23 September 2003. The prosecutor’s office held that the proceedings had not been excessively lengthy, given the number of ballistic and forensic reports carried out and the large number of witnesses heard, and that his son had been killed by the police officers in self defence.', '23. On 21 November 2003 Romani Criss challenged the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office decision of 7 July 2003 in so far as the decision regarding the investigated policemen was concerned on behalf of Mr Cristian Ciubotaru, Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Ana Romaşcu, and Ms Eva Ciubotaru.', '24. By an order of 3 December 2003 the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the challenge on the ground that the police officers had acted in legitimate selfdefence. Also, in respect of Mr Vasile Vâtu the unlawful act lacked a physicalinjury element. The Prosecutor’s Office acknowledged the challenge lodged by Romani Criss, to be introduced only on behalf of Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Ana Romaşcu and Ms Eva Ciubotaru. The Prosecutor’s Office held that according to the available evidence Mr Florin Călin and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru were shot by C.D. and N.N. while they were preparing to hit C.D. with an axe. At the same time, Mr Vasile Vâtu could not be seen by the policemen because he was hidden behind a wall made of sawdust when he was shot in the thorax. The wound did not endanger his life.', '25. On 19 December 2003 Romani Criss appealed against the Bacău Prosecutor’s Order of 7 July 2003 before the domestic courts. The appeal was also lodged on behalf of Cristian Ciubotaru, Ovidiu Ciubotaru, Ana Romaşcu, Vasile Călin and Ana Ciubotaru, but it had not been signed by those five individuals. The applicant organisation argued that according to the witness statements and the evidence available to the file the domestic authorities tried to protect the police officers, who on 5 December 2002 acted in an uncoordinated manner, misused their firearms and breached the applicable legal provisions in force at the time protecting the applicants’ right to life and their right not to be subject to inhuman and degrading treatment in a discriminatory way.', '26. On 13 and 28 January 2004 respectively Ms Ana Ciubotaru and Mr Vasile Călin died.', '27. By a judgement of 20 February 2004 the Bacău Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the applicants against the prosecutor’s orders. The court dismissed the preliminary objection raised by the Prosecutor’s Office and the two accused, namely that Romani Criss did not have standing to bring proceedings before the domestic courts concerning the events of 5 December 2002. The court held that because Romani Criss considered that Roma persons had been victims of discrimination they decided to represent them before the domestic courts in accordance with the authorisations signed by some of the parties concerned on 5 December 2002. The organisation also lodged a complaint before the domestic courts on its own behalf. Taking into account the organisation’s object of activity and the provisions of section 22 of Emergency Ordinance no. 77/2003, the court considered that it could not deny in principle the organisation’s legitimate interest and its standing to bring proceedings against state bodies in order to establish whether ethnic discrimination had occurred and whether the rights of its citizens had been protected. In respect of the merits of the case the court held, inter alia, that the operation of 5 December 2002 had been a work mission and all the police officers involved had been ordered to take part in it. However, the investigation into the events had not been carried out correctly. In particular, the wounding of the police officers E.I. and D.C. was not directly relevant to the claim of selfdefence, as the two police officers previously mentioned had been wounded in the final stages of the operation, when the police were retreating from the town, while the firearms had been used by the policemen at an earlier stage of the events. Moreover, the forensic expert report carried out over the course of the investigation did not establish with certainty if the rubber bullet Mr Florin Călin had been shot with by officer D.C. could have been the only cause of death in the absence of the rest of the shots. The court considered that this was an important factor in determining the identity of the perpetrator of the killing, considering that the same person had been shot almost simultaneously by police officer N.N., using live ammunition. Furthermore, the two axes allegedly used by Mr Florin Călin and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru had not been forensically checked for their fingerprints. The court held that such evidence was important to determine whether the use of firearms by the officers had been justified. In addition, the investigation failed to determine the exact position of the other members of the police force and whether they could have stopped Mr Florin Călin’s attack against D.C. At the same time, the investigation had failed to establish the distance and the angle from which Mr Ovidiu Ciubotariu had been shot. The circumstances of Mr Vasile Vâtu’s shooting had also not been clarified by the investigation in view of the parties’ statements, in particular there was no lawful explanation concerning why he had been shot through a wall or precisely when he had been shot during the operation. Lastly, the file did not contain sufficient evidence concerning the reasons for the police operation to capture the applicants: in particular, the court considered that the orders to seek and capture the applicants, the documents containing the charges against them and the arrest warrants issued in their names were missing from the file. Consequently, the court decided to send the case back to the prosecutor’s office in order to supplement the criminal investigation.', '28. D.C., N.N. and the Bacău Prosecutor’s Office lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against the judgment of 20 February 2004. They argued, inter alia, that the complaints lodged by Romani Criss before the domestic courts on behalf of the applicants contesting the prosecutor’s office’s order to discontinue the criminal investigation was not valid. In particular the authorisations signed by some of the applicants allowing Romani Criss to represent them before the courts did not comply with the formal requirements for powers of attorney provided by the applicable rules of criminal procedure. In addition, they submitted that the evidence in the file proved that the police officers had acted in selfdefence.', '29. On 20 May 2004 the Forensic Department attached to the Romanian Ministry of the Interior informed the investigating authorities that the axes allegedly used by Mr Florin Călin and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru to attack the police officers had wooden handles which were uneven and pitted. Consequently, the Forensic Department did not have substances or a method allowing them to examine fingerprints on such surfaces.', '30. At the hearings of 21 May, 24 September, 19 November and 17 December 2004 the Court of Cassation adjourned the proceedings on account of procedural errors in summoning the parties and in order to allow them to read the written submissions attached to the file.', '31. At the hearing of 11 February 2005 the Court of Cassation heard oral submissions from the parties and, because it needed time to deliberate, adjourned the proceedings to 25 February, 3 March and to 8 April 2005.', '32. By a final judgment of 8 April 2005 the Court of Cassation allowed the appeals on points of law by C.D., N.N. and the Prosecutor’s Office, quashed the judgment of 20 February 2004 and declared inadmissible the applicants’ and Romani Criss’s complaints against the Prosecutor Office order of 7 July 2003. It held that none of the natural persons had contested the prosecutor’s office’s order to discontinue the criminal investigation before the domestic courts. Only Mr Vasile Călin lodged a complaint against the prosecutor’s office’s order of 7 July 2003, which was dismissed on 23 September 2003. He did not challenge the latter decision before the domestic courts. Moreover, none of the applicants had personally signed the challenge lodged by Romani Criss on their behalf. In addition, the appeal lodged by Romani Criss on behalf of the applicants against the prosecutor’s office’s order for the investigation to be discontinued was invalid. The nongovernmental organisation had not been empowered by the applicants to represent them before domestic courts on the form required by the applicable rules of criminal procedure, in particular Article 222 (3) of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure, and therefore the organisation could not be considered to be the applicants’ representative. The applicants had not provided Romani Criss with a special and certified power of attorney as required by law. In so far as Romani Criss’s argument was concerned, that on the basis of section 22 of Emergency Ordinance no. 137/2002 it had legal standing to bring proceedings before domestic courts, the court noted that the organisation had not sustained any prejudice as a result of the incident complained of, and the police action of 5 December 2002 concerned the taking into custody of wanted individuals, and did not represent acts of discrimination as required by section 22 of Emergency Ordinance no. 137/2002. Consequently, it held that Romani Criss did not have legal standing to bring proceedings before the domestic courts.', '33. The applicants lodged their application before the Court with a letter dated 26 August 2005. The initial application form attached to the letter contained the names of Mr Cristian and Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, Ms Ana Romaşcu with the note that she was representing Mr Vasile Vâtu, Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Ana Ciubotaru and the organisation Romani Criss. The application form was signed by Mr I. Lazăr, as the applicants’ representative. No powers of attorney were attached to the application. The applicants complained that some of them had sustained bullet wounds and some of their relatives had been killed, but none of them referred, either expressly or in substance, to any other complaints as a result of other types of injury sustained.', '34. Following the Court’s request on 16 September 2005 the applicants’ representative submitted powers of attorney signed on 16 August 2006 by all the initial applicants, including Mr Vasile Călin and Ms Ana Ciubotaru. In respect of Mr Vasile Călin, Mr I. Lazăr submitted two powers of attorney bearing his name, one of them signed however by Ms Elena Avădanii, whose name does not appear on any of the other powers of attorney. Moreover, Mr Vasile Vâtu’s name and/or signature were not present on any of the powers of attorney submitted before the Court. In addition, one of the powers of attorney had been filled in and signed by Ms Eva Ciubotaru.', '35. On 31 January 2007 the Court received six sets of application forms which contained complaints identical to the ones mentioned in the first application form submitted by the applicants. Each application form bears the name of a different applicant, as follows: Mr Cristian Ciubotaru, Mr Ovidiu Ciubotaru, Ms Ana Romaşcu, Mr Vasile Călin, Ms Eva Ciubotaru and the organisation Romani Criss.', '36. The name of Mr Aurel Călin does not appear on any of the application forms or the powers of attorney submitted by the applicants at any stage of the proceedings before the Court.', '37. Article 197 (2) and (3) of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure provides, inter alia, that the breach of the rules concerning the lodging of a complaint before the court renders the complaint null and void. The nullity cannot be corrected and can be examined at any stage of the proceedings as well as by the court of its own motion.', '38. Article 222 (3) of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a complaint can be lodged by a person, either on their own behalf or through a representative authorised by a certified mandate attached to the complaint.', '39. The relevant legal provisions, in particular a description of the development of the law concerning complaints against decisions of the prosecutor (Articles 278 and 2781 of the Romanian Code of Criminal Procedure introduced by Law no. 281/2003 applicable from 1 January 2004), are set forth in the judgment of Dumitru Popescu v. Romania ((no. 1), no. 49234/99, §§ 4345, 26 April 2007).', '40. Section 22 (1) and (2) of Emergency Ordinance no. 137/2000 on combating discrimination provides that nongovernmental organisations involved in the protection of human rights, or justifying a legitimate interest in combating discrimination, have legal standing to initiate proceedings if the discrimination occurs in their field of activity and targets a community or a group of people. They also have legal standing in cases where discrimination targets an individual at the latter’s request.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Mr Vladislav Šimka, is a Slovak national who was born in 1956 and lives in Bratislava. He was represented before the Court by Ms V. Strážnická, a lawyer practising in Bratislava.', '3. The applicant held the post of Head of Service Office (vedúci služobného úradu) at the Ministry of the Interior.', '4. On 1 June 2005 the President of the State Civil Service Office (Úrad pre štátnu službu) removed the applicant from that post with effect from 2 June 2005, with reference to section 10(4) and (11)(d) as well as section 27(e) of the State Civil Service Act 2001. The decision indicated that it had been taken at the behest of the Minister of the Interior.', '5. Subsequently the applicant declined the offer of a transfer to a different position within the Ministry of the Interior.', '6. On 8 June 2005 the Ministry of the Interior issued a decision indicating that the applicant had lost the status of State civil servant on that day.', '7. On 15 June 2005 the applicant appealed against the decisions of 1 June 2005. He argued that neither the decision nor the Minister’s letter to which it referred gave any reasons for his removal. The decision interfered with his fundamental rights and was discriminatory. In particular, section 10(11)(d) of the State Civil Service Act 2001 allowed for removal of the then thirteen heads of different ministries Offices solely on the recommendation of the Minister concerned. However, some 40,000 State civil servants holding different posts could only be removed for reasons provided for by the law. The decision to remove the applicant without justification was also contrary to the principles underlying the Administrative Proceedings Act 1967.', '8. On 21 June 2005 the applicant appealed against the decision terminating his status as State civil servant. He gave reasons for his appeal against the decision.', '9. On 29 June and 24 August 2005 respectively the President of the State Civil Service Office dismissed both the applicant’s appeals. Those decisions stated that under section 10(11)(d) of the State Civil Service Act 2001 the President of the State Civil Service Office was obliged to remove the head of a ministry office at the behest of the Minister concerned. There was no requirement for reasons to be given for such a recommendation. The subsequent termination of the applicant’s status as State civil servant conformed to section 40(2)(c) of the State Civil Service Act 2001.', '10. On 30 August 2005 the applicant brought an action with the Supreme Court. He sought a review of the administrative decisions of 1 June and 29 June 2005 removing him from the post of Head of Office at the Ministry of the Interior. He argued that he had been discriminated against in that he had been removed without reasons being given. The applicant proposed that the Supreme Court should stay the proceedings on his action and request the Constitutional Court to examine the conformity of section 10(11)(d) of the State Civil Service Act 2001 with, inter alia, Article 36(b) of the Constitution, Article 14 of the Convention, and directives of the European Union.', '11. On 28 September 2005 the Supreme Court transferred the case to the Bratislava Regional Court for reasons of jurisdiction.', '12. On 30 July 2007 the Bratislava Regional Court stayed the proceedings, as it considered the relevant provision of the State Civil Service Act 2001 to run contrary to the Constitution and Article 14 of the Convention. It referred that issue for determination by the Constitutional Court.', '13. On 9 April 2008 the Constitutional Court discontinued the proceedings, because section 10(11)(d) of the State Civil Service Act 2001 had been repealed with effect from 1 January 2007. The decision stated that the Constitutional Court’s power to review conformity of legal rules with the Constitution extended exclusively to those rules which were actually in force. Three constitutional judges attached a dissenting opinion to that conclusion.', '14. On 2 October 2008 the Bratislava Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s action. It found that the applicant had been removed at the behest of the Minister of the Interior pursuant to section 10(11)(d) of the State Civil Service Act 2001, as in force at the relevant time. There had been no breach of the applicable law in that context.', '15. The applicant appealed. He noted that the Regional Court itself had expressed the view that the provision under which the applicant had been removed ran contrary to the Constitution and international treaties by which Slovakia was bound. In the absence of a decision of the Constitutional Court on conformity with the Constitution of the relevant legal rule, the issue fell to be determined by the ordinary court dealing with the case. To proceed in a different manner would amount to a denial of justice.', '16. On 21 October 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the first-instance judgment. It held that the applicant’s removal from post had been in accordance with the law. The ordinary courts within the administrative judiciary were not called upon to determine conflicts of law. Their role was restricted to examining whether administrative decisions complied with applicable law.', '17. On 13 September 2005 the applicant brought an action with the Supreme Court in which he challenged the decisions of 8 June and 24 August 2005 terminating his status as civil servant. With reference to the reasons for his action of 30 August 2005 seeking review of the administrative decisions, the applicant argued that the contested decisions were unlawful and contrary to the Constitution and international treaties by which Slovakia was bound. As in his previous action, the applicant asked for the proceedings to be stayed and for the Constitutional Court to be petitioned for a review of the constitutionality of the relevant provision of the State Civil Service Act 2001.', '18. On 26 October 2005 the Supreme Court transferred the case to the Bratislava Regional Court for reasons of jurisdiction.', '19. On 2 October 2008 the Regional Court dismissed the action. It noted that, following his removal as Head of Office at the Ministry of the Interior, the applicant had been offered three different posts at that Ministry. After he had declined those offers, his status as State civil servant had been terminated pursuant to section 40(2)(c) of the State Civil Service Act 2001. There had been no breach of the applicable law in that context.', '20. On 30 October 2008 the applicant appealed. He argued that his removal from the position of Head of Office had been unlawful and that judicial proceedings concerning that issue were pending. The applicant asked for the proceedings to be discontinued pending the final determination of the action concerning the lawfulness of his removal.', '21. On 21 October 2009 the Supreme Court upheld the first-instance judgment. With reference to the reasons for its judgment of 21 October 2009 it concluded that the applicant’s status as civil servant had been terminated in accordance with the law.', '22. On 18 January 2010 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court. He alleged that the Supreme Court’s two judgments of 21 October 2009 breached his rights under Articles 6 § 1 and 14 of the Convention, as well as their constitutional equivalents, and also his right under Article 36b of the Constitution to protection against arbitrary dismissal and discrimination in employment. In particular, the applicant asserted that the ordinary courts had decided arbitrarily, while disregarding the discriminatory nature of the legal provision pursuant to which he had been removed.', '23. On 5 February 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint. It noted that the primary issue was conformity of the relevant statutory provision with the Constitution and international treaties. However, such decisions lay within the power of the Constitutional Court in plenary session, and they could not be addressed in the context of individual complaints under Article 127 of the Constitution. In those circumstances, both the Constitutional Court and the ordinary courts were bound by the presumption that the relevant statutory provision was in conformity with the Constitution.', '24. The Constitutional Court concluded that in the judgments complained of the Supreme Court had given relevant reasons for its conclusions which were not arbitrary.', '25. Article 7 § 5 provides, inter alia, that international treaties on human rights ratified and promulgated in accordance with the law take precedence over laws.', '26. Article 36(b) guarantees protection for employees against arbitrary dismissal and discrimination.', '27. Pursuant to Article 125 § 1(a), the Constitutional Court decides on conformity of laws with the Constitution, constitutional laws, and international treaties approved by the National Council which have been duly ratified and promulgated.', '28. Article 127 § 1 entitles the Constitutional Court to decide on complaints lodged by natural or legal persons alleging a violation of their fundamental rights or freedoms or of human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in international treaties ratified by Slovakia, unless the protection of such rights and freedoms falls within the jurisdiction of a different court.', '29. Article 144 § 1 provides for independence of judges in the exercise of their function. When deciding on cases judges are bound by the Constitution, constitutional laws and international treaties referred to, inter alia, in Article 7 § 5 of the Constitution and laws.', '30. Pursuant to Article 144 § 2, where a court considers that a legally binding legal rule or a part thereof bearing on the matter before it is contrary to the Constitution, a constitutional law, an international treaty within the meaning of Article 7 § 5, or a law, it is to stay the proceedings and petition for proceedings to be brought under Article 125 § 1 of the Constitution. The legal opinion set out in the Constitutional Court’s decision is binding on the court concerned.', '31. Under Article 152 § 4, the interpretation and application of constitutional laws, laws and other generally binding legal rules must conform to the Constitution.', '32. Pursuant to Article 109 § 1(b), a court stays proceedings where, before determination of the merits, it concludes that the generally binding legal rule bearing on the case before it is contrary to the Constitution, a law, or an international treaty by which Slovakia is bound. In such an event it petitions the Constitutional Court for determination of that issue.', '33. At the material time the relevant provisions of the State Civil Service Act 2001 (Zákon o štátnej službe a zmene niektorých zákonov) provided as follows.', '34. Pursuant to section 1(1), the purpose of the Act is to govern legal relations in the context of the State civil service, namely the rights and obligations of the State and the civil servant in that context. Subsection 2 of section 1 lists professionalism, political independence and impartiality among the principles on which the State civil service is built.', '35. Section 7(1)(a) lists ministries and other central State administration bodies as “service offices” (služobný úrad) for the purpose of the Act.', '36. Pursuant to section 10(1), the head of a service office is the hierarchical superior of all the employees working in that service office. Subsection 3 of section 10 provides for appointment of heads of service offices at ministries at the behest of the minister concerned from among applicants who have been successful in the selection process.', '37. Section 10(11) provides for dismissal of a head of a service office at a ministry in the following cases:', '(a) failure to meet objectives set;', '(b) inability, for health reasons, to carry out the required duties for more than six months;', '(c) at his or her own written request;', '(d) on the Minister’s written recommendation; and', '(e) where the service office concerned has ceased to exist.', '38. Sub-section 12 of section 10 provides for a head of a service office who has been removed to be transferred to a different appropriate civil service post unless a different agreement is reached.', '39. Section 40(2)(c) allows for termination of a person’s status as a State civil servant where a head of a service office who has been removed cannot be transferred to an equivalent post because no such equivalent post exists, and where no other agreement has been reached. Two months’ salary is to be paid to the person concerned in such a case.', '40. With effect from 1 January 2007 the State Civil Service Act 2001 was amended in that, inter alia, subsections 9 to 13 were deleted from section 10. The reports accompanying the draft amendments indicated that their purpose was to eliminate shortcomings resulting from earlier amendments and to harmonise the removal of heads of service offices who fell under the direct managerial responsibility of politically nominated superiors at ministries and other central authorities of the State administration.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-121998,ENG,DEU,ADMISSIBILITY,2013,PERUZZO AND MARTENS v. GERMANY,3,Inadmissible,André Potocki;Angelika Nußberger;Ann Power-Forde;Helena Jäderblom;Mark Villiger;Paul Lemmens,"['1. The applicant in the first case, Mr Antonio Peruzzo (hereinafter also referred to as “the first applicant”), is an Italian national, who was born in 1957 and lives in Freienbach, Switzerland. He was represented before the Court by the law firm Endriß, Müller, Malek, Phleps & colleagues, Freiburg, Germany.', '2. The applicant in the second case, Mr Uwe Martens (hereinafter also referred to as “the second applicant”), is a German national, who was born in 1976 and lives in Nuremberg.', '4. The instant applications relate to decisions by the domestic courts ordering the taking of cellular material from the applicants, who had both been convicted of criminal offences in the past. The measures were ordered pursuant to Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung - see Relevant domestic law below) outside pending criminal proceedings at the prosecution authorities’ request with a view to determining the applicants’ DNA profiles for identification purposes on the occasion of future criminal proceedings.', '5. The courts ordered in each case that in the event the applicants should refuse to voluntarily provide cellular material by means of a saliva sample, a blood sample was to be taken from them by a doctor in accordance with Article 81a § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see Relevant domestic law below). They further specified that any cellular material obtained from the applicants had to be handed over to the expert in charge of its examination without disclosing the applicants’ identity, that the sample was to be used exclusively for the molecular genetic examinations referred to in Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that it was to be destroyed without delay once it was no longer required for establishing the applicants’ DNA profiles.', '6. In its related decision of 2 February 2007 with respect to Mr Peruzzo the Freiburg District Court noted that the first applicant had been convicted by a judgment of the Karlsruhe Regional Court dated 25 January 2006 of six counts of drug trafficking and been sentenced to an aggregate prison sentence of five years and nine months. On four occasions the crime had been preceded by the offence of illicit importation of drugs and on two occasions the first applicant had in addition instigated the illicit importation of drugs. The District Court further pointed to two previous convictions of Mr Peruzzo in Switzerland for having infringed the Swiss Narcotics Law. It referred in this context to judgments by the Horgen District Court (Bezirksgericht) dated 10 February 1982 and by the Schwyz Canton Criminal Court dated 22 April 2005 imposing a prison sentence of two years and 8 months and a suspended prison sentence of 15 months respectively.', '7. In view of the seriousness of the offences committed in the past and the resulting negative criminal prognosis for the first applicant, the Freiburg District Court found that the order to take a DNA sample from him and the execution of such measure were proportionate.', '8. By a decision of 25 April 2007 the Freiburg Regional Court, endorsing the Freiburg District Court’s decision, dismissed the first applicant’s related appeal and held that the conditions for the taking of an DNA sample pursuant to Article 81g § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure were met in the instant case. In the Regional Court’s opinion the considerable length of the prison sentence imposed on the first applicant by the Karlsruhe Regional Court in 2006 showed that the underlying drug offences constituted serious crimes in the meaning of the said provision. In this connection and in particular in view of the considerable amount of drugs that had been trafficked it was irrelevant that the applicant had “only” dealt with marihuana. The Regional Court further found that there were grounds to assume that criminal proceedings concerning serious offences would have to be conducted against the applicant in the future. The first applicant’s negative criminal prognosis followed in particular from the fact that his conviction in 2006 had not only related to a single spontaneously committed offence of drug trafficking but to a series of offences committed over the period from May 2004 to January 2005. Moreover, he had previously been convicted of similar offences in Switzerland. The fact that his first conviction by the Horgen District Court dated back as long as 1982 did not put into question his negative criminal prognosis. It had been demonstrated by the judgment of the Schwyz Canton Criminal Court dated 22 April 2005 that the applicant had committed further drug-related offences in the period from 2002 to 2003 in Switzerland, i.e. prior to his conviction in Germany in 2006. The Regional Court further specified that the applicant’s potential expulsion to Switzerland did not have an impact on its assessment of the case. Pursuant to German criminal law crimes of the kind at issue were subject to German jurisdiction even when committed abroad. Moreover, the fact that an individual had his place of residence abroad did not prevent him from committing offences in Germany.', '9. By written submissions to the Freiburg Regional Court dated 9 May 2007 the first applicant argued that there was nothing to indicate that he would commit further offences similar to the ones that had been at the origin of his previous convictions. He invoked in particular that the crimes referred to by the Freiburg District Court in its decision of 2 February 2007 dated back several years and that he had already served prison sentences of a considerable duration in this respect. Furthermore, since he was supposed to be expelled to Switzerland after having served half of his prison sentence, it was unlikely that he would reoffend in Germany and take the risk of having to serve the residual term of his prison sentence as a consequence.', '10. On 11 May 2007 the Freiburg Regional Court held that the first applicant’s submissions did not provide any additional arguments that would require it to deviate from its previous decision of 25 April 2007.', '11. By a decision of 14 August 2007 (file no. 2 BvR 1340/07) the Federal Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint without providing reasons.', '12. In its decision of 24 May 2012 with respect to Mr Martens the Nuremberg District Court, referring to the latter’s criminal record since 1999, held that the repeated commission of offences by the second applicant in the past had reached a degree of unlawfulness equal to the commission of an offence of considerable significance within the meaning of Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In 1999 the second applicant had been convicted by the Nuremberg District Court of having caused bodily harm by dangerous means (gefährliche Körperverletzung) and had been sentenced to a suspended prison sentence of seven months. By a judgment of 18 May 2006 the Erlangen District Court had found him guilty of two counts of attempted coercion (versuchte Nötigung) and had imposed a fine of 900 euros payable in 60 daily instalments. On 19 March 2008 the same court had convicted the second applicant of a further offence of having caused bodily harm by dangerous means and sentenced him to a suspended prison sentence of one year. Finally, by a judgment of the St. Pölten Regional Court (Landgericht), Austria, of 12 May 2011, he had been found guilty of having persistently stalked a woman and had been sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment. As regards the two incidents involving bodily harm in 1999 and 2008 the Nuremberg District Court specified that the second applicant had sprayed tear or pepper gas into his respective victims’ faces from a short distance leaving one victim with painful skin irritations and the other with an eye inflammation.', '13. In the Nuremberg District Court’s opinion the manner in which the offences had been committed showed that the second applicant had a tendency to compromise considerably the physical well-being of others and that further serious criminal offences were to be expected from him in the future. The court further found that having regard to the intervals in which the offences had been committed, it could be expected that the second applicant would repeatedly commit further offences similar to the ones that had been at the origin of the criminal proceedings instituted against him in the past. Having regard to the nature of the offences at issue it was conceivable that DNA traces would be left at the scene of a future crime and the measure ordered by the court was thus justified and necessary for the purpose of establishing identity and gender on the occasion of future criminal proceedings.', '14. By written submissions dated 26 May 2012 the applicant appealed the District Court’s decision. He maintained in particular that the offences committed by him in the past had not been of a gravity that justified an interference with his personal rights under Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure. He further complained that the District Court had not complied with his request to hear him in person and had not adequately reasoned its decision.', '15. By a decision of 5 July 2012 the Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court dismissed the appeal holding that the conditions for the taking of a DNA sample pursuant to Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been clearly met in the instant case and that the District Court’s order had consequently been proportionate. The Regional Court held that, firstly, the two incidents involving bodily harm that had been at the origin of the second applicant’s convictions in 1999 and 2008 constituted serious offences in the meaning of the said provision. On each of these occasions the second applicant had shown aggressive behaviour towards third persons without having been particularly provoked by the latter. Both offences had been committed in a similar way and demonstrated a significant criminal energy on the part of the second applicant and his potential for aggression.', 'The Regional Court further recalled that Article 81g of the Criminal Code put the repeated commission of offences on an equal footing with the commission of a serious crime for the purpose of justifying the taking of a DNA sample. The Regional Court pointed out that the legislator had specified in this context that repeated offences in the context of so-called stalking of the type that had been at the origin of the second applicant’s conviction by judgment of the St. Pölten Regional Court in 2011, constituted an example where the repeated commission of an offence reached a degree of unlawfulness that was equal to the commission of a serious offence. The second applicant’s previous convictions further showed that he had a tenacious and incorrigible character which was also reflected in his partly confused and incomprehensible submissions to the Regional Court in the instant proceedings. Having regard to the second applicant’s numerous past convictions, his personality and the circumstances under which the offences had been committed, the Regional Court found that there clearly remained a risk that criminal proceedings concerning similar offences would have to be conducted against him in the future.', '16. On 17 July 2012 the Erlangen District Court, at the prosecution authorities’ request, revoked the suspension of the second applicant’s prison sentence imposed by its judgment dated 19 March 2008 (see paragraph 12 above). With reference to the conviction for stalking by the St. Pölten Regional Court dated 12 May 2011 which had meanwhile become final, the District Court argued that the fact that the second applicant had reoffended in the course of his probationary period demonstrated that a suspended sentence was not sufficient to counter the risk of recidivism.', '17. By a decision of 29 August 2012 (file no. 2 BvR 1934/12) the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint of 24 August 2012 against the Nuremberg-Fürth Regional Court’s decision of 5 July 2012 without providing reasons. It further held that, as a consequence, there was no need to decide on the applicant’s request for interim measures.', '18. While the applicants’ submissions suggest that the court orders were subsequently executed and DNA samples taken from each of them, neither of the applicants has specified on which date the intervention occurred and whether the samples were obtained by means of saliva or blood samples.', '19. Article 81a to f of the German Code of Criminal Procedure (Strafprozessordnung) provide for the taking of DNA samples for the purpose of convicting suspects within the scope of pending criminal proceedings. By contrast, Article 81g regulates the taking of cellular material from suspects and convicts with a view to determining their DNA profile for use in future criminal proceedings. Article 81g § 1 in its current version, as also applicable at the time of the proceedings at issue, provides for such measure if a person is suspected of having committed or has been convicted of a criminal offence of considerable significance (Straftat von erheblicher Bedeutung) or of a crime against sexual self-determination and in the event the nature of the offence or the way it was committed, the personality of the concerned person or other information provide grounds for assuming that criminal proceedings will be conducted against him or her in future in respect of a criminal offence of considerable significance. Under these conditions cellular material may be obtained from the person concerned and subjected to molecular and genetic examination with a view to determining his or her DNA profile (DNA-Identifizierungsmuster) or gender for identification purposes in future criminal proceedings.', 'It is further specified in the provision that the repeated commission of criminal offences may reach a degree of unlawfulness (Unrechtsgehalt) that is tantamount to a criminal offence of considerable significance. This alternative ground for the taking of cellular material has been introduced into Article 81g § 1 by the Act on the revision of forensic DNA-analysis dated 12 August 2005 (Gesetz zur Novellierung der forensischen DNAAnalyse, Federal Gazette I, p. 2360). According to the explanatory memorandum to the Act the repeated commission of offences does not automatically reach the same level of significance as a serious crime. An order for the taking of cellular material under this alternative is only admissible in the event the circumstances of a particular case taken together provide evidence that the repeated commission of offences reaches the same degree of unlawfulness as a serious crime in the meaning of the provision. While, for instance, repeated fare evasion for public transport would as a rule not reach such threshold, this could, by contrast, be the case in the event of repeated trespassing in the context of stalking.', '20. The second paragraph of Article 81g stipulates that cellular material obtained may be used only for the aforementioned molecular and genetic examination and shall be destroyed without delay once it is no longer required for that purpose. Information other than that required for establishing the DNA profile or the gender may not be ascertained during the examination and tests to establish such information shall be inadmissible. Without the written consent of the person concerned, the taking of cellular material may be ordered only by a court and, in case of imminent danger (Gefahr im Verzug), by the public prosecution authorities including the officials assisting it (section 152 of the Courts Constitution Act). Without the written consent of the person concerned, the molecular and genetic examination of cellular material may be ordered only by a court. The related court order shall specify in each case the determining facts relevant to ascertaining the seriousness of the criminal offence at issue, the information giving rise to the assumption that the accused will be the subject of criminal proceedings in the future, as well as an evaluation of the relevant circumstances.', '21. Pursuant to Article 81g read in conjunction with the second paragraph of Article 81f of the Code of Criminal Procedure the courts shall appoint the experts responsible for the examination of the DNA material and determination of DNA profiles. The experts have to meet certain requirements with a view to ensuring their independence from the investigating authority as well as their professional integrity. They shall provide for the technical and organisational safeguards to ensure that inadmissible molecular and genetic examinations and unauthorised access to data are excluded. The cellular material to be examined shall be given to the expert with no indication of the name, address or date or month of birth of the data subject.', '22. Article 81g § 5 states that the data obtained may be stored at the Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt) and be used in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Federal Criminal Police Office Act (Bundeskriminalamtgesetz). Data may only be transmitted for the purpose of criminal proceedings, preventive aversion of dangers (Gefahrenabwehr) or international legal assistance in respect thereof.', '23. In the event of the taking of cellular material by means of a blood sample Article 81a of the Code of Criminal Procedure apples mutatis mutandis. The taking of blood samples is to be effected by a physician in accordance with the rules of medical science, provided no detriment to the concerned person’s health is to be expected. Blood samples or other body cells taken may be used only for the purposes set out in the Code of Criminal Procedure and shall be destroyed without delay as soon as they are no longer required for such purposes.', '24. Since 1998 the Federal Criminal Office maintains a national DNA database in which DNA profiles obtained in compliance with Articles 81a to g of the Code of Criminal Procedure are stored. The Federal Criminal Police Office Act contains rules on the storage and use of such DNA profiles. According to section 2 of the Federal Criminal Police Office Act, the Federal Criminal Police Office in its capacity as central agency for police information and intelligence in connection with the prevention and prosecution of criminal offences of federal, international or considerable significance, shall collect and analyse all relevant information for carrying out such task. Pursuant to Section 8 § 5 of the Act a convict’s personal data may be saved in files for the use in future criminal proceedings in the event particular circumstances give reason for believing that the person concerned will commit criminal offences of considerable significance. Personal data taken from an individual suspected of having committed a criminal offence have, as a rule, to be deleted in the event the proceedings against the concerned person have been definitely discontinued or once the suspect has been acquitted (section 8 § 3). The data compiled in the national DNA database may be made available to the Federal and Länder police authorities and according to section 11 of the Act the public prosecution authorities may retrieve information from the database for the purpose of administering criminal justice. Section 32 of the Federal Criminal Police Office Act stipulates that personal data saved in files have to be deleted once their storage has become inadmissible or in the event the retention of the data is no longer necessary for the performance of the Federal Criminal Police Office’', '25. By a judgment of 14 December 2000 (2 BvR 1741/99; 2 BvR 276/00 and 2 BvR 2061/00) the Federal Constitutional Court held that the provision of Article 81g of the Code of Criminal Procedure was constitutional. It emphasised that the scope of the provision was limited to the determination of a suspect’s or convict’s DNA profile for the purpose of establishing identity in future criminal proceedings and that the cellular material obtained in this respect had to be destroyed once the DNA profile was determined. The DNA profile as such did not allow for conclusions to be drawn as regards the personal characteristics of a concerned individual such as his or her hereditary dispositions, character traits or diseases and did not enable for an individual’s personal profile to be established. In the Constitutional Court’s opinion the core area of personality (Kernbereich der Persönlichkeit) that enjoyed absolute protection under constitutional law was thus not affected by the measures permitted under Article 81g.', 'The Constitutional Court found, however, that the determination, retention and future use of DNA profiles constituted an interference with the constitutionally guaranteed right to self-determination over personal data (informationelles Selbstbestimmungsrecht). Any restriction of such right was only permitted if prescribed by law and in the event it was justified by an overriding public interest and complied with the principle of proportionality. The Constitutional Court specified in this respect that while Article 81g was not aimed at the prevention of future criminal offences, it did however facilitate the investigation of future crimes of considerable significance and thus served the proper administration of justice. The Constitutional Court further held that the provision was sufficiently precise to qualify as a law from a constitutional point of view. The term “criminal offence of a considerable significance” could be found in a number of provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and had been defined in the established case law of the domestic courts as comprising crimes of medium gravity (mittlere Kriminalität) which seriously compromised law and order and were of a nature that could considerably affect the population’s sense of legal certainty (Rechtssicherheit).', 'The court finally held that the precautionary (“vorsorglich”) taking of evidence permitted under Article 81g did not infringe the principle of proportionality. The taking of such evidence could only be ordered in the event the concerned person had previously been convicted of an offence of considerable significance and in the event there were concrete indications that further proceedings concerning criminal offences of considerable significance were to be conducted against him or her in the future. Moreover, by strictly limiting the use of cellular material collected for the purposes defined in the Article and by making its destruction compulsory once the concerned person’s DNA profile was established, the legislator had provided for safeguards to prevent abuse of cellular material obtained.', 'The Constitutional Court specified that when ordering a measure pursuant to Article 81g the domestic courts had to establish and clarify the circumstances of each particular case. In their assessment they had to take into account the available criminal files and records with respect to the person concerned and had to provide plausible reasons for their assumption that it was likely that the latter would commit further crimes of considerable significance in the future.', '26. By a subsequent judgment dated 14 August 2007 (2 BvR 1293/07) the Federal Constitutional further held that the possibility of ordering the taking of a DNA sample in the event the repeated commission of criminal offences showed a degree of unlawfulness similar to the commission of a serious criminal offence - an alternative introduced by the Act on the revision of forensic DNA-analysis dated 12 August 2005 - did not give rise to concerns from a constitutional point of view. With reference to the explanatory memorandum to the said Act (see above paragraph 19), the Federal Constitutional Court noted that this alternative did not allow the domestic courts to automatically conclude that the repeated commission of offences justified an order for the taking of cellular material. By contrast, the domestic courts were obliged to have regard to the specific circumstances of the individual case and in particular the personality of the person concerned and the manner in which the offences had been committed. On this basis they had to proceed to an overall assessment of the degree of unlawfulness reflected in the offences committed and to be expected in the future while always observing the principle of proportionality in their decision-making.', '27. For a summary of relevant Council of Europe and European Union legal instruments and an overview of relevant national legislation in a selection of Council of Europe member states, reference is made to the Court’s judgment in S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [GC], nos. 30562/04 and 30566/04, §§ 41 to 53, ECHR 2008.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-23736,ENG,RUS,ADMISSIBILITY,2004,VORSINA and VOGRALIK v. RUSSIA,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress,"['The applicants, Irina Aleksandrovna Vorsina and Natalya Aleksandrovna Vogralik, are Russian nationals, who were born in 1934 and 1947 and live in Novosibirsk.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'The applicants are great-granddaughters of Mr Aleksandr Fyodorovich Vorsin, a prominent factory owner, one of the first brewers in the Altay Region. He founded a brewery in Barnaul in 1882.', 'The only surviving portrait of the grandfather was kept in the applicants’ family archives. In 1991 the applicants passed a copy of the portrait to the Altay Museum of local lore for exhibiting. The museum, in its turn, passed it to OAO “Barnaulskiy Pivovarennyy Zavod”, a joint-stock company producing beer.', 'The brewery produced several kinds of beer under the common brand “Vorsinskoye”—a derivative from the grandfather’s name. His portrait, obtained from the museum, was reproduced on beer bottles. The portrait was also extensively used on external advertising boards. One of the boards depicted a beer bottle (with the grandfather’s portrait on it) playing saxophone.', 'On an unspecified date the applicants brought an action against the brewery in the Industrialnyy District Court of Barnaul. They asked to remove the grandfather’s name and portrait from the beer advertisements because it interfered with their right to confidentiality of family life. The applicants claimed that they felt uneasy when strangers asked them about their relation to the person depicted on the beer bottles. They also claimed that they anguished at the sight of bottles—with their name and the portrait of a relative on them—littered about.', 'On 26 June 2000, the Industrialnyy District Court dismissed the action having found as follows:', '“... The label of the ‘Vorsinskoye’ beer has not yet been registered as a trademark. The [brewery] has filed a [relevant] application...', 'The court considers that pursuant to section 7 § 2 of the Law on Trademarks, Service Marks and Geographic Origin of Goods, great-granddaughters, and [the applicants] in particular, cannot be recognised as heirs.', 'In accordance with the Civil Code, two forms of succession exist: intestate and testamentary. [The applicants] did not claim that a last will and testament had existed.', 'In accordance with Article 532 of the Civil Code, the testator’s grandchildren and great-grandchildren become intestate heirs if by the moment of the commencement of succession no parent, who would have otherwise inherited, is alive.', 'A. F. Vorsin died in 1919, at that time his son N. A. Vorsin (1875-1942) ... was alive. Therefore, A. F. Vorsin’s great-granddaughters cannot be considered as his intestate heirs.', 'In these circumstances, the court considers that section 7 § 2 of the Law on Trademarks cannot be applied to the present case even by analogy.', 'In their statement of action [the applicants] claimed that they had made a copy of the portrait of the great-grandfather and had given it to the Altay Museum of local lore.', 'Pursuant to section 35 of the Law on Museum Stock and Museums, items and collections included in the museum stock of Russia and held in Russian museums shall be open for public access.', 'Pursuant to section 36 § 2 of the same Law, the production of graphic and printed merchandise, souvenirs and other replicated material and consumer goods with the use of images of museum items and collections, museum buildings and objects located on museums’ premises, as well as with the use of museums’ titles and insignia is to be carried out with the consent of the museums’ administration.', 'When applying for registration of the trademark [the brewery] did receive the permission of the museum for the reproduction of Mr Vorsin’s portrait in the label of the ‘Vorsinskoye’ beer.', 'The information about the Vorsin family of merchants, their photographs, were published in local lore publications ... and thus made publicly known. The same can be said about the portrait which was exhibited in the museum.', 'The explanatory dictionary by Ozhegov and Shvedov understands ‘secret’ as (1) something undiscovered, not yet known; (2) something concealed from others, not known to many.', 'The court takes the view that the defendant did not breach [the applicants’] right to the secrecy of their family life. The court draws a similar conclusion in respect of the alleged infringement of the inviolability of [the applicants’] private life. According to the Ozhegov dictionary, ‘inviolable’ means complete, immune from any encroachment. The court considers that the use of Mr Vorsin’s name and portrait in no way encroaches on [the applicants’] private life since this information is known to the general public...”', 'On an unspecified date, the applicants filed an appeal against the judgment. They argued that the lack of registration of the trademark should not have been considered as an obstacle to the application of the Trademark Law. According to the applicants, the Trademark Law provided a regulation of similar situations, and therefore it should have been applied by analogy. The applicants also claimed that the Trademark Law did not specify the notion of “heir” separate from that described in the Civil Code, and that the moment of the commencement of succession had been of little importance since the right infringed—the feeling of kinship—was of a non-pecuniary nature. The applicants maintained also that the fact that they had passed a copy of the portrait to the museum in no way implied their consent to see it on beer bottles.', 'On 30 August 2000, the Altay Regional Court disallowed the appeal on the following grounds:', '“... Articles 527-561 of the Civil Code permit the conclusion that succession usually extends to the right of property and other property interests which make part of contract, copyright and inventor obligations.', 'At the same time, heirs may also inherit certain non-pecuniary rights ... if the law so stipulates.', 'However, the [trial] court was correct in assuming that [the applicants] could not be considered as heirs.', 'The [appeal court] can neither accept [the applicants’] argument that their family secret, guaranteed and protected by Article 23 of the Constitution, had been disrespected. The [trial] court assessed these arguments and the [appeal court] upholds this view.', 'A.F. Vorsin is a prominent figure, the founder of beer production in the Altay Region, and this well-known fact cannot be regarded as a family secret. [The applicants] and [the brewery] have a dispute in connection with the right of reproduction of the portrait of A.F. Vorsin in [the brewery’s] trademark. The current legislation does not impose such restrictions.', 'The reproduction of the great-grandfather’s portrait in the trademark of OAO “Barnaulskiy Pivovarennyy Zavod”, which was founded by A.F. Vorsin, does not infringe or prejudice [the applicants’] personal non-pecuniary interests. The information about A.F. Vorsin is not only the family’s asset, but is also part of the public domain as information about a famous businessman of the Altay Region...', 'The fact that the great-grandfather’s portrait existed in one single copy in [the applicants’] possession does not mean that their family secret was breached.', '[The applicants] by their own initiative passed a copy of the portrait to the Museum of local lore, and [the brewery] obtained, in accordance with [section 35 of the Law on Museums], a permission of the museum to use the portrait...”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

MALTA,4,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson;Giovanni Bonello;Ján Šikuta;Ledi Bianku;Nebojša Vučinić;Nicolas Bratza;Päivi Hirvelä,"['The applicants, Ms Mary Green and Mr Ajad Farhat, are Maltese nationals who were born in 1959 and 1948 respectively and currently live in Marsa, Malta. They were represented before the Court by Dr J. Brincat, a lawyer practising in Malta. The Maltese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Dr Silvio Camilleri, Attorney General.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '1. Background', 'The first applicant married Mr X, a Maltese citizen, on 19 June 1978 according to the rites of the Catholic Church and in conformity with Maltese law.', 'In 1980 she went to Libya. She converted to Islam by means of a declaration. As a result of this declaration the first marriage was deemed to be null and void and consequently she was given permission by a Libyan court to marry under the law of Libya.', 'On 7 August 1980 she married the second applicant, according to the rites of Islam. The applicants settled in Libya where they established their matrimonial domicile and lived there, lawfully married, for twenty years.', 'In 1994 the first applicant went to the Public Registry in Malta and filled in an application requesting registration of her wish to revert to her maiden name, in accordance with Article 4 of the Civil Code. She did not inform the Public Registry that she had divorced Mr X or that she had obtained an annulment of that marriage. On 19 May 1994 the applicant’s request was granted.', 'In 2000 the applicants returned to Malta to take care of the first applicant’s father. The first applicant made several attempts to register her new marriage under Article 244 (1) of the Civil Code (see Relevant domestic law) in accordance with the principle of lex loci contractus. This registration would have allowed the second applicant to reside in Malta without the need for a visa. It would have granted him the status of an exempt person under the Immigration Act on the basis that he lived with and was married to a Maltese national.', 'The first applicant based her requests on a document dated 30 January 2001 and 22 September 2002, issued by the Court of First Instance of South Tripoli. According to this document, her previous marriage had been declared null and void upon her conversion to Islam and her marriage to a Muslim man.', 'However, the Director of the Public Registry refused to register the marriage. The first applicant had failed to prove that she had legally released herself from the obligations of her first marriage by providing a court decision demonstrating that it had been annulled or that she had divorced and that her second marriage had not been polygamous, and therefore contrary to Maltese public policy. Moreover, she had failed in the alternative to prove that she was domiciled in Libya since she had retained her Maltese citizenship and had indeed returned to Malta after twenty years.', 'She was informed that it was necessary for her to prove that, before contracting her second marriage, she had been released from her previous marriage in accordance with the provisions of Maltese law regarding capacity to marry (see section 18 (b) of the Marriage Act). She was therefore advised to produce the exequatur of a Maltese court ordering the Director of the Public Registry to register the alleged annulment or divorce obtained, thus allowing him to register her second marriage.', 'In the meantime the first applicant’s father passed away in 2001. However, the applicants remained in Malta to take care of the first applicant’s mother. Meanwhile, the second applicant’s visa was renewed on a concessionary basis.', 'On 1 June 2004 the applicants instituted proceedings before the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional jurisdiction. Invoking Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention, they claimed that the refusal to register their marriage amounted to a breach of their rights and that Maltese marriage law discriminated against Islam. They argued that marriages celebrated anywhere according to the rites of the Catholic Church were easily recognised, but not marriages contracted under other religions. Similarly, any annulment of a marriage by the Catholic Church (including the dispensation of the Holy Pontiff and the “Privilegum Paulinum”) was endorsed for Catholics under Maltese law.', 'On 29 November 2006 the Civil Court dismissed the applicants’ claims for non-exhaustion of ordinary remedies as the first applicant had not brought an action before the Civil Court in accordance with section 33 of the Marriage Act to prove that her first marriage was null and void. However, the court considered the complaints manifestly ill-founded since she had failed to prove her domicile, which was necessary for section 33 of the Marriage Act to apply. She was a citizen of Malta and Maltese law did not recognise divorce on religious grounds. Indeed, under section 24 of the Marriage Act, a decision declaring a Catholic marriage null and void was not automatically registered. In particular, one of the prerequisites was the participation of the spouses during the proceedings. However, in the present case Mr X was totally unaware of any proceedings. Moreover, it was for the national legislation to lay down rules regarding the validity of marriages in pursuance of the State’s public policy, and, therefore, no violation of Article 8 could arise in the present case. Lastly, the court noted that the applicants had failed to prove that they had suffered discrimination vis a vis someone in an analogous situation on one of the grounds mentioned in Article 14 of the Convention.', 'The applicants appealed. By a judgment of 13 April 2007 the Constitutional Court upheld the appeal in part. While revoking the part of the judgment dismissing the merits, it reaffirmed that the applicants had failed to make use of the ordinary remedy provided by law, namely instituting proceedings before the Civil Court in its ordinary jurisdiction, which could have ordered the registration of the marriage if the requisite criteria had been fulfilled.', 'On 5 July 2008 Mr X, the applicant’s first husband, passed away. On the basis that there were no longer any impediments to the first applicant’s remarriage the applicants attempted to obtain a marriage licence in Malta in order to remarry there. To proceed with such a licence they allegedly were requested to provide proof of a divorce in respect of their marriage contracted in Libya.', 'In accordance with Article 244 (1) of the Civil Code, Chapter 16 of the Laws of Malta, any marriage of a citizen of Malta drawn up or registered in a foreign country by a competent authority in that country, may, at the request of any interested person and upon the Director of the Public Registry being satisfied of the authenticity of such act, be registered in the Maltese Islands.', 'In this respect, Article 242 of the Civil Code reads as follows:', '“(1) The Director shall not receive any act which is not written in clear and legible characters, or which contains abbreviations, or which may appear to him to be otherwise defective or irregular.', '(2) In any such case, the act shall be presented by the Director to one of the Visitors of notarial acts, who, after hearing, if necessary, the person who had made the act, shall determine the manner in which, according to law, the act is to be drawn up.', '(3) The Director may not refuse to receive any act which is countersigned by one of the said Visitors.”', 'The Marriage Act 1975 (“the Act”), Chapter 255 of the Laws of Malta, applies to all marriages whether contracted in a civil or religious form.

The applicant company is represented before the Court by Mr. Kyrre Eggen, a lawyer practising in Oslo.', 'On 5 March 2001 P4 applied for authorisation to radiobroadcast, in whole or in part, the main hearing (hovedforhandling) in a major criminal trial concerning charges against four persons of triple murder, the so-called Orderud case, scheduled to take place before the Nes District Court (herredsrett) as from 18 April 2001. According to the applicant, this was probably the most spectacular and media-focused criminal case in Norwegian history. The case involved a son and his wife, the wife’s half-sister and a friend of the latter, who were charged with the murder of the son’s parents and sister, committed in a particularly brutal manner.', 'The district court judge (sorenskriveren), who received the application on 26 March 2001, replied by fax:', '“APPLICATION FOR BROADCASTING', 'The Orderud case', 'Hereby rejected', 'Nobody is granted such permission”', 'The above decision was taken under section 131A (in its version as applicable at the relevant time) of the Administration of Courts Act 1915 (domstolloven).', 'P4 appealed against this decision to the Eidsivating High Court (lagmannsrett) and requested it to quash the District Court’s refusal to broadcast and to give a new decision. The applicant maintained that there was no justification for refusing radio broadcasting from the lawyers’ opening statements and closing arguments and from the delivery of verdict.', 'On 4 April 2001 the High Court dismissed (avviste) the appeal. In so far the procedure was concerned, it found no error which warranted setting aside the refusal. Regarding the substance of the decision, it held that this was a matter which by its very nature could not form the subject of an appeal (uangripelig). The High Court added incidentally that, notwithstanding this limitation on its own jurisdiction, it did not find that the disputed refusal conflicted with either the Convention provisions concerning the public character of judicial proceedings or those on freedom of expression.', 'On 23 April 2001 the Appeals Selection Committee of the Supreme Court unanimously rejected an appeal by P4 against the High Court’s decision. The Committee’s reasoning could be summarised as follows.', 'The Committee noted the absence, in section 131 (incorporating the provision of section 131A according to an amendment in 1999, which had not yet entered into force) of the Administration of Court’s Act 1915, of an express provision on the right to appeal against a refusal to broadcast, unlike sections 129 and 130 concerning respectively prohibition on reporting from judicial proceedings (referatforbud) and publication of judicial decisions. This suggested that section 131 decisions were not intended to be open to appeal. However, the Committee did not find it necessary to consider the applicant’s argument that a right of appeal would follow from Article 377 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (straffeprosessloven), since such a right could in any event follow from the fact that it had been claimed that a Convention right had been violated. In this connection the Committee mentioned the provisions of the Human Rights Act on the precedence of international human rights conventions over domestic law and Article 13 of the Convention on the right to an effective remedy for “arguable claims” of violation. The Committee noted a decision by the former Commission (Atkin and Others v. the United Kingdom, application no. 13366), which concerned complaints by two journalist under Articles 10 and 13 of the Convention about judicial orders to prohibit reporting and to hear a case in camera, rejected as manifestly ill-founded. It was found that the interference was justified for the purposes of Article 10 § 2 and that, absent an arguable claim of violation, Article 13 did not apply. The Committee further observed that the “arguable claim” criterion had been criticised in legal theory and pointed out that the condition for lodging an appeal under Norwegian procedural law was that the appellant’s claim of violation did not appear entirely unfounded.', 'As regards the decision under challenge, the Committee, noting that the High Court had dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional ground, quoted its findings on the merits and upheld those findings. As regards the latter aspect, the Committee observed:', '“The Committee agrees with what has been stated by the High Court and points to the fact that the principle of publicity in Article 6 § 1 is to ensure democratic control of the courts, not the right of the public to receive information, and that the principle is preserved by the provisions on public hearing and the freedom to report in ... the Administration of the Courts Act. The Committee cannot see that the prohibition in section 131A, first paragraph, of the Act on, inter alia, recording for radio transmission from the proceedings in a criminal case infringes the right to receive and impart information under Article 10 of the Convention. It is recalled that the media are not excluded from, or imposed a duty of silence about, the proceedings. The Committee finds no support in the Court’s or the [former] Commission’s case-law for interpreting the right to freedom of expression to mean that there is a right to record from criminal proceedings with a view to radio - or television broadcasting.

A defamatory imputation is one to a man's discredit, or which tends to lower him in the estimation of others, or to expose him to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or to injure his reputation in his office, trade or profession or to injure his financial credit. The standard of opinion is that of right-thinking persons generally.” (Supreme Court of Cyprus in Paniccos Agathangelou v. S.

It is a matter of the impression an ordinary person gets on a first reading not on a later analysis.” (Lewis v. Daily Telegraph Ltd. (1963) 2 All E.R. p. 151)', '“An innuendo properly so called which is an allegation that words were used in a defamatory sense other than their ordinary meaning and which provides a separate cause of action must be supported by extrinsic facts or matters and cannot be found only on interpretation, because if the words bear the interpretation imputed to them they are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning.” (Grubb v.

The applicant was born in 1937 and lives in the town of Malaya Vyska, the Kirovograd region, Ukraine.', '6. On 9 April 1997 the applicant sold his house for UAH 35,000 to the Kirovograd Regional Department of Justice (hereafter “the Department”), responsible for the logistical support of the judiciary. The Department was represented in the transaction by Mr R., the President of the Malaya Vyska City Court. The contract was certified by a notary and specified that the purchase price had to be paid in two instalments: UAH 5,000 and 30,000 to be paid by 1 May 1997 and 1 September 1997 respectively. The contract also contained a clause stating the following:', '“In case if the exchange rate of the Hryvna depreciates the overall sum to be paid cannot be less than the Hryvna equivalent of USD 17,000.”', '7. In June 1997 the applicant was paid UAH 5,000. In 1998 the Hryvna substantially weakened against US dollar. In October 1998 and August 1999 the applicant received UAH 11,000 and 20,000 respectively.', '8. The applicant instituted proceedings against the Department, claiming that it had failed to fulfil its obligations under the contract, as the sum paid did not take into account the substantial depreciation of the exchange rate of the Hryvna. Thus, according to the applicant, he had lost some USD 6,553.', '9. On 4 November 1999 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd (hereafter “the District Court”) rejected this claim as unsubstantiated. On 8 September 2000 the Presidium of the Kirovograd Regional Court, following the protest (extraordinary appeal) of the Deputy President of this court, quashed the judgment and remitted the case.', '10. On 29 November 2000, in the course of a new hearing, the Department lodged a counterclaim seeking the annulment of the contract on the ground that Mr R. had exceeded his powers in agreeing to the dollar value clause.', '11. On 24 July 2001 the Kirovsky District Court of Kirovograd granted the applicant’s claim and rejected that of the Department. The court established that the clause in issue aimed at ensuring the stability of the contract and protecting the applicant against inflation. The court further found that the applicant had suffered increased financial losses due to the erosion of the Hryvna’s purchasing power during the lengthy delay in execution of the contract. It found that the amount eventually paid to him on the date of the final transaction had only been USD 10,457.50. The court awarded the applicant UAH 35,527.77 in compensation for the devaluation of the Hryvna, UAH 3,197.31 in statutory interest for the delay and UAH 502.13 in court costs.', '12. The Department appealed against this judgment and, on 20 December 2001, the Kirovograd Regional Court of Appeal (hereafter “the Court of Appeal”) quashed it and rejected the applicant’s claim. The court found in favour of the Department on both of their objections. It noted that Mr R. had acted ultra vires by conceding the inclusion of the disputed provision in the contract without the prior consent from the Department. The Court of Appeal further stated that, according to Article 3 of the Governmental Decree on the Regime of Currency Regulation and Currency Control 1993 (the 1993 Decree), the Hryvna was the only currency which could be used for internal transactions. The court did not find convincing the District Court’s argument that the impugned clause protected the applicant from inflation, since Article 214 of the Civil Code 1963 provided for compensation for losses incurred due to inflation if the execution of a contract was delayed.', 'The Court of Appeal acknowledged that the price for the apartment was paid with considerable delay and that the applicant, having made the relevant claim before the court, had the right to be awarded statutory interest at the rate of 3% per annum. Taking into account that the applicant had already received an extra thousand Hryvnas (paragraph 6 above), the Court of Appeal found it appropriate to award him further UAH 678.50.', '13. On 30 May 2002 the Supreme Court rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation.', '14. Article 3 of the Decree provided that the currency of Ukraine (i.e. the Hryvna) was the only lawful means of payment in Ukraine.', '15. According to Article 48 of the Code, a contract concluded contrary to the law should be declared invalid. If the contract is invalidated the parties should return to each other all that was received in execution of the contract.', '16. Article 214 of the Code provided that a debtor who had delayed the execution of a financial undertaking was obliged, on the request of the creditor, to pay the debt taking into account the established index of inflation for the period of delay, as well as statutory interest at 3% per annum.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

On 12 August 2002 Mr Põder died and his daughter, Ms Tiiu Kasvand, pursued the application on his behalf. Ms Kasvand and Ms Raag live in Tallinn. Ms Mölder lives in Tartu. The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr H. Vallikivi, a lawyer practising in Tallinn. The respondent Government were represented by Mrs M. Hion, Director of the Human Rights Division of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', ""On 8 October 1991 Mr Põder lodged an application with the Valga County Government (Valga Maavalitsus) for restitution of his family's property, which had been nationalised in 1947 and allocated by the authorities to a third person free of charge since 1970. The property consisted of farmland, a house and farm buildings."", 'By a decision of the Valga County Commission for the Return and Compensation of Unlawfully Expropriated Property (Õigusvastaselt võõrandatud vara tagastamise ja kompenseerimise Valga maakonna komisjon) of 5 May 1994, all three applicants were recognised as the persons entitled to the nationalised property under the property reform legislation.', 'On 9 April 1996 the Õru District Administration (Õru Vallavalitus), relying on section 12(8)(2) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act (Omandireformi aluste seadus), decided not to return the property to the applicants on the ground that it had lost its former distinct character (that is, the form or size of the property, as assessed according to the criteria established by law, had changed significantly). On 28 February 1997 the District Administration decided to award the applicants compensation in respect of the property.', 'The applicants appealed against both of these decisions to the Valga County Court (Valga Maakohus).', ""By a judgment of 23 February 1998, the County Court declared the decision of the Õru District Administration of 9 April 1996 unlawful, finding that the condition of the property had been incorrectly assessed. The judgment was upheld by the Tartu Court of Appeal (Tartu Ringkonnakohus) on 22 June 1998. The courts left unexamined the applicants' complaint concerning the decision on compensation of 28 February 1997 as the complaint did not meet the formal requirements."", 'On 25 August 1998 the Õru District Administration gave a new decision refusing to return the property to the applicants. That decision was also declared unlawful, mainly for lack of reasoning, by the Valga County Court and the Tartu Court of Appeal on 11 June 1999 and 24 September 1999 respectively. The courts also declared unlawful the compensation decision of 28 February 1997, as it had been made on the basis of the unlawful decision of 9 April 1996 to refuse restitution.', 'By a decision of 25 January 2000, the Õru District Administration refused to return the nationalised property to the applicants on the ground that the property was in the possession of a third person who had acquired it in good faith. In particular, that person had not persecuted the applicants or expropriated their property. The District A dministration based its decision on an amended version of section 12(3)(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act, which had come into force on 2 March 1997.', 'The applicants lodged a complaint against the decision submitting, inter alia, that, under section 12(3)(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act in the version in force until 2 March 1997, a person who had obtained expropriated property free of charge could not be regarded as the bona fide owner of the property. They had lodged an application for restitution at the time when that Act was in force and therefore had a legitimate expectation that their application would be decided according to that Act.', ""By a judgment of 24 April 2000, the Võru County Court (Võru Maakohus) dismissed the applicants' complaint. The judgment was upheld by the Tartu Court of Appeal on 6 September 2000. The Supreme Court (Riigikohus), which initially refused the applicants leave to lodge an appeal with it, subsequently granted them leave and, on 11 June 2001, rendered a judgment upholding the Court of Appeal's judgment."", 'In its judgment the Supreme Court reiterated that one of the purposes of the property reform was to undo the injustices caused by violations of property rights in the past. At the same time, the restitution of property or the payment of compensation to former owners should not prejudice the lawful interests of other persons or cause new injustices. The deprivation of property of new owners who had received it free of charge would create such an injustice. Expropriated property had often been preserved thanks to the efforts of new owners. The provisions of section 12(3)(3) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act, as they had existed until 2 March 1997, were unjust and offered no protection to new owners of unlawfully expropriated property. The applicants could not reasonably expect that the law would not change. Their expectation that their restitution claim would be decided in accordance with the former law did not outweigh the right of the current owner to the protection of his property and his legitimate expectation that he would not be deprived of his lawfully obtained possessions. The applicants were, however, entitled to claim compensation for property which could not be returned to them.', 'In the meantime, on 28 November 2000 the Õru District Administration decided to award compensation to the applicants in respect of the nationalised property in the form of “privatisation vouchers” to the nominal value of 63,150 Estonian kroons (EEK) for Mr Põder and to the nominal value of EEK 31,575 each for Ms Raag and Ms Mölder. The Government informed the Court that the applicants had received the compensation. There is no indication that the applicants appealed against the size of the award.', 'B. Relevant domestic law', 'The Property Reform (Principles) Act came into force in 1991. It subsequently underwent various substantial amendments. Section 12(3)(3) of the Act in its original wording provided that unlawfully expropriated property was not subject to return if', '“the property [was] in the possession of a natural person who [had] acquired it in good faith”.', 'Section 12(3)(3) of the Act as in force from 21 June 1993 to 2 March 1997 provided that unlawfully expropriated property was not subject to return if', '“the property [was] in the possession of a natural person who [had] acquired it in good faith; a person who [had] obtained the property free of charge by a decision of a State authority or who [had] participated in the persecution of the owner of the property or in its unlawful expropriation [could] not be regarded as a bona fide owner”.', 'On 2 March 1997 a further relevant amendment to the Act came into force. Under the new text of section 12(3)(3), unlawfully expropriated property was not subject to return if', '“the property [was] in the possession of a natural person who [had] acquired it in good faith; above all, a person who [had] participated in the persecution of the owner of the property or in its unlawful expropriation [could] not be regarded as a bona fide owner”.', 'Section 13(1) of the Property Reform (Principles) Act stipulated that if unlawfully expropriated property could not be returned on the basis of section 12 of the Act, the State would pay compensation in respect of the property according to the procedure provided for by law.', 'In accordance with the Regulation on the procedure for the restoration of unlawfully expropriated property enacted by the government on 5 February 1993, as amended, the restitution of property rights was carried out in three stages: (1) the establishment of the unlawfulness of the expropriation and the determination of the persons entitled to restitution of their property rights; (2) the decision as to whether the property was to be returned; (3) the transfer of the property to the eligible persons. The Regulation on the procedure for determining compensation in respect of unlawfully expropriated property enacted by the government on 13 July 1993, as amended, provided that the compensation procedure was initiated where the eligible person had requested compensation, the property in question had been destroyed, or the law did not provide for the return of the property concerned.', 'C.

On 2 May 1921 a deed of sale concluded before Mr Maigre, a notary, was published in the Vannes Mortgage Registry. By that deed, A. transferred ownership of the Isle of Irus to Mr S.', 'The registration of this deed by the Mortgage Registry, in so far as it relates to the dyke in particular, reads as follows:', '“...

The decision of 1967 refers to renewal of the decision of 1951 authorising occupation of a dyke; those of 1984 and 1986 refer to the dyke and house. The prefect's decision of 10 July 1986 did not authorise occupation of the public property beyond 31 December 1990. The decisions stated that “the dyke cannot interfere with navigation in any way, on condition that it is levelled above the high and spring tide water marks, or with maritime coastal traffic on condition that it is accessible to the public at all times”. The authorisation forms specified that, in accordance with Article 26 and 27 of the State Property Code, “the authorities reserve the right to modify or withdraw the authorisation should they deem it necessary, on any ground whatsoever, without the permittee thereby acquiring a right to claim any compensation or damages in that regard. The permittee must, if required, restore the site to its original state by demolishing the constructions built on the public property, including those existing on the date on which the decision was signed.

The annual fee proposed by the Highways Authority is 100 francs. The case gives rise to the following observations: Article R 56 of the Code of State Property provides that any fee payable to the Treasury Department must take into account the advantages of any kind procured to the concessionaire. In the aforementioned case, there is no doubt that the concession of the dyke in question procures a not inconsiderable advantage to the applicant: in particular, it allows her to save on the capital that would otherwise be invested in the purchase of a building plot in the area in question... In these circumstances I find it fully acceptable to retain a sum corresponding to the amount of interest calculated at the very reduced rate of 5% of the value of the land conceded. ...”"", ""17. On 15 March 1993 the applicants' mother applied to the Prefect of Morbihan for renewal of the occupancy agreement."", ""18. In a letter of 6 September 1993, the Prefect reminded her that the authorisation to occupy the house granted in 1986 had expired on 31 December 1990. He informed her that the entry into force of Law no. 862 of 3 January 1986 on the Development, Protection and Enhancement of Coastal Areas (hereafter “the Coastal Areas Act”), and particularly section 25, prevented him from renewing the said authorisation on the former terms because the use of public property had to take account of the designated purpose of the areas concerned, which ruled out any private use, including dwelling houses. However, having regard to the long period of occupation and the applicants' and their mother's sentimental attachment to the house in question, the Prefect said that he was willing to consider, exceptionally, granting limited authorisation restricting use of the property to strictly personal use and prohibiting any sale or transfer of the land and house, any work thereon other than maintenance, and reserving an option to the State, on expiry of the authorisation, to have the property restored to its original state or to reuse the buildings. He concluded by asking her to let him know quickly whether these conditions met with her approval so that “an illegal situation that had lasted two and a half years could be regularised”."", ""19. The applicants' mother refused the offer. By way of counterproposal, she sought a permit to build a dyke that would be valid as a transfer of ownership under Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property (see paragraph 44 below)."", ""20. On 9 March 1994 the Prefect of Morbihan rejected the applicants' mother's request but maintained his initial offer of an occupancy agreement subject to conditions:"", '“You have asked me to consider the possibility of having the dyke built on maritime public property that you occupy at Pen-Er-Men reclassified as private property, apparently with a view to acquiring the dyke and the property built on it ...', 'I regret to inform you that the classic method of conceding property whereby the concessionnee of the property acquired full title, under Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property, to land that had been drained was abandoned by ministerial circular some years ago, on grounds of lack of proven general interest. Your request goes against this policy and I repeat the conditions stipulated in my letter of 6 September with a view to regularising your situation.', 'Regularisation in this way could be done on the terms set out in the draft agreement attached. I should point out that the property fee will be adjusted upwards in order to take account of the particular nature of the occupancy of the property.”', ""21. On 5 May 1994 the applicants' mother applied to the Rennes Administrative Court for the Prefect's decision of 9 March 1994 rejecting her request for a permit to build a dyke to be set aside."", ""22. On 4 July 1995 the Prefect of Morbihan informed the applicants' mother that he was considering drawing up an official report recording the administrative offence of unlawful interference with the highway with a view to formally establishing the unlawful occupancy of public property. That official report was drawn up on 6 September 1995 and served on the applicants' mother on 16 November 1995. On 20 December 1995, on the basis of the finding of illegal occupancy of public property and in accordance with Article L. 28 of the Code of State Property (see paragraph 41 below), the Prefect lodged an application with the Rennes Administrative Court for an order against the applicants' mother to pay a fine and restore the property to its original state, that is, prior to construction of the house."", ""23. In two separate judgments delivered on 20 March 1997, the Rennes Administrative Court ruled on the application lodged by the applicants' mother on 5 May 1994 (case no. 941509) and the application lodged by the Prefect of Morbihan on 20 December 1995 (case no. 953516)."", ""24. The court ruled as follows in respect of the applicants' mother's application for the Prefect's decision rejecting her request for a permit to build a dyke to be set aside:"", ""“In accordance with Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property, “the State may concede, on conditions it shall determine ... the right to build a dyke”. Whilst section 27 of the aforementioned Act of 3 January 1986 has reduced the scope of application of that Article, it does nonetheless specify that “land draining carried out prior to the present Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation”. Accordingly, the only provisions applicable to the present case are Article L. 64 of the aforementioned Code and the Maritime Public Property Act of 28 November 1963, which provides that ... “subject to any contrary provisions of deeds of concession, land artificially removed from the action of the tide shall be incorporated into the category of maritime public property”. In rejecting the request on the basis of the principles and guidelines laid down in the inter-ministerial circular of 3 January 1973 setting out the policy to be followed for the use of maritime public property, the Prefect – when examining the applicant's particular situation involving an application for a concession – did not err as to the scope of the circular in question, which neither repeals nor amends the above-mentioned legislative provisions but is limited to applying them."", ""The aforementioned circular, which instructs the authorities responsible for deciding whether or not to grant concessions to build dykes not to transfer title to the plots of land thus created and to accept only installations designed for collective use, to the exclusion of private dwellings, was issued in respect of an area in which the relevant authorities have discretionary power. In referring to the principles laid down in the circular, the Prefect does not appear to have interpreted the legislative provisions inaccurately; nor did he fail to consider the specificity of the applicant's proposal before concluding that there was no special factor justifying an exemption from the instructions analysed above.”"", ""25. In case no. 953516 the Rennes Administrative Court granted the Prefect's application of 20 December 1995, on the following grounds:"", '“... The rules governing public property', ""“... The purpose of prosecuting someone for the administrative offence of interference with the highway is to preserve the integrity of public property. As can be seen from the judgment delivered by the court today in case no. 941506, the land on which Mrs Brosset's dwelling house was built is indeed public property."", 'The administrative courts base their determination of the substance of artificial public property on the judicial interpretation of any private deeds that may be produced whose examination raises a serious difficulty. In the present case the dyke and the house are not publicly owned property, given the exclusively private use made of them and the fact that they do not belong to a public authority. Accordingly, as it is not seriously disputed that the property in question has been appropriated for private use, it is not necessary to adjourn the application. ...', 'Whether there has been unlawful interference with the highway', ""... Whilst Mrs Brosset has full title to the dwelling house occupied by her and maintains that she is therefore not the unlawful occupant of public property, the fact remains that the erection of a permanent structure on public property could not be legally undertaken without either a concession to build a dyke or another type of concession. The investigation into the facts and, in particular, the absence of any documents evidencing that a concession was granted show that the dwelling house in question was illegally built on maritime public property. Accordingly, the Prefect is justified in requesting an order against Mrs Brosset to pay a fine and restore the seashore to its original state prior to the construction of the house ... This must be done within three months of service of this judgment... . On the expiry of that period, Mrs Brosset shall pay a fine of 100 francs per day's delay in the event of failure to comply with the present judgment and the authorities shall be authorised to enforce it at the cost and risk of the offender.”"", ""26. On 11 July 1997 the two applicants, acting in their capacity as their mother's heirs after her death, lodged an appeal against the judgment delivered in case no. 953516. On 18 July 1997 they appealed against the judgment delivered in case no. 941509."", ""27. By a judgment of 8 December 1999, the Nantes Administrative Court of Appeal decided to join the two sets of proceedings on the ground that they were connected and to dismiss the applicants' appeals."", 'With regard to the application relating to the offence of unlawful interference with the highway, the court noted first of all that Mrs Brosset had died during the proceedings and decided that the prosecution was therefore now extinguished. In respect of the State property proceedings, the Administrative Court of Appeal gave the following reasons for its decision:', '“ ... Firstly, it is not disputed that the parcel of land on which the dyke on which the house was built ... was entirely covered by water, independently of any exceptional meteorological circumstances, prior to the draining works undertaken in order to build the dyke. It has not been established, or even alleged by the applicants moreover, that the undrained portion of this land had ever been removed from the action of the tide. The investigation shows, moreover, that the dyke is the result of land draining carried out prior to the entry into force of the aforementioned Act of 28 November 1963 and that, notwithstanding the various authorisations of temporary occupancy granted by the authorities, as this was not done in the manner prescribed for concessions for the construction of a dyke it has not had the effect of bringing this part of the land thus removed from the action of the tide outside the category of maritime public property. In accordance with the principles of inalienability and imprescriptibility of public property, the submissions by Ms Triboulet and Ms Brosset-Pospisil to the effect that the house was built legally and its occupancy accepted by the authorities for a very long time and tolerated even after the expiry of the last authorisation to occupy it do not alter the fact that the land falls within the category of maritime public property.', 'Secondly, as has been said, the last decision authorising temporary occupancy of the maritime public property ... expired on 31 December 1990. In the absence, since that date, of a lawful title of occupancy, the Prefect of Morbihan is justified in requesting an order against the occupants to restore the site – if they have not already done so – to its original state prior to construction of the house on maritime public property. In disputing that obligation, the applicants cannot properly rely on the number of years of occupancy of the premises or on the fact that the authorities have tolerated the continuation of that occupancy since 31 December 1990 and proposed draft occupancy agreements to Ms Brosset in order to regularise the situation, which, moreover, she has not taken up. ...', 'Fifthly, [the obligation to restore the site to its original state] does not constitute a measure prohibited by the requirement of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest.”', 'Regarding the refusal to grant a concession to build a dyke, the Administrative Court of Appeal held as follows:', '“... Secondly, as section 27 of the above-mentioned Act of 3 January 1986 provides that draining works carried out prior to enactment of that Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation, the provisions codified under Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property according to which “the State may concede, on conditions it shall determine ... the right to build a dyke ...” are applicable.', ""The Prefect of Morbihan based his decision not to grant Mrs Brosset the requested concession to build a dyke on the guidelines set out in the circular of 3 January 1973 issued by the Minister for Economic Affairs and the Minister for Regional Development on the use of public property other than commercial or fishing ports. He did not discern any general-interest ground in favour of granting the applicant's request."", ""By instructing the authorities responsible for granting concessions to build a dyke not to allow any plot of land whatsoever falling into the category of public property to be reclassified as private property with a view to transferring full title thereto, the ministers signatory to the circular of 3 January 1973 did not adopt any legal rules amending or supplementing the above-mentioned provisions of Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property but confined themselves to applying them. Accordingly, as stated above, the plot of land in question is State-owned public property. There is no evidence in the case that the Prefect, before reaching his decision, either failed to examine the particular circumstances of Mrs Brosset's request or made a manifest error of assessment in concluding that there was no special feature or general-interest consideration in the case justifying an exemption from the above-mentioned rules”."", '28. On 21 February 2000 the applicants lodged an appeal on points of law against the judgment of 8 December 1999. They submitted that in the absence of proof, which logically they could not have as they had acquired by gift a house already built on a previously constructed embankment, they had shown that the only legal means of building a dwelling house on a parcel of land supposedly falling within the category of public property was to obtain authorisation of temporary occupancy for private use of that land that did not expressly exclude the possibility of such an edifice being built on it. They concluded from this that the construction of a house, of which the authorities were aware and which they had accepted, had resulted in full title to the house passing to the occupants of the land. If this were not the case, it was for the Prefect to provide proof that the draining works undertaken at the beginning of the century had been illegal. The applicants also submitted that the penalty was disproportionate and that, in the absence of justification on grounds of the general interest, compensation should be paid for the damage wrongly caused.', ""29. The Government Commissioner pointed out, in the same submissions as those made in a similar case, that the value in today's terms of the purchase price of the house was 655,530 euros (EUR). He continued as follows:"", ""“ ... The appellants have not acquired any property right over their houses; nor have they acquired rights in rem over public property as a result of the successive transfers. Given the precarious situation of the buildings, the market value could not be established without taking account of that essential fact and it is to be hoped that the applicants were duly informed of the position when the purchase deeds were drawn up... . Lastly, and despite the fact that we are not especially enthusiastic about the outcome of this case, we have no alternative but to dismiss the appellants' pleadings. ... They probably committed a tactical error in refusing the Prefect's reiterated offer. Even if they were not exactly delighted by the prospect, it was at least preferable to a straightforward demolition order which will have to be judicially enforced at their expense. All hope is perhaps not lost of renewing contact with the authorities with a view to finding what might be a less drastic solution."", 'There may be a case for suing the State in tort for allowing occupants of public property to nurture for almost a century the hope that they would not be ruthlessly compelled to demolish their property. It should be pointed out that the prospects of success of such an action are fairly slim, however, given the legitimate protection enjoyed by public property. In any event, it is clear that if the public authority were to be found liable, the offenders would bear a considerable portion of liability too.”', ""30. By a judgment delivered on 6 March 2002 the Conseil d'Etat dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicants. It held that they could not rely on any right in rem over the land in question or over the buildings that had been erected on it and that the obligation to restore the land to its original state without any prior compensation was therefore not a measure prohibited by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1."", '31. On 6 August 2002 the director of the Department of Culture and Legal and Political Affairs for the Morbihan département wrote to the applicants in the following terms:', '“I have received some information from the Brittany Regional Cultural Affairs Department. It appears first of all that your house was not specifically listed by the Regional Inventory Service when they drew up an inventory for the Vannes-Ouest district in the early 1990s. However, Pen er Men Bay is well documented, as can be seen from a photograph available at the Inventory Service, in which your house appears very clearly. Furthermore, the Inventory Service has told me orally that if an inventory of the Vannes-Ouest district were to be carried out today, your house, and others in the same situation, would definitely be listed.', ""In any event, the Inventory Service could usefully make submissions on your behalf to the Public Works Department for the département, among others, with a view to protecting the region's cultural heritage if a further threat of demolition were to be made."", 'As regards, lastly, the possible classification or registration of your house in the supplementary list of historical monuments, you should not count on this, firstly because the State does not consider you as owner and secondly because it is inundated with requests, especially in the Morbihan. For the time being, given that the Public Works Department appears kindly disposed to your problem, I am not particularly worried.”', ""32. In 2008 the housing tax on the house came to EUR 584 and the land tax to EUR 708. The applicants produced a valuation of their house prepared by an estate agent in November 2008: “a dwelling house made of stone built in 1905 ... Having regard to the geographical situation of the property, the condition of the building, the surface area, its location on maritime public property and the local property market, and subject to the owners' ability to produce a concession agreement in respect of maritime public property, this property is worth between 800,000 and 1,000,000 euros”."", ""33. The idea that the foreshore is “common property”, that is, cannot be appropriated for private use and is managed by the public authorities, dates back to Roman times, when even then a permit was necessary in order to build on the seashore. Colbert's Ordinance of the Marine of August 1681 codified the principle and up until recently was still the legal basis for the State's management of maritime public property. In addition to defining what constituted the “seashore and foreshore”, it laid down the applicable rules: “No one shall build on the foreshore, set stakes in the ground or erect any construction that may interfere with navigation, on pain of demolition of the constructions, confiscation of the materials and discretionary fines”. At the time of the Revolution, the idea developed that maritime public property was governed by the Government in the interest of the nation, and not merely as part of the heritage that used to belong to the Crown and now belongs to the State. The management of maritime public property is still largely guided by this principle today. Over and above the idea of State ownership of such property, the conservation and management of it are more a matter of implementation of a policy regarding its use than the exercise of the owner's “civil” rights. The prefect has a major role in the protection of maritime public property. He is the authority who, generally, governs the use of the property at local level, decides whether or not to allow private occupancy and protects the integrity of the property by prosecuting offenders (source: www.mer.gouv.fr, consulted on 3 February 2010)."", ""Colbert's Ordinance of the Marine was definitively repealed in 2006. Since 1 July 2006 the General Code of Property owned by Public Bodies (Code general de la propriété des personnes publiques – “the CGPPP”) has replaced the Code of State Property (dating from 1957). It restructures the law governing State-owned land and public bodies and combines the rules governing maritime public property into a whole, including provisions relating to the environment in particular."", '34. Maritime public property, determined on the basis of natural phenomena, lies between the highest point of the shore, that is, up to the high tide mark under normal meteorological conditions (CE Ass, Kreitmann, 12 October 1973) and the boundary of the territorial waters, seaward. Under Article L. 2111-4 of the CGPPP, “State natural maritime public property shall comprise:', '1. The seabed and marine substrata between the external boundary of the territorial waters and, on land, the foreshore.', 'The foreshore comprises the whole area covered (and uncovered) by the sea, up to the high tide mark under normal meteorological conditions;', '2. The beds and sub-strata of salt pans communicating directly, naturally and permanently with the sea;', '3. Land naturally reclaimed from the sea:', ""a) which was part of the State's private property at 1 December 1963, subject to third-party rights;"", 'b) which has been constituted since 1 December 1963.', '...', '5. Land reserved for public-interest maritime, seaside or tourist needs which has been purchased by the State.', ""'Land artificially removed from the action of the tide shall remain in the category of natural maritime public property unless otherwise stipulated in legally concluded and lawfully executed deeds of concession transferring ownership'.”"", ""35. The principle of inalienability of public land, which was established in the case-law and then incorporated into the Code of State Property (Article L. 52) and the CGPPP (Article L. 3111-1), is inextricably linked to the notion of public land. The basis of this principle is the designation of land for public use. As long as it remains thus designated, and no express decision has been taken reclassifying particular public land as private property, no transfer of land can be authorised. It is a means of preventing public land from being acquired by prescription or adverse possession under private law, hence the principle of imprescriptibility that is very often associated with the principle of inalienability. Accordingly, in its Cazeaux judgment, on the subject of plots of land situated close to the seashore in the Arcachon Basin the Conseil d'Etat found that “whilst the public authorities have authorised various building works on this land and on several occasions waived their right to apply the rules governing public land ..., neither the founders of the société du domaine des prés salés nor the company itself have been able to acquire any property right over the land, which, being part of public land, was inalienable and imprescriptible”."", ""36. The Constitutional Council has stated that inalienability is limited to precluding the transfer of public property that has not first been reclassified as private property (CC, no. 86-217 DC of 18 September 1986, Freedom of communication). It has not, however, recognised that the principle of inalienability has any constitutional status (CC, dec. no. 94-346 of 21 July 1994, Rights in rem over public property). The Conseil d'Etat has recently reiterated that “where property belonging to a public authority has been incorporated into the category of public land by virtue of a decision classifying it thus, it shall remain public land unless a decision is given expressly reclassifying it as private property”. Accordingly, it has held that the question whether or not short-stay factories fell into the category of public property was not affected by the fact “that these short-stay factories were intended to be rented or assigned to the occupants or that the occupancy leases granted were private-law contracts” (CE 26 March 2008, Société Lucofer)."", ""37. The effect of the principle of inalienability is that any transfer of public land that has not been “reclassified” is null and void, so third-party purchasers have a duty to return the land even if they have purchased it in good faith. Moreover, the fact that public land is inalienable means – in theory – that no rights in rem can be established over it. However, the legislature has departed from this principle by passing two Acts, one of 5 January 1988 which creates long administrative leases, and the other of 25 July 1994 on the constitution of rights in rem over public land, thus making it possible to grant private rights in rem to occupants of maritime public property. The Act of 5 January 1988 concerns only public land belonging to local and regional authorities or groups thereof. The Act of 25 July 1994 relates to artificial maritime property and immovable constructions and installations built for the purposes of an authorised activity (Article L. 34-1 of the Code of State Property and Article L. 2122-6 of the CGPPP). In its above-mentioned decision of 21 July 1994, the Constitutional Council held that granting rights in rem in this way was compatible with the Constitution as public services were maintained and public property protected under the 1994 Act. However, it declared the provision allowing the renewal of authorisation beyond seventy years unconstitutional on the ground that it could potentially render ineffective the public authority's right to the automatic return, free of charge, of any constructions and therefore undermine the “protection due to public property”."", ""38. The last consequence of the principle of inalienability is that property belonging to public authorities cannot be seized (Article L. 2311-1 of the CGPPP). This consequence has been attenuated by a decision of the Conseil d'Etat in a case which subsequently came before the Court (Société de Gestion Du Port de Campoloro et Société fermière de Campoloro v. France, no. 57516/00, 26 September 2006)."", '39. Apart from public easements intended to protect public property from the encroachment of private properties, such as a three-metre wide right of way along the coast over properties adjoining maritime public property, created by an Act of 31 December 1976 reforming town and country planning, the land conservation policy guarantees the protection of the physical integrity of maritime public property and compliance with its designated use. Offenders are prosecuted for unlawful interference with the highway on grounds of infringement of the land conservation policy. An interference of this kind is liable to a criminal fine imposed by the administrative courts and the offender is required to restore the site to its original state. The relevant provisions on unlawful interference with maritime public property no longer refer essentially to navigation but take account of the protection of coastal areas for their own sake (Articles L. 2132-2 and L. 2132-3 of the CGPPP).', ""40. According to the Conseil d'Etat, conservation agencies have a duty to prosecute offenders (CE Ministre de l'équipement v. Association “des amis des chemins de ronde”, 23 February 1979). Regarding a plot of land incorporated into maritime public property at Verghia beach (southern Corsica), the Conseil d'Etat decided that “the fact that M.A. produced title deeds to the property in question and had been authorised to build on the land under the regional planning legislation, as distinct from the legislation governing maritime public property, does not mean that the offence of unlawful interference with the highway has not been made out and, in any event, cannot preclude prosecution by the Prefect ...” (CE, no. 292956, 4 February 2008). With regard to repairing damage caused to public property, the actual attitude adopted by the authorities prior to bringing proceedings for unlawful interference with the highway has been deemed to give rise to rights in favour of the offender, including the right not to assume personal responsibility for restoring the site to its original state (CE, Koeberlin, 21 November 1969)."", '41. The use of maritime public property may be collective or private. Collective use which allows all citizens to benefit from public property (navigation on watercourses, beaches) is freely exercisable, equally available to all and free of charge. However, the principle that use is free of charge has not been expressly incorporated into the CGPPP because it is subject to numerous exceptions.', 'Private occupancy must be compatible or in conformity with the designated use of the public property. Unlike collective use, it is subject to authorisation, issued personally, and a charge and is of a precarious nature.', 'Article L. 28 of the Code of State Property (Article L. 2122-1 of the CGPPP) provided that', '“Subject to authorisation being issued by the competent authority, no one may occupy any national public property or make use thereof over and above the right of use vested in everyone.', 'The Property Department shall record any infringement of the provisions of the preceding paragraph with a view to instituting proceedings against illegal occupants, recovering compensation for charges in respect of which the Treasury Department has been defrauded, without prejudice to the institution of proceedings for unlawful interference with the highway.” [Article A 26 specified that authorisation was revocable without compensation].', ""42. According to the Conseil d'Etat, “whilst the authorities may, as part of their management powers, authorise – provisionally and on the conditions provided for by the rules in force – private occupancy of the said land, that authorisation cannot legally be granted unless, having regard to the requirements of the general interest, it is compatible with the designated use of the land that the public are normally entitled to exercise, and with the obligation incumbent on the authorities to conserve public land” (CE, Commune de SaintBrévinlesPins, 3 May 1963)."", ""43. The precariousness of these authorisations derives from the principle of inalienability, according to which the protection – and accordingly the disposal – of public land is vested in the authorities. According to the case-law, “any authorisation to occupy public land is precarious and revocable. Consequently, the fact – assuming it is made out – that, prior to adoption of the decision being challenged, I. had been granted authorisation to occupy the part of common public property ... does not affect the lawfulness of the mayor's decision requesting him to demolish the buildings he had erected and restore the public land to its original state ...” (CE, Isas, 29 March 2000). It also states very clearly that those to whom authorisation has been granted have not thereby “acquired rights” to renewal of the authorisation (CE, Helie, 14 October 1991)."", '44. The conditions of occupation of public property are determined either in unilateral concessions granted by the authorities (of the type referred to above in Article L. 28 of the Code of State Property) or in contracts signed with the occupant. The latter are called concessions to occupy public land, which – on maritime public property – may be a beach concession or a concession to build a dyke. By means of this concession, the State authorises the concessionaire to carry out works on the foreshore by which land is removed from the action of the tide. In respect of natural maritime public property an arrangement was established in 1807, traditionally called a concession to build a dyke and by which ownership was transferred (former Article L. 64 of the Code of State Property): the concessionaire was authorised to drain land, which, once removed from the action of the tide, no longer fell within the definition of natural maritime public property and could therefore be reclassified as private property and transferred by the State. That arrangement, which was originally used to build agricultural polders, has more recently been used for property developments in the form of marinas, reclaimed from the sea. Following a reaction to what was perceived as a privatisation of the shore, a circular was issued in 1973 prohibiting such arrangements – a prohibition later confirmed by the Coastal Areas Act, which imposes a broader prohibition on any interference with the natural state of the shore. It is now no longer possible to build marinas or polders by means of concessions to build dykes by which ownership is transferred. This arrangement can now apply only to past draining works and is the sole means of legalising these (source: www.mer.gouv.fr).', '45. Up until 1986 maritime public property was protected by the rules governing the highways. The Coastal Areas Act introduced new rules for the protection of natural public land (source: www.mer.gouv.fr).', '46. As early as the 1960s enthusiasm for seaside holidays brought about an increase in the number of tourists and thus in the number of buildings on the seashore ... . Awareness of the economic importance of the seashore and of the degree to which it is coveted made it necessary to introduce a rule of overriding legal force that would arbitrate between the many uses of coastal areas. It is in this spirit that the Coastal Areas Act of 3 January 1986 (consolidated on 7 August 2007) was unanimously passed by Parliament. Section 1 of the Act provides that coastal areas are “geographical entities which call for a specific policy of development, protection and enhancement”. The general principles of that Act consist in preserving rare and fragile areas, managing spatial planning and tourist development economically and, lastly, making the shore – like the beach – more widely accessible to the public and giving priority in coastal areas to marine-related activities.', '47. It is in the planning sphere that the principles established are the best known and have given rise to the most litigation. Planning permission for further development must be granted with regard to continuation of existing constructions or new hamlets. It is forbidden to build roads on the shore and through roads cannot be built closer than 2,000 metres from the shore. In order to preserve natural sites the Act imposes a “no building” rule within a 100-metre band – outside urban centres – from the shore, and restricts development in areas near the shore. Lastly, sites of outstanding interest or characteristic of the shore must be preserved and only small-scale development can be allowed.', '48. The Act has laid down rules for managing maritime public property which include a mandatory public inquiry prior to any substantive change of use, clarifying the procedures for delimiting the foreshore, prohibiting – other than in exceptional circumstances – interference with the natural state of the seashore and establishing specific rules for collective mooring. Lastly, it has established the principles of unobstructed and free public use of the beaches and facilitated public access to the sea (see Article 321-9 of the Environment Code and Article L. 2124-4 of the CGPPP: “Pedestrians shall have free access to beaches ... . Beaches are fundamentally reserved for the unobstructed and free use of the public.”', '49. Section 25 of the Act, now Article L. 2124-1 of the CGPPP, has given rise to a reform of the rules governing the occupation of maritime public property. It provides:', '“Decisions regarding the use of maritime public property shall take account of the vocation of the zones in question and those of the neighbouring terrestrial areas, as well as of the requirements of conservation of coastal sites and landscapes and biological resources. Accordingly, they shall be coordinated with, inter alia, decisions concerning neighbouring public land.', 'Subject to specific provisions regarding national defence and the requirements of maritime safety, any substantive change of use of zones of maritime public property shall first be the subject of a public inquiry ...”', '50. Section 27 of the Act, now Article L. 2124-2 of the CGPPP, lays down the principle that there shall be no interference with the natural state of the seashore:', '“Subject to sea defence operations being carried out and the construction of structures and installations required for maritime safety, national defence, sea fishing, salt works and marine cultures, the natural state of the seashore, outside port and industrial port areas, may not be damaged, especially by dyke construction, drainage, rock filling or embankment forming, except for structures or installations related to providing a public service or carrying out construction work for which the seaside location is essential for topographical or technical reasons that have been declared of public interest.', 'However, land draining carried out prior to the present Act shall continue to be governed by the previous legislation.”', '51. The following is an extract from the section entitled “Matching facts with the theory” of a report on the conditions of application of the Coastal Areas Act, drawn up by the Highways Authority and sent to the Minister for Infrastructure, Housing and Transport in July 2000:', '“... there is an acute sense of unfairness when an application for planning permission is turned down in respect of a site where the presence of buildings would appear to suggest that at other times the authorities have been less particular. ...', 'The right to enjoy “for life” but not to transfer a dwelling house built on maritime public property, as recognised in an agreement signed with the Prefect, the right granted to a married couple until their death to camp or park their caravan in a zone in which camping was now illegal, together with an agreement expressly stipulating that the right could not be inherited, illustrate the creativity shown by the authorities in this regard in Charente-Maritime and the Morbihan. ...', 'All sorts of liberties are increasingly being taken in various degrees of good faith. ... Should we simply ignore the development of a black market in permits to occupy public property ... Should we not be attempting to establish liability on the part of public officials who in the course of their administrative duties have knowingly contributed to creating or exacerbating an illegal situation? ...”', '52. A report entitled “Assessment of the Coastal Areas Act and measures in favour of coastal areas”, prepared by the Government for Parliament (September 2007), contains a part devoted to opening coastal areas to pedestrians which is worded as follows:', '“The purpose of the Coastal Areas Act is to maintain or develop tourism in coastal areas. Sections 3 to 8 of the Act, in particular, lay down the conditions in which the public may visit natural sites, the seashore and the corresponding facilities. The provision of coastal paths goes some way towards giving effect to these legislative provisions. ... The public can continue to walk along the coast by virtue of an easement over private properties and a right of way over public land that may belong to the State (maritime public property), the Coastal Protection Agency or local and regional authorities ... .', 'Making a pathway often requires an on-site study of the terrain in order to determine whether the coastal area in question can be opened to pedestrians without harming the fauna, the flora or the stability of the soil. If the land is considered to be accessible without any risk to the environment, regard will have to be had to where the path is routed, particularly across private property, it being observed that the statutory route (three metres in width running along the boundary of maritime public property) is not always the most appropriate solution. If the statutory route across private properties has been modified, a public inquiry must be carried out. ...”', '53. The Court examined the situation in sixteen coastal member States. Only four States (Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the United Kingdom and Sweden) do not recognise the existence of maritime public property exclusive of any private ownership rights. In the other twelve States (Germany, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Turkey), maritime public property belongs either to the State or to other public bodies and is inalienable on that basis. In all these States maritime public property can nevertheless be designated for private use on the basis of fixed-term concessions. And in all these States illegal use exposes the offender to administrative or even criminal penalties. In particular, the illegal construction of immovable property can result in the offender being ordered to demolish the building concerned at his or her own expense and without compensation. This type of measure also exists in Sweden, where the private right of ownership of land on the seashore is recognised by law but the land is subject to relatively strict easements which prohibit the construction of new buildings and guarantee public access to the sea.', '54. In Croatia, as in Spain, the owners of buildings legally built and acquired before the entry into force of the “Maritime Property Act” (2006) in the case of the former and the Coastal Areas Act in the case of the latter (1988), and designed for use as a dwelling, could obtain a concession of these buildings, without any obligation to pay a charge on the sole condition that they apply for the concession within one year of the entry into force of the Act. In Spain properties built before the Act came into force without a permit or concession as required by the previous legislation will be demolished if they cannot be legalised on public-interest grounds. Any building that was authorised before the Act came into force but is now illegal will be demolished on the expiry of the concession if it is located on land falling within the category of maritime public property. In Turkey, according to the case-law of the Court of Cassation (judgment of 10 October 2007), which refers to the judgment in Doğrusöz and Aslan v Turkey (no. 1262/02, 30 May 2006), if the annulment of a property deed in respect of property located inside the delineation of the seashore is compatible with the domestic legislation, the interested party can apply to the courts for compensation for his or her pecuniary loss.', ""55.

The court found that the applicant had not satisfied two of the five conditions listed in section 28a of the Act of 18 January 1996 on Physical Education (ustawa o kulturze fizycznej) (“the 1996 Act”), namely he was not a Polish national and did not have his place of residence in Poland. Accordingly, the court found that the challenged decision had been given in accordance with the law and that the applicant’s complaint therefore had to be dismissed.', 'In 2003 the applicant requested the relevant Polish authorities to grant him Polish citizenship.', 'On 11 February 2004 the President of the Republic of Poland granted the applicant Polish citizenship.', 'On 1 September 2005 the Professional Sports Act (Ustawa o sporcie kwalifikowanym) of 29 July 2005 entered into force.

The applicant, who is a French national of Polish origin, was born in 1931. She lived for a long time in Andrésy, France. At present, she lives in Poznań, Poland. She owns a house and a plot of land in Gdynia, Poland. The property previously belonged to her parents.', '12. Polish legislation on rent control is the result of many historical and recent factors. Legislative schemes restricting the rights of landlords and regulating increases in rent were already in operation before the Second World War. The description below of the general situation is based on the findings of the Polish Constitutional Court (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) which, on 12 January 2000, in one of its judgments concerning the constitutionality of certain aspects of the legislation on rent control, gave thorough consideration to the historical background of this legislation and the factors contributing to the preservation of restrictions dating back to an early stage of the communist regime in Poland.', '13. The rent-control scheme was the consequence of the introduction of the so-called “State management of housing matters” (publiczna gospodarka lokalami) by the former communist authorities (see paragraphs 67-70 below). It was accompanied by provisions drastically restricting the amount of rent chargeable. The applicable provisions originated in the exceptionally rigid distribution of housing resources which characterised the first thirty years of the communist regime in Poland.', '14. The circumstances did not change significantly after the end of the communist rule in 1989. Indeed, at the beginning of the 1990s the housing situation of Poland was particularly difficult, as was demonstrated, on the one hand, by a shortage of dwellings and, on the other hand, by the high cost of acquiring a flat. The State-controlled rent, which also applied to privately owned buildings, covered just 30% of the actual costs of maintenance of the buildings.', 'In 1994 those social and economic factors prompted the legislature not only to maintain elements of the so-called “special lease scheme” (szczególny tryb najmu) (see paragraph 69 below) in respect of State-owned dwellings but also to continue to apply that scheme – temporarily, for a period of ten years expiring on 31 December 2004 – to privately owned buildings and dwellings. In short, the system was a combination of restrictions on the amount of rent chargeable and of limitations on the termination of leases, even in respect of tenants who did not comply with the terms of the contract.', '15. The material collected by the Constitutional Court in 2000 included a report prepared by the Office for Housing and Town Development (Urząd Mieszkalnictwa i Rozwoju Miast). According to that report, in 1998, after four years of the operation of the 1994 rent-control scheme, the average rent as fixed under that scheme covered only 60% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. The shortfall was to be covered by landlords. The scale of the problem was considered to have been very large, since at that time 2,960,000 dwellings (25.5% of the country’s entire housing resources) were let under the rent-control scheme. That number comprised some 600,000 flats in buildings owned by private individuals. The total number of flats in Poland was estimated at about 11,600,000. Flats in privately owned buildings subject to the rent-control scheme constituted 5.2% of the country’s housing resources.', 'The report stated, among other things:', '“Before ... [1994], statutory rent determined by the Cabinet covered about 30% of running maintenance costs. At present, after four years of operation of the [1994] rent-control scheme, municipalities set levels of rent covering on average 60% of maintenance costs. ...', 'In respect of buildings owned by municipalities, the shortfall is covered by the municipalities, which frequently use for that purpose surplus derived from letting commercial premises.', 'As regards privately owned buildings where tenants pay controlled rent, the shortfall is covered by the owners of the buildings.”', '16. In 2003-04 the government, in the course of preparation of its bill amending the legislation on rent control (see paragraphs 114 et seq. below), collected a considerable amount of data describing the current general housing situation in Poland.', 'The situation is characterised by a serious shortage of residential dwellings. According to the 2002 national population and housing census, the deficit, defined as the difference between the number of households and the number of flats, amounts to 1,500,000 flats. There is a particularly acute shortage of flats to let.', '17. Data collected by the Central Statistical Office (Główny Urząd Statystyczny) on the overall financial situation of households, indicate that in the years 1998-2003 household expenses such as rent and electricity bills amounted to 14.5%-15.4% of total expenses (18.6%-19% in pensioners’ households). During the same period, between 7% and 10% of Polish households were in rent arrears (1998: 7.5%; 1999: 7%; 2000: 7%; 2002: 10%; 2003: 9%).', 'In 2000 about 54% of the population lived below the poverty line, of which 8% were below the abject poverty line. In 2002 some 58% of the population lived below the poverty line, of which 11% were below the abject poverty line.', '18. Various reports received by the Office for Housing and Town Development confirmed that the provisions relating to the protection of tenants as applicable until 31 December 2004 (see paragraphs 85-89 below) limited the availability of flats to let. In the authorities’ view, the introduction of the so-called “commercial lease” (najem komercyjny) – in other words a market-related lease – by lifting restrictions on rent increases for privately owned buildings and freeing private landlords from their obligation to provide indigent tenants with alternative accommodation upon the termination of their lease, should encourage private investors to build tenement houses designated solely for letting.', '19. The Government gave various figures to indicate the number of persons potentially affected by the operation of the rent-control scheme. They stated that, according to information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development, the operation of the relevant legislation affected approximately 100,000 landlords and 600,000 tenants. Other sources cited by the Government indicated that the total number of persons concerned was around 100,000 landlords and 900,000 tenants.', '20. The applicant’s house was built in 1936 as a one-family home. It originally consisted of a duplex flat, a basement and an attic.', '21. During the Second World War, the house was occupied by officers of the German army. In May 1945 it was taken over by the Red Army, which quartered some of its officers there for a while.', '22. On 19 May 1945 the head of the housing department of Gdynia City Council (Kierownik Wydziału Mieszkaniowego Magistratu Miasta Gdynia) issued a decision assigning the first-floor level of the duplex flat to a certain A.Z.', '23. In June 1945 the Gdynia City Court (Sąd Grodzki) ordered the return of the house to the applicant’s parents. They began to renovate it but, shortly afterwards, were ordered to leave. A.Z. moved into the house in October 1945.', '24. On 13 February 1946 the Decree of 21 December 1945 on the State management of housing and lease control (Dekret o publicznej gospodarce lokalami i kontroli najmu) came into force. Under its provisions, the house became subject to the so-called “State management of housing matters” (see paragraph 13 above).', '25. In 1948, at a public auction, the authorities unsuccessfully tried to sell the house to A.Z., who was at that time employed by Gdynia City Council, an authority responsible for the State management of housing matters at the material time. At about the same time, the applicant’s parents, likewise unsuccessfully, tried to recover their property.', '26. On 1 August 1974 the Housing Act (Prawo lokalowe) (“the 1974 Housing Act”) came into force. It replaced the State management of housing matters with the so-called “special lease scheme” (see paragraphs 14 above and 69 below).', '27. On an unknown date in 1975 a certain W.P., who was at that time head of the housing department of Gdynia City Council (Kierownik Wydziału Spraw Lokalowych Urzędu Miejskiego), tried to buy the house from the applicant’s brother.', '28. On 8 July 1975 the mayor of Gdynia issued a decision allowing W.P. to exchange the flat he was renting in another building under the special lease scheme for the ground-floor flat in the applicant’s house. That decision was signed on behalf of the mayor of Gdynia by a civil servant who was subordinate to W.P. On 28 January 1976 Gdynia City Council issued a decision confirming that under the provisions governing the special lease scheme the flat had been let to W.P. for an indefinite period. Later, in the 1990s, the applicant tried to have that decision declared null and void but succeeded only in obtaining a decision declaring that it had been issued contrary to the law (see paragraphs 44-49 below).', '29. On 24 October 1975 the head of the local management and environment office of Gdynia City Council (Kierownik Wydziału Gospodarki Terenowej i Ochrony Środowiska Urzędu Miejskiego w Gdyni) ordered that the house become subject to State management (przejęcie w zarząd państwowy). That decision took effect on 2 January 1976.', '30. On 3 August 1988 the Gdynia District Court (Sąd Rejonowy), ruling on an application by A.Z.’s relatives, gave judgment, declaring that, after A.Z.’s death, her daughter (J.P.) and son-in-law (M.P.) had inherited the right to rent the first-floor flat in the applicant’s house.', '31. On 18 September 1990 the Gdynia District Court gave a decision declaring that the applicant had inherited her parents’ property. On 25 October 1990 the Gdynia District Court entered her title in the relevant land register.', '32. On 26 October 1990 the mayor of Gdynia issued a decision restoring the management of the house to the applicant. On 31 July 1991, acting through her representative, she took over the management of the house from Gdynia City Council. Shortly afterwards, she began to refurbish the house.', '33. On an unknown date in the 1990s the applicant set up a private foundation called the Amber Trail Foundation (Fundacja Bursztynowego Szlaku). Since 1991 she has been trying to make her house the seat of the foundation.', '34. After taking over the management of the house, the applicant initiated several sets of proceedings – civil and administrative – in order to annul the previous administrative decisions and regain possession of the flats in her house.', '35. On 16 June 1992 the applicant asked the Gdynia District Court to order the eviction of her tenants. In April 1993, on an application by the defendants, those proceedings were stayed. On 26 April 1996 the applicant’s claim was dismissed.', '36. In April 1995 the applicant asked the Gdańsk Regional Court (Sąd Wojewódzki) to order Gdynia City Council to relocate the tenants living in her house to dwellings owned by the municipality. She also asked the court to award her compensation, inter alia, for the fact that the authorities had deprived her parents and herself of any possibility of living in their own house, for damage to the property and arbitrary alteration of its use, and for mental suffering. On 5 July 1996 the Regional Court ruled that, under the Lease of Dwellings and Housing Allowances Act of 2 July 1994 (Ustawa o najmie lokali mieszkalnych i dodatkach mieszkaniowych) (“the 1994 Act”), the defendant authority had no obligation to relocate the tenants to accommodation owned by the municipality. It dismissed the remainder of the claims. The applicant appealed.', '37. On 17 January 1997 the Gdańsk Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) heard, and dismissed, her appeal. It observed that no provision of the 1994 Act obliged the municipal authorities to relocate the applicant’s tenants or, at her request, to provide them with alternative accommodation (lokal zastępczy). The relevant provisions of the 1994 Act, namely section 56(4) and (7) (see paragraph 77 below), stipulated that a tenant had to vacate a dwelling only if the owner had offered him another flat he owned or the municipality had agreed to provide the tenant with alternative accommodation owned or administered by it. As regards the applicant’s claim for damages for financial loss sustained as a result of the administrative decisions, the Court of Appeal observed that such claims could be determined by the courts of law only if a claimant had first applied for compensation to the administrative authorities and the outcome of the relevant administrative proceedings had been unfavourable. It referred the applicant to the Code of Administrative Procedure (Kodeks postępowania administracyjnego), which set out the rules governing the liability of public authorities for issuing wrongful decisions.', 'In so far as the applicant sought compensation for damage to the house and for the alteration of its use, the Court of Appeal considered that the defendant authority could not be held liable for the consequences of the laws which had previously been in force. In particular, it was not liable for the enactment of the post-war legislation which had introduced restrictive rules concerning the lease of dwellings in privately owned houses and the State management of housing matters. Nor was it liable for the implementation of the special lease scheme introduced by the 1974 Housing Act and the operation of the 1994 Act, which incorporated certain similar rules for the protection of tenants whose right to rent flats in privately owned houses had been conferred on them by administrative decisions (see paragraphs 71-72 below). Lastly, the court noted that the defendant could not be liable for any damage caused by the applicant’s tenants.', '38. Subsequently, the applicant lodged a cassation appeal (kasacja) with the Supreme Court (Sąd Najwyższy). On 13 November 1997 the Supreme Court dismissed that appeal on procedural grounds. The court held that the applicant had not complied with the relevant formal requirements; in particular, she had not specified the errors of substantive civil law allegedly committed by the lower courts.', '39. In October 1995 the applicant asked the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal (Samorządowe Kolegium Odwoławcze) to declare null and void the decision of the head of the housing department of Gdynia City Council of 19 May 1945. By virtue of that decision, the first-floor flat in the house had been assigned to A.Z. It had also formed a basis for granting the right to lease that flat in the applicant’s house to A.Z.’s successors (see paragraphs 22-23 and 30 above).', '40. On 26 June 1997 the Board rejected her application. It noted that the impugned decision had been taken pursuant to the Decree on housing commissions issued by the Polish Committee of National Liberation on 7 September 1944 (Dekret Polskiego Komitetu Wyzwolenia Narodowego o komisjach mieszkaniowych), a provision which had at the relevant time governed all housing matters. It found that the decision had not been issued by the competent public authority and, in consequence, had not been lawful. Yet the Board could not declare the decision null and void (stwierdzić nieważność decyzji) because, pursuant to Article 156 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, if more than ten years had elapsed from the date on which the unlawful decision had been made, the Board could only declare that the decision “had been issued contrary to the law” (została wydana z naruszeniem prawa).', '41. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny). On 15 January 1998 the court dismissed her appeal because she had not availed herself of an obligatory legal remedy in that she had not made an application to the Board for the matter to be reconsidered (wniosek o ponowne rozpatrzenie sprawy).', '42. The applicant subsequently made such an application. On 23 June 1998 the Board upheld its decision of 26 June 1997. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. The Gdańsk Regional Prosecutor (Prokurator Wojewódzki) joined the proceedings and lodged an appeal on the applicant’s behalf.', '43. On 8 June 1999 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed both appeals. It confirmed that the impugned decision had been unlawful. It added that there had been several procedural shortcomings (for instance, the applicant’s parents had not been notified of the proceedings and had never had any opportunity to challenge the decision; in addition, no legal basis had been given for it). However, in accordance with Article 156 § 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, the court could not annul the decision but could only declare that it had been issued contrary to the law. In passing, the court observed that the above-mentioned procedural shortcomings could be rectified by means of reopening the proceedings.', '44. In 1992 the applicant asked the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal to declare null and void the decision of the mayor of Gdynia of 8 July 1975. By virtue of that decision, W.P. had been granted the right to lease the ground-floor flat in the applicant’s house (see paragraph 28 above)', '45. On 27 January 1994 the Board rejected her application. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court.', '46. On 14 June 1995 the court dismissed her appeal. It found that the flats in the applicant’s house had been let under the special lease scheme introduced by the 1974 Housing Act and that, accordingly, the mayor had been competent to issue the decision in question. It further observed that, despite some procedural errors committed by the mayor of Gdynia (which could be rectified by means of reopening the proceedings), the decision had had a legal basis and could not, therefore, be declared null and void.', '47. On 17 September 1994 the applicant asked the mayor of Gdynia to reopen the relevant proceedings and to declare the impugned decision null and void. The mayor rejected her application as being lodged out of time.', '48. On 29 December 1995 the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal, of its own motion, reopened the proceedings. It found that the contested decision had been made on behalf of the mayor of Gdynia by a civil servant who had been W.P.’s subordinate and that that fact in itself constituted a sufficient ground for reopening the proceedings pursuant to Article 145 § 1 (3) of the Code of Administrative Procedure. That fact had also rendered the decision unlawful. However, since more than five years had elapsed from the date on which the decision had been given, the Board could not annul it. It could merely declare that it had been issued contrary to the law, as laid down in Article 146 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure.', '49. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, alleging that the decision had never been served on the owners of the house and that it should have been declared null and void. On 28 November 1996 her appeal was dismissed.', '50. On 4 October 1994 the applicant asked Gdynia City Council to reopen the administrative proceedings that had been terminated on 24 October 1975 by the decision of the head of the local management and environment office of Gdynia City Council. By virtue of that decision, the applicant’s house had become subject to State management (see paragraph 29 above). She further asked to have the decision declared null and void, submitting that it had lacked a legal basis. In particular, the house had incorrectly been classified as a “tenement house” (dom wielorodzinny), whereas in reality it was, and always had been, a one-family house and, as such, should not have become subject to State management. The decision, the applicant added, had been made solely for the personal benefit and gain of W.P., who had at that time been the head of the housing department of Gdynia City Council. In her view, it had been made to sanction the prior – and likewise unlawful – decision of 8 July 1975 whereby W.P. had acquired the right to lease the flat in her house.', '51. On 7 December 1994 the mayor of Gdynia rejected her application, finding that she had lodged it outside the prescribed time-limit. On 12 June 1995 the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal upheld the mayor’s decision. Subsequently, the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court. On 14 November 1996 the court quashed both decisions because the mayor of Gdynia had not been competent to rule on the application.', '52. On 27 February 1997 the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal reopened the proceedings terminated by the decision of 24 October 1975. On 28 April 1997 the Board declared that that decision had been issued contrary to the law because the owners of the house had not been notified of the proceedings. It found that Gdynia City Council had not acted with due diligence. In particular, it had made no effort to establish who had been the rightful successors to the owners of the house, while at the material time the applicant and her brother had – on a regular basis – paid the relevant taxes on the property to the City Council. Relying on Article 146 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Procedure, the Board refused to annul the decision because more than five years had elapsed from the date on which it had been given.', '53. On an unspecified date in 2002 the applicant asked the Governor of Pomerania (Wojewoda Pomorski) to declare the decision of 24 October 1975 null and void. The application was referred to the Gdańsk Self-Government Board of Appeal, a body competent to deal with the matter. The Board rejected the application on 13 May 2002. It held that the matter was res judicata.', '54. The parties gave differing information as to the actual usable surface area of the flats in the applicant’s house, a factor relevant for the determination of the chargeable rent.', '55. The Government submitted that the usable surface area of the applicant’s house was 196 square metres. They produced an inventory done on 1 August 1991 in connection with the transfer of management of the house from Gdynia City Council to the applicant (see also paragraph 32 above). The usable surface area of the house was estimated at 196 sq. m; no net living area was indicated. There were four flats and no commercial premises. The number of habitable rooms in the flats was twelve. The surface area of those flats was estimated at 148 sq. m. The total surface area of the house was indicated as 255 sq. m.', '56. The applicant stated that the total surface area of the house occupied by the tenants and for which they paid rent was about 250 sq. m. In that connection, she supplied a declaration of 28 May 2001, issued by the Gdynia Association of Landlords and Managing Agents (Zrzeszenie Właścicieli i Zarządców Domów), an agency that apparently administered her property. According to the declaration, since at least the 1950s the applicant’s house had been divided into three flats leased by means of the agreements originating in the administrative decisions described above.', '57. The usable surface areas of those flats for the purposes of fixing rent were as follows: flat no. 1 = 127.38 sq. m; flat no. 3 = 67.90 sq. m; and flat no. 4 = 54.25 sq. m. Accordingly, the total usable surface area occupied by the tenants was 249.53 sq. m.', '58. On an unspecified date in 1995 W.P. asked the Gdynia District Court to determine the amount of the rent to be paid by him. On 20 March 1996 the District Court gave judgment and determined the amount of rent at 33.66 Polish zlotys (PLN) per month. It ordered the applicant to pay costs in the amount of PLN 528.90.', '59. According to the Gdynia Association of Landlords and Managing Agents’ declaration of 28 May 2001 (see paragraph 56 above), the amounts of rent to be paid by the applicant’s tenants were as follows: for flat no. 1 (usable surface area of 127.38 sq. m), occupied by J.P. and M.P.: PLN 500.60; for flat no. 3 (usable surface area of 67.90 sq. m), occupied by W.P.: PLN 322.65; for flat no. 4 (former attic; usable surface area 54.25 sq. m.), occupied by J.W.: PLN 188.25. Dwelling no. 2 (apparently originally the bedroom of the applicant’s parents, later used as a drying room), which had previously been used by W.P. without any legal title or authorisation and for which he had paid no rent, was at that time locked and sealed by the managing agent. W.P. was served with a notice ordering him to pay PLN 2,982.46 for the unauthorised use of the dwelling on pain of being evicted.', 'At the hearing before the Chamber on 27 January 2004, the Government informed the Court that the rent paid by J.P. and M.P. on that date was PLN 531.63.', '60. Following a request by the Chamber to produce evidence establishing the situation of the applicant’s tenants, the Government supplied a certificate issued by the Gdynia District Centre for Social Services (Dzielnicowy Ośrodek Pomocy Społecznej) on 19 February 1993. The certificate stated that W.P. had received assistance from the centre as from January 1993. He was to obtain a periodical social welfare benefit for March and May 1993. In 1992 he had received assistance for housing purposes. The certificate further stated that W.P. had earlier been assessed as having a “disability of the second degree”, the disability and its degree being subject to a medical verification in May 1993.', '61. On 12 February 2004, in reply to an enquiry by the Government in connection with the present case, the Gdynia City Centre for Social Services (Miejski Ośrodek Pomocy Społecznej) stated that the applicant’s tenants, W.P., J.P., M.P. and J.W., were not receiving any assistance from the centre and they had not received any assistance from social services for the past few years, that is from 1995 onwards.', '62. In reply to a question from the Chamber as to the amount of controlled rent received by the applicant from 10 October 1994 onwards, the Government stated that they had no details of the rent received by the applicant at the relevant time. However, they supplied indicators relevant for the fixing of a controlled rent, as determined by Gdynia City Council for similar houses.', '63. According to this information, in December 1994 the rent per square metre was 9,817 old Polish zlotys; from January to November 1995, PLN 1.04; from December 1995 to October 1996, PLN 2.11; from November 1996 to December 1997, PLN 2.63; from January 1998 to January 1999, PLN 3.37; from February 1999 to January 2000, PLN 4.01; from February 2000 to February 2001, PLN 4.37; and from April 2002 to October 2002, PLN 4.61.', '64. On 10 October 2002, following the coming into effect of the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 2 October 2002, it became possible for landlords to increase the rent up to 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling (see paragraphs 86, 102-04 and 113 below).', 'From December 2002 to 30 June 2003 the relevant conversion index of the reconstruction value of the dwelling (see paragraphs 75 and 85 below) was PLN 2,525.30. From 1 July to 31 December 2003 it amounted to PLN 2,471.86.', 'In 2004 the conversion index was fixed at PLN 2,061.21. The Government submitted that the reconstruction value of the dwellings in the applicant’s house was calculated on the basis of the following three elements: the 3% mentioned above, the usable surface area of the flats and the relevant conversion index (PLN 2,061.21). The monthly rent per square metre in the applicant’s house corresponded to 3% of the conversion index of the reconstruction value of a square metre divided by 12 months (3% x PLN 2,061.21 = PLN 61.83/12). It accordingly amounted to approximately PLN 5.15 per square metre. Having regard to the usable surface area of the house as indicated by the Government, the maximum monthly chargeable rent was PLN 1,009.40 (PLN 5.15 x 196 sq. m). Taking into account the surface area as indicated by the applicant, the relevant amount was PLN 1,285.08 (PLN 5.15 x 249.53 sq. m).', '65. According to the applicant, in the years 1994-99 the free-market rent for the three flats in her house would have amounted to 1,700 United States dollars (USD) per month (USD 800 + USD 500 + USD 400 respectively, depending on the size of the flat). In the years 2000-02 the rent would have decreased to USD 1,250 per month (USD 600 + USD 350 + USD 300). In 2003 it would have been further reduced to USD 900 per month (USD 450 + USD 250 + USD 200). She stated that her prognosis as to the decrease in rent was based on such factors as the devaluation of the house owing to its age and the decreasing demand and increasing supply of flats to let on the market.', '66. In their referral request of 20 May 2005, the Government informed the Court that two of the applicant’s flats had become vacant because W.P. had moved out on 2 June 2003 and J.P. and M.P. had moved out on 6 September 2004. They also stated that J.W. had recently been offered a council flat by the authorities and was about to move out.', 'At the oral hearing, the Government said that J.W. was still living in the flat but that she was to move out in the coming weeks.', 'On 18 April 2006 the Government informed the Court that J.W. had moved to a council flat on 15 February 2006.', '67. The Cabinet Decree of 21 December 1945 on the State management of housing and lease control (Dekret z 21 grudnia 1945 r. o publicznej gospodarce lokalami i kontroli najmu), which came into force on 13 February 1946, introduced “State management of housing matters”, which also applied to dwellings or commercial premises in privately owned buildings (see paragraph 13 above).', '68. Later, on 1 September 1948, the Decree of 28 July 1948 on the lease of dwellings (Dekret o najmie lokali) came into force. Under its provisions, the State authorities administered all housing matters in the public and private sectors alike. The authorities were given power to issue a decision assigning to a tenant a particular flat in a privately owned building. Those provisions also laid down rules concerning rent control.', '69. The 1974 Housing Act introduced the “special lease scheme”, which replaced “State management of housing matters”, although it did not significantly change the principles on which the right to lease was based. For instance, the right to lease a flat in a building subject to “State management” did not originate in a civil contract but was conferred on a tenant by an administrative decision. The owner of such a building had no say as to who could live in his or her house and for how long. The special lease scheme applied to residential and commercial premises.', '70. Decisions on “allocation of a dwelling” (przydział lokalu) were, for all practical purposes, tantamount to “granting” a right to lease a dwelling (or commercial premises) under the special lease scheme. They were issued by the relevant departments of the local council (depending on which of the many reforms of the system of public administration was being carried out, those departments were called variously “housing departments”, “departments of local management and environment”, “dwelling departments”, etc.).', '71. The Act came into force on 12 November 1994. It was intended to bring about a reform of the law governing the relationship between landlords and tenants. Although it abolished the “special lease scheme” and relaxed the control of rent by, for instance, allowing rents of commercial premises to be market-related and determined freely, as well as allowing rents for residential dwellings to be fixed freely in civil contracts between landlords and tenants, it maintained the control of rent of residential dwellings in which the right to lease a flat had earlier been conferred on a tenant by an administrative decision.', '72. The 1994 Act introduced the system of “controlled rent” (czynsz regulowany) and set out detailed regulations on the calculation of rent for residential dwellings which had so far been subject to the “special lease scheme”. The provisions concerning controlled rent, the ratio legis of which was to protect tenants in a difficult financial situation during the transition from a State-controlled to a free-market housing system, were to remain in force until 31 December 2004.', 'The 1994 Act maintained, albeit with slightly modified wording, the rules concerning the protection of tenants against the termination of leases continued on the basis of previous administrative decisions and the right of succession to a lease.', '73. Section 8(1) of the Act read:', '“1. In the event of a tenant’s death, his or her descendants, ascendants, adult siblings, adoptive parents or adopted children or a person who has lived with a tenant in de facto marital cohabitation, shall, on condition that they lived in the tenant’s household until his or her death, succeed to the tenancy agreement and acquire the tenant’s rights and obligations connected with [the lease of] the flat, unless they relinquish that right to the landlord. This provision shall not apply to persons who, when the [original] tenant died, had title to another residential dwelling.', '2. In cases where there is no successor to the tenancy agreement, or where the successors have relinquished their right, the lease shall expire.”', '74. Section 20 set out the following:', '“(1) Under the lease agreement the tenant is obliged to pay the rent.', '(2) In the cases provided for by the present statute, the rent shall be determined in a manner specified in this Act (controlled rent). In other cases the rent shall be determined freely.', '(3) The rent shall be determined with reference to the physical state of the building in question, its surface area and the condition of the flat and other factors which increase or reduce the flat’s value.', '(4) The parties shall specify the rent in their agreement.”', '75. Section 25, which, pursuant to section 56(2) (see paragraph 77 below), also applied to privately owned flats subject to the previous special lease scheme, provided:', '“(1) Subject to the reservation set forth in section 66, controlled rent shall be paid by tenants of dwellings belonging to municipalities, the State Treasury, State legal entities or legal entities administering dwellings for non-profit-making purposes, except for housing cooperatives.', '(2) The maximum controlled rent must not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling [wartość odtworzeniowa lokalu] per annum.', '(3) The reconstruction value of the flat shall be the product of its usable area and the conversion index of 1 square metre of the usable area of the building.', '(4) The [relevant] Governor shall, by means of an ordinance issued quarterly, determine the conversion index of 1 square metre of the usable surface area of the residential building.”', '76. Under the transitional provisions of the Act the right to lease a flat conferred on a tenant by an administrative decision was to be treated as a lease originating in a lease agreement concluded under the relevant provisions of the Civil Code. Tenants of such flats were to pay controlled rent until 31 December 2004.', 'Under section 55 of the Act the lease of a flat on the basis of an administrative decision issued under the 1974 Housing Act was to remain in force.', '77. Section 56 laid down further regulations in respect of such “administrative leases”. Its relevant parts provided:', '“(1) Under this Act, a lease which originated in an administrative decision on the allocation of a flat, or had another legal basis [that existed] before State management of housing or the special lease scheme was introduced in a given locality, shall be treated as a contractual lease signed for an indefinite period under the provisions of this Act.', '(2) Until 31 December 2004 inclusive, the rent for flats let in the manner specified in subsection (1) in dwellings owned by natural persons shall be determined in accordance with the provisions concerning controlled rent.', '...', '(4) If an owner referred to in subsection (2) intends to dwell in his flat and with that intention has vacated the flat which he has hitherto rented ... from the municipality, the tenant shall be obliged to vacate the owner’s flat and move into the flat [offered to him], provided that the [condition of] the flat in question complies with the requirements laid down by this Act in respect of alternative accommodation. If such is the case, the owner may terminate the lease under section 32(2).', '...', '(6) If the owner’s adult child or parents are to dwell in his flat, subsection (4) ... shall apply by analogy.', '(7) If the landlord has offered the tenant alternative accommodation which he or she owns himself or if, at the owner’s request, such alternative accommodation has been provided by the municipality, subsection (4) shall apply by analogy.”', '78. Section 9 of the Act set out a detailed list of landlords’ duties under a tenancy. It applied both to landlords letting flats for a freely determined, market-related rent and to landlords receiving controlled rent. It also listed the types of maintenance work to be carried out by landlords under lease agreements. The relevant parts of that section provided:', '“(1) The landlord shall ensure that the existing technical facilities in the building are in working order; shall enable the tenant to use lighting and heating in the dwelling; shall ensure that the dwelling is supplied with cold and hot water; and shall ensure the proper functioning of lifts, the collective aerial, and other facilities in the building;', '...', '(3) The landlord shall, in particular:', '1. maintain in working order and keep clean any shared premises and facilities in the building; the same should apply to the vicinity of the building;', '2. carry out repairs in the building and its dwellings and facilities, and restore any building which has been damaged, regardless of the cause of such damage; however, the tenant shall bear the costs of repairing damage for which he is liable;', '3. carry out repairs in the dwellings, repair or replace installations and technical facilities and, in particular, carry out repairs for which the tenant is not responsible; in particular, he shall:', '(a) repair and replace the water supply installation in the building and the gas and hot water supply installations, and repair and replace the sewage, central heating (including radiators), electricity, telephone and collective aerial installations – the latter, however, without fittings;', '(b) replace or repair furnaces, window and door frames, floors, floor linings and plasterwork.', '...”', '79. In practice, if such a tenant had not fallen into more than two months’ arrears of controlled rent, the lease could not be terminated unless he had used the flat “in a manner inconsistent with its function”, damaged the flat or the building, repeatedly and flagrantly disturbed the peace and public order or had sublet the flat without obtaining the prior consent of the landlord (sections 31 and 32 of the 1994 Act).', 'However, even if a tenant had fallen into rent arrears exceeding two months, a landlord was obliged to notify him in writing of his intention to terminate the lease agreement and to grant him a period of one month to pay off both the arrears and the current month’s rent.', 'If, following the termination of the lease agreement, the tenant did not vacate the flat (which was very often the case, given the acute shortage of cheap dwellings for rent and the high costs involved in buying a flat), the landlord had to bring an action for eviction against him. If an eviction order was issued, the landlord, in order to have it enforced and the flat vacated, had to ask the relevant municipality to provide the tenant with “substitute accommodation”. As there was a very short supply of such accommodation, the enforcement of the eviction order and vacation of the premises could take many years. Once an eviction order had become final, the tenant, as long as he lived in the flat, was obliged to pay so-called “compensation for extra-contractual use” (odszkodowanie za bezumowne korzystanie), equal to 200% of the current rent. If that sum did not cover the losses incurred by the landlord in connection with maintenance of the flat, he could sue the tenant for supplementary compensation.', '80. On 12 January 2000 the Constitutional Court, ruling on a point of law referred to it by the Supreme Court, declared unconstitutional section 56(2) read in conjunction with, inter alia, section 25 of the 1994 Act (see paragraphs 75 and 77 above). It found that those provisions were in breach of Article 64 § 3 (admissible limitations on property rights) read in conjunction with Article 2 (rule of law and social justice) and Article 31 § 3 (principle of proportionality) of the Constitution (see paragraphs 107 and 109-10 below), and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, because they placed a disproportionately heavy and, from the point of view of the permitted restrictions on the right of property, unnecessary financial burden on the exercise of property rights by landlords owning flats subject to rent control.', 'The court ruled that the unconstitutional provisions should be repealed on 11 July 2001. That in practice meant that by that date Parliament had to enact new, constitutional, legislation dealing with the matter.', '81. Before giving its judgment, the Constitutional Court asked the President of the Office for Housing and Town Development (Prezes Urzędu Mieszkalnictwa i Rozwoju Miast) for information concerning the implementation of the 1994 Act and, more particularly, the manner of determining the “conversion index of 1 square metre of the usable surface area of the residential building” as referred to in section 25 of the Act. According to the information received, levels of controlled rent had never reached the statutory 3% of the reconstruction value referred to in section 25(2) but were determined by the municipalities at 1.3% of that figure. As a result, the levels of controlled rent covered merely 60% of the maintenance costs of residential dwellings. The rest had to be covered by landlords from their own resources. That did not allow them to put aside any savings for repairs.', '82. In the judgment, the Constitutional Court attached much importance to the fact that the relevant regulations concerning controlled rent had brought about a situation whereby the expenses incurred by owners of dwellings were much higher than the rent paid by tenants and that the former “had no influence on how the rates of controlled rent were determined”. In its view, that shortfall of the rent actually received had resulted in the progressive reduction of the value of tenement houses and this, with the passage of time, entailed consequences similar to expropriation.', 'The judgment contains extensive reasoning, the gist of which can be summarised as follows.', '“One of the essential elements of the right of property is the possibility of deriving profit from the object of ownership, which is of particular importance in a market economy. The legislature may regulate and limit this right in view of, among other things, the social context of enjoyment of property and duties towards the community that are inherent in ownership. In exceptional cases, ... it is even [acceptable] to exclude temporarily the possibility of ... deriving an income from goods that are the subject of ownership. However, if the limitations on a property right go even further and the legislature places an owner in a situation in which his property necessarily inflicts losses on him, while at the same time imposing on him a duty to maintain the property in a specific condition, it can be said that there is a limitation which impairs the very essence of that right. ...', 'The Constitutional Court observes that the applicable provisions very seriously limit the possibility for a landlord to use and dispose of his dwellings, as referred to in section 56(1) of the 1994 Act. In particular, under this section all earlier tenancy relationships, in so far as they originated in administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling ... were transformed into contractual leases for an indefinite period. ...', 'The Constitutional Court will not assess the compatibility of those regulations with the Constitution, as this is not the object of its ruling. It merely observes that, against that background, the owner of a building is practically deprived of any influence on the choice of tenants in his building and on whether the lease relationships with those persons should continue. ...', 'Thus, the possibility [for a landlord] to enjoy and dispose of property is very considerably limited. While it is not totally extinguished, as he may still sell his building (dwelling) or take out a mortgage on it and there are no restrictions on succession rights, the exclusion of the owner’s right to dispose of dwellings subject to the provisions of the 1994 Act results in the depreciation of the market value of the building. By the same token, other attributes which have so far not been taken away from the owner, such as the possibility of enjoying and disposing [of his property], are substantially reduced and his property right becomes illusory.', 'At the same time, the legal provisions impose on the owner of the building a number of onerous duties ... Not only do most of the applicable laws impose specific duties on the owner but they also provide for specific penalties for failure to comply with those duties or to discharge them properly. ...', 'The Constitutional Court considers that the 1994 Act and, especially, its practical application have not secured a sufficient mechanism for balancing the costs of maintaining a building, its equipment and surroundings and the income from controlled rent. ...', 'The Constitutional Court considers it necessary to draw attention to two further points which are relevant for the situation of the landlord.', 'Firstly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis-à-vis real expenses for maintenance of a building does not allow ... [landlords] to put aside savings for repairs and for keeping the building in a good condition. As a result, the tenement houses are gradually losing value. In terms of property rights, this should be perceived as a process of gradual deprivation of this right, leading, with the passage of time, to results similar to expropriation. Also, it has a general impact on the community because many tenement houses are approaching the time of their ‘technical death’ and, in consequence, not only will the owner lose his property but tenants will also lose the possibility of housing, which will hardly be compatible with Article 75 § 1 of the Constitution.', 'Secondly, the inadequacy of controlled rent vis-à-vis real expenses for maintenance of a building has not been duly recognised by the tax laws ... [Under those laws], landlords are treated in the same way as businessmen or persons letting dwellings for a profit and must bear the financial consequences of all losses caused by the lease of their dwellings. ...', '[As regards the principle of proportionality laid down in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution]', '... it may be justified to fix rent in such a way that it will not be disproportionate to the financial standing of tenants, so that it will be possible for them to maintain a decent standard of living (or at least a minimum standard) after paying the rent. Thus, it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a ‘social State’ to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who cannot provide subsistence for themselves and their families. By the nature of things, the extent of that sacrifice depends on the level of income and imposes a heavier burden on those who are better off. By the nature of things, the owners of property may be required to make sacrifices, according to the general principle that ‘ownership entails obligations’. However, the distribution of burdens among specific members of society cannot be arbitrary and must maintain rational proportions.', 'In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants. ... It may still – in any event in the transitional period – be justified to impose wider restrictions on property rights, precluding the freedom to derive profit by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building.', 'However, an assessment of the 1994 Act leads to the conclusion that the applicable restrictions do not stop there. The present regulations deliberately set the levels of controlled rents below the costs and expenses actually incurred by owners. That, in itself, would not necessarily have had to be considered unconstitutional had there been any parallel legal mechanism compensating for incurred losses. No such mechanisms have been set up. In consequence, the applicable provisions are based on the premise that property must – until the end of 2004 – entail losses for the owner and that, at the same time, the owner has a duty to incur expenses to maintain his property in a particular condition.', 'That means that the 1994 Act placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for tenants, or at least for tenants in a difficult financial position, on the owners of property. Besides, other remedies – such as, for instance, subsidising from public funds the costs of maintaining and repairing buildings referred to in section 56(1), ensuring full recognition in the tax regulations for losses and expenses incurred by landlords and making the level of rent dependent on the tenant’s income – have not been employed. Instead, the simplest means (being apparently the cheapest in social terms) have been applied, namely setting a low maximum level of rent and allowing the municipalities to make exceptions to that level. Consequently, it has been assumed that owners will cover the remaining costs of maintaining their property out of their own pockets. No proportionality whatsoever has been maintained in respect of the distribution of burdens (sacrifices) among the owners and the other members of society.', 'The Constitutional Court would stress once again that in the present context there is a constitutionally acknowledged necessity to protect the rights of tenants ... and this may be reflected in, among other things, provisions fixing a maximum level of rent. However, there is no constitutional necessity to afford them such protection mostly at the expense of private individuals – the owners of dwellings – because the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons. It is possible to adopt other legal solutions so as to secure at the same time the necessary protection to tenants and the minimum financial means needed to cover the requisite costs to the landlords. ... It is not for the Constitutional Court to indicate concrete solutions and to determine the ratio of costs to be incurred by tenants, landlords and the community as a whole. However, this Court considers that there are no constitutional considerations which justify imposing the greater part of those costs on the landlords. ...', 'Consequently, section 56(2) is incompatible with the Constitution. A limitation on the right of property ... which is not ‘necessary’ does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality.', '[Other considerations]', 'The finding that section 56(2) infringes the principle of proportionality makes it unnecessary for the Constitutional Court to determine whether that provision also infringes the very essence of the right of property since [a further finding to that effect] will not affect the merits of the ruling. It should merely be noted in passing that the question whether the ‘essence’ of the right of property has been preserved must also be assessed ... against the background of the combination of existing limitations on this right. ... The manner in which [rent control] has been effected by section 56(2) taken together with other provisions regarding privately owned buildings has [resulted] in the owners being deprived of even the slightest substance of their property rights.', 'It is the Constitutional Court’s opinion that, in consequence, the right to derive profit from property, which is an important element of the right of property, has been destroyed and, at the same time, the second element, the right to dispose of one’s property, has been stripped of its substance. In consequence, the right of property has become illusory and unable to fulfil its purpose in the legal order based on the principles listed in Article 20 of the Constitution [principles of social market economy, economic activity, private ownership, solidarity, dialogue and cooperation].', '[As regards the constitutional aspects of the situation of tenants]', 'A kind of obligation has been placed on the legislature to ensure that up to 31 December 2004 tenancy relationships concerning municipal dwellings and [privately owned] dwellings should retain their present form, including the level of rent [3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling] ... The Constitutional Court considers that, having regard to the principle of maintaining citizens’ confidence in the State and the law made by it and the principle of legal certainty, which ensue from the rule of law laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution and are binding on the legislature, renouncing that obligation will be admissible only in the event of exceptional public necessity. At present, there is no such necessity ... It should be noted in passing that setting a time-limit for the operation of the rent-control scheme in buildings owned by natural persons also places an obligation on the legislature – for the benefit of landlords – to repeal the scheme in its present form by the end of 2004. This obligation should also be seen from the perspective of the principle of maintaining citizens’ confidence in the State.', '[Final considerations]', 'The constitutional inadmissibility of setting the income received by landlords below a certain minimum does not automatically mean that the rent chargeable to tenants has to be increased, because that problem can be resolved by allocating public financial resources.”', '83. In a judgment of 10 October 2000, the Constitutional Court held that section 9 of the 1994 Act (see paragraph 78 above), laying down landlords’ obligations, was incompatible with the constitutional principles of the protection of property rights and social justice because, in particular, it placed a heavy financial burden on them, a burden which was in no way proportionate to the income from controlled rent. The Constitutional Court ruled that that provision should be repealed by 11 July 2001.', '84. Following the Constitutional Court’s rulings of 12 January and 10 October 2000, Parliament adopted a new law governing housing matters and relations between landlords and tenants. The relevant statute – that is to say, the Law of 21 June 2001 on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and on amendments to the Civil Code (Ustawa o ochronie praw lokatorów, mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie Kodeksu cywilnego) (“the 2001 Act”) – came into force on 10 July 2001. It repealed the 1994 Act and replaced the previous scheme of controlled rent with another statutory rent-control mechanism that restricted the possibility for landlords to increase levels of rent.', 'The 2001 Act was then successively amended. The most important amendments, adopted by Parliament on 17 and 22 December 2004, came into force on 1 January 2005 (see paragraphs 124-32 below).', '85. Section 9 of the 2001 Act listed situations where a landlord could increase rent. The relevant parts of that provision, in the version applicable until 10 October 2002 (see paragraph 102 below), read as follows:', '“(1) Increases in rent or other charges for the use of a dwelling, apart from charges that do not depend on the landlord [e.g. those for electricity, water, central heating, etc.] may not be made more often than once every six months;', '(2) If a landlord increases other charges that do not depend on him, he shall be obliged to provide the tenant with a table of charges and the reasons for the increase;', '(3) In a given year the increase in rent or other charges, except for charges that do not depend on a landlord, shall not exceed the average general yearly increase in prices for consumer goods and services in the previous year in relation to the year preceding that year by more than:', '1. 50% – if the annual rent does not exceed 1% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling;', '2. 25% – if the annual rent is higher than 1% but not more than 2% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling;', '3. 15% – if the annual rent is higher than 2% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.', 'Information on the increase in prices referred to in the first sentence [of this subsection] shall be communicated in official bulletins of the President of the Central Statistical Office;', '...', '(8) The reconstruction value of a dwelling shall be the product of its usable area and the conversion index of the reconstruction cost of 1 square metre of the usable area of the residential building. ...”', '86. A further restriction on rent increases by landlords followed from section 28(2) of the 2001 Act, which provided that controlled rent could not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the flat. That provision was in force until 31 December 2004, the deadline that had already been set under the 1994 Act (see paragraph 77 above).', 'Section 28(2) read:', '“Until 31 December 2004, in all tenancy relations subsisting before the date of entry into force of this Act, the level of rent in respect of dwellings that were subject to the controlled-rent scheme on the date of the entry into force of this Act, may not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling per year.”', '87. Section 11 of the 2001 Act listed situations in which a landlord could terminate a lease agreement that originated in an administrative decision.', 'Section 11(1) and (2) read in its relevant parts as follows:', '“(1) If a tenant is entitled to use a dwelling for rent, the landlord may give notice only for reasons listed in this provision ... Notice should, on pain of being null and void, be given in writing.', '(2) The landlord may give one month’s notice effective at the end of a calendar month, if:', '1. the tenant, despite a reminder in writing, still uses the dwelling in a manner contrary to the terms of the agreement or in a manner inconsistent with its function, thus causing damage; or if he or she has damaged equipment designed for the common use of residents; or if he or she has flagrantly or repeatedly disturbed the peace, thus severely upsetting [czyniąc uciążliwym] the use of other dwellings; or', '2. the tenant has fallen into more than three months’ arrears of rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling and, despite being informed in writing of the landlord’s intention to terminate the agreement and given one month to pay off both the arrears and the current month’s rent, has not paid those amounts; or', '3. the tenant has sublet the flat or part of it, or allowed it, or part of it, to be used free of charge by another without the landlord’s authorisation; or', '4. the flat used by the tenant has to be vacated in view of the impending demolition or substantial renovation of the building ...', '88. Under section 11(3), a landlord who received rent which was lower than 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling could terminate the agreement if the tenant had not lived in the flat for more than twelve months or if he had title to another flat situated in the same town.', 'Section 11(4) provided that a landlord could terminate the agreement with six months’ notice if he intended to dwell in his own flat and had provided the tenant with “alternative accommodation” (lokal zastępczy) or the tenant was entitled to a dwelling which met the conditions for “alternative accommodation”.', 'Under section 11(5), a landlord could terminate the agreement with three years’ notice if he intended to dwell in his flat but had not provided the tenant with any “substitute accommodation”.', '89. However, section 12(1) further limited the possibility of terminating leases. It stated that if a landlord intended to terminate a lease on the grounds mentioned in section 11(2)(2) (rent arrears unpaid despite the fact that a warning notice had been served and a further time-limit had been set for payment) and if the tenant’s income would entitle him to obtain a lease on “social accommodation” (lokal socjalny) belonging to the municipality, no notice could be given unless the landlord had proposed a settlement to the tenant concerning the arrears and running charges.', 'As regards situations where, despite the termination of the lease agreement, the tenant did not vacate the flat, the landlord had to – as under the previous regulations – bring an action for eviction against him and, even if he obtained an eviction order, could not repossess the flat until the tenant had obtained a substitute dwelling from the municipality.', '90. The 2001 Act, in the version applicable up to 1 January 2005, did not contain any specific provisions setting out the duties of landlords and tenants with regard to maintenance and repairs of dwellings and residential buildings. Those issues were governed partly by the relevant provisions of the Civil Code (which applied in so far as a given matter had not been addressed by the 2001 Act) and partly by the Construction Act of 7 July 1994 (Prawo budowlane) (“the Construction Act”), which lays down the general duties of owners of buildings.', '91. Article 662 of the Civil Code, which lays down a general rule, reads in its relevant part:', '“1. The landlord should give the object [of a lease] to the tenant in a usable state and should keep it in such a state for the duration of the lease.', '2. Minor repairs related to the normal use of the object [of the lease] are incumbent on the tenant.”', '92. Article 675 of the Civil Code, in its relevant part, reads:', '“1. After the termination of a lease, the tenant shall be obliged to return the object [of the lease] in a condition not worse [than when he took possession of it]; however, he or she shall not be responsible for any deterioration of the object caused by reasonable wear and tear.”', '93. Article 681 lists minor repairs for which a tenant is responsible. It reads as follows:', '“Minor repairs for which the tenant is responsible are, in particular: minor repairs of floors, doors and windows, painting of walls and floors and the inner side of the flat’s entrance door, as well as minor repairs to installations and technical equipment that enable the use of lighting, heating, the water supply and the sewage system.”', '94. Section 61 of the Construction Act provides:', '“The owner or manager of a building shall be obliged to maintain and use the building in accordance with the rules set out in section 5(2).”', 'Section 5(2) states:', '“The conditions for use of a building shall be secured in accordance with its purpose, in particular in respect of:', '(a) the water and electricity supply and, if need be, the supply of heating and fuel, regard being had to their effective use;', '(b) sewage, waste disposal and rainwater drainage.”', '95. The relevant part of Article 691 of the Civil Code provides:', '“1. In the event of a tenant’s death, the following persons may succeed to the tenancy agreement: his or her spouse if the latter has not been a party to that agreement, his or her children, his or her spouse’s children, any other persons to whom he was obliged to pay maintenance, and a person living with the tenant in de facto marital cohabitation.', '2. The persons referred to in paragraph 1 shall succeed to the tenancy agreement if they lived in the tenant’s household until his or her death.', '3. If there are no persons in the categories referred to in paragraph 1, the lease agreement shall expire.”', '96. On 11 December 2001 the Ombudsman (Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich) made an application to the Constitutional Court and asked, inter alia, that section 9(3) of the 2001 Act (see paragraph 85 above) be declared incompatible with the constitutional principle of the protection of property rights. The Ombudsman referred to numerous complaints he had received from landlords, who claimed that levels of rent as determined under that section did not cover the basic maintenance costs of residential buildings. He also submitted that the recent rules for the determination of rent put landlords at a bigger disadvantage than the rules which had been laid down in the 1994 Act and which had already been repealed as being unconstitutional.', 'He criticised the legislation on the ground that it was exceptionally inconsistent. He referred, in particular, to the – in his view erroneous – statutory correlation between rent increases and the increase of prices for consumer goods and services, which were not related in reality to the costs of maintaining a building. He added that there were still no provisions to allow the landlords to recover losses incurred in connection with expenses for the maintenance of property.', '97. The representatives of Parliament and the Prosecutor General (Prokurator Generalny) asked the Constitutional Court to reject the application.', '98. The Constitutional Court invited organisations of landlords and tenants to take part in the proceedings and submit observations in writing. The Polish Association of Tenants, the Polish Union of Property Owners (Polska Unia Właścicieli Nieruchomości) and the All-Polish Association of Property Owners (Ogólnopolskie Stowarzyszenie Właścicieli Nieruchomości) filed their pleadings on 16, 17 and 18 September 2002 respectively.', '99. The Polish Union of Property Owners supplied considerable statistical material, showing that the level of controlled rent represented on average around 1.5% of the reconstruction value of the building, which in turn amounted to some 40% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. They presented a sample calculation of monthly rent based on the average reconstruction value, the average size of a flat and the average gross income.', 'Assuming that the average reconstruction value was PLN 2,200, that 1.5% of that value was the average maximum reached by controlled rent and that the average flat had a surface area of 40 sq. m, the average monthly rent amounted to PLN 110. That amount, they stressed, represented 5% of the average gross income, whereas, according to them, in European Union countries rent accounted for 25 to 30% of the average gross income.', '100. The All-Polish Association of Property Owners submitted, among other things, that the impugned legislation was in breach of the constitutional principle of proportionality because a group of some 100,000 landlords had to bear the main burden of social protection afforded by the Polish State to about 900,000 tenants, without any financial support from some 15,000,000 Polish taxpayers.', '101. The Polish Association of Tenants considered that the contested provisions were compatible with the Constitution. It drew attention to the fact that a large group of tenants, especially those who had been granted the right to a lease by means of administrative decisions, were in a poor financial position. It stressed that during the period of State management of housing matters those tenants had made investments and had thereby contributed to the maintenance costs of buildings, even though they had not been legally obliged to do so. At the hearing, in reply to questions from the judges, the President of the Polish Association of Tenants admitted that tenants paying controlled rent also included well-off persons, in respect of whom an increase in rent would be justified.', '102. On 2 October 2002 the Constitutional Court, sitting as a full court, declared section 9(3) of the 2001 Act unconstitutional as being incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 and Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution (see paragraphs 109 and 110 below). The provision was, accordingly, repealed. The repeal took effect on 10 October 2002, the date of the publication of the judgment in the Journal of Laws (Dziennik Ustaw).', '103. In the reasoning of its judgment, the Constitutional Court extensively cited its judgment of 12 January 2000 (see paragraphs 80-82 above).', 'In conclusion, it held that the fact that the 2001 Act had abolished the scheme of rent control had not improved the situation of landlords because, instead, it had introduced a defective mechanism for controlling increases in rent. In its opinion, section 9(3) had not only “frozen” the disadvantageous position of landlords, a situation which had already been found to be incompatible with the Constitution, but had also, owing to the changing economic circumstances, significantly reduced any possibility of increasing rent to cover expenses incurred by them in connection with the maintenance of property.', 'The court repeated what it had already stated in its judgment of 12 January 2000, namely that the relevant provisions placed the main burden of the sacrifices that society had to make for the benefit of tenants in a difficult financial position on the owners of property. It went on to find that section 9(3) perpetuated the state of a violation of property rights that had subsisted under the 1994 Act, especially as landlords had not been relieved of any of their previous duties in respect of maintenance of property.', '104. The main thrust of the Constitutional Court’s reasoning was as follows:', '“During the transition from controlled rent to contractual rent it is necessary to control the increase in rent. ... In most European countries legislative bodies exercise control over rent increases. The introduction of such a mechanism into Polish law seems to be particularly justified and the need for it follows quite evidently from the shortage of flats and the absence of a lease market which would influence rates of rent. This very low supply of flats for rent has caused a situation in which tenants are exposed to undue demands from landlords. Hence there is a need to regulate rent increases.', 'While recognising this necessity, the Constitutional Court is convinced that the mechanism introduced by the impugned provision is defective and is objectively inappropriate for accomplishing the aims pursued by the legislature. ...', 'To begin with, the Constitutional Court will examine the impact of the operation of section 9(3) of the 2001 Act on landlords who were subject to controlled rent under the 1994 Act. In this Court’s view, the contested provision has not only ‘frozen’ the disadvantageous position of landlords subsisting under the 1994 Act, a situation which was already found to have been incompatible with the Constitution, but has also actually aggravated that situation on account of changing economic circumstances. ...', 'At the time when the present legislation came into force, tenants paid rent determined by the municipalities. [The rent paid], according to the information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development, covered merely 60% of the costs of maintenance of residential buildings. The 2001 Act did not increase rent to the level that could have been established according to the principles set out by the Constitutional Court in [the judgment of 12 January 2000]. Nor did the legislature give landlords an opportunity to increase rent to a level ensuring recovery of their expenses. The 2001 Act has frozen rates of rent and fixed them as a reference level for the calculation of future increases. ...', 'In the Constitutional Court’s opinion, in order to arrive at reasonable levels of rent it is necessary to take one of the following two measures: either a one-off increase in deflated rates of controlled rent, accompanied by a restrictive protection of tenants against further increases or, while freezing the applicable rates, permitting considerable increases in relatively rapid succession until an acceptable level has been reached. However, the legislature fixed an unreasonably low basic rent and allowed only strictly regulated increases, correlated with the inflation rate. The legislature did not take into account the fact that the rate of inflation was constantly declining, which means that permissible increases have been insignificant, amounting merely to a few percentage points of the basic rent and giving no opportunity, for purely mathematical reasons, to reach levels that would ensure profitability, or at least recovery of maintenance costs. The decrease in the inflation rate, although a generally positive sign of economic stability, has resulted in the stagnation of rents at low levels.', 'The deterioration of the situation of landlords receiving controlled rent is also shown by a comparison of rent increases under the 1994 Act with increases permissible under the 2001 Act. As transpires from information supplied by the Office for Housing and Town Development [in respect of the operation of the 1994 Act], at the relevant time, municipalities raised controlled rent annually to a significant extent: in 1996, when the inflation rate was about 20%, by 30% on average, but in 1997, when the inflation rate was 13%, by 31%. The pace of transition to reasonable levels of rent was faster than at present, if only because municipalities, themselves owning residential buildings, had a strong interest in securing genuine increases in rent. Finally, the previous regulations gave landlords the hope of relaxing rent policy. Irrespective of the rates of controlled rent imposed on them by municipalities, they knew that from 2005 they would be able to negotiate rents freely. However, that encouraging prospect was wiped out by section 9(3) of the 2001 Act. Even though the ceiling of 3% will no longer apply after [31 December] 2004, given the provision of section 9(3), this ceiling will not be reached in reality.', 'In the Constitutional Court’s view, the above circumstances give sufficient grounds to find that the situation of landlords who formerly received controlled rent is now unquestionably less favourable than it used to be under the 1994 Act. ... [O]n the contrary, section 9(3) has perpetuated the violation of the right of property. At this point, it is necessary to determine how the landlords’ situation looks in other respects, apart from the restrictions on rent increases. If, following the ... judgment of 12 January 2000, the legislature had significantly changed any aspect of the legal position of landlords, thereby compensating for losses resulting from reduced rent, the evaluation of levels of rent in the present case would have had to be based on other criteria than those referred to by this Court in 2000.', 'Since 12 January 2000 there have been no changes to legislation, apart from the enactment of the 2001 Act, which seriously aggravated the situation of landlords. They still bear the burden of obligations imposed by the Construction Act, whose non-fulfilment, as stressed by the Ombudsman, is subject to penalties. There have been no changes to regulations on income tax, at least in respect of deductions from tax (or from taxable income) of amounts spent on the maintenance of buildings in which flats are let to tenants. Nor has the legislature introduced preferential loans for repairs. ... The Constitutional Court also points out that the 2001 Act has not materially improved the situation of landlords in respect of termination of leases. ...', 'Accordingly, it is fully justified to rely on this Court’s findings in respect of section 56(2) of the 1994 Act. Even though the provisions under consideration have changed, and the Court is now considering completely different legal instruments (control of rent increase as opposed to the scheme of rent control under the 1994 Act), the core of the dispute and the issues under consideration remain essentially the same, namely the situation of landlords on whom the legislature has imposed reduced levels of rent. In addition, section 9(3) leads to a difference in the treatment of landlords, depending on whether they are parties to lease relationships formerly governed by the rent-control scheme, or to lease contracts based on freely determined rents. As shown above, in practice the rent increase mechanism adversely affects the first group of landlords and, at the same time, unjustifiably and at the tenant’s expense, favours the second group.', 'In view of the foregoing, the Constitutional Court finds that the [operation of] the contested provision is tantamount to the continued violation of the right of property vested in a specific group of landlords, namely those who entered into a lease relationship by virtue of administrative decisions on the allocation of a dwelling, or on another basis, prior to the introduction of State management of housing matters in a given municipality. Not only did the legislature fail to adjust rates of controlled rent, despite their having been found to be unconstitutional, but in fact, through the introduction of restrictive provisions on rent increases, it practically froze such rents at levels that cannot be regarded as consistent with constitutional guarantees of the right of property. ...', 'It is worth reiterating, having regard to the [judgment of 12 January 2000], that the restrictions in question are undoubtedly guided by the need to protect public order and the rights of other persons, namely tenants. However, according to the Constitutional Court’s case-law, Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution requires restrictions on the rights guaranteed therein to be necessary. In respect of the rent [control scheme], the Constitutional Court qualified as ‘necessary’ – at least during the transitional period – the restriction on the right of property ‘precluding the freedom to derive profit, by fixing levels of rent in such a way as to cover only the costs of maintenance and upkeep of the building’. A reduction below that minimum was seen by this Court as unconstitutional. Placing the financial burden of subsidising rent on a single social group, namely landlords, was also considered to have been unconstitutional since ‘the duty to help the underprivileged and [the duties inherent in] social solidarity are incumbent not only upon those persons’. The Constitutional Court envisaged and still envisages the possibility of applying other legal solutions ... which would result in a more uniform social distribution of the burden linked to the necessity to satisfy housing needs. It is therefore unnecessary to place the entire burden on the single group of landlords. Consequently, the Constitutional Court considers that the restriction resulting from section 9(3) ... does not meet the criteria established by the principle of proportionality and goes beyond the tolerable extent of limitations on the right of property set out in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution.', 'The Constitutional Court is not competent to fix minimum levels of rent... [However,] from the point of view of the protection of landlords’ rights, [it] stresses again the crucial importance of the correct determination of the costs of maintenance and upkeep of residential buildings. This constitutes the absolute minimum rate. ...', 'As regards the implementation of the constitutional rights of tenants, the Constitutional Court stresses that, although in the present judgment section 9(3) of the 2001 Act has been found unconstitutional, the Act still imposes significant restrictions on the freedom to increase rents. The most important of them is definitely section 28(2), which remains in force and which provides that ... up to 31 December 2004 inclusive the annual rent may not exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.”', '105. On 12 May 2004 the Constitutional Court heard a constitutional complaint lodged by a certain J.-M. O., challenging the constitutionality of section 9(3) and section 28(3) of the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 85 and 86 above). He submitted that those provisions were incompatible with Article 64 § 1 (protection of property rights) of the Constitution read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 (principle of proportionality).', 'In their written pleadings, the Prosecutor General and representatives of Parliament asked the court to discontinue the proceedings in so far as they concerned the constitutionality of section 9(3) since it had already been repealed by the judgment of 2 October 2002, and to hold that section 28(3) was compatible with the Constitution.', 'At the oral hearing, J.-M.O. stated that he intended to pursue his complaint only in so far as section 28(3) was concerned.', '106. The Constitutional Court held that section 28(3) was compatible with the Constitution and found:', '“As emerges from [the Constitutional Court’s judgments of 12 January 2000 and 2 October 2002], the question of maintaining the maximum ceiling on rent has already been examined by this Court and the measure was considered to have been necessary from the point of view of public order – at least in the transitional period. The need to protect tenants against unduly high rents is justified by the housing situation in Poland, which is the consequence of State management of housing and has resulted in a commonly experienced shortage of flats.', 'A limitation on levels of rent – such as the one introduced by the contested provision – does not impair the essence of the right of property because it does not deprive owners of essential elements of that right. It has to be stressed that the right to a lease is one of the pecuniary rights protected by Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution and that restrictions on the right of property are inherent in many pecuniary rights, including the right to a lease. The contested section has set a maximum ceiling on rents with a clear time-frame – up to the end of 2004 – and this also may have an impact on whether a temporary restriction on the right of property may be regarded as not impairing its essence.', 'It also has to be stressed that the setting of a clear time-frame in section 28(3) implies an obligation of the legislature towards landlords, which must be assessed from the point of view of the principle of citizens’ confidence in the State and the law made by it.”', '107. Article 2 of the Constitution states:', '“The Republic of Poland shall be a democratic State ruled by law and implementing the principles of social justice.”', '108. Article 20 lays down the basic principles on which Poland’s economic system is founded. It reads:', '“A social market economy, based on freedom of economic activity, private ownership, and solidarity, dialogue and cooperation between social partners, shall be the basis of the economic system of the Republic of Poland.”', '109. Article 31 § 3 reads:', '“Any limitation on the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when it is necessary in a democratic State for the protection of its security or public order, or for the protection of the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms or rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not impair the essence of freedoms and rights.”', '110. Article 64 protects the right of property in the following terms:', '“1. Everyone shall have the right to ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.', '2. Everyone, on an equal basis, shall receive legal protection regarding ownership, other property rights and the right of succession.', '3. The right of ownership may be limited only by means of a statute and only to the extent that this does not impair the substance of such right.”', '111. Article 75 refers to the protection of tenants. It reads as follows:', '“1. The public authorities shall pursue policies conducive to satisfying the housing needs of citizens, in particular combating homelessness, promoting the development of low-income housing and supporting activities aimed at acquisition of a home by each citizen.', '2. Protection of the rights of tenants shall be established by statute.”', '112. Article 76 provides:', '“The public authorities shall protect consumers, customers, hirers or lessees against activities threatening their health, privacy and safety, as well as against dishonest market practices. The scope of such protection shall be specified by statute.”', '113. After 10 October 2002, as a result of the Constitutional Court’s judgment, it became possible for landlords to increase rent up to 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling. At the end of 2002 levels of rent generally increased. According to the Government, in the Warsaw District, where the previous rate was PLN 2.17 per square metre, the rent quadrupled, reaching around PLN 10.00 per square metre in 2004. According to reports published in the Polish press, in most other towns 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling corresponded to PLN 5.00-6.00 per square metre. Levels of freely determined contractual rent are still higher: sometimes, especially in large towns, the difference may even reach 200 to 300%.', '114. At the beginning of 2003 the government started to prepare a bill amending the 2001 Act. The bill was submitted to Parliament on 30 December 2003.', '115. The explanatory memorandum on the bill stated that the aims of the proposed amendments were, among other things, “to specify the rights and obligations of the landlord and the tenant in order to strengthen the protection of the weaker party”; “to introduce new rules for the protection of tenants against excessive increases in rent and other charges for the use of dwellings”; and “to reduce the disproportion between the constitutionally guaranteed protection of tenants and the constitutional rights of landlords”.', '116. The government proposed a number of changes to the existing provisions. The most important and controversial provision was the proposed section 28, pursuant to which (subsection (2)) the rent-control scheme, despite the fact that the end of its operation had been set by the legislature at 31 December 2004, was to be maintained until the end of 2008 in respect of all lease agreements in force before 10 July 2001 under which the tenants paid controlled rent. That in practice meant all leases originating in administrative decisions regarding privately owned buildings.', 'The provision was to be applied mostly to all individual landlords, its operation in relation to public-housing entities and housing cooperatives being of minimal effect. The explanatory memorandum stated that the repeal of the rent-control scheme in its entirety “could cause a dramatic increase in rent” after the end of 2004 and that the limitation “would allow a smooth transition from the levels of rent at the end of 2004 to levels fixed in accordance with general principles”.', 'The government therefore proposed that controlled rent be frozen at the maximum level of 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling up to 31 December 2004; 3.25% up to the end of 2005; 3.5% up to the end of 2006; 3.75% up to the end of 2007, and 4% up to the end of 2008.', '117. The effects of the proposed rent freeze on the property rights of individual landlords have received considerable media attention and have given rise to heated public debate. The proposal was severely criticised by all organisations of landlords.', '118. Eventually, on 5 October 2004, the government submitted to Parliament an amendment to their bill. They withdrew their original proposal to freeze levels of rent after 31 December 2004. They still maintained the proposal to limit the increase in rent for leases originating in previous administrative decisions.', '119. On 22 June 2004 a group of deputies from the “Law and Justice” (“Prawo i Sprawiedliwość”) Party submitted a bill proposing amendments to the 2001 Act.', '120. The general thrust of the proposed changes, as set out in the relevant explanatory memorandum, was:', '“to secure the effective protection of the rights of tenants, as guaranteed by Article 75 § 1 and Article 76 of the Constitution, by:', '(a) preventing the overuse by landlords of the right to terminate a lease agreement under section 11(5) of the 2001 Act;', '(b) preventing the dysfunction resulting from non-fulfilment by landlords of the duties incumbent on them in leasing dwellings (even in cases where the landlords are unknown and the municipality does not manage the property).”', '121. Parliament decided to work on both bills simultaneously. The first reading took place on 6 October 2004. The second reading, following the report of the Parliamentary Committee on Infrastructure, the Committee for Family and Social Policy and the Committee on Self-Government and Regional Policy and the adoption of amendments, was on 17 November 2004. After the third reading, which took place on 19 November 2004, the bills were adopted by the Sejm (the lower house of the Polish parliament) and transmitted to the Senate and the President of Poland on the same day.', 'On 6 December 2004 the Senate proposed several amendments, the most significant being the amendment to section 9 of the 2001 Act restricting the maximum increase in rent to a level of 10% per year in situations where the rent paid exceeded 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.', '122. On 17 December 2004 the Sejm accepted some of the Senate’s amendments, most notably the amendment to section 9. On the same day the Act of Parliament was transmitted for signature by the President of Poland. The President signed it on 23 December 2004.', '123. On 22 December 2004, following, among other things, press reports stating that the new provision of section 9 of the 2001 Act did not exclude the possibility of a one-off increase in rent even where the rent was equal to, or less than, 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling, Parliament passed, in an accelerated procedure, another bill amending the 2001 Act. The bill was tabled by a group of deputies and contained only one proposal, namely to add another subsection to section 9 of the 2001 Act (see paragraph 132 below). On the same day the bill was transmitted to, and accepted by, the Senate. The President of Poland signed the Act of Parliament on 23 December 2004.', '124. The Act of 17 December 2004 on amendments to the 2001 Act on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and on amendments to the Civil Code and amendments to certain statutes (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy o ochronie praw lokatorów, mieszkaniowym zasobie gminy i o zmianie Kodeksu cywilnego oraz o zmianie niektórych ustaw) (“the 17 December 2004 Amendment”) came into force on 1 January 2005.', '125. Section 1(8) of the 17 December 2004 Amendment introduced a new section 8a into the 2001 Act. This new provision was drafted with a view to implementing both the Constitutional Court’s ruling of 2 October 2002 and the constitutional principle of the protection of tenants’ rights. It subjects the increase in rent to various restrictions.', 'Section 8a reads, in its relevant parts:', '“(1) The landlord may increase rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling, giving [the tenant] notice of the rent increase, not later than by the end of a calendar month [and] in compliance with the terms for giving notice.', '(2) The term for giving notice of an increase in rent or in other charges for the use of the dwelling shall be three months, unless the parties have stipulated a longer term in their contract;', '...', '(4) An increase whereby rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling would exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling within one year may take place only in justified cases. At the tenant’s written request, the landlord shall, within seven days, give reasons for the increase and its calculation in writing.', '(5) The tenant may, within two months following the notice of the increase, challenge the increase referred to in subsection (4) by bringing a court action to have the increase declared unjustified or justified but in a different amount[; he or she may also] refuse to accept the increase, with the effect of the contract being terminated by the end of the term of notice. The burden of proof in respect of the justification of the increase shall rest with the landlord.', '...', '(7) The provisions of subsections (1) to (6) shall not apply to increases', '1. not exceeding 10% of the current rent or current charges for the use of the dwelling within a year;', '...', '3. concerning charges that do not depend on the landlord.”', '126. Pursuant to section 1(9)(a) of the 17 December 2004 Amendment, section 9 of the 2001 Act was reworded in its subsections (1) and (2) as follows:', '“(1) Increases in rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling, apart from charges that do not depend on the landlord [e.g. those for electricity, water, central heating, etc.] may not be made more often than every six months but, if the level of the annual rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling, apart from charges that do not depend on the landlord, exceeds 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling, a yearly increase cannot be higher than 10% of the current rent or current charges for the use of the dwelling[; such an increase] shall be calculated without charges that do not depend on the landlord.', '(2) If charges that do not depend on the landlord have been increased, he or she shall give the tenant a written statement listing charges and reasons for their increase. The tenant shall be obliged to pay the increased charges only up to such a level that is necessary for the landlord to cover costs of supply of utilities referred to in section 2(8) [e.g. electricity, water, heating].”', '127. Section 1(11)(a) of the 17 December 2004 Amendment introduced certain changes in respect of the termination of leases by individual landlords. However, the new section 11 of the 2001 Act differs only slightly from the previous provision on termination of leases (see paragraphs 87-88 above).', 'Section 11(1) now reads, in its relevant parts, as follows:', '“If a tenant is entitled to use a dwelling for rent, the landlord may give notice only for reasons listed in subsections (2) to (5) ... Notice should, on pain of being null and void, be given in writing.', 'Subsections (2), (4) and (5) of section 11 remain unchanged. Subsection (3) now reads:', '“The landlord of a dwelling for the lease of which the rent is lower than 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling in a given year may terminate the lease:', '(1) with six months’ notice if the tenant has not lived in the flat for more than twelve months;', '(2) with one month’s notice, expiring at the end of a calendar month, in respect of a person who has been entitled to another dwelling in the same or nearby locality and provided that dwelling meets the requirements for substitute accommodation.”', '128. As regards cases where the landlord, his adult descendants or a person in respect of whom he is obliged to pay maintenance intend to dwell in the landlord’s flat (see also paragraph 89 above), the present section 11(7) provides that the notice to quit given to the tenant should, on pain of being invalid, indicate the person who is to dwell in the flat. The terms for giving notice (six months and three years respectively) remain unchanged.', '129. Under section 11(12) the termination of a lease in respect of a tenant who on the date of giving notice is more than 75 years old and who, after the expiry of the applicable three years’ notice, will have no title to another dwelling and will have no persons obliged to maintain him or her will take effect upon his or her death.', '130. The 17 December 2004 Amendment, in its section 5, introduced a new provision – section 6a – setting out a list of the landlord’s duties under the tenancy. In essence, it repeats the provision of section 9 of the 1994 Act (see paragraph 78 above).', '131. Section 6b, introduced by the same section 5 of the 17 December 2004 Amendment, lays down the tenant’s duties. Its relevant part reads as follows:', '“(1) The tenant shall be obliged to keep the dwelling in a proper technical, sanitary and hygienic state as prescribed by other separate provisions and to comply with the rules of good conduct in the building. He or she shall also be obliged to take care, and ensure protection against damage or devastation, of parts of the building designed for common use, such as lifts, staircases, corridors, chutes, other [similar] premises and the surroundings of the building.”', 'Subsection (2) sets out a detailed list of repairs and works involved in the upkeep of a flat.', '132. The Act of 22 December 2004 on amendments to the 2001 Act on the protection of the rights of tenants, housing resources of municipalities and on amendments to the Civil Code (“the 22 December 2004 Amendment”) came into force on 1 January 2005. Its section 1 read:', '“In section 9(1) [of the 2001 Act] the following subsection (1)(a) shall be included:', '‘The provisions of subsection (1) shall also apply in the event of an increase in rent or other charges for the use of a dwelling, except for charges that do not depend on the landlord if, after the increase, the level of the annual rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling, except for the charges that do not depend on the landlord, is to exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling.’ ”', '133. On 4 January 2005 the Polish Union of Property Owners made an application to the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the 17 December and 22 December 2004 Amendments (“the December 2004 Amendments”). The Union alleged, in particular, that the provisions extending State control over increases in rent for dwellings owned by private individuals were incompatible with the constitutional principles of protection of lawfully acquired rights and citizens’ confidence in the State and the law made by it.', 'In that context, they stressed that the Polish authorities, in breach of their obligation to terminate the operation of the rent-control scheme by 31 December 2004 that they had taken upon themselves by virtue of two successive laws, namely the 1994 Act and the 2001 Act, had failed to abolish the impugned scheme and had simply replaced it by further restrictions on rent increases.', '134. On 19 January 2005 the Prosecutor General made an application to the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of the December 2004 Amendments. In particular, he contested the provisions restricting increases in rent to 10% and submitted, inter alia, that those restrictions constituted an unjustified interference with landlords’ property rights. He further alleged that Parliament was in breach of its duty to “legislate decently” (zasada “przyzwoitej legislacji”), especially the duty to formulate legal provisions in a correct and coherent manner.', '135. The Constitutional Court invited the Speaker of the Sejm, acting on behalf of Parliament, the All-Polish Association of Property Owners and the Polish Association of Tenants to take part in the proceedings and submit their written observations. The Speaker of the Sejm and the All-Polish Association of Property Owners fully supported the Prosecutor General’s application. The association submitted detailed calculations of levels of rent that would be necessary to cover the maintenance costs of residential buildings. It maintained that in respect of most such buildings there was a “repair shortfall” (luka remontowa) amounting to 60% of the costs necessary for the reconstruction of the value of dwellings through major repairs and that, in order to secure sufficient means for such purposes, the levels of rent should reach 6% of the reconstruction value per year.', 'The Polish Association of Tenants considered that the current possibility of increasing rents set at the level of 3% of the reconstruction value by 10% per year already imposed an excessive burden on tenants. It submitted that the landlords’ association had given exaggerated figures in respect of the costs of necessary repairs. In the context of rent increases, it also stressed that the State’s financial assistance to tenants was practically non-existent.', '136. The Constitutional Court heard the Prosecutor General’s application on 19 April 2005. It repealed section 1(9)(a) of the 17 December 2004 Amendment in so far as it made any increase in rent above 3% of the reconstruction value subject to a maximum yearly ceiling of 10% of the current rent and section 1 of the 22 December 2004 Amendment in its entirety.', 'In its judgment, it made an in-depth analysis of the housing laws as applicable from 1994 to 2004 and their historical and social background. It referred to its previous judgments repealing the successive defective legal provisions and to their implications.', 'The judgment contains extensive reasoning and a thorough assessment of the various social, political and economic circumstances affecting the current state of the Polish housing legislation. The gist of the Constitutional Court’s arguments is summarised in the following paragraphs.', '137. The Constitutional Court first analysed the impugned provisions from the point of view of the principle of the rule of law as laid down in Article 2 of the Constitution (see paragraph 107 above):', '“In the opinion of the [Court], the introduction of the contested legal provisions clearly violated the principle of proper legislation, which necessarily leads it to declare those provisions incompatible with the principle of the rule of law as expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution. The amendments, contrary to the intentions of the legislature itself – as is confirmed by the content of the Sejm’s written observations [filed in this case] – eliminated a market mechanism in a situation where the actual purpose of introducing restrictions on rent increases was to be the protection of tenants, that is to say, persons who in a given case do not accept the proposed increase. There is a distinct inconsistency between the provisions of the amendment in the initial bill and the provisions introduced following the parliamentary debate. In consequence, none of the declared aims of the [legislation] has been attained. Rents were not relaxed within rational limits encompassing the requirements of justice and of protection of landlords’ rights and nor were effective and precisely determined procedures introduced to protect the rights of tenants against abuse of [landlords’ right to] determine rent freely.', 'The new version of section 9(1)(a) has also violated the principle of ... confidence in the State and the law made by it. Thus, as already mentioned, there is no doubt whatsoever that until the adoption of the 17 December 2004 Amendment the legislation of the last decade consistently assured society, and especially persons directly interested in the situation of landlords and tenants, that rents that were controlled and at the same time limited to the level of 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling exclusively in respect of a certain category of premises would apply for the transitional period, that is, up to 31 December 2004. This period ... was [set] to make it possible for the government and the legislature to develop a new, comprehensive and multi-faceted system governing the relations between landlords and tenants, fully taking into consideration the justified interests of the parties and also realistically allowing those same parties to prepare themselves for surviving the most difficult period and to accept fully the new state of affairs, so that mutual relations between the parties to a lease (or an analogous relationship) could be shaped in a rational manner and above all with due consideration for the concrete conditions determining rent. The date of 31 December 2004 as the deadline for the transition period was also confirmed in the 2001 Act, which further strengthened the conviction that after that date the mechanism for determining rent would be compatible with the principle of freedom of contract.', 'This societal conviction was further supported by the unambiguous case-law of the Constitutional Court, which on many occasions underlined the transitional character of the rent-control scheme. It thus follows that in the years 1994-2004 the unambiguous ‘rules of the game’ were established, whose period of validity was clearly indicated by the 1994 Act (section 56(2)) and then in some sense confirmed by section 28(2) of the 2001 Act. ...', 'In its case-law the Constitutional Court has frequently expressed the opinion that the legislature must not fail to meet deadlines for those ‘rules of the game’ that it set itself. This opinion was expressed, inter alia, in ... the reasoning of [its judgment of 12 January 2000]. In its judgment ..., the Constitutional Court expressed the opinion that setting aside the principle of controlled rent for a ten-year transitional period would be acceptable only under exceptional circumstances, for otherwise there would be a violation of the principle of legal certainty expressed in Article 2 of the Constitution.', 'These considerations lead to the conclusion that the adoption of the contested Act and its publication on 29 December 2004, with its entry into force on 1 January 2005, violated the ‘rules of the game’ which were laid down in the previous legislation and which were subject to an unambiguous time-limit[. This happened in a situation where] there were no exceptional circumstances or events that could justify or explain the extension of [those rules] for a longer period.', 'The breaking of what amounted to a promise laid down in a statute must be regarded as a particular kind of irresponsibility on the part of the public authorities, and hence an exceptionally jarring violation of the principle of confidence in the State and the law made by it, a principle constituting one of the foundations of the rule of law.”', '138. The Constitutional Court next referred to the principle of the protection of property and the principle of proportionality:', '“Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution guarantees the protection of ownership and other property rights on an equal basis for all. Among these ‘other property rights’ are the right to lease residential premises and other rights relating to premises serving to satisfy housing needs. Each of these rights, whether accruing to landlords or to tenants, enjoys constitutional protection, but in different ways. As a rule these rights collide but, as has been pointed out [in one of the Constitutional Court’s previous judgments], it would be a simplification to treat this conflict in linear terms, and to presume that providing a certain degree of protection to one of these rights must necessarily result in a weakening of the degree of protection afforded to the other.', 'Section 9(1) and (2) and section 9(1)(a) ... were based on the unjustified conviction that relations between landlords and tenants always have an antagonistic nature, which inevitably leads to the ‘zero-sum game’. In reality, however, this does not have to be the case; on the contrary, properly determined relations between the parties to a lease agreement are of service both to landlords and tenants, provided that neither of the parties abuses its rights, since everyone is obliged to respect the freedoms and rights of others (Article 31 § 2 of the Constitution).', 'The Constitutional Court is fully aware of how difficult it is to balance the legitimate interests of both landlords and tenants and to create the best possible ways of organising their relations. This is particularly true in the Polish situation, in which the rights of landlords were not respected for a long time and housing matters were subject to State management for entire decades[. This], combined with other systemic and economic factors, resulted in a degradation of housing supply unheard of in the countries of western Europe, and the consequences of which affected and still affect not only landlords but, ultimately, also tenants. Stepping back from this abyss will be difficult and will take many years, and the effective change of the present state of affairs will probably not be possible without committing public funds adapted to concrete situations (see the Constitutional Court judgment [of 12 January 2000]).', 'It is therefore the legislature’s duty to strive to form a harmonious legal situation for landlords and tenants, so that their relations can be seen as desirably complementary rather than characterised by inevitable antagonism. Charges for the use of the premises, including rent, are a special element of those relations. They should ensure that the landlord not only covers the costs of building maintenance and repair, but also obtains a return on invested capital (amortisation) and a decent profit because no legal provisions may extinguish one of the basic components of the right to property, namely the right to derive profit from property ... This was possible, as found by the Constitutional Court [in its earlier judgment], in the transitional period, during which it was considered reasonable to restrict profit [by fixing] such levels of rent as only covered the costs of maintenance and upkeep. Now complete regulations, fully and precisely determining the elements of rent, are required. The 2001 Act specified what are to be regarded as charges that do not depend on the landlord ... but it did not indicate ... the elements of rent as such. As a result, judicial control of reasons for rent increases is to a large extent illusory. ...', 'At the same time, the Constitutional Court considers it necessary to take into account the legitimate interests of tenants, and to establish effective mechanisms to protect them against abuse of their rights by landlords. It is also necessary to develop a set of instruments that would make it possible to support tenants finding themselves in difficult financial and living circumstances. This must not be done, as has been the case hitherto, mainly at the cost of landlords, but mostly through the deployment of special public resources. Thus, the duties inherent in social solidarity and the duty to help the underprivileged are incumbent on society as a whole. ...', 'Over the last dozen years or so, attempts have been made in Poland to protect the legal interests of ... tenants through the statutory determination of percentage rent increase indicators, or of rent ceilings, or through the introduction of certain stronger control measures after a certain limit was exceeded, but in fact this has always been done in isolation from the concrete circumstances of given landlords and given tenants. An exception in this respect is the duty to determine officially the so-called ‘conversion index’, which of course adjusts the calculation of rent, but only locally, and, furthermore, is highly formalised and mechanical in nature.', 'The end of the transitional period for controlled rents must mean a real break with the statutory automatism in respect of setting levels of rent, determining the rent ceilings or imposing restrictions on rent increases. One should expect the establishment of a system providing flexible solutions, adapted to the requirements of a modern housing market, which – stressing the parties’ freedom to determine rent levels – would also ensure effective control in order to prevent arbitrariness and abuse of that freedom.', 'The contested provisions allow the parties ... a very small margin of freedom, which does not take into consideration concrete circumstances, such as the technical condition of the premises and the building, the personal and financial situation of the tenants or local factors. The legislature believes that the elimination of irregularities in increasing rent, apart from rent being subject to an arithmetical ceiling, will be effected through a special procedure for judicial control laid down in section 8a combined with the mechanism restricting rent increases as laid down in section 9 of the 2001 Act, in particular section 9(1) and (1)(a).', 'The legislature, declaring that controlled rents would be abolished in the future, never promised that from 1 January 2005 the levels of rent determined by the parties would not be controlled at all. However, judicial control to this end would be effective if the law clearly determined elements of rent and formulated precise criteria for its evaluation. But this did not happen. The 2001 Act does not indicate at all how rent should be determined (because rent increases as such are a different matter), even in such a fragmentary way as section 20 of the 1994 Act did. It thereby deprived a court assessing an increase in rent of the possibility of objective verification, on the basis of concretely enumerated elements of rent and clear criteria for their evaluation, whether or not the increase was justified (section 8a(5) of the 2001 Act), and hence created a risk of divergence between judicial decisions. It should also be noted that in certain situations the limiting mechanism introduced by section 9(1) and (1)(a) either excludes judicial control of rent altogether, or makes it completely illusory ...', 'In consequence, ... both the contested amendments amounted to a breach of the principle of proportionality expressed in Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, [notably] through defective formulation of the rules determining [rent], which do not give adequate protection either to landlords or to the rights of tenants.”', '139. In the context of the principle of proportionality the Constitutional Court also referred to this Court’s Chamber judgment in the following terms:', '“The Constitutional Court paid particular attention to the European Court of Human Rights’ judgment of 22 February 2005 in the case of Hutten-Czapska v. Poland. ...', 'Given the date of this judgment, [considerations] of the European Court were already based on the legal situation obtaining on 1 January 2005. Hence they encompassed both the December 2004 Amendments to the 2001 Act and the Prosecutor General’s application. In the Constitutional Court’s view, the opinion expressed by the European Court provides additional arguments in favour of finding that these amendments, in their parts contested in the application, violate the principle of maintaining confidence in the State and in the law made by it as laid down in Article 2 of the Polish Constitution and undermine in an inadmissible manner the standards of property protection common to the member States of the Council of Europe.”', '140. It then went on to analyse the general situation:', '“The Constitutional Court still holds the view (expressed in its judgment of 12 January 2000 ...) that', '‘it is in conformity with the contemporary perception of a “social State” to demand some sacrifice from all members of society for the benefit of those who cannot provide subsistence for themselves and their families ... In the circumstances obtaining in Poland, under Article 31 § 3 [of the Constitution], it may be justified to maintain the provisions limiting landlords’ property rights and, more particularly, excluding unrestricted freedom in fixing rates of rent and other charges collected from tenants.’', 'The latter remark was particularly significant for the assessment of legislation during the transition period, but it cannot be seen as having fully lost its relevance with the end of that period.', '...', 'Thus, States which, like Poland, are undergoing radical systemic and economic transformation must create legislative tools that make it possible for them to overcome the consequences of historical events (arbitrary and peremptory interference with private property by the State) and to ensure the transition to conditions appropriate for democratic, liberal States governed by the rule of law. This is a very difficult task, especially given the absence of well-tried models of proceeding in such cases. The scale of the phenomenon far surpasses the post-war experience of western European States. Changes in this area are being introduced by trial and error; they are slow and not effective enough – as has been pointed out by the Constitutional Court in the judgments cited above.', 'It is therefore not possible, in respect of the rights of landlords, who were formerly deprived of the possibility of fully enjoying their property, simply to give this possibility back to them in the form of unrestricted market-related rent. Such a measure, in a situation where private houses, previously taken in connection with the so-called ‘public management of housing matters’, have depreciated and require very major investments in repairs and high running maintenance costs, would mean imposing on tenants an excessive burden undermining their existence. ...', 'It must be kept in mind that the fact that landlords’ rights were infringed over several decades did not result from any acts by tenants, but was first and foremost caused by defective legislation. Removing, after years of neglect, all those harmful consequences may not therefore be done at the expense of tenants, and certainly not at their expense alone, but must above all stimulate the public authorities themselves to take appropriate action.”', '141. In its final considerations the Constitutional Court stressed that, given that its judgment was inherently limited by the scope of the Prosecutor General’s application, it could not resolve comprehensively and definitely the fundamental systemic issues arising from the operation of the rent-control scheme. In particular, it could not address the mechanism for balancing the interests of landlords and tenants, a mechanism which was still missing in the existing legal system.', 'Having regard to the fact that sections 8a and 9 of the 2001 Act (in so far as they were still in force following the repeal) did not provide for any satisfactory and consistent mechanism and no appropriate legislative initiative to that effect had been envisaged, the Constitutional Court decided to prepare recommendations (sygnalizacja) for Parliament, whose object would be to formulate clear demands to create a mechanism making it possible to formulate precise criteria for judicial control of rent and related charges.', '142. On 29 June 2005 the Constitutional Court gave a decision (postanowienie) setting out the recommendations for Parliament (“the June 2005 Recommendations”) referred to in the judgment of 19 April 2005. In its relevant parts, the decision reads as follows:', '“1. Starting-point', '... Under the present legislation, as amended by the Constitutional Court’s judgment [of 19 April 2005], landlords may increase rents or other charges for the use of the dwelling not more often than every six months but an increase in rent or other charges, apart from those which do not depend on a landlord, whereby rent would exceed 3% of the reconstruction value of the dwelling within one year may take place only in justified cases. ... [T]he tenant may challenge the increase by bringing a court action to have the increase declared unjustified, or justified but in a different amount, or may refuse to accept the increase with the effect that the contract is terminated at the end of the term of notice.', 'However, judicial control of increases in rent and the procedure for such increases do not apply if an increase does not exceed 10% of the current rent or current charges.', '2. Lack of statutory criteria for judicial control', '[The 2001 Act] does not indicate, and this is its fundamental shortcoming, the criteria on the basis of which the courts are to control increases in rent or other charges for the use of the dwelling. This situation is detrimental to both landlords and tenants. Accordingly, judicial control, lacking statutory criteria, certainly becomes very difficult and unforeseeable, if not illusory. This may lead to quite arbitrary decisions. It is likely that in this legal situation the courts would be forced to create an ad hoc set of criteria for the future assessment [of increases] rather than to review legal grounds for increases. It should be stressed that removing from the judicial control increases in rent and charges that do not exceed 10% will, in many instances, deprive tenants of the necessary protection and will, within several years, lead to rents being hauled up to an objectively unjustified level.', 'The above considerations lead to the conclusion that the statutory system of fixing the maximum ceiling of rents and other charges and of controlling increases determined algorithmically, which was justified in the transitional period ..., can neither satisfactorily serve the interests of landlords nor protect the justified interests of tenants. It is therefore necessary to regulate in a complex manner those matters, maintaining at the same time flexible solutions. ....', '3. Factors influencing the level of so-called ‘basic rent’ [czynsz początkowy]', 'The question of determining rents and charges for the use of the dwelling cannot be seen only from the perspective of the criteria and rules for their increase. First of all, it is necessary to set a statutory starting-point – in other words, elements of rent that would adequately take into account the rights of landlords.', 'At the same time, not losing sight of the necessarily complementary relationship between a landlord and a tenant, one should have regard to the fact that the essential duty of the tenant is to pay an economically justified level of rent, i.e. not too high but related to the justified economic interest of the landlord.', 'The point of departure for determining such ... rent should be an indication that its elements cannot be [fixed without relation to] running repairs and maintenance, an adequately determined depreciation and a decent profit. ...', 'The need to include the costs of repairs and maintenance does not require any further explanation – it is obvious. Likewise, a decent profit derived from the exercise of the right of property is an indispensable element of the genuine protection of property rights. Without profit, there are no investments or even modernisation works, which are dictated by technological progress and which are also beneficial for the interests of tenants. The future detailed legal solutions should, however, pay due regard to the fact that the aims pursued by the public authorities (the State Treasury, other State authorities and municipalities) are different from those pursued by private individuals and bodies (such as housing cooperatives) and that the expectations of [those two groups] in respect of a decent rent should be established at different levels. ...', 'It is also necessary to include among the elements of rent a return on landlords’ investments in the construction or modernisation of the building in due time, it being understood as a basis for an adequately established depreciation level. ...', '4. Additional instruments for monitoring the level of rent', 'An auxiliary instrument, enabling the courts to assess thoroughly the basis of the determination of, and increase in, rent could entail, among other things, the setting up by the authorities, in the process of a true social dialogue with organisations of landlords and tenants, a system for monitoring the levels of rent in all municipalities which would, for example, disseminate information on the average level of rent in a given region. Such systems are known in some European countries as a ‘rent mirror’. ...', '5. Housing benefits', 'The justified ‘basic rent’, determined in the manner indicated above in respect of each residential building, might often be incompatible with the tenants’ financial situation. ... In such cases the poorer tenants should be included in a system of individual benefits, justified by their [individual] circumstances, from the public funds, which would genuinely help them to fulfil their duty to pay rent regularly up to a certain determined amount.', '...', '8. Instruments for the necessary support of landlords', 'In certain situations (especially in respect of buildings regarded as part of the national heritage) it may happen that [even] properly determined rent will still not be sufficient to cover all the costs required for the necessary expenses involved in normal maintenance, in particular the necessary repairs or modernisation. In such precisely determined cases the system of public finances should provide for forms of individual support for landlords obliged to cover the extra costs involved in the maintenance of the buildings. Such support may take various forms, from housing subsidies, through loans on preferential terms for specific investments and, finally, to tax exemptions. ...', '...', '10. Inconsistent regulation of the rights and obligations of parties to a lease agreement', 'The Constitutional Court considers it necessary to point to inconsistencies, as regards the setting out of a catalogue of landlords’ and tenants’ duties, between the new sections 6a to 6f of the 2001 Act and the provisions concerning the lease of a dwelling contained in ... the Civil Code. It is against the rules of proper legislation to include the provisions governing the lease of dwellings not in the Civil Code, which contains a full set of regulations on lease relations, but in a law whose object is to protect tenants generally, not to regulate the lease relationship.', '[Final remarks]', 'The Constitutional Court’s present recommendations are concerned with shortcomings and lacunas to which it has pointed in recent years either in its judgments or documents providing information about its activities. ... Removing them in the near future is necessary also in view of the principle of the social market economy, which has particular importance in the present context. Now it is no longer possible to regulate these matters in a fragmentary or provisional manner. It should once more be stressed that they should be resolved through comprehensive solutions pursuing clearly defined aims which are compatible with the Constitution.”', '143. On 24 August 2005 the Ombudsman made an application to the Constitutional Court for certain provisions of the 2001 Act to be declared unconstitutional. He asked, inter alia, that section 8a (4)-(5)-(7.1) of the 2001 Act (as amended in December 2004) be found to be incompatible with Article 64 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution (principle of the protection of property rights) read in conjunction with Article 31 § 3 (principle of proportionality) and Article 76 (principle of protection of consumers against dishonest market practices). He further asked that section 9(1) of the 2001 Act be found to be incompatible with Article 2 of the Constitution (principle of the rule of law).', '144. The Ombudsman first referred to the Constitutional Court’s judgment of 19 April 2005, stating that this judgment left no doubt whatsoever that the legislature’s essential duty was to set up a legal mechanism balancing the constitutionally protected rights of landlords and tenants. Indeed, the attempts that had hitherto been made had proved to be unsuccessful mostly because of the authorities’ choice to give priority to current political interests rather than to the law, as demonstrated by many earlier judgments of the Constitutional Court.', '145. As to the contested provisions of section 8a, the Ombudsman stressed first their internal inconsistency, submitting that, on the one hand, subsections (4) and (5) made increases in rent above 3% of the reconstruction value per year subject to “judicial control” and required them to be “justified” but that, on the other hand, the latter subsection read a contrario meant that any other increases did not need to be justified. He further referred to the Constitutional Court’s recommendations, pointing out that there were no statutory criteria for what was to be considered a “justified increase”. In fact, he maintained, from the point of view of the landlord every rent increase was justified as it either increased his profit or reduced the losses involved in proper maintenance, while from the point of view of the tenant every such raise was “unjustified” as it involved greater expense on his part.', 'As regards section 9(1), the Ombudsman submitted that it was unclear and incompatible with the principle of proper legislation ensuing from the rule of law in that, for instance, it did not specify when the six-month period – relevant for determining the point from which a given increase in rent had applied – was to start.

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '6. By a charter of 12 September 1991, the applicant company chartered a Cypriot-owned vessel called the Cape Maleas (“the vessel”). The charter party was on an amended New York Produce Exchange time-charter form, and was for a time-charter voyage to the south Iranian ports. The duration of the voyage was stated to be fifty days and the purpose to carry general cargo, steels and commercial containers.', '7. By agreement between the parties, namely the applicant company and the owner of the vessel, Seabeach Shipping Ltd, on 18 September 1991 the charter party became subject to “Addendum No. 1”. This provided that the applicant charterer could load 2,500 cubic metres of “IMCO 1” cargo. “IMCO 1” denotes cargo which falls within the “Class 1 – Explosives” category of the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code.', '8. The applicant company ordered the vessel to proceed to the port of Burgas in Bulgaria and, on 8 October 1991, further cargo commenced loading. This consisted of general cargo but also arms, ammunition and military spare parts which fell within the “IMCO Class 1” category (“the arms cargo”).', '9. The applicant company’s agent in Burgas drew up bills of lading in respect of the cargo, including the arms cargo (“the bills of lading”). These bills of lading described the arms cargo as “special equipment”, followed by a reference to a numbered contract. The port of discharge for the “special equipment” was specified as Tartus in the Syrian Arab Republic. The shipper was stated to be “Socotrade” and the consignee as “to order”.', '10. The applicant company’s agent in Burgas also prepared a manifest of cargo. Like the bills of lading, this described the arms cargo as “special equipment”, and gave the port of discharge as Tartus. The applicant company at all times intended that the arms cargo should be discharged at the port of Bandar Abbas in Iran. The vessel sailed from Burgas at 7 p.m. on 21 October 1991 and was ordered to proceed to Setúbal in Portugal in order to load further cargo. In order to reach Setúbal from Burgas, the vessel had to transit through the Bosphorus.', '11. On 22 October 1991, at about 3.30 p.m., the vessel was about to commence transit through the Bosphorus. Before entering the Straits the master of the vessel requested the assistance of a pilot for navigation through the Bosphorus. The vessel was flying the international signal flag to indicate that it carried dangerous cargo.', '12. As a result of information received by the Turkish customs authorities from a Turkish vessel which had recently arrived from Bulgaria, the Turkish authorities believed that the arms cargo on board the vessel was bound for Cyprus, from where it would be smuggled into Turkey.', '13. According to the Turkish authorities, the vessel was first sighted when it was ten miles outside the Straits. After the vessel had entered the Straits, a pilot went on board and invited the master to declare any hazardous materials which were on board. The master duly did so, and the vessel proceeded for a few minutes through the Straits before the pilot instructed the master to stop the engines.', '14. The Turkish coastguard and other Turkish authorities boarded and seized the vessel. Since the waters were rough at the point where the vessel was stopped, it was towed by a military boat to the Turkish port of Büyükdere. All parties to the case subsequently proceeded on the basis that the seizure of the vessel had taken place in the Straits, governed by the Montreux Convention of 20 July 1936.', '15. At Büyükdere the vessel was searched and the bills of lading and manifest of cargo examined. The Turkish authorities discovered the arms cargo and questioned the master of the vessel. The statement entitled “Protocol of Facts”, in which the Turkish authorities summarised their allegations and the actions which they had taken in respect of the vessel, was prepared and signed by all the officials who were present at the seizure and search of the vessel. The master, the first officer and the radio operator of the vessel were taken into custody by the Turkish authorities.', '16. On 24 October 1991 statements were taken from the master and first officer in the form of affidavits. These formed part of the file which was submitted by the public prosecutor to a single judge of the Istanbul State Security Court.', '17. On 28 October 1991, having examined the file and citing, inter alia, Articles 5 and 6 of the Montreux Convention, a single judge of the Istanbul State Security Court approved the arrest of the vessel and the detention of its crew, namely the master, the first officer and the radio operator. The judge referred in his decision to “systematic weapon smuggling” and stated that the “evidence confirmed that the above-mentioned smuggled weapons could be used against the security of the Republic of Turkey”.', '18. On 30 October 1991 that decision was served on the lawyer instructed on behalf of the vessel and the master. The following day, the lawyer filed an objection against the decision, setting out the relevant provisions of the Montreux Convention and noting that Turkey was not in a state of war with any country within the meaning of the provisions of its Constitution and that there was neither a threat nor a risk of war.', '19. On 4 November 1991 the Istanbul State Security Court dismissed that objection.', '20. On 5 November the Chief Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court indicted the master, the first officer and the radio officer of the vessel, charging them with organised transportation of firearms and ammunition. In the public prosecutor’s view, Turkey was at war with Cyprus. He cited various decrees of the Turkish parliament which had authorised the sending of troops to Cyprus, and stated that:', '“... notwithstanding the ceasefire achieved through the efforts of the United Nations putting an end to the armed conflict, no treaty having yet been signed, the state of war is ongoing from a legal point of view. Consequently, it has become necessary to enforce Article 5 of the Montreux Convention. ...', 'Pursuant to [Article 5 of the Montreux Convention], the commercial vessels of countries at war with Turkey do not enjoy free passage through the Straits. Therefore, there being no right of unrestricted passage through the Straits of a ship flying the Cypriot flag and laden with weapons, the Turkish Government may exercise, for its own security and based on its sovereign rights and Article 5 of the said Convention, control over that ship and the weapons contained therein.”', '21. Since the vessel was registered as a Cypriot ship and flew the Cypriot flag, the Turkish authorities concluded that they had been entitled under Article 5 of the Montreux Convention to seize the vessel and to launch proceedings for arms smuggling.', '22. During November and December 1991 the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran sought the release of the vessel and its cargo through high-level diplomatic meetings. The issue was raised at presidential level and, on 11 November 1991, the Iranian ambassador to Turkey visited the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs to deliver copies of one of the bills of lading and of the Montreux Convention. This was intended to establish that the arms cargo was in fact being carried on behalf of the Iranian State.', '23. On 12 November 1991 the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Justice, giving an account of the meetings which had taken place, enclosing copies of the bill of lading and the Montreux Convention and offering to obtain further information on the “special equipment” listed on the bill of lading.', '24. On 13 November 1991 the lawyer acting on behalf of the owners and the master of the vessel pointed out to the Istanbul State Security Court that the assumption that Turkey and Cyprus were at war with each other was the “crucial point” of the case. He requested the Istanbul State Security Court to enquire immediately of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether a state of war existed. He also submitted that the Presidency of the Parliament should be asked whether there had been a declaration of war.', '25. On 18 November 1991 the lawyer filed another application with the court reiterating that Turkey was not at war with any country (Cyprus included) and seeking the release of the master on bail.', '26. On 25 November 1991 the lawyer submitted a petition to the Istanbul State Security Court asking the court to rephrase the question which it had put to the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He objected to the question which had been put, namely “whether the peace operations in Cyprus have ended with a treaty of peace ...”, and submitted that the proper question to be asked was “whether the Republic of Turkey is in a state of war or not with the State of Cyprus”.', '27. In another communication, dated 29 November 1991, the applicant company’s lawyer sent the Istanbul State Security Court translations of the charter party and the bills of lading. He explained that the nature of a time charter was similar to a lease, and that charterers had control over the cargo and its documentation.', '28. The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the questions posed by the Istanbul State Security Court in two letters of 13 and 26 December 1991. The letters stated:', '“... as there is no ‘state of war’ between Turkey and any other country, including the Greek Cypriot Administration, it is obvious that the seizure of the ship cannot be based on Articles 5 and 6 of the Montreux Convention. In fact, ships carrying the flag of the Greek Cypriot Administration have always traversed the Straits freely.', '2. In the Note sent to our Ministry by the Iranian embassy in Ankara, it was stated that the arms found on the ship belonged to Iran. This had been certified by the Iranian authorities on several occasions.', 'On the other hand, the Bulgarian authorities stated that the said arms had officially been sold to Iran by an agreement signed between Bulgaria and Iran in 1989 and that the arms had been loaded in Burgas.', '3. Except for the limitations set out in Articles 4 and 5 of the Montreux Convention in ‘time of war’, commercial ships flying foreign flags enjoy full freedom of transit passage at times of peace, whatever their flag and cargo may be. As stated above, it is impossible to invoke the ‘time of war’ provisions of the Montreux Convention in this case because no state of war with the Greek Cypriot Administration exists. Moreover, in accordance with customary international and treaty laws, ships have the ‘right of innocent passage’ through the territorial waters of other countries ...”', '29. On 16 December 1991 the Istanbul State Security Court issued a decision for the release of the master on bail, but ordered the seizure and confiscation of the vessel and its cargo on suspicion of their being intended for use for the commission or preparation of a crime.', '30. On 10 January 1992 the public prosecutor filed his observations on the merits. He maintained his earlier position, relying upon Article 5 of the Montreux Convention, contending that the vessel and the arms cargo should be seized and the master imprisoned.', '31. By January 1992 the applicant company had concluded that attempts to secure the release of the vessel and its cargo through diplomatic negotiations were unlikely to succeed. The applicant company applied through its Turkish lawyer, Mr Aydın, to intervene in the proceedings before the Istanbul State Security Court. In its application, the applicant company set out its interest in the case as the owner of the cargo and stressed that the arms cargo was being carried as part of a normal and legal commercial transaction and that Turkey was not at war with any country. It therefore asked for the unconditional release of the vessel and its cargo. The court ordered that the applicant company be joined as an intervening party in the proceedings.', '32. On 22 February 1992 the then Prime Minister of Turkey, Mr Süleyman Demirel, issued a certificate which stated:', '“The Republic of Turkey is not in a state of war with any country, Southern Cyprus included ...”', '33. By a judgment of 12 March 1992, the Istanbul State Security Court acquitted the first officer and the radio operator, but convicted the master of the vessel of importing arms into Turkey without official permission and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment and a fine of 50,000 Turkish liras (TRL). The court ordered that the arms cargo and the vessel be confiscated pursuant to the final paragraph of section 12 of Law no. 6136, that all the cargo other than the arms be returned to the applicant company and that the master bear the costs of the court hearing. With reference to a judgment of the Court of Cassation in a similar case, the Istanbul State Security Court held that in the present case there was bad faith on the part of the applicant company since the bill of lading gave inaccurate information as to the contents of the cargo and the route of the vessel. It noted that there was no justification for not informing the Turkish authorities of Iranian weapons passing through the Straits. The court further considered the following in relation to the Montreux Convention:', '“The second question is whether the Turkish authorities were entitled to seize the munitions and weapons. Pursuant to the relevant Article of the Montreux Convention, the passage of ships carrying firearms and owned by any State with which Turkey is in a state of war is forbidden.', 'The other important issue is whether Turkey is in a state of war with the Greek Cypriot State, or in other words, whether a peace agreement has been reached after the war. It is known that Turkey has engaged in war with the Greek Cypriot State, as a result of which Cyprus has been divided into two sections, that the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus has been established, that the Greek Cypriot State has not recognised the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and until now no agreement has been reached, and that inter-State negotiations are in progress.', 'Therefore, the letter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ... and the letter of the Prime Minister ... were disregarded.”', '34. The judgment went on to refer to the Vassoula case, concerning another vessel, and concluded that “the existence of a state of war has been confirmed”.', '35. Following the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court, the applicant company paid the hire charge and expenses due to the owner and the charter party in the sum of 1,161,374.50 United States dollars (USD). Although the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court had ordered the return of the non-arms cargo to the applicant company, it was not returned and, by an order of 29 May 1992, the Istanbul Court of Commerce granted an injunction to the owner of the vessel which imposed a lien of TRL 4,111,168,608 over the cargo to secure the unpaid hire. The owner of the vessel, Seabeach Shipping Ltd, then commenced enforcement proceedings for encashment of the lien over the cargo which belonged to the applicant company.', '36. On 13 March 1992 the applicant company appealed against the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court. The applicant company disputed the court’s conclusion that a state of war existed between Turkey and Cyprus. The ground of appeal also questioned the legitimacy of the court’s reliance on the earlier Vassoula case, and pointed out that the arms cargo had only been in transit through the Straits.', '37. By a decision of 3 June 1992, the Court of Cassation quashed the Istanbul State Security Court’s judgment. It held that there was no material evidence in the file indicating that the arms would be discharged from the vessel in Turkey. As regards the applicability of the provisions of the Montreux Convention, the Court of Cassation held:', '“... that the state of war mentioned in Article 4 of the Convention did not exist as also evidenced by the letters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister which explicitly state that ‘Turkey is not at war with any country, including the Southern Greek Cyprus Administration’ ... and that there is no room for application of Article 6 of the Montreux Convention. ...”', '38. The case was remitted to the State Security Court for retrial.', '39. In an application of 3 September 1992, pending the retrial of the master of the vessel before the Istanbul State Security Court, the applicant company sought removal of the lien which had been imposed by the Istanbul Court of Commerce over the cargo.', '40. On 8 September 1992 the Istanbul Court of Commerce refused the applicant company’s request, so on 18 September 1992 the applicant company agreed to pay the owner some of the hire charges, without prejudice as to liability. In return, the owner agreed to relinquish its lien on the non-arms cargo. Under that agreement the applicant company had to pay 80% of the hire charge in respect of the period from 14 March 1992 to 13 September 1992 inclusive (USD 1,118,074.40). The applicant company also agreed to pay 100% of future charges, as and when the payments fell due. The owner provided the applicant company with a guarantee to repay the sum of USD 1,118,074.40. The applicant company considered that it was obliged to pay the hire charges due, otherwise the Istanbul Court of Commerce and the owner would not have released the vessel and its cargo.', '41. On 30 September 1992 the Istanbul State Security Court acquitted the master on retrial. An appeal by the public prosecutor against that judgment was dismissed by the Court of Cassation in a decision of 12 November 1992, which was approved on 13 November 1992.', '42. On 18 November 1992 the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the release of the vessel and the arms cargo. The vessel left Turkey on 8 December 1992 and was returned to the owner by the applicant company under the terms of the charter party on 9 March 1993.', '43. In a written application of 22 July 1993, the applicant company brought an action before the Istanbul Court of Commerce claiming TRL 38,087,249,964 (equivalent to USD 3,386,598.98) plus interest against the Ministry of Finance and Customs, with reference to the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. The applicant company based its claim on Article 41 of the Code of Obligations and submitted that the seizure and detention of the vessel and its cargo had been unjustified. It argued in this connection that the arms and ammunition had belonged to the Islamic Republic of Iran, that the vessel had been wrongfully impounded for 413 days, 2 hours and 30 minutes and, as a result, it had had to pay USD 3,263,522.92 to the owner, USD 81,978.86 in fuel charges and USD 41,097.20 in harbour fees.', '44. The application went on to distinguish this case from the Vassoula case, and to explain the circumstances in which the applicant company had been forced to pay the hire charges and other expenses to the owner of the vessel.', '45. On 28 September 1994 a first expert report was submitted to the Court of Commerce following its interlocutory order of 9 March 1994. The experts advised that the applicant company’s claim should be declared inadmissible, principally on the basis that the applicant company had chosen voluntarily and without legal compulsion to pay the hire charges under the charter party.', '46. The applicant company objected to the first report and the Court of Commerce ordered the preparation of a second expert report on 11 November 1994.', '47. On 3 April 1995 the second expert report was submitted to the court with the conclusion that the applicant company’s claim should be dismissed. This second panel of experts considered that the owner of the vessel, but not the applicant company, might in appropriate circumstances claim compensation from the Turkish State. They expressed the opinion that the applicant company’s claim might succeed in relation to dock and fuel expenses incurred, as well as supplementary losses under Article 105 of the Code of Obligations, but that the claim in respect of hire charges should fail.', '48. On 13 June 1995 the applicant company filed an objection against the second report and requested the court to rule on the case without obtaining a further report, or alternatively to order a third expert report.', '49. By a decision of 20 September 1995, the Istanbul Court of Commerce dismissed the applicant company’s claim for compensation, holding that the vessel was not a merchant vessel since it was carrying, in part, a cargo of arms. It considered that the security authorities had merely carried out their statutory duty to investigate serious allegations of arms smuggling. The court therefore ruled that there had been no breach of the Montreux Convention or of Turkish law, in particular Article 41 of the Code of Obligations.', '50. On 6 November 1995 the applicant company appealed.', '51. On 27 December 1996 the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal and upheld the judgment of the Istanbul Court of Commerce. A request by the applicant company for rectification of that decision was rejected by a new decision of the Court of Cassation of 22 May 1997, served on the applicant company on 22 June 1997.', '52. The charter party provided, inter alia, that any dispute arising under it should be referred to arbitration in London. As a result of the seizure and subsequent detention of the vessel and its cargo by the respondent government, a dispute arose between the applicant company and the owner of the vessel concerning the hire charges and other expenses paid by the applicant company.', '53. Following arbitration proceedings in London, on 20 September 1995 the arbitration panel decided that the charter party had been frustrated by the Istanbul State Security Court’s decision of 12 March 1992. The applicant company therefore recovered from the owner of the vessel the hire charges and other expenses which had been paid in respect of the period after 12 March 1992, but was unable to recover USD 1,300,403.83 which it had paid or which it thereupon had to pay to the owner in respect of the period between the seizure on 22 October 1991 and 12 March 1992.', '54. Meanwhile, the owner of the vessel, Seabeach Shipping Ltd, brought an action in the Beyoğlu Commercial Court in Istanbul seeking a lien on the cargo for the hire charges. In a decision of 29 May 1992 the Beyoğlu Commercial Court accepted the owner’s claim on the ground that it was owed freight charges.', '55. The cargo receiver, the Mobarakeh Steel Complex, also brought an action in the Beyoğlu Commercial Court claiming USD 2,236,208 in damages from the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence. It submitted that it had lost revenue as a result of the detention of its merchandise carried on the vessel and that new commercial goods had been purchased in order to replace the seized merchandise.', '56. In a judgment of 17 January 2000, the Beyoğlu Commercial Court dismissed that claim on the grounds that the seizure of the vessel had been lawful since the arms cargo was not clearly indicated on the bill of lading. On appeal by the plaintiff, the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment. Relying on the outcome of the criminal proceedings, the Court of Cassation noted that the goods in question were not contraband or of a kind requiring them to be confiscated. It accordingly held that the defendant must be liable for the damage resulting from the wrongful confiscation of the goods.', '57. In a judgment of 15 December 2000, the Beyoğlu Commercial Court confirmed its earlier judgment and held that the plaintiff’s claim must be dismissed on the grounds that the seizure and detention of the vessel had been in compliance with domestic law and the Montreux Convention governing the Straits. Taking into account the fact that the vessel had been sailing under the Cypriot flag, and the inconsistency between the cargo and the documents, the court considered that the seizure of the vessel had been lawful. The court further noted that the State of Turkey had acted with the aim of preventing activities designed to undermine it. The plaintiff again appealed against that judgment.', '58. On 21 November 2000 the Court of Cassation sitting as a full civil court upheld the judgment of the Beyoğlu Commercial Court and dismissed the action. It considered that while under the Montreux Convention merchant ships were entitled to innocent passage, this did not outweigh Turkey’s sovereign rights. That being so, any arms trafficking would adversely affect Turkey and would thus mean that the passage was no longer innocent. It further stated the following:', '“... On the other hand, the bill of lading described the 2,131 boxes opened as containing ‘Special Equipment’. The Turkish Commercial Code specifies in Articles 1098 and 1114 the points to be included in the bill of lading. The cargo received or loaded onto the vessel for transportation must be described on the bill of lading in order for the acknowledgment of receipt and the delivery contract to be complete ... This description, which is an essential element of the bill of lading, must be such as to allow the cargo to be distinguished at all times from the other cargoes on the vessel and must be complete. The carrier is obliged to indicate on the bill of lading the amount, brand and external appearance as well as the characteristics of the cargo ... Clearly, as is apparent from the bills of lading in the case file, these indications, some of which are mandatory, were not included on the bill of lading and invited suspicion.', 'A country may purchase the arms it needs for its defence from another country, or may secure them by means such as aid or donations. In other words, arms trading between States is a normal and lawful procedure. Transportation of these arms is also normal and lawful. Arms purchased and transported must be indicated clearly as such on the bill of lading and other documents, in accordance with international rules. There should be no need to conceal them or make use of other channels. The file did not include a sales contract to the effect that the party sending these arms had purchased them lawfully, nor did it include any evidence to the effect that a letter of credit had been opened by banks. Given the manner in which the arms were loaded onto the vessel, it was essential from the point of view of Turkey’s security to inspect the vessel. In the matter of innocent passage, the coastal State has the right to impose sanctions on the vessel and cargo in accordance with the rule on the prevention of non-innocent passage which stems from customary law and the Montreux Convention. The Montreux Convention, customary law and the principle of ex aequo et bono do not prevent Turkey from exercising this right. For these reasons, the trial court’s decision to dismiss the action must be upheld on the grounds that it is in conformity with the law and with statutory procedure.”', '59. The former signatories to the Treaty of Lausanne (1923), together with Yugoslavia and Australia, met at Montreux, Switzerland, in 1936 and abolished the International Straits Commission, returning the Straits zone to Turkish military control. Turkey was authorised to close the Straits to warships of all countries when it was at war or threatened by aggression. Merchant ships were to be allowed free passage during peacetime and, except for countries at war with Turkey, during wartime. The convention was ratified by Turkey, Great Britain, France, the USSR, Bulgaria, Greece, Germany and Yugoslavia, and – with reservations – by Japan. The preamble to the convention stated that the desire of the parties was “to regulate transit and navigation in the Straits of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the Bosphorus, comprised under the general term ‘Straits’, in such manner as to safeguard, within the framework of Turkish security and of the security, in the Black Sea, of the riparian States, the principle enshrined in Article 23 of the Treaty of Peace signed at Lausanne on the 24th July, 1923”.', 'The relevant provisions of the convention read as follows:', '“The High Contracting Parties recognise and affirm the principle of freedom of transit and navigation by sea in the Straits.', 'The exercise of this freedom shall henceforth be regulated by the provisions of the present Convention.”', '“In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of transit and navigation in the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag and with any kind of cargo, without any formalities, except as provided in Article 3 below. No taxes or charges other than those authorised by Annex I to the present Convention shall be levied by the Turkish authorities on these vessels when passing in transit without calling at a port in the Straits.', 'In order to facilitate the collection of these taxes or charges merchant vessels passing through the Straits shall communicate to the officials at the stations referred to in Article 3 their name, nationality, tonnage, destination and last port of call (provenance).', '...”', '“All ships entering the Straits by the Aegean Sea or by the Black Sea shall stop at a sanitary station near the entrance to the Straits for the purposes of the sanitary control prescribed by Turkish law within the framework of international sanitary regulations.

In 1995 he retired.', 'In July 1995 a medical expert commission recognised the applicant as having a number of work-related illnesses. As a result K paid him a lump sum in compensation and started to pay him a monthly pension.', 'On 1 July 1998 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Tsentralno-Miskyy District Court of Kryvy Rig (“the District Court”) against K, seeking a recalculation of the above-mentioned payments.', 'On 16 February 1999 the defendant requested the court to order an accountant’s report on the calculation of the payments in question. The court allowed this request.', 'On 1 March 1999 the expert opinion was read out at a court hearing.', 'On 18 March 1999 the District Court found for the applicant.', 'On 25 October 1999, upon an appeal by the defendant, the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court (since June 2001 the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Court of Appeal) quashed that judgment on the ground that the first-instance court had wrongly calculated the amounts awarded, and ordered a retrial.', 'The District Court’s hearing scheduled for 8 February 2000 was adjourned at the applicant’s request because he was preparing an additional claim. This claim, apparently for additional payments, was lodged on 22 February 2000. Further additional claims were lodged by the applicant on 11 July 2001 and 4 March 2002.', 'On 15 March 2000 the District Court ordered, at the defendant’s request, a forensic examination by an accountant. The defendant subsequently refused to bear the costs of the forensic examination in view of lack of funds and the expert terminated the examination. The file was transferred back to the District Court and the next hearing took place on 9 April 2001.', 'On 17 July 2001 the District Court joined, at the defendant’s request, the local department of the State Social Security Fund (Виконавча дирекція Фонду соціального страхування від нещасних випадків на виробництві і професійних захворювань в м.

On 20 October 1992 the first applicant, as the owner of 3 freshwater fish farms, was charged with offences against the Act on freshwater fish farms of 5 April 1989 (bekendtgørelse nr. 224), henceforth also called the 1989 Act, as allegedly he had intentionally exceeded the fixed feed quotas with danger or risk thereof to the environment, and with enrichment for himself.', '8. On 13 September 1993 an indictment was submitted to the City Court in Fjerritslev (retten i Fjerritslev) before which the trial was scheduled for 9 December 1993. However, the trial was adjourned awaiting the outcome of a corresponding pending criminal case, considered to be a “test-case”, in which the defendant had alleged inter alia that the 1989 Act had no legal authority as it contravened articles of the Penal Code and provisions of the Environmental Protection Act (Miljøbeskyttelsesloven). The Government claimed that the adjournment was initiated by the first applicant’s counsel. The applicant contested this. It is undisputed, however, that the parties agreed to the adjournment and that no objections were raised against it. The proceedings in the test-case were finally determined on appeal by a High Court judgment of 21 September 1995.', '9. Subsequent to a preliminary hearing held in the applicant’s case on 18 December 1995 it was decided to adjourn his case anew awaiting another corresponding pending criminal case, considered to be a test-case, in which the defendant had alleged that the 1989 Act had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC Council Directive of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, amended by the 88/182/EEC Council Directive of 22 March 1988. The proceedings in the corresponding case were finally determined on appeal in the autumn of 1996 when a High Court delivered its judgment.', '10. The applicant’s trial commenced on 8 April 1997. Since a witness on the applicant’s behalf was prevented from appearing on that day, the trial continued and ended on 14 May 1997. By judgment of 28 May 1997 the City Court in Fjerritslev convicted the applicant and sentenced him to pay a fine of 68,000 Danish kroner (DKK). In addition a profit estimated to DKK 275,000 was confiscated.', '11. On 9 June 1997 the applicant appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark (Vestre Landsret) before which he was granted permission to procure an expert witness, who during the preparation of the case was requested to reply in writing to specific questions formulated by counsel, and approved by the prosecutor.', '12. By judgment of 29 June 1998 the High Court of Western Denmark upheld the applicant’s conviction, but increased the fine to DKK 95,000 and the amount to be confiscated to DKK 384,000.', '13. The applicant’s request of 7 July 1998 for leave to appeal against the High Court’s judgment to the Supreme Court (Højesteret) was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board (Procesbevillingsnævnet) on 23 November 1998.', '14. The case was brought before the Supreme Court on 15 January 1999, where it was joined with the second applicant’s appeal (see below).', 'II', '15. On 26 October 1993, the second applicant, as manager of two limited companies which each owned a freshwater fish farm, was charged with offences against the amended Act of 31 September 1994 on freshwater fish farms partly in conjunction with the former Act of 5 April 1989 (bekendtgørelse nr. 900 jfr. tildels bekendtgørelse nr. 224), as allegedly he had intentionally exceeded the fixed feed quotas with danger or risk thereof to the environment, and with enrichment for the companies.', '16. The case was brought before the City Court in Mariager (retten i Mariager) by the prosecution’s submission of an indictment of 8 March 1994, which was later extended by supplementary indictments.', '17. In the period between September 1994 and October 1995 the case was adjourned awaiting the outcome of a corresponding pending criminal case, which was considered to be a test-case.', '18. On 3 November 1995 the proceedings were adjourned at the request of the applicant’s counsel, who wished to submit a written pleading. On 21 November 1995 counsel requested an extension of the time-limit for submitting his pleading. On 12 February 1996 he stated that his pleading was approaching. On 21 March 1996 he was granted yet another extension of the timelimit, and on 17 April 1996 the pleading was submitted.', '19. Further pleadings were submitted and additional preliminary issues were dealt with, inter alia with regard to counsel’s request that the applicant’s case be joined with another corresponding pending case.', '20. On 4 October 1996 counsel was granted an extension of the timelimit to submit his rejoinder within eight weeks.', '21. A hearing was held on 24 February 1997 and the case was scheduled to commence on 8 September 1997 as counsel had stated that he was unable to appear before that date.', '22. On 16 September 1997 the City Court in Mariager convicted the applicant and sentenced him to pay a fine of DKK 275,000. In addition profits estimated to DKK 900,000 and DKK 200,000, respectively, were confiscated in the companies.', '23. On 23 September 1997 the applicant appealed against the judgment to the High Court of Western Denmark, before which the case was ready to be listed for trial on 27 November 1997. As counsel was unable to appear on the proposed dates in January, February and May 1998, the case was scheduled for trial on 27 August 1998.', '24. By judgment of 3 September 1998 the High Court of Western Denmark upheld the applicant’s conviction, but increased the fine to DKK 345,000 and the amounts to be confiscated to DKK 1,158,000 and DKK 240,000 respectively.', '25. The applicant’s request of 11 September 1998 for leave to appeal against the High Court’s judgment to the Supreme Court was granted by the Leave to Appeal Board on 23 November 1998.', '26. The case was brought before the Supreme Court on 15 January 1999, where it was joined with the first applicant’s appeal. The applicants jointly argued that the Act of 1989 had no legal authority as the European Commission had not been notified of it as allegedly prescribed by the 83/189/EEC Council Directive of 28 March 1983 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, amended by the 88/182/EEC Council Directive of 22 March 1988, and that accordingly they should be acquitted. Moreover, they requested that the Supreme Court referred the question of the legal consequences of the non-notification to the European Court of Justice pursuant to the former Article 177 of the EC Treaty.', '27. As to the latter the Prosecutor General procured an opinion from the Ministry of Justice of 29 January 1999, finding no basis for a preliminary reference, an opinion he endorsed. On 4 February 1999 the Supreme Court requested counsel’s comment on this issue.', '28. On 17 February 1999 the applicants requested that an additional counsel be assigned to plead on the EU-law issues of the case. This was refused by the Supreme Court on 24 February 1999. The following day, the applicants requested that a named attorney substitute their counsel as to the EUlaw issues. This request was granted on 18 April 1999 and the proceedings were adjourned for eight weeks pending comments from the substituting counsel.', '29. It appears that the substituting counsel three times was granted an extension of the time-limit to submit his comments, thus his first written pleading was submitted on 5 October 1999.', '30. The Prosecutor General stated definitively on 3 November 1999 that he found no basis for referring the case to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.', '31. The exchange of pleadings on this question continued until 7 April 2000, as the substitute counsel three times requested that the Prosecutor General submit written replies to various questions put by counsel on the issue. Each time the replies were followed by a comprehensive pleading by the substitute counsel.', '32. On 22 August 2000 the Supreme Court decided not to refer the case to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling, as it found that there was no obligation to notify the European Commission of the specific section of the Act on freshwater fish farms of 5 April 1989, with which the applicants were charged, and that there was no reasonable doubt that the section in question was in accordance with European Community legislation.', '33. By judgment of 16 February 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s judgment in respect of the first applicant, but reduced the amount to be confiscated to DKK 240,000, and by judgment of the same date the Supreme Court upheld the High Court’s judgment in its entirety in respect of the second applicant.']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Prem. She is the mother of Simon Volk, who was born in 1983.', '6. On 14 January 2008 the applicant’s son was convicted of rape, grievous bodily harm and deprivation of liberty. He was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. On 11 November 2008 he started serving his prison sentence in Dob Prison.', '7. The applicant’s son had been dependent on drugs since 2001. As a part of his medical treatment in prison he received substitutes for opiates, such as Suboxon, Sanval, which is a hypnotic, Serguel, which is an antipsychotic drug, and Zoloft, which is an anti-depressant. Before beginning his sentence, the applicant’s son made an appointment at a drug dependency treatment centre at a psychiatric hospital. Its report, dated 7 October 2008, shows that he had stated that he wished to be hospitalised, but had failed to meet the conditions, namely abstinence. On 6 November 2008 the applicant’s son was examined privately by a psychiatrist, who noted that he had no sign of abstinence and was referred to his general practitioner for treatment for drug dependency.', '8. As regards the facilities available to the applicant’s son in the cells and common areas in Dob Prison, as well as the health care regime in the prison and the conditions imposed on him regarding activities outside the cells and contact with the outside world, see the Court’s decision in the case of Lalić and Others v. Slovenia (dec.), no. 5711/10 etc., 27 September 2011.', '9. As regards drug users, the prison offers medical (including methadone substitution) treatment and therapeutic help in accordance with a specialised drug treatment programme. Prisoners who successfully undergo methadone substitution treatment are able to undergo detoxification, which normally takes three to four weeks. Further rehabilitation of previous drug users is provided in the drug-free sections of the prison, to which only those prisoners who are no longer dependent on drugs and who are no longer undergoing opiate replacement therapy may be assigned.', '10. When he arrived in Dob Prison, the applicant’s son underwent an admission interview, conducted by a social worker, which, apart from his dependency problem, did not show anything giving rise to particular concern. On 12 November 2008 he was examined by a doctor, who prescribed him substitution therapy for drug dependency. On the same day he was seen by a drug abuse therapist.', '11. The applicant’s son was initially placed in a seven-square-metre cell, which he shared with another prisoner. Between 17 November 2008 and 12 February 2009 he was accommodated in cell 1, Block 2. The cell, in which fifteen prisoners were held, measured about 60 square metres.', '12. On 20 November 2008 the applicant’s son developed an infection in his right arm and underwent surgery on 24 November 2008. Between 25 November and 2 December 2008 his wound was cleaned and dressed daily.', '13. On 12 and 26 November 2008 the applicant asked the Dob Prison authorities to move her son to Koper Prison. She stated that the latter prison was closer to their home and had better living conditions. She also stated that her son was often ill and was in hospital at the time of the request. Her request was rejected on the grounds that proper medical assistance could also be provided in Dob Prison.', '14. In the meantime, the prison psychologist saw the applicant’s son on 25 November 2008. He noted, inter alia, that no serious mental difficulties or suicidal tendencies could be observed. On 5 December 2008 a prison social worker N.B., held a meeting with the applicant, her son and his sister. The applicant inquired about the prison regime and repeated her requests for a transfer for her son.', '15. On 1 December 2008 the applicant told the drug abuse therapist that he was in crisis with his drug dependency and that he had stopped taking his substitution medication. The therapist informed him of the possible treatments for his drug dependency in the prison. On 8 December 2008 the applicant had a consultation with the psychologist. On 9 December 2008 the general practitioner noted in the report that the applicant had stopped taking the substitution medication.', '16. On 10 December 2008 a “personal plan” (osebni načrt) was set up for the applicant’s son. Referring to the judgment by which he had been convicted and the report from the drug abuse therapist, the plan noted that the applicant’s son’s substitution therapy should be monitored and that he should be encouraged to deal with his drug dependency. It was envisaged that a urine test be regularly taken; that he have special psychological therapy with regard to the criminal offence he had committed; and that he be given the opportunity to continue his primary education. It was also noted that social worker N.B. was the officer responsible for his case.', '17. On 11 December 2008 the applicant’s son had a consultation with the drug abuse therapist. On the same day he was also introduced to leisure activities provided by the prison. It was agreed that he would attend such activities for three hours every Wednesday. However, he attended only three times and after 7 January 2009 he gave up the enrolment.', '18. On 22 December 2008 a meeting was held with the applicant’s son. The report prepared by the head of Block 2 following the meeting does not reveal anything untoward.', '19. On 15 January 2009 the applicant’s son told the psychiatrist that he had started taking heroin again. He told the drug abuse therapist, whom he saw the same month, the same thing. During January 2009 the applicant’s son also had two consultations with the psychologist.', '20. On 5 February 2009 the applicant’s son was seen by a social worker, following an “urgent request” in which he complained about extortion by his co-inmate, S.B., from other inmates, including himself. The applicant’s son gave a statement on the record in which he alleged that S.B. had taken money from him, as well as clothes and slippers. On 6 February 2009 S.B. was moved to Block 1 (high-security regime).', '21. In the evening of 9 February 2009, two guards entered the cell and found the applicant’s son using a wet towel to cool his face. He told them that he had been attacked by D.M. because of a dispute over a USB network key. The operative head of the prison then talked to both prisoners, who reached agreement. After the incident, the applicant’s son’s personal belongings were searched. It was discovered that his computer was connected to the internet and drugs were found in his cupboard. The computer and the drugs were seized. Following the search, the applicant’s son repeatedly said that he would cut or hang himself and that he would not survive the night. The applicant’s son was then transferred to a special cell with video surveillance, where he remained from 10.55 p.m. On 10 February 2009 a report noting these events was prepared by the prison guard who was on duty that evening.', '22. At 10.55 a.m. on 10 February 2009 the applicant’s son was returned to an ordinary regime. Before this transfer he was seen by the head of Block 2. According to the report prepared by the head, the applicant’s son had said that he had had no intention of committing suicide and that he had calmed down. It was also noted that he had refused to be examined by a doctor, as he had not sustained any injuries. Lastly, the report noted that the psychologist had talked to the applicant’s son and that the prison guards had been informed that they needed to pay special attention to him.', '23. On 11 February 2009 the head of Block 2 and the prison psychologist held a meeting with the applicant, her son and his sister. The report of the meeting notes that the applicant alleged that her son was in danger and that it was no surprise that he was on drugs. They also discussed the incident of 9 February 2009 and the applicant’s transfer request. As regards the latter, the prison officers explained to the applicant that her son could not simply be moved to Block 3 or 4, and informed her that the prisoner who had extorted money from the applicant (presumably S.B.) was now being held in a high-security block (i.e. Block 1). The next day, 12 February 2009, the applicant was transferred to Block 1. The decision referred to his drug problem, refusal to give urine samples and possession of illegal items. His transfer to Block 1 implied that he could only have two hours of outdoor exercise and was not allowed to spend time in the recreation room. He was allowed to receive visits of an hour’s duration, and to use the telephone in accordance with the daily schedule. When leaving the cell he was accompanied by a guard and he could spend time outdoors only in the Block 1 yard. Two prisoners were allowed to be in the same area of the yard, under supervision. the applicant’s son was held in cells 32, 21 and 41.', '24. On 18 February and 4 March 2009 social worker N.B. invited the applicant’s son for a consultation, but he refused. He also refused to have a consultation with the drug abuse therapist on 25 March and 15 April 2009. However, in February 2009 the applicant’s son had one consultation with the drug abuse therapist and three with the psychologist. In March 2009 he saw the drug abuse therapist once and the psychologist twice. Moreover, between 19 January and 23 March 2009 the applicant’ son had six consultations with the psychiatrist, in which they discussed his drug dependency and substitution therapy.', '25. The applicant made further requests for a transfer for her son, which were refused on 18 March 2009.', '26. On 23 March the team of officers dealing with the applicant’s son’s case decided that he should be moved to Block 3.', '27. On 25, 27 and 31 March 2009 social worker N.B. held meetings with the applicant’s son. They discussed transferring him to an ordinary regime, where he would be able to participate in a drug treatment group and attend school as well as take part in leisure activities. They also discussed his problem with debt. The applicant’s son said that he had a debt of 200 euros (EUR) but he did not fear the person to whom he owed the money. He had more concern about a certain I.N., to whom he owed EUR 130 and whom he might meet on the yard if transferred. He added that he would not provoke I.N. When reminded, on 31 March 2009, that it was planned to transfer him to Block 3, the applicant’s son requested that this be delayed for at least a month. He said he did not feel strong enough to reject drugs if they were offered to him. He was reminded that he was continuing to refuse to give urine samples, which was an indication that he was taking drugs while in Block 1.', '28. Following the meeting with social worker N.B. on 31 March 2009 (see paragraph 27 above), at which he had opposed the idea of being transferred to an ordinary regime, a decision was taken that he should stay in Block 1.', '29. Following unsuccessful attempts to reach the Head of the Administration for the Execution of Prison Sentences (“the Administration”) by email or telephone, the applicant sent him a letter on 26 March 2009. She complained about the refusal of her request for transfer, stating that it was clear from the documentation available to the prison authorities that her son had lodged a complaint against S.B. and that she had asked for him to be transferred out of the cell following the attack by D.M. She also complained that the applicant’s son had previously been in a cell with sixteen prisoners, although the statutory limit was eight prisoners, and that, unlike in Koper Prison, in Dob Prison he was not provided with the opportunity to study or work. She also stated that of 510 prisoners 470 were taking drugs and that one psychiatrist was employed for less than six hours a day and was not sufficiently accessible. This letter was treated as an appeal and rejected by the Administration on 16 April 2009. The latter reiterated that Koper Prison did not provide any special psychological treatment targeted at her son’s drug abuse and the offence he had committed, and that Dob Prison had sufficient means at its disposal to ensure his safety.', '30. It would appear that on 8 April 2009 the governor of Dob Prison requested, of his own motion, that the applicant’s son be transferred to Koper Prison, stating that this would have a positive effect on his motivation for realisation of his “personal plan”.', '31. On 6, 14 and 16 April 2009 the applicant’s son saw the psychologist.', '32. On 15 April 2009 it was ordered that the applicant’s visits to her son should be held behind a glass partition. The decision referred to the fact that following visits from his sister and the applicant on 4 and 15 April 2009 he was found to be in possession of a presumably illegal substance.', '33. On 16 April 2009, during a conversation with a psychiatrist, the applicant’s son became very upset and threatened to harm himself. The prison governor ordered that he be placed in a single cell under supervision and afterwards remain in Block 1.', '34. On 20 April 2009 the psychiatrist had a discussion with the applicant about her son’s situation. The applicant’s son was also examined by the psychiatrist. At that examination he said that he wished to reduce substitution therapy. He also confirmed that he had had suicidal thoughts twice before. The physiatrist prescribed him substitute therapy and anti-stress medication. The applicant’s son saw the psychologist the same day.', '35. On 24 April and 6 May 2009 social worker N.B. invited the applicant’s son for a consultation, but he refused to attend.', '36. On 12 May 2009 social worker N.B. and the prison governor held a meeting with the applicant and her son. The applicant stressed that her son was in danger and referred to her requests that he be transferred.', '37. In the meantime, on 4 May 2009 the applicant’s son reported to the prison authorities that he had been attacked by an inmate from the same cell and asked to be transferred to another cell.', '38. On 11 May 2009 the Head of the Administration issued a decision refusing the request by the governor of Dob Prison on the grounds already given in the previous decisions (see paragraphs 13 and 29 above), but ordered of his own motion a temporary placement of the applicant’s son in Koper Prison for the period between 20 May and 20 November 2009.', '39. On 14 May 2009 a report was sent to Koper Prison, which noted the applicant’s son’s addiction problem and his fear of fellow inmates to whom he owed money. It was also mentioned in the report that officers from Dob Prison had noticed that a certain prisoner was putting pressure on the applicant and was demanding that he return money.', '40. On 22 and 27 May 2009 the applicant’s son was examined by a general practitioner in Koper Prison, who noted that he had not been taking substitution medication.', '41. On 5 July 2009, after a visit from his mother and sister, the applicant’s son was found to be in possession of a bag containing forty-nine tablets, which had been hidden in a shampoo bottle. Because of this incident, as well as because of his lack of interest in education and drug rehabilitation, the applicant’s son was returned to Dob Prison on 20 July 2009.', '42. Following his return to Dob Prison, the applicant’s son was interviewed by a prison officer, who noted in a special questionnaire that he had a history of drug abuse and attempted suicide. The doctor who examined him noted that his medical condition remained unchanged. The applicant’s son was placed in a single cell 20 (7.4 square metres) in Block 1. The electric light in this cell was not functioning.', '43. On 23 July 2009 the drug abuse therapist held a consultation with the applicant’s son. The latter said that he wished to discontinue the substitution therapy, but did not want to participate in drug therapy or give urine samples. He also alleged that he had intended to use the tablets he had been found to possess in Koper Prison to “clean himself”.', '44. On 7 August 2009 the psychologist discussed a “personal plan” with the applicant’s son.', '45. On 9 August 2009 the applicant’s son lodged a request to be given leave to bring into his cell certain objects, such as an electric extension cable, a USB key and so on, which was granted on 10 August 2009.', '46. On 13 August 2009 the applicant was transferred to single cell 21 in Block 1, which was identical to cell 20 but had functioning electricity.', '47. During his stay in Dob Prison the applicant’s son sent thirty-seven letters and received nineteen packages. He had telephone contact with his father, his sister and the applicant. He was visited regularly by the applicant and by his sister. He was allowed to bring in his computer, radio, headphones, boxing equipment and so on. In the period between 15 December and 23 March 2009 the applicant’s son participated in the “Bridge to education” programme. He attended forty-eight hours of this course.', '48. On 14 August 2009, the technical facilities in the cell were inspected and the applicant’s son was given a DVD player, a night light and some other items for personal use brought in by his mother. Between 11.40 a.m. and midday the applicant telephoned his mother. Beforehand, while waiting for the telephone in the corridor, he was attacked by prisoner S.B. The security camera footage from the staircase area at the time of the attack, which was submitted to the Court, show that S.B. and the applicant’s son met at the stairs and that the former swung his hand towards the latter and grabbed or attempted to grab him, possibly around the neck. S.B. is then seen leaving, being followed by the guard who was rushing after him. These events took fourteen seconds.', '49. At 6.50 p.m., in the context of regular supervision when the guard changed, two guards on day duty entered cell no. 20 and saw the applicant’s son sitting smoking. They later said that the applicant’s son looked at them and greeted them and that he seemed normal, as he had earlier in the day. At 7.25 p.m. two guards from the night shift opened cell 20 for a nurse to deliver the prescribed medication. They found the applicant’s son hanging from a water pipe by his bed sheet. The nurse examined him and concluded that he was dead. At 7.40 p.m. a doctor arrived. Officers from a local police station arrived at the scene at around 8 p.m. The investigating judge on duty was informed of the incident but declined to attend. According to a report dated 15 August 2009 the doctor found that the applicant’s son had died as a result of suicide, that there were no signs of violence and that the cause of suicide was a depressive syndrome and drug addiction. The remains were taken to a hospital, where an autopsy was carried out.', '50. Immediately after the death of her son, the applicant requested the police to seize the applicant’s son’s personal file kept in the prison, which they did.', '51. Following the death of the applicant’s son, one report was prepared by M., head of security at Dob Prison, and another by a three-member commission formed within the Administration.', '52. The first report, which is dated 15 August 2009, concluded:', '“We regret the incident. The prisoner was a known drug addict when he started serving his sentence. Due to his drug addiction, the enforcement of the prison sentence was very difficult ... Due to his drug addiction, [the applicant’s son] soon got into trouble with other inmates and suffered mental difficulties.', 'It is our assessment that the treatment of the prisoner was lawful, respectful and professional ...', 'We believe that the prisoner’s suicide could not have been prevented, due to the complexity of his problems.”', '53. On 17 August 2008 the Head of the Administration appointed a three-member commission to investigate the circumstances of the applicant’s son’s death. The commission held interviews with the two prison guards who were on duty on the day of the suicide, the prison psychologist, certain prisoners, the nurse who was present at the scene of the suicide, the governor, and the Head of Unit 1, S.Ž,, and examined documents which remained available after the seizure. It issued a report on 28 August 2009. According to the report, the prison doctor and S.Ž. stated that the applicant’s son had not shown any suicidal tendencies. It noted that the applicant’s son had not reported the conflict he had with S.B. on the day of his death, which was only observed when the video recordings were inspected after the suicide. The commission concluded:', '“According to the assessment made by the commission, the treatment [of the applicant’s son] was lawful, respectful and professional. However, by his conduct and actions the prisoner contributed to several conflict situations, which the authorities could not entirely prevent. The fact that the prisoner was often transferred within the establishment as well as to Koper Prison demonstrates that efforts were made to ensure his safety....The commission also notes that the deceased never reported maltreatment by or conflicts with the prison staff. It was also denied by the prisoners heard by the commission that the deceased was maltreated, threatened or intimidated by prison staff.', 'On the basis of the established facts, the commission concludes that the [authorities of] Dob Prison could not have prevented the suicide of the deceased.”', '54. On 22 September 2009 the governor of Dob Prison sent the Administration an additional report, focusing on the conflict between the applicant’s son and S.B. It noted that the contact between the applicant’s son and S.B. took six seconds. Having regard to the statements of prison staff and a prisoner who were near the staircase at the time in question and did not observe or hear anything, as well as to the fact that the applicant’s son sustained no injuries, it was unlikely that S.B. had hit the applicant. The report also noted that the prison staff was of the opinion that there had been much more conflict going on than had actually been observed by them, and that some inmates claimed that the applicant’s son had debts amounting to a total of around EUR 5,000. According to the report, the telephone booths were situated near the staircase and inmates often encountered each other there. This was a known problem, and efforts to change the system were under way. The report suggested that it would have been easier for the applicant’s son to serve a sentence in a smaller prison and that a systemic solution to cases such as his would have been isolation from other inmates, which was legally and practically impossible at the material time.', '55. Previously, on 23 March 2009, the applicant had lodged a criminal complaint against the prisoners who had allegedly intimidated and beaten her son on several occasions. Her statement given to the police read, as far as relevant, as follows:', '“Simon started serving his sentence in 2008. He was placed in Building 2. There, he was intimidated by a prisoner called ... [S.B.], who would take his things (money and other things) and beat him (for example, every day he would wait for him outside the bathroom, slap him and demand that Simon give him everything he had). This was confirmed by another prisoner ... who shared a cell with Simon. [Further to complaints from Simon and another prisoner]... [S.B.] was transferred to Building 1 ... Simon was then beaten by a prisoner ... [D.M] on 9 February 2009 ... Immediately after that attack, Simon reported the incident to the prison guards and told them that he would cut his throat (this is what the administration told me). For that reason, Simon was put under video surveillance for twelve hours in a special room ... On 12 February 2009 Simon was moved to Building 1 and since then he has been afraid to leave the room ... He is afraid of ... [S.B and D.M.], who were also moved to this building ... so that now all three of them are there ...', 'I asked for a transfer for my son ... but was unsuccessful on the grounds that I failed to bring evidence showing that Simon was in danger.', 'I am very afraid for the safety of my son ... Simon is also very very afraid. I wish they would transfer him anywhere, just away from here, as he still has eighteen months to serve ...”', '56. The police forwarded the above criminal complaint to the Novo Mesto District Prosecutor (“the Prosecutor”). On 6 April 2009 the Prosecutor requested the police to collect evidence and requested that the case be examined as a priority. Subsequently, the police forwarded to him a report which included a statement by the applicant’s son. The latter told the officers that he had no interest in pursing the proceedings and that it was his father who had started them. On 14 August 2009 the Prosecutor again requested the police to collect evidence, in particular as regards the allegations concerning D.M. and a certain I.N., who was also mentioned by the applicant at some point. He instructed them to question the suspects as well as prison staff, and also to investigate what measures were being taken by the prison staff to monitor the applicant’s son and what the prison authorities’ findings were as regards the applicant’s son’s endangerment and debts.', '57. Following the applicant’s son’s death, on 14 August 2009 the police secured the evidence at the scene and ordered an autopsy. They took statement from, inter alia, the inmates who had had contact with the applicant’s son and seized the video recordings of his contact with S.B. on the day of the suicide. On 15 August 2009 the police interviewed the applicant. On the same day a hospital autopsy report was issued. It stated that there were no signs of violence on the applicant’s son’s body and found that the death had been caused by hanging.', '58. On 15 August 2009 the applicant complained to Trebnje Police Station about the conditions of her son’s detention, and alleged that she had not been taken seriously by prison officers, in particular the governor, J.P.', '59. On 17 August 2009 the applicant told Novo Mesto Police that a prisoner from Dob Prison had called her the previous day to tell her that her son had been attacked by another prisoner shortly before his suicide and that the prison officers had done nothing to stop the attack. She also alleged that her son had died in suspicious circumstances and that the head of Block 1, S.Ž., had intimidated her son. She further alleged that the authorities had not adequately responded to her warnings about the fragile mental state of her son and his risk of suicide. On the same day the applicant also went to Trebnje Police Station, where she alleged that her son had been beaten up prior to his death, that the head of Block 1, S.Ž., had threatened her son and had moved him to a cell with no amenities on 13 August 2009. She also alleged that governor J.P. performed his duties in a negligent manner. On the same day the investigating judge on duty ordered a new autopsy to be carried out by the Institute for Forensic Medicine to establish the exact cause of death, whether there were injuries on the body, and whether prompt help could have prevented the death.', '60. An autopsy report was prepared by the Institute for Forensic Medicine on 28 August 2009. It showed no injuries on the body which could have been caused by the use of violence; it noted suicide as the certain cause of death. It also noted that the applicant’s son was not under the influence of drugs and that the death could have been prevented only if he had been found no more than five minutes after the hanging.', '61. On 14 September 2009 the applicant alleged at the Novo Mesto District Prosecutor’s office that her son’s suicide had been caused by the extortion by S.B. and his attack on the day of her son’s death. She also alleged that the prison guards should be held responsible for the attack, which they could have prevented.', '62. On 15 September 2009 the Prosecutor ordered the police to collect evidence concerning the suspects referred to by the applicant, to conduct interviews with the prison guards and relevant inmates and to prepare a report concerning the video recordings.', '63. On 23 September 2009 the applicant reported to Ilirska Bistrica Police her suspicion that her son had been murdered in the prison. She said that her son took a large number of tablets, then lost consciousness and was hanged by the prison guards.', '64. On 8 October 2009 the Prosecutor sent a letter to police urging them to collect evidence, as previously requested by him. He emphasised the need for an extensive and thorough investigation of the allegations made by the applicant. He also stated that the investigation should be based on direct taking of evidence by police, and gave them certain instructions in this regard.', '65. On 23 October 2009 a forensic report was issued. It found that the fingerprints at the scene of the suicide were those of the applicant’s son.', '66. On 2 November 2009 the police submitted their report concerning the applicant’s allegations. It transpires from the report that the police had questioned, among others, the head of Block 1 S.Ž., the social worker N.B. and nine inmates. The report referred also to the findings of autopsy reports, the toxicological report, the applicant’s son’s prison file and his diary. It noted that the time of death was sometime between 6.50 p.m. and 7.25 p.m.', '67. On 19 November 2009 the Prosecutor requested that a criminal investigation be opened against S.B. concerning the criminal offence of extortion. His request was upheld by the investigating judge. A number of witnesses, including prisoners who knew the applicant’s son and the applicant, were heard. S.B. stated in those proceedings that the applicant’s son had sold everything he had for drugs and had borrowed money from co-inmates, but not from him. According to S.B., the applicant’s son, in order to get more money from his family, falsely reported to authorities that he and D.M. had been extorting money from him. This had had consequences for S.B. as he had been moved to Block 1 for eleven months. S.B. also admitted that he had met the applicant’s son at the staircase on the day of his death. He said that the applicant’s son had greeted him and that he in response had pushed him, saying that he did not have the right to greet him as he had been the reason for his transfer to Block 1. As there was insufficient evidence that S.B. had extorted money from the applicant’s son, and in particular there was insufficient proof that the applicant’s son had owed anything to S.B., the prosecutor eventually discontinued the proceedings (on 24 March 2010). The applicant subsequently took them over in her capacity as a subsidiary prosecutor. The proceedings are currently pending trial.', '68. On 19 November 2009 the Prosecutor requested the police to take further measures to investigate the allegations concerning the alleged lack of protection of the applicant’s son by prison staff and ill-treatment by fellow inmates, in particular I.N. and D.M. He also requested that the role of the prison governor J.P. be explored.', '69. On 16 December 2010 the police obtained a forensic report which indicated that the handwriting on the letter found next to the body was that of the applicant’s son.', '70. On 30 December 2009 and 1 and 25 February 2010 the applicant lodged further criminal complaints against named prisoners and prison officials, including the governor J.P. and the head of Block 1, S.Ž. She alleged, inter alia, that they had committed the criminal offence of negligence by denying her son access to psychiatric care. The Prosecutor subsequently requested the police to question the relevant prison staff with regard to these allegations.', '71. On 20 May 2010 the Prosecutor rejected the applicant’s criminal complaints concerning the criminal offences of extortion, endangering the security of a person, murder, abuse of office, violation of human dignity by abuse of power, and theft allegedly committed against the applicant’s son by fellow inmates or prison staff. The written reasons given for the Prosecutor’s decision, which is eighteen pages long, refer to, inter alia, statements by prisoners. While most of them did not indicate anything which would attract particular attention, two of them testified that the applicant’s son prior to his death had mentioned to them that he was unhappy about not having a television, and that he had said he did not feel well, but did not mention suicide. One also said that the applicant’s son had told him that he wanted to sue the Head of Block 1, S.Ž. Prisoner I.N. said that the applicant’s son had been addicted to heroin and spent EUR 40 to 50 on drugs per day. I.N. said that he had lent him EUR 470, and had taken his jacket as EUR 200 of it. The decision further refers to the analysis of the video recordings and to the limited contact between the applicant’s son and S.B. It also notes that S.B. was sanctioned in disciplinary proceedings for an attack on the applicant’s son. The decision moreover refers to statements by S.Ž., who said during questioning by the police that he had been in daily contact with the applicant’s son in the days preceding his death. After his return from Koper Prison, S.Ž. had not noticed any changes in his behaviour which would indicate that he was a suicide risk. According to S.Ž., the applicant’s son wished to stay in a single cell and the fact that there was no light in cell 20 did not appear to bother him. Moreover, he seemed content on 13 August 2009, after being moved to a new cell. S.Ž. also said that the applicant called the prison authorities on an almost daily basis, in particular before the applicant’s son’s transfer to Koper Prison, requesting her son’s transfer and claiming that he felt unsafe. On the basis of the evidence in the file, the Prosecutor concluded that S.B.’s behaviour had not caused the applicant’s son’s suicide. The Prosecutor also found that there was not the slightest indication that the applicant’s son had been murdered. Furthermore, he noted that his accommodation had been determined in the standard procedure and not at the discretion of S.Ž., that the prison staff had acted within their competences, and that S.Ž. and J.P. had tried to make the applicant’s son’s accommodation as comfortable as possible in the circumstances. He established that the applicant’s son had never been denied medical or psychiatric assistance. There was also no evidence of other acts alleged by the applicant, including the alleged extortion by I.N.', '72. The applicant, in the capacity of a subsidiary prosecutor, subsequently took over the prosecution in the above cases and lodged an indictment. The proceedings appear still to be pending.', '73. On 17 December 2010, the Prosecutor also rejected the applicant’s remaining criminal complaints (see paragraph 70 above), in particular those concerning alleged negligence at work aimed at certain prison personnel.', '74.

In 1994 and 1996 his heir (“the heir”) relinquished her rights as regards restitution of the property to the applicant before a notary public.', 'On 8 August 1989 the East Berlin City Council (Magistrat von Ostberlin) allowed the refurbishment of the building subject to expropriation of the property from its owner.', 'On 14 September 1989 the State Planning Commission of the GDR cabinet (Ministerrat der DDR) approved the refurbishment plans.', 'On 20 September 1989 the Central Office responsible for the International Trade in Licences requested that the property be expropriated; the compensation was set at 111,800 marks.', 'On 25 January 1990 the Inner Berlin Borough Council (Rat des Stadtbezirks Mitte) expropriated the property from its owner with effect from 1 March 1990 and transferred the property to the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The undated decision to expropriate the property was signed and sealed. The applicant contested that the expropriation had taken place on that date.', 'On 9 March 1990 the Ministry of Foreign Trade sold the building built on the property to a public holding (“the holding”) for 245,443.60 marks. On 13 March 1990 the ownership of the property was transferred to the holding. The holding had been founded on 26 January 1990 and had been registered in the register of public enterprises (Register der volkseigenen Wirtschaft) on 9 February 1990. On 28 June 1990 the holding requested to be registered as a limited company in the course of incorporation; the company was dissolved with effect from 31 December 1992.', 'The Court has summarised the political background to the dissolution of the GDR in the case of Streletz, Kessler and Krenz v. Germany ([GC], nos. 34044/96, 35532/97 and 44801/98, § 17, ECHR 2001II) as follows:', '“In autumn 1989 the flight of thousands of citizens of the GDR to the FRG’s embassies in Prague and Warsaw, and to Hungary, which had opened its border with Austria on 11 September 1989, demonstrations by tens of thousands of people in the streets of Dresden, Leipzig, East Berlin and other cities, and the restructuring and openness campaign conducted in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Gorbachev (perestroika and glasnost) precipitated the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989, the collapse of the system in the GDR and the process that was to lead to the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990.”', 'On 18 October 1989 the Secretary-General of the Socialist Unity Party’s Central Committee, Mr E. Honecker, stepped down and was replaced by Mr E. Krenz. Especially after the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 the GDR was in an ever-increasing state of dissolution.', 'On 26 January 1990 the Under-Secretary of State in the GDR’s Ministry of Finance and Prices wrote to the First Deputies to the Borough Councils and admonished them to comply with the rules of regulations governing expropriations from owners living outside the GDR, namely, that the latter should be kept correctly informed of and allowed to participate in proceedings concerning their property. On 3 October 1990, the date of the German reunification, the Convention entered into force on the territory of the new Länder.', 'On 20 September 1990 the heir applied for rights under the Act on the Regulation of Outstanding Property Issues/ Property Act (Gesetz zur Regelung offener Vermögensfragen/ Vermögensgesetz – hereinafter the “Property Act”, see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below). On 4 September 1992 the Office for the Resolution of Outstanding Property Issues ordered that the public administration of the property be lifted.', 'On 22 December 1992 the property rights were administratively allocated to the holding pursuant to the Act on the Allocation of Former Public Property (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below); this decision became final on 16 December 1994 after the Berlin Administrative Court had dismissed the heir’s claim.', 'On 21 January 1993 the heir was listed as owner in the land register on the basis of the heir’s certificate. The registration had no effect on the ongoing proceedings.', 'On 11 January 1994 the order that the public administration be lifted was revoked following an administrative appeal by the holding in dissolution; on 5 September 1996 the Federal Administrative Court upheld the decision.', 'On 4 December 1995 the property was administratively allocated to the Fiduciary Office’s property holding (Treuhandliegenschaftsgesellschaft) as successor to the holding.', 'On 14 February 1996 the holding in dissolution was registered as its owner in the land register.', 'On 29 December 1992 the Berlin Mitte District Court granted the holding’s request for an interim objection to the predecessor’s listing as owner of the property in the land register.', 'On 5 November 1993 the Berlin Court of Appeal, 15th Civil Senate, quashed the decision of the District Court and refused the request on the ground that the holding had not established that it had become the owner of the property. The Court of Appeal noted that the expropriation by the GDR authorities had clearly been carried out in complete administrative disarray, likely caused by the then imminent German reunification. The decision to expropriate the property from the predecessor had been undated, the form had not been properly filled out and the note that the decision had become final had not been in conformity with standard practice. The expropriation procedure had furthermore violated theprovisions for the basic legal protection of property owners under GDR law, for the GDR authorities had not contacted the heir, as the owner, and had not ascertained whether the predecessor had died, although this would have been possible after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Court of Appeal concluded that the GDR authorities had deliberately excluded the heir from the proceedings in order to finalise the expropriation before the German reunification on 3 October 1990.', 'On 30 November 1994 the holding handed the property over to the heir without prejudice to the ownership of the property.', 'The heir then requested in the main proceedings that she be declared theowner of the property. The holding brought a counter-claim for it to be declared the owner. The Berlin Regional Court dismissed the heir’s request and granted the counter-claim on the grounds that the holding had become the owner by virtue of the decision that had administratively assigned the property to it and which had become final on 16 December 1994 (see above).', 'On 21 February 1997 the Berlin Court of Appeal, 21st civil senate, dismissed the heir’s appeal and ordered her to return the property in exchange for the return of a bond of 1.3 million German marks she had deposited with the respondent. The Court of Appeal held that the expropriation by the GDR authorities had been lawful. In particular, the public administrator had been informed of the expropriation.', 'On 29 January 1998 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the heir’s appeal on points of law.', 'On 11 June 1998 the Office for the Resolution of Outstanding Property Issues ordered that the property be returned to the applicant against the payment of compensation on the grounds that the applicant’s predecessor had suffered a property loss within the meaning of section 1(1) (b) of the Property Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below).', 'On 10 April 2000 the Office for the Resolution of Outstanding Property Issues dismissed the Fiduciary Office’s administrative appeal.', 'On 15 December 2005 the Berlin Administrative Court set aside the restitution order on the grounds that the heir had not been entitled to restitution of the property. The property had not been expropriated without compensation (section 1(1) (a) of the Property Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below)) because in principle the owner could have been compensated under the laws and the state practice of the GDR. Furthermore, the property had not been expropriated for less compensation than citizens of the GDR would have been entitled to (section 1(1) (b) of the Property Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below)). According to the caselaw of the Federal Administrative Court this provision was only applicable to expropriations for which the former owner had deliberately been granted less than a citizen of the GDR would have had; following the entering into force of the decree on prices no. 3/87 in 1987, which had been applicable in the present case, owners living in West Germany were no longer systematically discriminated against in calculating the compensation due. Lastly, the property had not been taken by unfair means (section (1)(3) of the Property Act (see “Relevant domestic law and practice” below)); in particular, expressly relying on the case-law of the Federal Administrative Court, the Berlin Administrative Court held that the property had not been taken for a purpose other than the one stated, that its transfer into public property before transferring it to the holding had not been unfair, that the fact that the owner that was listed in the land register had already died had no bearing on the fairness of the expropriation proceedings, and that the property had been expropriated before 26 January 1990. As regards the Berlin Administrative Court observed that the GDR authorities had been of the opinion that the owner of the property did not have to be informed about the expropriation according to the GDR law as practised by its authorities, since the property had been subjected to public administration.', 'On 21 September 2006 the Federal Administrative Court refused leave to appeal on points of law and noted, inter alia, that it was not decisive that the Federal Court of Justice had previously held that the deliberate exclusion of the owner living in the FRG from the expropriation proceedings by the GDR authorities after 18 November 1989 had resulted in the expropriation being void. The Federal Administrative Court noted that any difference in opinion between the two federal courts had no bearing on the applicant’s case because the Berlin Administrative Court had conclusively established that the GDR authorities had been of the opinion that they had not needed to inform the owner of the expropriation proceedings; the GDR authorities had accordingly not deliberately excluded the owner from them.', 'On 14 February 2007 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the applicant’s constitutional complaint for adjudication (no. 1 BvR 2899/06).', 'Pursuant to Article 19 of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic concerning the German Reunification - Reunification Treaty (Vertrag zwischen der Bundesrepublik Deutschland und der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik über die Herstellung der Einheit Deutschlands – Einigungsvertrag), administrative acts by the authorities of the GDR prior to reunification remain in force. Such acts may be repealed if they are incompatible with the principles of the rule of law or the Reunification Treaty.', 'A former owner may request restitution of property (section 3 of the Property Act) that was expropriated in the GDR if the property was expropriated without compensation (section 1(1) (a) of the Property Act), with less compensation than a GDR citizen would have been entitled to (section 1(1) (b) of the Property Act), if the state administrator sold the property or if the nationalised property was sold to third persons (section 1(1) (c) of the Property Act), or if the property was taken by unfair means, such as the misuse of power, corruption, coercion or deceit (section (1)(3) of the Property Act).', 'According to this provision, the validity of expropriations that lead to the transfer of property into public property shall be determined in view of the law in force at the time of the expropriation. Expropriations are invalid if the property could not have been transferred into public property or if the transfer was plainly irreconcilable with the rule of law (mit rechtsstaatlichen Grundsätzen schlechthin unvereinbar) because of serious violations of the rule of law or of the principle of proportionality or because the expropriation had been arbitrary.', 'The relevant authority may decide to allocate former public property following a procedure in which all interested parties have had the right to participate. Property rights of third persons such as ownership and specifically named rights of interested parties are not affected by this decision (section 2(1) of the Act on the Allocation of Former Public Property – Gesetz über die Feststellung der Zuordnung von ehemals volkseigenem Vermögen).', 'In a judgment of 28 April 1999 (no. 8 C 5/98, published in BVerwGE, vol. 109, p. 81 et seq.), the Federal Administrative Court held that expropriations by the GDR authorities in flagrant violation of the pertinent provisions of the GDR law amounted to a taking by unfair means (section (1)(3) of the Property Act) if the expropriation took place after 26 January 1990, the date of the letter of the Under-Secretary of State in the GDR’s Ministry of Finance and Prices to the First Deputies to the Borough Councils.', 'In a judgment of 12 December 2001 (no. 8 C 10/01), the Federal Administrative Court held that the assessment whether the GDR authorities expropriated using unfair means within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Property Act was to be conducted on a case by case basis if the expropriation took place between 18 October 1989 – the date Mr Honecker stepped down – and 26 January 1990, the date of the aforementioned letter of the Under-Secretary of State in the GDR’s Ministry of Finance and Prices. Only after 26 January 1990 the GDR administrative practice could be assumed to comply with the relevant procedural requirements of GDR law, and thus flagrant procedural shortcomings could result in a taking using unfair means.', 'In a judgment of 12 May 2000 (no. V ZR 47/99) the Federal Court of Justice held that as a general rule, expropriations by the GDR authorities after 18 October 1989 had used unfair means within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Property Act if the owner living in the FRG had been deliberately excluded from the expropriation proceedings; in such a case the owner had not lost the property and was entitled to be registered as owner in the land register.', 'In a judgment of 25 July 2003 (no. V ZR 362/02) the Federal Court of Justice held that an owner could pursue a claim to be reinstated as owner in the land register if the GDR authorities’ expropriation order had not become effective, regardless of whether the taking had been accomplished by using unfair means within the meaning of section 1(3) of the Property Act. The Federal Court of Justice noted that it did not depart from the jurisprudence of the Federal Administrative Court in a decisive manner and therefore did not need to refer the question as to the date on which expropriations by the GDR authorities became plainly irreconcilable with the rule of law.', 'Pursuant to Article 95(3) of the Basic Law a Common Senate (Gemeinsamer Senat der obersten Gerichtshöfe) of the Federal Court of Justice, the Federal Administrative Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Labour Court and the Federal Tax Court shall be established to preserve the uniformity of decisions. The Common Senate decides the legal question that is disputed between senates of different federal courts if they cannot agree on a common interpretation following a procedure laid down in the Act on the Preservation of the Unity of the Federal Courts’ Jurisprudence (Gesetz zur Wahrung der Einheitlichkeit der Rechtsprechung der oberten Gerichtshöfe des Bundes).

001-57574,ENG,SWE,CHAMBER,1976,CASE OF SCHMIDT AND DAHLSTRÖM v. SWEDEN,2,No violation of Art. 11;No violation of Art. 14+11,,"['8. The applicants are Swedish citizens. Mr. Folke Schmidt is a professor of law at the University of Stockholm and Mr. Hans Dahlström is an officer in the Swedish Army.', '9. The applicants are members of trade unions affiliated to two of the main federations representing Swedish State employees, namely the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation, abbreviated to SACO) in the case of Mr. Schmidt and the National Federation of State Employees (Statstjänstemännens Riksförbund, abbreviated to SR) in the case of Mr. Dahlström.', 'In 1971, after expiry of one collective agreement and during negotiations for a new agreement, the applicants’ unions called selective strikes not affecting the sectors in which worked the applicants, who thus did not come out on strike. Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Dahlström complain that on conclusion of the new agreement, they, as members of the ""belligerent"" unions, were denied certain retroactive benefits paid to members of other trade unions and to non-union employees who had not participated in the strikes.', 'General background', '10. For more than a hundred years, workers and employers in the private sector in Sweden have traditionally enjoyed the right to form and join trade unions and associations and to take action in defence of their occupational interests without interference by the State.', 'Certain principles of labour law which had evolved in practice were codified in 1928 and 1936 by the following legislation:', '(i) the 1928 Collective Agreements Act (lag om kollektivavtal);', '(ii) the 1928 Labour Court Act (lag om arbetsdomstol); and', '(iii) the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate (lag om förenings-och förhandlingsrätt).', '11. The 1928 Collective Agreement Act deals with collective labour agreements between employers or employers’ associations and trade unions. It specifies in particular the legal effects of such agreements. For example, the parties may not take strike or lock-out action in regard to an issue regulated by a collective agreement in force between them.', '12. The 1928 Labour Court Act contained rules governing the composition, jurisdiction and procedure of the Labour Court. The Labour Court was competent to hear cases of alleged violation of the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate. It also had jurisdiction in disputes relating to the interpretation or application of collective agreements, but proceedings could only be brought by a party to the agreement in issue. Unions or non-union employees to whom such an agreement had been made applicable (paragraph 17 below) were obliged to bring their disputes before the ordinary courts or administrative courts, as the case might be.', '13. The above-mentioned Act of 1936 guarantees two distinct rights to the parties on the labour market, namely the right to organise and the right to negotiate.', 'The right to organise is defined in Section 3 of the Act as being the right of employers and employees to belong to an employers’ organisation or a trade union, to exercise their rights as members of that organisation or union, and to work for an organisation or a union or for the formation of an organisation or a union, without interference or pressure by the other party. The Act specifies that the right to organise shall be considered as being violated ""if measures are taken either by employers or by employees to constrain any employee or employer, as the case may be, to refrain from becoming a member of, or to resign from, an association, to refrain from exercising his rights as a member of an association, or to refrain from working for an association or for the formation of an association, and likewise if measures are taken either by employers or by employees calculated to cause prejudice to an employee or employer, as the case may be, on the ground that such employee or employer is a member of an association, exercises his rights as a member of an association or works for an association or for the formation of an association"".', 'The only way in which such associations enjoy the protection of the Act is that they may be awarded damages if the other party violates the right to organise of an individual member in such a way that the violation is to be regarded as intervention in the affairs of the association.', 'The right to negotiate is defined in Section 4 of the 1936 Act as being ""the right to institute negotiations regarding conditions of employment or relations between employers and employees in general"". It imposes on the other party an obligation to enter into negotiations, to attend meetings for negotiations and, where necessary, to make proposals for the settlement of the issues involved. This provision is applicable to all trade unions.', '14. Prior to 1966, the State determined the wages and conditions of employment of its employees in the event of a breakdown of the negotiations between the State and the employees.', 'As from 1 January 1966, the 1965 State Officials Act (statstjänstemannalag) has virtually assimilated State employees to employees in the private sector as regards trade union rights, strikes, lock-outs, etc. The Act made the 1928 Collective Agreement Act, the 1928 Labour Court Act and the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate applicable in the public sector. Furthermore, the Act provided for collective agreements to be concluded, subject to certain exceptions, between the National Collective Bargaining Office (Statens Avtalsverk, hereinafter referred to as ""the Office""), representing the State as employer, and the organisations of State employees. The Ministry of Finance has a nominee on the governing board of the Office.', '15. The 1965 legislative reform was facilitated by the centralised structure of the Swedish trade union movement; one factor which greatly contributed to its adoption was the conclusion in December 1965 of a Basic Agreement on Negotiations’ Procedure (slottsbacksavtalet) between the Office and the four main trade union organisations of State employees, namely:', '(i) the State Employees’ Union (Statsanställdas Förbund, abbreviated to SF and known prior to 1 July 1970 as Statstjänarkartellen),', '(ii) the National Federation of State Employees (SR),', '(iii) the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (SACO),', '(iv) the Civil Servants Section of the Central Organisation of Salaried Employees (Tjänstemännens Centralorganisations Statstjänstemannasektion, abbreviated to TCO-S).', 'According to the information at the disposal of the Court, these federations represent the large majority of Swedish State employees: more than 450,000 out of the 500,000 whose terms of employment are negotiated by the Office. About forty trade unions are affiliated to these organisations. The few independent trade unions represent only about 2,000 State employees in all.', 'Insofar as they are union members at all, university teachers and army officers generally belong to SACO and SR respectively. These two organisations, which are respectively open to staff possessing a university degree or the school leaving certificate (the equivalent of the baccalauréat), recently merged after the case had been brought before the Commission.', 'According to the trade unions’ own published figures, the number of SACO members in respect of whom the Office conducts collective negotiations was about 48,800 in 1971 and 1972; it rose to 51,800 in 1973 and was between 53,600 and 53,700 at the end of 1974. The university teachers’ union affiliated to SACO had between 1,800 and 1,900 members in 1971, between 1,900 and 2,000 in 1972, between 2,100 and 2,200 in 1973 and between 2,300 and 2,400 at the end of 1974. SR had 19,200 members in 1971, 19,800 in 1972 and about 20,000 at the end of 1973. The army officers’ union affiliated to SR had between 6,900 and 7,000 members in 1971, 7,300 in 1972 and between 7,400 and 7,500 at the end of 1973; it would appear that in August 1975 its membership had fallen to about 7,100 or 7,200.', '16. Clause 4 of the above-mentioned Basic Agreement provides that negotiations with a view to concluding a collective agreement shall be conducted on the employees’ behalf by the ""main organisation"" concerned, unless the Office and the ""main organisation"" agree otherwise.', '17. The Royal Order of 30 June 1965 relating to Certain Public Collective Agreements (KK om vissa statliga kollektivavtal m.m.) includes the following provisions:', '""Collective agreements as to such conditions of employment or service as are determined by the King-in-Council or by Parliament shall be concluded conditionally on the agreement being sanctioned by the King-in-Council.""', '""An Authority which is bound by a collective agreement shall apply the provisions of the agreement to any employee within the occupational group and region to which the agreement refers, notwithstanding that the employee is not covered by the agreement or by any other applicable collective agreement.""', '18. Collective agreements in Sweden are normally concluded for a period of two or three years. For various reasons, however, the new collective agreement is often concluded some time after the previous agreement has expired. In such cases, the new agreement has often specifically provided that its terms shall apply retroactively as from the date of expiry of the previous agreement. In the case of a strike during the bargaining period, on the other hand, employers - both in the public and private sector - have customarily refused to grant retroactive benefits in order to deter unions from taking industrial action in the future (application of the principle that ""a strike destroys retroactivity"").', '19. Negotiations in the public sector of the labour market are centralised in that they are conducted by the federations on behalf of their member unions. Moreover, strikes and other collective action may not be taken by the different trade unions independently but rather on the basis of a decision by, or after receiving the approval of, the federation concerned, which chooses and designates in accordance with its pre-arranged policy or tactics those of its members who are to take part in the action. According to the present practice, the negotiations between the Office and the federations result in one single agreement which regulates the increase in salaries, the grading of different categories of employees, working hours, various salary allowances, etc., and which applies, as a result of Article 4 of the Order referred to above (paragraph 17), to all categories of State employees, including those who are not represented by the federations. The agreement is normally signed by all the federations.', 'The question whether an individual employee has any means of challenging his union’s decision to go on strike is a matter exclusively governed by the internal rules of the union concerned. These may provide for a right to ask for a secret ballot or for other rights to object to the union’s decisions to take industrial action.', '20. The law described above at paragraphs 10 to 17 has in recent years undergone various changes which, being subsequent to the facts at issue, are not relevant for the present case.', 'Facts of the particular case', '21. In 1969 a global agreement for the years 1969 and 1970 was concluded by the Office and the four federations. When this period expired on 31 December 1970, the parties were still engaged in negotiations regarding the new global agreement. No agreement was reached and a Commission of Conciliation was appointed, but negotiations before it broke down as well. Consequently, SACO and SR proclaimed selective strikes which became effective on 5 February 1971 and involved about 4,000 members. This resort to strike action, which was quite lawful (see paragraphs 11 and 14 above), did not apply to university teachers or the Army so that neither Mr. Schmidt nor Mr. Dahlström took any part in the strikes.', 'The Office retaliated and, on 19 February 1971, about 30,000 members of SACO and SR were locked out. This affected all university teachers belonging to SACO, including Mr. Schmidt, and some officers belonging to SR, but not Mr. Dahlström. New strikes and lock-outs were proclaimed, but did not become effective. On 12 March 1971, an Act was promulgated which gave the King-in-Council power to order the prolongation of certain collective agreements for a period of six weeks, but not extending beyond 25 April 1971, provided that collective industrial action threatened vital public interests. By virtue of this Act the previous collective agreement was reinstated on 13 March 1971 for a period of six weeks and all strikes and lock-outs terminated forthwith.', '22. Subsequent negotiations before the Commission of Conciliation resulted in June 1971 in a new global agreement for the years 1971 to 1973. According to this agreement, certain posts were upgraded and the salary scales were generally increased retroactively as from 1 January 1971. Clause 18, however, provided for an exception in this respect:', '""Officials who were members between 1 January and 12 March 1971 (or any part of this period) of organisations that organised industrial action for any part of this period, shall not be entitled from 1 January to 12 March 1971 to the increased wage benefits applicable under the agreement, unless the Collective Bargaining Office decides otherwise. This declaration also concerns other officials if they took part in any such industrial action.""', '23. The agreement was only signed by TCO-S and SF. SACO and SR refused since they considered the terms unacceptable. The agreement, and in particular clause 18, was nevertheless applied to their members by virtue of Article 4 of the above-mentioned Royal Order (paragraph 17).', 'According to the applicants, during the negotiations SF and TCO-S had urged that the non-retroactivity clause should not be included in the agreement and expressed the opinion that it properly belonged to an agreement between the State and the two organisations concerned, SACO and SR. SF and TCO-S declared this expressly and inserted a reservation in the record before putting their signatures to the agreement. TCO-S had, however, attempted to entice to itself some members of SACO, which was in its opinion a purposeless organisation, and had in fact written to the applicant Schmidt in this vein.', '24. As a result of the agreement, members of SACO and SR, insofar as they were upgraded, did not receive the higher salary for the period from 1 January 1971 to 12 March 1971, nor did they benefit from the general increase in the salary scales during the same period, regardless of whether or not they had been on strike. State employees who were not members of SACO or SR but who had all the same participated in the strike, were also refused the benefit of retroactivity.', 'The exception clause applied to both applicants as members of SACO and SR, even though they themselves had not gone on strike at all. Mr. Schmidt was affected for the period from 1 January to 19 February 1971, being the date when he was locked out and thus deprived of his salary. Mr. Dahlström, who was upgraded under the new agreement, was affected for the whole period up to 12 March 1971. During these periods the applicants performed work for a lower salary than that paid to other employees who were in the same salary brackets but not members of SACO or SR. Their financial losses amounted to Kr. 300 and Kr. 1,000 respectively.', '25. Mr. Schmidt, following the conclusion of the collective agreement, gave notice to the Office that, through his special treatment in regard to wages, his right to organise had been violated. When the Office nevertheless refused him the benefit of retroactivity, SACO and SR brought an action against the State before the Labour Court under the 1936 Act on the Right to Organise and Negotiate, seeking on behalf of the applicants (and a third person who was also a member of SR), inter alia:', '(i) a declaration that the measures taken by the Office constituted a violation of the applicants’ right to organise and that this involved an interference with the affairs of SACO and SR;', '(ii) a declaration that clause 18 of the agreement of June 1971 was of no effect in regard to the applicants;', '(iii) an order that the State pay compensation to the applicants for financial loss and infringement of their right to organise.', 'SACO and SR asserted that the State had infringed their members’ right to organise as guaranteed in Section 3 of the 1936 Act since, with regard to retroactive wage benefits, they were subjected to special treatment in comparison with members of TCO-S and SF and non-union officials. The Office denied any such infringement since members of SACO and SR had been refused the benefit of retroactivity only for the reason that the State wanted to maintain the principle that ""a strike destroys retroactivity"". A comparison between SACO and SR members, on the one side, and members of TCO-S and SF and non-union officials, on the other, did not provide any basis for the conclusion that the State acted on such a basis or with such a purpose as was envisaged by Section 3 of the 1936 Act.', '26. In its judgment of 22 December 1971, the Labour Court unanimously rejected the claim of the applicants’ unions. The Court first confirmed the parties’ common view that the right to organise did not exclude the possibility for the State to enforce the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity. The adoption of such a position, and its enforcement after a conflict, were not to be regarded in themselves as an attack on the right to organise. Furthermore, the employer’s duty to respect this right did not include any obligation in principle to pay equal wages to union and non-union employees or to members of different organisations. The mere fact that different wages were accorded to different groups of employees did not by itself lead to the conclusion that a measure violating Section 3 had been employed. However, any favouring either of members of the organisation which reached agreement or of non-union employees, with the aim of exercising against the members of the other organisation the type of pressure envisaged in Section 3, would constitute a violation of that provision.', 'The Court then found that no such purpose on the part of the State could be established. In particular, no support had appeared for the idea that the State intended to induce members of SACO and SR to switch over to TCO-S and SF. In this context, the Court assumed that the latter organisations would also have been refused retroactivity if they had organised industrial action during the process of negotiations.', 'With respect to non-union employees the Court found that the reason why they were granted a special benefit had nothing to do with their position as being non-union. Any procedure designed to refuse the benefit of retroactivity generally to non-union employees in sectors where SACO and SR were dominant or representative obviously could have become very complicated and time-consuming. Moreover, no recognised norms existed for determining such sectors, and the concept of representation was ambiguous and disputed. The Court then referred to the State’s failure to negotiate an agreement which would exclude retroactivity to all non-union employees within the sectors in which SACO and SR were representative. In this respect the Court considered that the facts of the case did not support the conclusion that this failure showed any intention on the part of the State to violate the right to organise. Otherwise, the State would, as soon as one federation organised industrial action, be barred from upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity in any other way than by refusing retroactive validity for agreements concluded with respect to all employee organisations. Such a general limitation of the State’s possibilities of upholding the principle could not be based on Section 3 of the 1936 Act.', 'In the case before it, the Court did not consider the granting of retroactive benefits to non-union employees who had not been on strike as proof of any purpose to violate the right to organise. In the Court’s opinion, the parties had not been able to present anything more than quite uncertain information on the total number of non-union officials or on their field of employment. The Court indicated that the plaintiffs’ view concerning the State’s purpose in its treatment of non-union officials might have appeared more reasonable if it had been possible to show that the large majority of non-union officials were active within the main field of activity of SACO and SR. Conversely, it would be less reasonable to take notice of the treatment of the group of non-union officials if these could primarily be classified within the field of recruitment of SF and TCO-S. The uncertainty in regard to these circumstances argued, in the Court’s conclusion, in favour of the States declaration that its purpose did not extend beyond upholding the principle that a strike destroys retroactivity.', '27. In their application, lodged with the Commission on 9 June 1972, the applicants complained that in the particular circumstances the implementation of the Government’s policy regarding payment of retroactive benefits had amounted to preferential treatment, in particular in comparison with non-union employees, and had consequently violated Article 11 (art. 11) of the Convention.', 'The Commission declared the application admissible by a decision of 18 October 1972.', 'During the examination of the merits, the applicants relied on Article 11 (art. 11) and also Article 14, read in conjunction with Article 11 (art. 14+11).', '28. In its report of 17 July 1974, the Commission:', '(i) confirmed its opinion, previously expressed in the report in the Swedish Engine Drivers’ Union case, that Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1) may legitimately extend to cover State responsibility in the field of labour-management relations and thus to provide some protection for unions against interference by employers;', '(ii) expressed the opinion:', '- by nine votes to one with one abstention, that the Government’s policy of denying retroactive benefits to non-striking members of belligerent unions did not in the circumstances infringe the applicants’ right, under Article 11 para. 1 (art. 11-1), to form and join the trade unions;', '- that in view of the preceding finding, the Commission was not called upon to examine whether the action complained of was justified under Article 11 para. 2 (art. 11-2);', '- by eight votes to one with two abstentions, that the differential treatment complained of was in the circumstances justified as an industrial relations policy and that there had been no violation of Article 14 read in conjunction with Article 11 para. 1 (art. 14+11-1).', 'The report contains a separate concurring opinion.']",[],[],[],"['11', '14']",[],[],0

She distributed a leaflet containing her curriculum vitae, which mentioned her career as an athlete in the national team of the German Democratic Republic and that she had won several international tournaments. Also, the applicant listed in the leaflet her fees for a first legal consultation, depending on the value in dispute, in matters concerning private litigation and, depending on the duration of the consultation, in matters concerning family law, labour law and criminal law. Her highest fee was 333 German marks (DEM). At the bottom of the list, she put an asterisked footnote that the highest fee for a first consultation permitted under the applicable law, then the Federal Scale of Fees for Lawyers (Bundesrechtsanwaltsgebührenordnung), was DEM 350. The latter fee was therefore higher than any of the fees the applicant had listed.', 'Another lawyer who practised in the same town as the applicant lodged an application for interim measures, and as a result the Leipzig Regional Court provisionally ordered, in a judgment of 7 November 2001, the applicant to refrain from referring to her former sports career in her advertising and from listing her fees for first legal consultations on matters of family and labour law with the above-mentioned footnote. An appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the Dresden Court of Appeal on 5 February 2002.', 'In the main proceedings, by judgment of 17 April 2002, the Leipzig Regional Court repeated the above order and included an order to refrain from listing in the footnote to the leaflet the fees for all first legal consultations, subject to a fine of 250,000 euros (EUR) for non-observance of the order. It based the claimant’s request for an injunction (Unterlassungsanspruch) on sections 1 and 3 of the Unfair Competition Act in conjunction with section 43b of the Federal Lawyers Act (see relevant domestic law section). The Leipzig Regional Court reasoned that lawyers were only allowed to use factual information whose form and content was connected with the profession in their advertising. It reasoned that the reference to her former sports career lacked any such connection with her profession as a lawyer.', 'As to the list of her legal fees containing the asterisked footnote, it noted that the applicant had made a comparison between her fees for a first legal consultation and the fees permitted under the applicable law. Ordinary citizens however would not be aware that the applicable law gave lawyers the discretion to charge a fee for a first consultation ranging between a tenth of that fee and the full amount, and that the fees varied according to the value in dispute. After comparing the applicant’s fees with the amount mentioned in the footnote, an ordinary citizen would assume that any other lawyer might charge DEM 350 for a first legal consultation, whereas the maximum fee the applicant charged was DEM 333. Therefore, the leaflet might give the impression that the applicant’s fees were normally lower than the fees of those lawyers who used the full discretion permitted under the applicable law. The Leipzig Regional Court noted however that this was not the case, pointing out that some of the applicant’s fees for lower values in dispute were considerably higher than the fees permitted under the applicable law. It also pointed out that the footnote referred to a fee of DEM 350 without mentioning that this was the full fee for consultations only for disputes with a value above DEM 10,000. Therefore, ordinary clients could be misled into assuming that the fee of DEM 350 applied to all values in dispute and that the applicant’s fees were normally lower than the fees permitted under the applicable law. Therefore, the list with the footnote had to be considered “misleading advertising” within the meaning of section 3 of the Unfair Competition Act.', 'On 27 September 2002, the Dresden Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal lodged by the applicant. It reasoned that, contrary to the applicant’s submission, she had not generally been prohibited from mentioning her fees in her advertising. It was the specific form of the advertisement in conjunction with the footnote that had been regarded as misleading by the Leipzig Regional Court.', 'On 4 August 2003 the Federal Constitutional Court partly quashed the judgments of the Leipzig Regional Court of 29 May 2002 and of the Dresden Court of Appeal of 27 August 2002 in so far as they concerned the prohibition on referring to the applicant’s sports career in the leaflet. It took the view that, because the applicant partly specialised in legal disputes concerning sports, the reference did have a direct connection to her profession. Therefore, the prohibition violated the applicant’s freedom to choose a profession under Article 12 of the German Basic Law. With regard to the prohibition on listing her fees in the asterisked footnote, the Federal Constitutional Court refused to admit the constitutional complaint for adjudication. It found that Article 12 of the Basic Law included advertising for professional services, and that the professions were allowed to advertise as long as they provided factual information which was not misleading. It was not objectionable from a constitutional point of view that the domestic courts had regarded the list with the asterisked footnote as misleading and that they had interpreted that list in context and from the perspective of an ordinary citizen. By using the footnote, the applicant had made a comparison between her “prices” and the highest fees permitted under the applicable law. It could not be regarded as erroneous that the domestic courts had found that an ordinary citizen (who would not make complicated calculations) would assume by mistake that the applicant was normally less expensive. The Unfair Competition Act protected not only other competitors, but also the general public, from unfair competition. It was not decisive that there had not been malpractice on the part of the applicant.', 'The applicant received the decision of the Federal Constitutional Court on 20 August 2003.', 'Relevant provisions of the Unfair Competition Act (Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb):', '“Any person who, in the course of business activity and for purposes of competition, commits acts contrary to honest practices may be enjoined from performing these acts and held liable for damages.”', '“Any person who, in the course of business activity and for purposes of competition, makes misleading statements concerning business matters, in particular concerning the nature, the origin, or the manner of manufacture, or the pricing of individual goods or commercial services or of the offer as a whole, concerning price lists, the manner or the source of acquisition of goods, concerning the possession of awards, concerning the occasion or purpose of sale, or concerning the size of the available stock, may be enjoined from making such statements.”', 'Relevant provision of the Federal Lawyers Act (Bundesrechtsanwalts-ordnung):', '“A lawyer is only permitted to advertise his/her services in as far as the advertising in question provides factual information concerning the form and the nature of the professional services and as long as it is not aimed at soliciting specific instructions or a specific brief.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

LITHUANIA,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;David Thór Björgvinsson;Françoise Tulkens;Giorgio Malinverni;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque,"['The applicant, Mr Virginijus Česnulevicius, is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1956 and lives in Vilnius.', 'In 1990, after the Republic of Lithuania had re-established independence, the applicant and J.U. started working at the Department of National Defence (Krašto apsaugos departamentas).', 'On the evening of 12 January 1991 the Soviet army launched military operations against Lithuania. Soviet troops entered the television tower of Vilnius and the headquarters of Lithuanian public television, and also tried to take the Lithuanian parliament. Massive crowds of Lithuanian citizens came to the rescue of the institutions of the newly independent Lithuania. Thirteen Lithuanian civilians were killed and hundreds injured during the clash with the Soviet army (see Ždanoka v. Latvia [GC], no. 58278/00, § 20, ECHR 2006IV). At the time of the events, the applicant and J.U. were on the premises of the Lithuanian parliament building, where they worked as guards.', 'In 2004 a publishing house released a book by J.U. According to the applicant, it contained false and defamatory information about him.', 'On 12 July 2004 the applicant addressed the publishing house requesting the opportunity to respond critically to the content of the book. In his letter to the publisher the applicant described J.U. negatively and criticised J.U.’s actions during the events of January 1991. The applicant’s letter contained allegations that J.U. had deserted his post at the barricades of the Parliament building and that he had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a gun.', 'Following these events, on 2 March 2005 J.U. brought a private prosecution against the applicant for defamation. The applicant made a counterclaim, alleging that J.U. had defamed him in his private prosecution statement.', 'The applicant states that during the initial examination of the case by the Vilnius City First District Court he was undergoing medical treatment. He asked for a longer break before the later hearings, for health reasons. The applicant states that the judge suggested that he did not have to be present at the final two hearings of his case, at which J.U. was due to give his final submissions and judgment would be adopted. The applicant admits that no request for a longer break was noted in the official hearing record. Although the applicant then informed the court that he would not be present at the two final hearings, they were not postponed.', 'On 5 December 2005 the Vilnius City First District Court found the applicant guilty of defamation, given that his statements that “J.U. had deserted his post during the tragic events of January 1991” and “J.U. had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a gun” had not been proved. The applicant was fined 1,250 Lithuanian litai (LTL, 362 euros (EUR)) and ordered to pay compensation for non-pecuniary damage in the sum of LTL 1,000 (EUR 290). The court terminated the proceedings in so far as the counterclaim by the applicant was concerned. J.U. and his lawyer, as well as the applicant, were present at the hearing.', 'In finding the applicant guilty, the court noted that the applicant had failed to submit credible evidence in support of his statement that J.U. had deserted his post. In this connection the court noted that in an official document J.U.’s superior had given a positive evaluation of J.U.’s behaviour during the events of January 1991. The submissions of one independent witness, J.G., questioned in the courtroom, were also taken into account. The court further established that the statement that J.U. had not passed the psychiatric check for permission to carry a firearm was false, given that the medical records showed that he had passed the examination in respect of his mental health.', 'The applicant states that he saw the record of the hearing of 5 December 2005 only on 8 December 2005, at approximately 3 p.m.', 'The applicant appealed, mainly arguing that the trial court had distorted the testimony of J.G., had misunderstood the circumstances surrounding the events of January 1991, and assessed the evidence and applied domestic law wrongly.', 'On 11 April 2006 the Vilnius Regional Court upheld the applicant’s conviction. In the appellate proceedings the applicant was represented by a lawyer. As the transcript of the hearing on appeal shows, the court deemed it unnecessary to question witness J.G., who had testified before the trial court, again, but granted the applicant’s request to add written evidence to the file and to question two more witnesses, J.Ž. and G.G. One more witness, A.Z., was questioned at the request of J.U.', 'The Vilnius Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s argument that the official transcript of the hearing was inaccurate, finding that the applicant had had the right to comment on the record of the hearing within three days of its signing by the judge, if he believed there were mistakes or inconsistencies. However, he had not made use of this right. The court reviewed the findings of the lower court and decided that the latter had assessed the evidence correctly and reached reasoned conclusions. The appellate court also emphasised that J.G., who had testified before the trial court at the request of the applicant, could not unambiguously confirm the fact that J.U. had left his post at the barricades in January 1991. Another witness, A.Z., had testified that J.U. had not deserted his post. The appellate court also noted that written evidence - a report by J.U.’s superior - stated that during the events of January 1991 J.U. was “holding firm”.', 'Lastly, the court observed that the lower court had correctly concluded that the assertion that J.U. had not passed the psychiatric check was a pejorative allusion to his mental health, and thus was damaging to his reputation. No procedural violations were found. This decision was final, as there is no right to appeal on points of law under the domestic law in private prosecution cases.', 'Subsequently, the applicant unsuccessfully tried to reopen the proceedings, alleging that the courts were unfair. His requests were dismissed by the public prosecutor and the Vilnius City Second District Court as unsubstantiated; they found no procedural irregularities when handling the applicant’s case at both levels of jurisdiction.', 'Articles 57-29 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provide that a participant in the criminal proceedings may raise an objection on the grounds of partiality of a judge.', 'Article 261 §§ 4-8 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that a transcript of a hearing must be prepared and signed by the judge who heard the case and the recording officer of the hearing no later than three days after the hearing took place. The participants in the proceedings have the right to acquaint themselves with the transcript within three days of its signing. Any objections as to the accuracy of the transcript must be put to the judge who heard the case. If the judge agrees with the objections, he or she adds them to the transcript of the hearing. Should the judge deem that the original transcript was accurate, he may dismiss the participant’s objections by adopting a ruling in a new hearing.', 'Article 367 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that an appeal on points of law may not be lodged in cases of private prosecution.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-75617,ENG,FRA,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,SCEA FERME DE FRESNOY v. FRANCE [Extracts],1,Inadmissible,,"['The applicant company, SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy, is an agricultural partnership with unlimited liability (société civile d’exploitation agricole). Its registered office is situated at Port-Saint-Nicolas in the administrative district of Saint-Nicolas-la-Chapelle and its manager, Mr Bertrand Mangeot, acts on its behalf. It was represented before the Court by Mr C. Bremond, of the Paris Bar. The French Government were represented by their Agent, Mrs E. Belliard, Director of Legal Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', 'On 19 May 2004 counsel for the applicant company informed the Court that Mr Paul Mangeot, one of the partners in the business, had died and that his widow, together with his son, Mr Bertrand Mangeot, who was already the manager, were now the only shareholders. Counsel indicated that Mr Mangeot and his mother had expressed their wish to continue the proceedings before the Court.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'Mr Bertrand Mangeot runs a 242-hectare farm in the administrative district of Montpothier (département of Aube). His father was joint manager until his death. The farm was acquired in 1971 following the expropriation of a previous agricultural holding based in Lognes.', 'The central part of the farm consists of various farm buildings around an inner courtyard and includes a chapel and a chapter house dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which are the remains of the Templar commandery of Fresnoy. Both of those edifices are tightly integrated into the surrounding buildings.', 'In a letter of 4 March 1986, the Aube prefecture offered a State grant for the restoration of the chapel and chapter house. The proposed grant was to cover 15% of the initial work. The applicant company declined the offer in view of the excessive share of the cost that it would have to bear.', 'By a decision of the prefect dated 26 August 1988, the remains of the commandery were added to the secondary list of historic buildings.', 'Following the approval of the National Historic Monuments Commission on 16 November 1992 and by a decision of 4 January 1994, the chapel and chapter house of the historic Fresnoy commandery were added to the primary list of historic buildings under the Historic Monuments Act of 31 December 1913. The reason for the listing was that “the preservation [of the buildings] ha[d] public-interest value in relation to the history of art, in view of the rarity and authenticity of the Templar architecture”. This status gave rise to various sets of proceedings.', 'As the applicant company had envisaged building a farm shed near the chapel and chapter house, various meetings were organised with the national heritage architect and the architecture authority for the département of Aube with a view to finding a new location, since the applicant company’s initial plan could no longer be implemented owing to the constraints of the historic monument protection. On 24 March 1990 the applicant company lodged an application for a building permit in respect of a farm machinery workshop, in spite of the national heritage architect’s negative opinion, which was subsequently confirmed on 3 August 1990. By a decision of the prefect dated 10 August 1990, the building permit was refused on the ground that “the intended construction would have an adverse effect on the chapel of the Templar commandery and would undermine the current harmony of the buildings as a whole”.', 'The applicant company applied to the Châlons-sur-Marne Administrative Court for judicial review of the prefect’s decision.', 'On 12 December 1990 a further meeting was held on the site with a view to finding a possible location for the farm machinery workshop. In a letter of 4 April 1991, the national heritage architect informed the applicant company, among other things, that the purpose was not to prevent it from building but to help it draw up the best possible plan, taking into account all the technical, operational and site-related constraints.', 'In a judgment of 1 December 1992, the Châlons-sur-Marne Administrative Court set aside the decision of 10 August 1990 to refuse the building permit, on the ground that the prefect had based his decision on an incorrect assessment of the facts. In a judgment of 30 June 1994, the Nancy Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal by the Minister for Infrastructure, Housing and Transport on the ground that the national heritage architect had not given his opinion within the statutory period.', 'On 3 March 1995 the applicant company applied for a permit to build a shelter.', 'On 8 July 1995 the national heritage architect advised against the granting of a permit. By a decision of 19 July 1995, the prefect denied the applicant company a building permit in respect of a maintenance and repair workshop on the ground that', '“the work envisaged is capable of adversely affecting the surroundings of the historic monument protected under the Act of 31 December 1913 (chapel and chapter house)”.', 'On 26 June 1996 the national heritage architect received Mr Mangeot, who submitted to him a plan for the construction of a farm building situated to the west of the main farm and aligned with an existing shed (adjoining the chapel). The national heritage architect gave his approval in principle, subject to a few minor adjustments, as the plan complied with the main guidelines laid down by the architecture and heritage authority of the département of Aube.', 'On 26 November 1996 the applicant company applied for a building permit. By a decision of the prefect dated 22 January 1997, the building permit was granted subject to certain conditions, such as the obligation to plant a screen of standard trees of local species. The extra cost incurred on account of the permit conditions was 1,850 French francs (FRF).', 'On 23 September 1997 the applicant company applied for a permit to demolish two unlisted buildings that were not adapted to the needs of the farm. By a decision of the prefect dated 9 December 1997, the demolition permit was refused on the following grounds:', '“... the work envisaged is capable of adversely affecting the surroundings of the historic monument protected under the Act of 31 December 1913 (Fresnoy Farm).', '... the disappearance of these traditional constructions with their specific character would detract from the immediate surroundings of the above-mentioned protected buildings and would undermine the quality of their environment; restoration with a view to reuse has to be envisaged.”', 'On 21 March 2000 the applicant company lodged two fresh applications for building permits. On 3 May 2000 the national heritage architect advised in favour of both applications, subject to the following conditions:', '“In order to harmonise this development with the neighbouring traditional constructions, which form the setting of the above-mentioned protected building:', '[In respect of the first plan:]', 'the cladding will be of a dark colour ...', 'the roofing will be red-brown in colour and mat in appearance', '[In respect of the second plan:]', 'the building to be erected will be clad entirely with wooden slats [tavillons]', 'the roofing will be red-brown in colour and with no gloss effect.”', 'By two decisions of the prefect dated 17 May 2000, the applicant company was granted two building permits, subject to the above-mentioned conditions. As the applicant company failed to proceed with the building work within the periods laid down in the decisions, the validity of the two building permits has since lapsed.', 'On 11 March 1994 the applicant company applied to the Conseil d’Etat for judicial review of the listing decision of 4 January 1994. In a judgment of 22 February 1995, the Conseil d’Etat dismissed the applicant company’s application for judicial review and confirmed both the formal validity and the substantive legality of the impugned decision. The Conseil d’Etat noted in particular, concerning the substantive legality of the listing decision, that', '“the chapel and chapter house of the Fresnoy commandery ... constitute a rare example of Templar architecture ... the preservation [of which] has public-interest value for artistic and historical reasons, such that the listing thereof as a historic monument can legally be justified ... [and] the second paragraph of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913 ... cannot have the purpose or effect of obliging the authorities to attach any easements or obligations to the listing status other than those resulting, pursuant to the Act of 31 December 1913, from the listing itself”.', 'On 7 November 1994, in a letter addressed to the prefect of the département of Aube, the applicant company sought FRF 5,000,000 in compensation under section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913, on the ground that', '“the listing has clearly caused harm to the claimant company’s agricultural activity, by creating in the very heart of the farm an easement capable of rendering impossible any development of the farm, or even of seriously undermining its day-to-day operations”.', 'Having regard to the fact that the listing had obliged the company to “rebuild all the farm buildings currently at its disposal in a position other than that in which the operational buildings [we]re currently located”, and to the fact that this total reconstruction had been assessed by experts at FRF 6,777,000, the applicant company concluded its letter with a claim for that sum under the second paragraph of section 5 of the above-mentioned Act of 1913.', 'Having failed to reach a friendly settlement of the compensation claim, the applicant company lodged an application for compensation on 20 December 1995 with the expropriations judge at the Troyes tribunal de grande instance. At a hearing on 6 June 1996, the Government Commissioner noted that there was “some confusion between obligations for owners of properties located in the vicinity of listed buildings and easements arising directly from a listing decision”.', 'In a judgment of 11 July 1996, the tribunal de grande instance rejected the application, noting in particular:', '“In the present case ... only two parts of the farm buildings have been listed, representing 4% of the total developed area.', 'The damage claimed by SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy mainly concerns developments affecting non-listed structures; accordingly, the applicant company has not shown that it has sustained damage in respect of the listed premises alone or as a result of a change affecting the premises and capable of causing such damage; it is not therefore entitled to rely on the provisions of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913 since the dispute concerns only the area surrounding the listed premises and, moreover, the applicant company is bound only by restrictions that do not preclude it from altering neighbouring premises if it abides by the prescriptions laid down by the authorities.', 'In these circumstances, it is appropriate to reject the application by SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy, which has not sustained direct and established pecuniary damage as a result of the listing of its buildings.”', 'The applicant company appealed against that judgment, maintaining in particular that section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913 was to be construed as creating an entitlement to compensation for all forms of damage sustained by an owner as a result of a listing decision, and not simply that sustained in respect of the listed buildings themselves. The applicant company further argued that “such a restrictive construction of section 5 ... would in effect deprive the owner of the compensation due to him for damage arising from a serious violation of his right of property, in breach of the French Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, which expressly guarantee respect for such right”. The Government Commissioner noted, as at first instance, that there was “some confusion between obligations for owners of properties located in the vicinity of listed buildings and easements arising directly from a listing decision”. He stated that the case in issue “concern[ed] an easement for the protection of the vicinity of a listed structure ... [which was] not to be confused with easements arising directly from a listing decision”. He concluded that the grounds submitted in support of the applicant company’s claim did not derive directly from the listing decision. On 24 June 1998 the Rheims Court of Appeal upheld the judgment and gave the following reasoning:', '“– Construction of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913', 'The appellant company claims that section 5 of the Act ... is to be construed as pertaining to the entire grouping of buildings, incorporating the listed structures.', 'However, that provision refers only to the listing decision.', 'The notion of ‘premises’ as used in the second paragraph of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913 pertains only to the premises designated in the listing decision.', 'The decision of 4 January 1994 states that ‘the chapel and chapter house of the historic Fresnoy commandery shall be listed as historic monuments ...’.', 'It is therefore appropriate to dismiss the claim of SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy whereby it contends that the term ‘premises’ as used in the above-mentioned section 5 should be construed as covering the entire property, which would be tantamount to the listing of the whole complex of buildings.', '– Conditions of application of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913', 'For there to be an entitlement to compensation, the easement relating to the listing must have entailed a change in the condition or use of the premises giving rise to direct, substantiated and established damage, for which the burden of proof lies with the claimant.', 'In this connection SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy based its claim on the restrictions imposed on it, as a result of the listing, in respect of its plans for demolition, the construction of a farm shed or development of the farm site.', 'However, those restrictions, created by prior agreement with the national heritage architect, are not the result of any change in the status or use of the premises, as the chapter house and chapel have not been affected by such changes.', 'The restrictions imposed on the company result from the application of Article R. 421-38-4 of the Planning Code, which protects the view around a listed building by requiring the agreement of the national heritage architect prior to any demolition or construction.', 'Such an easement, pertaining to the protection of the area surrounding a listed building, does not give rise to the compensation provided for in the current legislation.', 'Moreover, SCEA Ferme de Fresnoy has obtained permission to erect a storage building, subject to the approval of the plan by the national heritage architect.', 'Lastly, such easements for the protection of the area surrounding a listed building derive from the law and cannot give rise to compensation unless it is specifically provided for in a statutory instrument. ...”', 'The applicant company subsequently lodged an appeal on points of law, in support of which it submitted a single ground with four limbs. One of its claims was that the Court of Appeal’s decision had been devoid of the statutory basis required by Article 55 of the Constitution, as it had denied compensation for damage resulting from the listing without considering whether such refusal was contrary to the provisions of Article 14 of the Convention or Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.', 'On 8 March 2000 the Court of Cassation, rejecting the submissions of the Advocate-General, dismissed the appeal in a judgment containing the following reasoning:', '“... having found, firstly, that section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913 provided for compensation following a listing by official order if the resulting easements and obligations entailed a change in the condition or use of the premises and, secondly, that the easement pertaining to the protection of the area surrounding a listed building did not give rise to any compensation under the current legislation, the Court of Appeal, leaving aside a subsidiary consideration and without being required to make a determination that had not been sought from it as to the applicability of Article 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms or of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, rightly considered that the notion of ‘premises’ pertained only to those designated in the listing decision and dismissed the company’s compensation claim, thus justifying its decision in law.”', '...', 'In France, the first provisions for the protection of historic monuments date back to 1836, when the church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe was listed. However, until 1887 the listing process had few legal effects and the provisions of an Act of 30 March 1887 were mainly “contractual” in nature.', 'It was only in 1913 that a meaningful protection system was provided for in France with the Historic Monuments Act of 31 December 1913, the basic statute governing heritage, which has since been amended a number of times. The Act mainly lays down the procedures whereby immovable property whose preservation is in the public interest for historical or artistic reasons is to be added to the secondary or primary historic monuments lists. Such decisions carry various legal effects and may create easements or obligations which affect the property itself.', 'Only in respect of property on the primary list may the adverse consequences of easements and obligations relating to listing, under certain circumstances, give rise to compensation at the request of their owner, under the second paragraph of section 5 of the Act of 31 December 1913.', 'The 1913 Act, in sections 13 bis and 13 ter, also provides for a protected area around buildings deemed to be of interest, such that, through the review of applications for building or demolition permits by the owners of property in the vicinity of listed buildings, their surroundings are protected and the aesthetic quality of the adjacent area is preserved as far as possible. Such easements, created for the benefit of owners of historic buildings, affect the adjacent property.', 'The protection of a historic monument, whether by secondary listing or by primary listing, under the amended Historic Monuments Act of 31 December 1913, automatically creates a conservation area around it, extending to about 78.5 hectares. Over the past century, some 40,000 monuments have been protected under this legislation in France. In view of the geographical proximity of some monuments or even their superposition in certain cases, the aggregate surface area of the conservation areas thus created, and consequently the number of properties concerned, are considerable.', 'The total protected area becomes even greater when account is taken of sites classified under the Law of 2 May 1930 on the protection of natural monuments and places of artistic, historic, scientific, legendary or scenic interest, together with the architectural and landscape heritage areas (zones de protection du patrimoine architectural et paysager – ZPPAUP) set up under sections 69 to 72 of Law no. 83-8 of 7 January 1983 on the division of powers between municipalities, départements, regions and the State.', '“Immovable property whose preservation is in the public interest for historical or artistic reasons shall be entered on the primary list of historic monuments, as a whole or in part, by the minister responsible for the fine arts, in accordance with the distinctions laid down in the following sections.', 'Immovable property subject to listing under the present Act shall include:', '...', '2. Immovable property of which listing is necessary to allow for the isolation, clearing or cleaning of a listed building or building proposed for listing;', '3. In general terms, developed or undeveloped property located within the field of view of a listed building or building proposed for listing.

On an exceptional basis this range may be extended beyond 500 metres. A decision of the Conseil d’Etat, adopted further to an opinion of the National Historic Monuments Commission, shall indicate the monuments to which such extension may apply and shall determine the range of the protected area in each case.', 'From the date on which the fine arts authority notifies the owner of a listing proposal, all the effects of such listing shall apply automatically to the property concerned. They shall cease to apply if the listing decision is not taken within ‘twelve months’ following such notification.', '...”', '“The following property shall be regarded as having been validly listed prior to the enactment of this law: (1) buildings listed on the general schedule of listed monuments, officially published in 1900 by the fine arts authority; (2) those and other buildings that have been listed by means of a decision [arrêté or décret] under the Act of 30 March 1887.', 'Within a period of three months, the schedule of buildings regarded as listed prior to the enactment of this Act shall be published in the Official Gazette.

Christoph, of the Berlin Bar.', 'The facts of the case, as presented by the parties, can be summarised as follows.', 'Between 1 September 1967 and 31 August 1990 the applicant worked as a radio journalist in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). He ran the international press-review office until shortly before the entry into force of the German Unification Treaty on 3 October 1990 .', 'On 31 July 1990 the applicant entered into an agreement proposed by his employer under which his contract of employment was to terminate and he would receive an early-retirement pension (Vereinbarung zur Beendigung des Arbeitsrechtsverhältnisses und zur Gewährung von Vorruhestandsgeld) of 1,074 East-German marks a month, in accordance with Article 3a of the Early-Retirement Pensions Order of 8 February 1990 (Verordnung zur Gewährung von Vorruhestandsgeld). The Order required employers to pay qualifying employees an early-retirement pension equal to 70% of their average net wage over the preceding twelve months. Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision (Zweite Durchführungsbestimmung) of the Order provided for the pensions to be indexed to changes in pay levels within the firm that would have affected the employee had he or she continued to work.', 'In a judgment of 3 March 1994 the Berlin Regional Court (Landes-arbeitsgericht) dismissed an appeal by the applicant for the same reasons.', 'In a judgment of 27 June 1995, the Federal Labour Court (Bundes-arbeitsgericht) dismissed a further appeal by the applicant, holding that his rights had been extinguished by the entry into force of the Unification Treaty on 3 October 1990.', 'The Federal Court pointed out, firstly, that the obligations of the GDR radio and television company, which was dissolved on reunification, had been assumed by the five Länder situated within the territory of the GDR at the time and the Land of Berlin. It added that by virtue of Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision of the Early-Retirement Pensions Order, taken together with Appendix IIa of the German Unification Treaty, the Federal Labour Ministry was in law the successor (Rechtsnachfolger) to the applicant’s former employer.', 'The Federal Court found, further, that the applicant no longer had any right to payment of the difference, as the legal basis for the progressive indexation of the early-retirement pension had disappeared on 3 October 1990, the German Unification Treaty having changed the method by which the level of the early-retirement pension was adjusted. That change had been made with the consent of the parliament of the GDR. Former Article 9 § 2 of the second implementing provision had been repealed and replaced by the “adjustment factor” provisions set out in Article 112a.', 'The Federal Court found, lastly, that the agreement made on 31 July 1990 did not contain any provision giving the applicant any additional rights to those set out in the Early-Retirement Pensions Order of 8 February 1990. In particular, it did not provide for a progressive, long-term revaluation of the applicant’s early-retirement pension in line with changes in wage levels paid by the employer, but expressly stipulated that the pension was granted on the basis of the Order of 8 February 1990.', 'On 14 July 1997 the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungs-gericht), sitting as a bench of three judges, declined to accept a further appeal by the applicant for adjudication.', 'Appendix II, Chapter VIII, section E, paragraph III no. 5 of the German Unification Treaty of 31 August 1990 provides that the Early-Retirement Pensions Order remains valid, but lays down, inter alia, that after that date payments will, at the employee’s request, be made by the Federal Labour Ministry and that the early-retirement pension shall be equal to 65% of the average net wage over the three preceding months.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Cobo del Rosal, a lawyer practising in Madrid.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 18 June 2004 the applicant was arrested in Spain and remanded in custody in execution of a European arrest warrant issued by the French judicial authorities following a judgment by the Pau tribunal de grande instance delivered in his absence on 12 January 1993. In that judgment, the court had sentenced the applicant to five years’ imprisonment for a drug-related offence.', 'On 25 June 2004 central examining magistrate no. 4 referred the case to the Audiencia Nacional for a decision on the merits. However, he considered that the statutory time-limit for surrendering the applicant to the French authorities had not been complied with and that the application to have the applicant surrendered to the French authorities could therefore be rejected, the applicant being opposed to it.', 'On 15 July 2004 the applicant submitted an application for bail, arguing that there was nothing to indicate that he had committed the offence in respect of which the French courts had delivered their judgment in 1993. The Audiencia Nacional dismissed his application by a decision of 20 July 2004.', 'However, on 27 July 2004 the same court ordered the applicant’s release. At the same time, it requested the French authorities to provide the fingerprints of the person who had been detained in France, and asked Interpol for the fingerprints of the person who was the subject of the extradition request.', 'In a decision of 22 December 2004, the Audiencia Nacional agreed to surrender the applicant to the French authorities. It noted that the procedure complied with the conditions laid down in Law 3/2003 of 14 March 2003, which had been enacted in Spain pursuant to the obligations on the State under the framework decision on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between member States adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 June 2002 (OJEC L 190/1 of 18 July 2002). The decision made the surrender of the applicant to the French authorities conditional on any sentence that might be imposed upon him being executed in Spain, as the judgment convicting him had been delivered in his absence and was therefore subject to appeal.', 'On 30 December 2004 the applicant submitted an application for interpretation (aclaración) of that decision. The application concerned, firstly, whether he had been identified and by what means and, secondly, the application to his case of Law 4/1985 of 21 March 1985 on passive extradition and not of the framework decision of the Council of the European Union of 13 June 2002, given that the facts at the origin of the criminal proceedings in France had taken place between February 1991 and January 1992. On 31 January 2005 the Audiencia Nacional dismissed the application, considering that the contested decision did not fall into the category of cases subject to an application for interpretation under section 267 of the Judicature Act. Owing to an error, the applicant was not informed that his application had been dismissed.', 'On the same day, the Audiencia Nacional ordered that the applicant be detained for surrender to the French authorities. An appeal (recurso de súplica) lodged against that decision was dismissed on 18 February 2005, as the measure had been adopted for the purposes of surrendering the applicant to the French authorities but the applicant could still serve the final sentence in Spain.', 'Relying on Article 24 (right to a fair trial) in conjunction with Articles 17 (right to freedom) and 25 (principle of legality) of the Constitution, the applicant lodged an amparo appeal (action for infringement of fundamental rights) with the Constitutional Court against the decisions of 22 December 2004 and 31 January and 18 February 2005. The Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal in a judgment delivered on 18 July 2005 and served on 27 July 2005.', 'It dismissed the complaints relating to the decision of 22 December 2004 as they were out of time, and considered that the applicant had not been adversely affected by the failure to notify him of the rejection of his application for interpretation of the decision delivered on 31 January 2005 because that application had clearly been futile.', 'With regard to the decisions of 31 January and 18 February 2005 relating to the detention of the applicant for the purposes of surrendering him to the French authorities, the Constitutional Court noted that the amparo appeal did not contain any complaint about those decisions; the applicant had confined himself to arguing, firstly, that the Audiencia Nacional should have applied the extradition law, which he considered to be of greater relevance to his case, and not Law 3/2003 on the European arrest warrant and, secondly, that the French criminal proceedings resulting in a European arrest warrant being issued against him had related to a statute-barred offence. In that connection, the Constitutional Court observed that it was not its task to reconstruct the reasons given by applicants for lodging an appeal.', 'The applicant then requested that the decision of 31 January 2005 be served on him, which was done on 7 September 2005. On 14 September 2005 he lodged a further amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 29 September 2005, the court dismissed the appeal, holding that an application for interpretation which artificially extended the proceedings was inadmissible.', '“1. The courts cannot amend decisions once they have been signed; however they can interpret obscure concepts and correct clerical errors ...”', '“... The purpose of this Law is to fulfil the obligations which the framework decision creates for the member States, and which consist of replacing extradition procedures with a new procedure for surrender [to the authorities of the applicant State] of persons who are suspected of having committed an offence or who try to escape justice after being convicted by a final decision. ...', 'The application of the principle of mutual recognition requires that, once the competent authority has received the European warrant with a view to its execution, this takes place practically automatically, without the judicial authority that executes the warrant having to examine the application again to verify its conformity with domestic law. Therefore, the reasons enabling the judicial authority to refuse execution are laid down by law, and the nature [of the warrant] allows that authority to make an objective assessment. Thus the usual reasons for refusal in extradition proceedings are eliminated, such as those relating to the non-surrender of nationals or to the fact that certain offences are considered to be political offences.', 'The extremely innovative nature of this procedure is even clearer if we consider that it applies to the long list of categories of offences set out in the framework decision, for which the existence of double criminality can no longer be verified. Accordingly, when the judicial authority receives a European arrest warrant for one of the types of offence listed, and provided that the corresponding sentence exceeds a given threshold, it must proceed with execution, whether or not its criminal legislation provides for such an offence. ...”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The Austrian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ambassador H. Tichy, Head of the International Law Department at the Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 3 March 2003 the applicant, a practising lawyer, was served with a decision dated 25 February 2003 by the Zell am See Tax Authority (Finanzamt Zell am See als Finanzstrafbehörde I. Instanz) informing him that proceedings had been initiated against him on suspicion of evasion of both income and turnover tax, through his submission of incorrect declarations of earnings in both the years 1999 and 2001.', '5. The panel at the Salzburg Stadt Tax Authority (Spruchsenat beim Finanzamt Salzburg-Stadt) held five hearings, namely on 20 April 2004 and 9 February, 6 April, 14 September and 18 October 2005, of which only the first two were attended by the applicant. The applicant was aware that his former employee, witness X, would be required to testify in the proceedings; however three hearings were postponed when witness X failed to appear. When X finally appeared at the hearing of 18 October 2005 it transpired that the applicant had relied on X’s duty of confidentiality on account of his previous employment contract with the applicant, and X could not then testify.', '6. The applicant did not receive a transcript of the hearing. The applicant had not lodged a request to receive the transcript until the hearing was under way.', '7. On 18 October 2005 the Tax Authority panel found the applicant guilty of having evaded tax in the amount of almost 51,000 euros (EUR) and ordered him to pay a fine of EUR 20,000, which would be replaced, in the event of default, by a prison term of four weeks. The applicant was, however, acquitted of having evaded turnover tax in 1999. In fixing the amount of the fine, the panel considered the following to be mitigating factors: the applicant’s lack of any prior convictions, his partial payment of the money owed, his confession in respect of part of the charges and the long period of time that had elapsed since the offences had been committed. It did not find any aggravating factors. The written decision of 18 October 2005 was served on the applicant on 18 May 2006.', '8. On 19 June 2006 the applicant appealed to the Independent Finance Panel (Unabhängiger Finanzsenat), which delivered its decision orally after a hearing on 6 December 2007. The Independent Finance Panel reduced the amount of the fine to EUR 12,500, with sixteen days’ imprisonment in the event of default. Among the reasons given by the Independent Finance Panel for the reduction of the fine was the applicant’s low income, and it cited the long duration of the proceedings as a further mitigating factor in addition to those already put forward by the Tax Authority panel. On the other hand, it considered that the fact that the applicant was a practising lawyer constituted an aggravating factor. The written decision was served on the applicant on 14 August 2008.', '9. The applicant lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Verfassungsgerichtshof) on 25 September 2008 against the decision of the Independent Finance Panel. In a decision dated 8 October 2008 the Constitutional Court declined to consider the case for its lack of prospects of success and sent it to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgerichtshof). The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant on 14 October 2008.', '10. The applicant filed additional observations in support of his complaint to the Administrative Court as requested. On 8 July 2009 the Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s complaint as ill-founded. It held that the Independent Finance Panel had acted appropriately in taking the unreasonably lengthy duration of the proceedings and the applicant’s poor financial situation into consideration and had set the fine accordingly and in line with the domestic courts’ jurisprudence. It also held that the applicant should have applied to receive a transcript of the hearing by the time it had started, as was provided for by law.', '11. The decision was served on the applicant’s counsel on 27 August 2009.', '12. The jurisdiction of the tax authorities as regards proceedings relating to tax offences and the conduct of such proceedings are regulated in the Tax Offences Act (Finanzstrafgesetz).', '13.

AUSTRIA,4,Inadmissible,Georg Ress,"['The applicant, Ernst Steiner, is an Austrian national, born in 1941 and living in Marchtrenk/Austria.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 7 December 1973 the Roman Catholic Rectory of Saint Nicolaus (Römisch-katholische Stadtpfarrkirche St. Nikolaus, hereafter “the Rectory”), the owner of an estate in Hall/Tyrol, concluded a contract with Mr M. S., the owner of three adjacent estates, authorising him to use its estate for the construction of a sales hall. The agreement was subject to the condition that M. S. obtained the prior permission by the M. company, the tenant of the Rectory’s estate. M. S. later transferred his entitlement as regards the sales hall to the L. company.', 'On 2 October 1985 a donation contract of 23 December 1982 between the L. company as donor and the applicant as recipient was deposited with the Hall District Court and subsequently entered into the land register. The purpose of this contract was to transfer to the applicant the ownership of the sales hall, including the part of the building that had been constructed on the Rectory’s estate.', 'On 16 December 1987 the Rectory brought an action against the applicant before the Innsbruck Regional Court, requesting that the entry of the above donation contract into the land register be declared null and void. In an alternative claim the Rectory requested a declaratory judgment that the applicant had no property rights regarding the part of the sales hall constructed on the Rectory’s estate.', 'On 18 December 1987 the Innsbruck Regional Court refused to deal with the action for lack of competence and transferred the case to the Wels Regional Court. The Rectory’s appeal against this decision remained unsuccessful. In March 1988 the court file arrived at the Wels Regional Court.', 'At the hearing of 13 June 1988 the Wels Regional Court closed the proceedings and announced that the judgment would be given in writing.', 'By judgment of 21 October 1988 the Wels Regional Court dismissed the plaintiff’s main as well as its alternative claim. It found that the Rectory lacked legal interest in the matter since its own legal position was in no way affected by the registration of the donation.', 'On 12 October 1989 the Linz Court of Appeal, upon the Rectory’s appeal, partly quashed the judgment for errors of law and referred the case back to the Wels Regional Court.', 'On 13 June 1990 the Supreme Court, on both parties’ appeals, quashed the Court of Appeal’s decision and referred the case back to the Regional Court.', 'On 7 November 1990 the H. company, the successor of the M. company as tenant of the Rectory’s estate, intervened in the proceedings as coplaintiff. Hearings took place on 8 November 1990, 4 February, 23 April and 11 July 1991. On the latter date the applicant requested the court to revoke the co-plaintiff’s admission to the proceedings. On 22 January 1992 the Wels Regional Court rejected the applicant’s request. On 14 February 1992 the applicant appealed against this decision. On 6 April 1992 the Linz Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', 'On 24 June 1992 the Wels Regional Court announced a hearing to be held at the Innsbruck Regional Court on 17 and 18 September 1992, at which 22 witnesses residing in Tyrol would be heard.

It announced that the written version of the judgment would be served as soon as witness Z. had been heard by way of judicial assistance at the Vienna District Court.', 'Witness Z. failed to appear before the Vienna District Court on 4 and 18 January 1995. He was heard on 10 March 1995.', 'On 25 August 1995 the Wels Regional Court granted the Rectory’s claim and ordered that the entry in the land register of the donation contract between the L. company and the applicant concerning the part of the building located on the tenant’s estate of the Rectory be annulled. The court, having regard to the documentary evidence and the statements of the witnesses heard, found that in the absence of an agreement by the tenant of the Rectory’s estate (the M. company), the authorisation by the Rectory of December 1973 was not valid. Therefore M. S. and his successors could not lawfully acquire any ownership rights regarding the part of the sales hall situated on the Rectory’s estate.', 'On 6 December 1995 the Linz Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal of 3 October 1995.', 'On 27 March 1996 the Supreme Court refused to deal with the applicant’s appeal on points of law.

The Regional Court acceded to this request and ordered the applicant to pay monthly amounts of maintenance both to his children and his ex-wife. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal (gerechtshof) of Arnhem, which quashed the decision of the Regional Court and reduced the amount of the applicant’s maintenance obligations. As the applicant considered that the reasoning and calculations applied by the Court of Appeal were both incorrect and incomprehensible, he lodged an appeal on points of law (beroep in cassatie) with the Supreme Court (Hoge Raad).', 'In his advisory opinion of 15 May 1998, one of the advocates-general (advocaten-generaal) of the Supreme Court recommended that the appeal be dismissed.

The decision did not mention that the applicant, or counsel on his behalf, had replied to that opinion or that account had been taken of that reply. In dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court referred to Article 101a of the Judiciary (Organisation) Act (Wet op de Rechterlijke Organisatie) according to which the Supreme Court, if it considered that a complaint did not provide grounds for overturning the impugned decision and did not require answers to questions of law in the interests of the unity or development of the law, could, when giving reasons for its decision, limit itself to that finding.', 'At the time relevant to the present case, Article 328 § 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Wetboek van Burgerlijke Rechtsvordering, “CCP”) provided that neither the parties nor their representatives were allowed to address the court after the public prosecution service had presented its opinion (Article 328 § 1 in conjunction with Article 326 CCP). However, pursuant to Article 328 § 2, simple notes (eenvoudige aantekeningen) contesting facts, which the parties believed had been presented incorrectly by the public prosecution service, could be submitted to the President of the court by the parties or their representatives.', 'In a judgment of 28 March 1997, the Supreme Court held that it was free to take cognisance of comments submitted in response to the opinion issued by the public prosecution service by one of the parties unless this ran counter to the requirements of due process, seen also in the light of the interests of the other party (Nederlandse Jurisprudentie (NJ) 1997, no. 581).', 'A similar reasoning was adopted by the Supreme Court in a judgment of 12 September 1997 (NJ 1998, no. 687), in which it held, with reference to the Court’s judgment in the case of Vermeulen v.

No restrictions other than those arising from due process, for instance in connection with the interests of the other party, apply to this document [i.e. the reply to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service].”', 'In order to observe the principle of due process, the Supreme Court allowed a period of two weeks for the submission of the response to the advisory opinion of the public prosecution service.', 'On 1 January 2002 an amended Article 44 CCP entered into force, paragraph 3 of which gives parties the right to submit written comments in reply to the advisory opinion issued by the Procurator-General of the Supreme Court within two weeks of the transmission of the advisory opinion to them.', 'At the time of the decision in the present case, September 1998, the general practice of the Supreme Court was to mention in its judgment or decision that a reply to the advisory opinion had been submitted.

It was claimed that the applicant had, ""as a result of his unjustified detention"", suffered over and above the loss of his fortune irremediable damage to his health which reduced his life expectancy and made constant medical care necessary. The applicant’s lawyer therefore requested the Minister to advance on account the sum of 50,000 German marks (DM).

The applicant did not dispute that decision, and paid the fine.', 'On 15 November 2000 the prosecution re-opened the criminal proceedings against the applicant.', 'On 22 November 2000 a fresh medical expert examination confirmed the seriousness of the injuries caused to the boy, finding that he would need plastic surgery.', 'On 14 December 2000 the applicant was charged with causing medium bodily harm by negligence (Article 115 of the Criminal Code) and remanded on bail, with a written obligation not to leave her place of residence. The applicant did not appeal against this restriction.', 'On 19 March 2001 the Klaipėda City District Court acquitted the applicant. It was established that the applicant was not guilty of a criminal offence but rather of an administrative violation for which she had already been punished.', 'On 29 May 2001 the Klaipėda Regional Court reversed this judgment, finding the applicant guilty. The appellate court noted the gravity of the injuries sustained by the boy (bite wounds on his nose, forehead, cheeks, arm and leg). The court also found that the applicant’s behaviour had been negligent, in that she had walked her dog without a muzzle, although the animal was of a dangerous breed. In view of these factors, the court concluded that the applicant’s acts must attract criminal rather than administrative responsibility. The applicant was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment, but the sentence was rescinded by virtue of an amnesty act. The applicant lodged a cassation appeal.', 'On 13 November 2001 the Supreme Court upheld the applicant’s conviction. It established that the applicant had been criminally liable for having caused medium bodily harm by negligence.', 'The Supreme Court noted that in cases where the same acts attracted both criminal and administrative liability, the nature of the offence was a criterion determining which procedure ought to be applied. In particular, if the nature of the act made it punishable under the criminal law, the person should be held liable under criminal law. If the nature of the offence was not such as to attract criminal liability, a person would be held liable under the administrative law. The Supreme Court went on to say:', '“It was established that the applicant had caused medium bodily harm by negligence, therefore, she has been rightly convicted under Article 115 of the Criminal Code.', 'The fact that [the applicant] has been punished for the same acts by way of an administrative procedure is not a valid ground to discontinue the criminal proceedings, since such a ground is not foreseen by the Code of Criminal Procedure. However, a person cannot be punished twice for the same offence, because it is contrary to Article 31 § 5 of the Constitution and Article 3 § 4 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Since [the applicant] has been reasonably convicted under Article 115 of the Criminal Code, the issue of the lawfulness of the administrative decision to fine [the applicant] can be reconsidered in accordance with the [Code of Administrative Offences].”', 'Article 31 of the Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania states as follows:', '“...Punishment may be imposed or applied on the grounds established by law. No one may be punished for the same criminal offence twice. ...”', 'Article 3 of the Criminal Code (as then in force) stipulated:', '“A person shall be held liable only when the act committed is forbidden by a criminal statute which came into force before the commission of the offence ...', 'No one shall be punished for the same criminal act twice ...”', 'The then Article 115 of the Criminal Code provided for criminal liability for causing serious or medium bodily harm by negligence.', 'Article 110 of the Code of Administrative Offences (as then in force) provided:', '“Any person who breaches pet-keeping rules - approved by the Municipal Council - shall be punished by a warning or fine of up to 100 litai. The same act, committed repeatedly or when causing damage to the health or property of others - shall be punished by a fine between 100 to 3,000 litai.”', 'The then Article 291 of the Code of Administrative Offences provided for a right of appeal against a decision to impose an administrative penalty.', 'The then Article 301 of that Code stipulated:', '', '“Where a decision finding a person liable for an administrative offence has been quashed, the [fine] paid shall be reimbursed ... and other restrictions relating to the [administrative penalty] shall be repealed.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

Applicant’s version of the facts', 'The applicant used to live and work as a farmer in the Molla Hüseyin hamlet of the Pınarbaşı village attached to the Bismil district of the province of Diyarbakır.', 'On account of terrorist activities in the state of emergency region the villagers were requested to be village guards and the villages of those who did not agree to be village guards were evacuated and destroyed by security forces.', 'The applicant was also requested to be a village guard. As he did not agree he received a warning from the security forces in the region.', 'On 14 November 1994 the commander of the Gendarme Station in the Ahmetli village arrived in the applicant’s village accompanied by soldiers and requested the applicant either to agree to be a village guard or to leave the village.', 'On 30 November 1994 the applicant, along with 13 members of his family, left his home and village since he was continually threatened with death.', 'The applicant arrived in his son’s house in Istanbul and telephoned his brother who lived in his village. He learned that his home and its contents had been destroyed by security forces in the evening of the day he had abandoned his village.', 'The applicant and his family are currently living in Istanbul.', '', '2. Government’s version of the facts', 'The authorities began an investigation immediately after they had learned of the applicant’s allegations. In this respect, on 27 February 1998 the Gendarme Station Commander of the Ahmetli village took statements from the applicant’s brothers, Mehmet Çelebi and Alaattin Çelebi, who are currently living in the applicant’s village.', 'Mehmet Çelebi stated:', '“I know İsmet Çelebi. He is my elder brother. Until 1994 we lived together in the same village. At the relevant time, his son Murat Çelebi went to Istanbul to find work. We learned that he had joined the mountain cadre of the PKK. I do not know whether my brother was involved in the PKK terrorist organisation. After his son had [joined the PKK] he wanted to emigrate to Istanbul. He did not tell us why he wanted to go Istanbul. He was thinking of finding a proper and better job. In November 1994 he emigrated to Istanbul of his own will. There has never been a [military] operation in our village neither before nor after [November 1994]. Security forces did not force us to abandon our village. Nobody beat or threatened us in order to force us to evict the village. My brother İsmet Çelebi was neither insulted nor beaten by any member of the security forces. We are not village guards. We were not subjected to pressure to agree to be village guards. We are living in peace in our village. It is not true that my brother İsmet left the village on account of the pressure or torture inflicted on him since he did not agree to be a village guard. His house was neither burned nor destroyed by the security forces. His house is in a good state. However, I removed the wooden parts of his house (doors, windows and the roof) two years after he had left the village, considering that [my brother] would not return to the village. Some of the wood is in my stable. I used some of them. My brother İsmet Çelebi knows that I removed the wooden parts of [his house] and I do not understand why he had slandered [the security forces]. However, I consider that he might have been tempted to lie by the PKK or his son in the mountain [cadre]. None [of the houses] has been burned or destroyed. Nobody was beaten, insulted or tortured in our village. We were not forced to agree to be village guards and we are still not village guards. I can return the wooden parts of my brother’s house if he wants. They are at my place. I removed the wooden parts in order to protect them from decaying. My brother has 150 acres of land in the village. We are using his land and paying him a rent. If my brother wants to return to the village he may live with us. We are not under pressure of the security forces...”', 'Alaattin Çelebi stated:', '“İsmet Çelebi is my elder brother. We are currently living in the Molla Hüseyin hamlet of the Pınarbaşı village attached to the Bismil district in the province of Diyarbakır. We are dealing freely with our works in the village. My brother abandoned the village four years ago of his own will and emigrated to Istanbul. I do not know why he emigrated. In 1994 his son Murat Çelebi went to Istanbul to work and later joined the mountain cadre of the PKK. Following this incident my elder brother emigrated to Istanbul. He emigrated of his own will. He was not subjected to pressure or oppression by security forces. There has not been an operation before or after November 1994. We are not village guards. It is a lie that we were subjected to pressure to agree to be village guards. We still are not village guards. Me and my brother Mehmet Çelebi are taking care of our elder brother İsmet Çelebi’s house and fields since he emigrated to Istanbul. Me and Mehmet disassembled the wooden parts of İsmet Çelebi’s house. The other parts of the house are currently as they used to be [in the past]. My brother Mehmet and I are cultivating [İsmet]’s fields and sending the rent to him. It is absolutely a lie that we are subjected to pressure or oppression by security forces. Everybody is living freely and getting on with his own work. My elder brother İsmet Çelebi left the village on his own will. The [allegation] that he was subjected to pressure to agree to be a village guard is a lie...”', 'On 1 March 1998 the Ahmetli District Gendarme Station Commander and the Deputy Commander went to the applicant’s village to conduct a survey of the scene of the incident. A survey minute was drawn up and signed by the Commander, the Deputy Commander, the applicant’s two brothers, Mehmet and Alaattin Çelebi, and three inhabitants of the village. The survey minute stated:', '“On 1 March 1998 [we] went to [İsmet Çelebi]’s village in order to carry out an investigation following his application to the European Commission of Human Rights. [İsmet Çelebi]’s house was found. [We], along with his brother Mehmet Çelebi, arrived to the house İsmet Çelebi had abandoned. Subsequent to the examination, it was observed that no demolition, burning or destruction had occurred. Mehmet Çelebi stated that he had disassembled the wooden doors, windows and the roof in order to protect them from decaying. It was further observed that some of the disassembled materials were used [by Mehmet Çelebi], some were kept in his stable, the wooden materials were in a good state and did not bear any trace of fire. The villagers and his brothers were asked about the alleged acts complained of. They all stated that no operation had been carried out [in the village] and no destruction, burning or violence had occurred. [They further stated] that there was no village guard in the village and nobody was forced to agree to be a village guard. According to the statements of his brothers and the villagers it was understood that [İsmet Çelebi] had left the village on his own will...”', 'On 1 March 1998 the Ahmetli District Station Commander sent a letter to the Diyarbakır Provincial Gendarme Commanding informing it of the conclusion of the investigation carried out. He stated that on 14 March 1994 no operation was carried out in the Molla Hüseyin hamlet of the Pınarbaşı village, the villagers were not forced to agree to be village guards and there was no village guard in the village at the present time. He further stated that the records kept by the authorities indicated that [İsmet Çelebi] had never applied to or lodged complaints with the [administrative or judicial] authorities.', 'On 2 March 1998 the Bismil Public Prosecutor, accompanied by an expert and the applicant’s brother Alaattin Çelebi, conducted a survey of the applicant’s house. He noted in his report that the applicant’s house had not been not destroyed or burned but its wooden parts had been removed and used by his brother Alaattin Çelebi. He further noted that 24 pieces of wooden materials removed from the applicant’s house were kept in his brother’s stable and that they were in good condition and usable. On the same day, the Public Prosecutor took statements from two inhabitants of the applicant’s village, Mehmet Demir and İzzet Oral. They told the Public Prosecutor that the security forces had not destroyed the applicant’s house but his brother had removed its wooden parts. They further stated that the applicant had left the village of his own will as well as on account of the pressure from the PKK.', 'On 2 March 1998 the Bismil Public Prosecutor and the District Governor sent letters to the Bismil Gendarme Unit Command informing it that the applicant had not lodged an application as regards his complaints that he was forced to agree to be a village guard and that his house was destroyed by the security forces.', 'On 10 March 1998 the Bismil Public Prosecutor issued a decision to discontinue the criminal proceedings against the Ahmetli Station Commander, Rahmi Canlı, subsequent to the investigation carried out into the applicant’s allegations.', 'B. Relevant domestic law and practice', '1. Administrative liability', 'Article 125 of the Turkish Constitution provides as follows:', '“All acts and decisions of the administration are subject to judicial review...', 'The administration shall be liable to indemnify any damage caused by its own acts and measures.”', 'The above provision is not subject to any restrictions even in a state of emergency or war. The latter requirement does not necessarily require proof of the existence of any fault on the part of the administration, whose responsibility is of an absolute, objective nature, based on a concept of collective liability and referred to as the theory of “social risk”. Thus the administration may indemnify people who have suffered damage from acts committed by unknown or terrorist instigators when the State may be said to have failed in its duty to maintain public order and safety, or in its duty to safeguard individual life and property.', 'The principle of administrative liability is reflected in the additional section 1 of Law no. 2935 of 25 October 1983 on the State of Emergency, which provides:', '“... actions for compensation in relation to the exercise of the powers conferred by this Law are to be brought against the administration before the administrative courts.”', '2. Criminal responsibility', 'It is an offence under the Turkish Criminal Code', '- to make an unlawful search of an individual’s home (Articles 193 and 194);', '- to commit arson (Articles 369, 370, 371, 372) or aggravated arson if human life is endangered (Article 382);', '- to commit arson unintentionally by carelessness, negligence or inexperience (Article 383); or', 'to damage another’s property intentionally (Articles 516 et seq.).', 'For all these offences complaints may be lodged, pursuant to Articles 151 and 153 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the public prosecutor or the local administrative authorities. The public prosecutor and the police have a duty to investigate crimes reported to them, the former deciding whether a prosecution should be initiated, pursuant to Article 148 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. A complainant may appeal against the decision of the public prosecutor not to institute criminal proceedings.', 'If the suspected authors of the contested acts are military personnel, they may also be prosecuted for causing extensive damage, endangering human life or damaging property, if they have not followed orders in conformity with Articles 86 and 87 of the Military Code. Proceedings in these circumstances may be initiated by the persons concerned (non-military) before the competent authority under the Code of Criminal Procedure, or before the suspected persons’ hierarchical superior (sections 93 and 95 of Law no. 353 on the Constitution and Procedure of Military Courts).', 'If the suspected author of a crime is an agent of the State, permission to prosecute must be obtained from a local administrative council (the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly). The local council decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court; a refusal to prosecute is subject to an automatic appeal of this kind.', '3. Provisions on compensation', 'Any illegal act by civil servants, be it a crime or a tort, which causes material or moral damage may be the subject of a claim for compensation before the ordinary civil courts. Proceedings against the administration may be brought before the administrative courts, whose proceedings are in writing.

001-71525,ENG,ISL,ADMISSIBILITY,2005,GUNNARSSON v. ICELAND,3,Inadmissible,David Thór Björgvinsson,"['The applicant, Mr Kjartan Gunnarsson, is an Icelandic national who was born in 1951 and lives in Reykjavik. He was represented before the Court by Mr J.R Möller, a lawyer practising in the same town.', 'On 31 August 2000 the newspaper Dagur published an article amidst a heated public debate in the wake of the acquisition of a large part of the shares of the Icelandic Investment Bank by a group, Orca SA in Luxembourg, and strong criticism of leaders of the Independence Party, of which the applicant was the Secretary General. The author of the article, an Advocate named Sigurdur G. Gudjónsson, had advanced the view that members of the general public were not treated equally when at the hands of Independence Party leaders. He recounted events that had occurred in May 1994 when he, a Mr J. O. and several others, had purchased shares in the Islendska útvarpsfélagid (the Icelandic Broadcasting Company, hereinafter referred to as “the IBC”). The acquisition created a new shareholder majority in the IBC. Following a change in the IBC’s Board of Directors, the Islandsbanki had withdrawn a loan offer to, and had in fact broken off with, the IBC. The article further stated that the Islandsbanki’s Managing Director and the former Chairperson of its Board of Directors had close family ties and that the Chairperson was a member of the Independence Party’s Finance Committee. The article then went on (the two passages in italics were the subject of defamation proceedings brought by the applicant):', '“At this point, we approached Landsbanki. The Chairperson of Landsbanki’s Board of Directors at the time was [the applicant], Secretary General of the Independence Party and Chairperson of the Broadcasting Licensing Committee, which is concerned with the affairs of independent Broadcasting stations. On 29 July 1994, the IBC received a letter from Landsbanki, notifying that it declined to do any business with the IBC. No explanations were given, but those of us [the respondent and other shareholders] who represented the IBC in the negotiations with the Bank were told that [the applicant] was opposed to Landsbanki’s doing business with a company where Mr J. O. was involved. No formal negotiations took place with the other State owned bank, Bunadarbanki, as we were told in informal discussions that it could not take up business with the IBC as some of its shareholders who had lost their majority holdings in the IBC at the share holders’ meeting in July were customers of the bank and might be offended if the bank were to assist the IBC or take up business relations with the IBC. Fortunately there were savings banks in Iceland at the time who regarded business with the IBC as being a positive and lucrative option. Here, decisions regarding business of IBC were made on the basis of interests of the saving banks, not on the basis of what was best for the Independence Party and acceptable to the leaders of the Party’s Finance Committee.”', 'The applicant subsequently brought defamation proceedings against the author of the article, requesting - in addition to compensation - that the following two statements be declared null and void:', '(1) “No explanations were given, but those of us [the respondent and other shareholders] who represented the Company in the negotiations with the Bank were told that [the applicant] was opposed to Landsbanki’s doing business with a company where Mr J.O. was involved.”', '(2)“ Here, decisions regarding business of IBC were made on the basis of interests of the saving banks, not on the basis of what was best for the Independence Party and acceptable to the leaders of the Party’s Finance Committee”.', 'The applicant categorically denied as false the allegation that he had played any part in the decision by Landsbanki (hereinafter “the Bank”) and this was supported by two managing directors. The applicant pointed out that members of the Bank’s Board of Directors normally did not involve themselves in the Bank’s lending activities. He considered the allegations as defamatory in that they accused him of allowing interests other than those of the Bank determine his position regarding the Bank’s business with individual companies and of unlawful conduct, in breach of general business rules and ethics and administrative practice.', 'By a judgment of 3 May 2000 the District Court found for the respondent and against the applicant. The latter appealed but by a judgment of 19 December 2000 the Supreme Court rejected his appeal.', 'The Supreme Court observed that the author of the disputed article had made no attempt to prove that the applicant had been involved in the decision in question. However, he had submitted that the employees of the Bank who had been responsible for assessing the IBC’s credit rating had told him and his associates about the applicant’s involvement. The documentary evidence provided no indication that the refusal of credit could not have been based on legitimate business reasons. The take over by the new majority shareholders had given rise to considerable struggle resulting in some uncertainty about the IBC’s future but everything indicated that things had worked out well.', 'Turning to the impugned statements, the Supreme Court noted that allegation (2) did not specifically address the applicant. As to allegation (1), it observed that the remark did not refer to the Bank’s decision-making process but only to informal explanations offered by its employees – no formal explanation had actually been provided for its withdrawal of the offer of credit. The respondent could only be required to prove what the representatives of the company had been told, by providing statements from the bank’s employees. It would not be sufficient for him merely to provide statements by his associates; he would have to summon the relevant bank employees to give oral evidence before the court. The respondent had refused to do so in order to avoid embarrassing the employees concerned, which was understandable in view of the statutory confidentiality rules in section 43 of the Act on Commercial Banks and Saving Banks applicable to bank employees and the fact that they might be reluctant to give evidence about conduct regarded as embarrassing or even illicit by a member of the Bank’s Board of Directors. Having regard in particular to the context in which the impugned remarks had been made, the applicant’s interest in having them declared null and void could hardly be regarded as sufficient to require the Bank’s employees to give evidence. In the view of the Supreme Court, the respondent could not be required to prove the truth of the disputed remarks as this would be unreasonably difficult for him to do. Considering the applicant’ prominent position within the Independence Party and that he served on the Bank’s Board of Directors and as Chairperson of the Broadcasting Licensing Committee, nominated by the Independence Party and elected by Parliament, as well as the requirement that his work in these areas be independent from his role as Secretary General of the Party, he ought to accept public discussion on these connections. Cautiousness should be observed in any attempts to limit such discussion.', 'In a dissenting opinion Supreme Court Justice Mr Gardar Gislason stated inter alia that it could hardly have been difficult for the respondent author to summon the bank employees to give evidence. Not only had the plaintiff asked him to do so but it could also not be maintained that the bankers would thereby act in breach of confidence contrary to section 43 of the Act on Commercial Banks and Saving Banks. It had not been shown that requiring proof from the respondent would amount to an unreasonable burden being placed on him.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1955 and is currently detained in Aachen Prison.', '6. Between 1978 and 1981 the applicant was convicted, among other offences, of numerous counts of joint burglary committed in companies and shops and was imprisoned from March 1980 until February 1985.', '7. In 1986 the Dortmund Regional Court convicted the applicant of trafficking in drugs (hashish and cocaine) and sentenced him to eight years’ imprisonment. The applicant was in pre-trial detention and served his sentence from August 1985 until June 1993.', '8. In December 1996 the applicant was arrested and placed in pre-trial detention on suspicion of drug trafficking; he has remained in prison since then.', '9. In a judgment dated 9 February 1998 the Aachen Regional Court convicted the applicant of unauthorised importing of drugs and of drug trafficking committed in 1996 and involving some 280 kilos of hashish. It sentenced him to eight years and six months’ imprisonment. It decided not to order the applicant’s preventive detention under Article 66 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 22-23 below) as it was not convinced that the applicant was dangerous to the public owing to a disposition to commit serious offences. In this assessment, the court took into consideration that the applicant had not attempted to avert his punishment by lodging numerous procedural motions and had agreed to the forfeiture of money stemming from drug trafficking. The applicant claimed that he had struck a deal with the Regional Court on the latter’s proposal that the court would impose a sentence of less than ten years and would not order his preventive detention if he ceased to contest the court’s finding of fact. The Government submitted that there was no indication in the case-file that such an agreement had been made.', '10. In a judgment dated 7 April 1999 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed an appeal by the applicant on points of law. It allowed an appeal by the prosecution regarding the Regional Court’s decision not to order the applicant’s preventive detention and quashed the judgment in this respect as the Regional Court had not given valid reasons for considering the applicant not to be dangerous to the public.', '11. In a judgment dated 14 November 2001 a different chamber of the Aachen Regional Court ordered the applicant’s (first) indefinite preventive detention pursuant to Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code. Having consulted a psychiatric expert and having regard to the applicant’s personality and his previous convictions, the court considered that the applicant had a disposition to commit serious offences, was likely to commit further serious drug offences and was thus dangerous to the public.', '12. In a decision dated 31 May 2002 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed as ill-founded an appeal by the applicant on points of law, in which the latter had complained that provisions of substantive law had not been complied with (allgemeine Sachrüge).', '13. On 24 June 2002 the applicant, without being represented by counsel, lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court against the two judgments of the Regional Court and the judgment and the decision of the Federal Court of Justice. He complained, in particular, that preventive detention was incompatible with his right to liberty under Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, which did not cover such a preventive measure. It further violated the prohibition of retrospective punishment under the Basic Law and Article 7 of the Convention because it was incompatible with the principle of legal certainty and because his preventive detention had been ordered without a maximum duration of ten years, which had been the maximum penalty at the time he committed his offences. Furthermore, his right to a fair trial had been breached in that the domestic courts had not subsequently respected the deal struck with the Regional Court that he would not further contest the court’s finding of facts in exchange for the court not ordering his preventive detention.', '14. On 11 March 2004 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 1046/02). The Federal Constitutional Court found that in so far as the applicant complained about the judgment of the Regional Court of 9 February 1998 and that of the Federal Court of Justice of 7 April 1999, he had lodged his constitutional complaint out of time. In so far as the applicant complained that the Regional Court’s order for his preventive detention in its judgment of 14 November 2001 lacked a valid legal basis and was arbitrary, his complaint was inadmissible for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies. The court found that the applicant had failed to submit his statement of the grounds of his appeal on points of law nor had he claimed before it that he had complained about the unconstitutionality of the amended provisions on preventive detention and about their application by the Regional Court to him before the Federal Court of Justice, at least by complaining that provisions of substantive law had not been complied with.', '15. On 13 July 2007 the Bochum Regional Court, acting as the court dealing with the execution of sentences, having heard the applicant in person, ordered the applicant’s placement in preventive detention as of 25 July 2007 (Article 67c § 1 of the Criminal Code; see paragraph 24 below), that is, as from the day on which the applicant would have served his full prison sentence. The court fully agreed with the findings of a psychiatric and psychotherapeutic expert it had consulted on the applicant’s dangerousness. In his report dated 7 May 2007 the expert, having examined the applicant, had considered that, if released, the applicant was very likely to commit further serious offences similar to those he had previously committed. He was still dangerous to the public as he had to date failed to reflect sufficiently on his numerous offences. Even assuming that the security measures taken against him by the prison authorities had not been justified, this did not alter the fact that there had not been a consistent treatment limiting the risk that he would reoffend after his release.', '16. On 6 September 2007 the Hamm Court of Appeal, endorsing the reasons given by the Regional Court, dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '17. On 24 January 2008 the Hamm Court of Appeal rejected an objection (Gegenvorstellung) by the applicant.', '18. On 17 October 2007 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court against the Regional Court’s decision of 13 July 2007 and the Court of Appeal’s decision of 6 September 2007. By submissions dated 3 March 2008 he extended his complaint to the Hamm Court of Appeal’s decision of 24 January 2008. He claimed, in particular, that the order to place him in preventive detention disproportionately interfered with his right to liberty. He argued that the expert report on which the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had relied had not been drawn up in due form, that the courts had failed to give convincing reasons, in view of his mostly less serious previous convictions, why he was likely to commit further serious offences if released and that he had been refused relaxations in the conditions of his detention without convincing reasons.', '19. On 14 July 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 2356/07). It found, in particular, that the decisions of the courts dealing with the execution of sentences to order the applicant’s placement in preventive detention had not violated the applicant’s right to liberty. The Federal Constitutional Court found that the Regional Court’s assessment that the applicant had repeatedly committed serious offences was not arbitrary as the latter had been sentenced to one term of eight years’ imprisonment and another of eight years and six months. The expert report, which was of recent date, was sufficiently substantiated. In so far as the applicant had been refused relaxations in the conditions of his detention, the Constitutional Court noted that the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had not based their decision to order preventive detention globally on the fact that the applicant had failed to prove that he was no longer dangerous in the course of such relaxations. If the prison authorities refused to grant the applicant relaxations in the conditions of his detention in the future, the applicant had to raise this issue with the competent lower courts first. In view of the courts’ assessment that the applicant was likely to commit further serious offences if released, their finding that the interest in public safety prevailed over the applicant’s right to liberty had been proportionate.', '20. On 12 August 2009 the Aachen Regional Court, acting as the court dealing with the execution of sentences, refused to suspend the execution of the preventive detention order against the applicant on probation. That decision was confirmed on appeal.', '21. A comprehensive summary of the provisions of the Criminal Code and of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the distinction between penalties and measures of correction and prevention, in particular preventive detention, and the making, review and execution in practice of preventive detention orders, is contained in the Court’s judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (no. 19359/04, §§ 45-78, 17 December 2009). The provisions referred to in the present case provide as follows:', '22. The sentencing court may, at the time of the offender’s conviction, order his preventive detention, a socalled measure of correction and prevention, under certain circumstances in addition to his prison sentence, a penalty, if the offender has been shown to be dangerous to the public (Article 66 of the Criminal Code).', '23. In particular, the sentencing court orders preventive detention in addition to the penalty if someone is sentenced for an intentional offence to at least two years’ imprisonment and if the following further conditions are satisfied. Firstly, the perpetrator must have been sentenced twice already, to at least one year’s imprisonment in each case, for intentional offences committed prior to the new offence. Secondly, the perpetrator must previously have served a prison sentence or must have been detained pursuant to a measure of correction and prevention for at least two years. Thirdly, a comprehensive assessment of the perpetrator and his acts must reveal that, owing to his propensity to commit serious offences, notably those which seriously harm their victims physically or mentally or which cause serious economic damage, the perpetrator presents a danger to the general public (see Article 66 § 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force at the relevant time).', '24. Article 67c § 1 of the Criminal Code provides that if a term of imprisonment is executed prior to a simultaneously ordered placement in preventive detention, the court responsible for the execution of sentences (that is, a special Chamber of the Regional Court composed of three professional judges, see sections 78a and 78b(1)(1) of the Court Organisation Act) must review, before completion of the prison term, whether the person’s preventive detention is still necessary in view of its objective. If that is not the case, it suspends on probation the execution of the preventive detention order; supervision of the person’s conduct commences with suspension.', '25. Under Article 67d § 1 of the Criminal Code, in its version in force prior to 31 January 1998, the first placement in preventive detention may not exceed ten years. If the maximum duration has expired, the detainee shall be released (Article 67d § 3).', '26. Article 67d of the Criminal Code was amended by the Combating of Sexual Offences and Other Dangerous Offences Act of 26 January 1998, which entered into force on 31 January 1998. Article 67d § 3, in its amended version, provided that if a person has spent ten years in preventive detention, the court shall declare the measure terminated (only) if there is no danger that the detainee will, owing to his criminal tendencies, commit serious offences resulting in considerable psychological or physical harm to the victims. Termination shall automatically entail supervision of the conduct of the offender. The former maximum duration of a first period of preventive detention was abolished. Pursuant to section 1a § 3 of the Introductory Act to the Criminal Code, the amended version of Article 67d § 3 of the Criminal Code was to be applied without any restriction ratione temporis.', '27. Under the well-established case-law of the Federal Constitutional Court, a complainant is obliged to submit to that court, within the onemonth time-limit running from the notification of the impugned court decision, either a copy of the impugned decisions and of all documents necessary for their understanding or at least to set out their content in a manner allowing for a control of their constitutionality (see, inter alia, the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court of 16 December 1992, file no. 1 BvR 167/87, Collection of the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfGE), vol. 88 (1993), pp. 40 ss., 45; of 10 October 1995, file nos. 1 BvR 1476, 1980/91 and 102, 221/92, Collection of the decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court, vol. 93 (1996), pp. 266 ss., 288; confirmed, for instance, by a decision of 18 March 2009, file no. 2 BvR 1350/08). No distinction was made in these decisions between complainants who were and those who were not represented by counsel.', '28. On 4 May 2011 the Federal Constitutional Court delivered a leading judgment concerning the retrospective prolongation of the complainants’ preventive detention beyond the former ten-year maximum period (compare the provisions in paragraphs 25-26 above) and about the retrospective order of the complainants’ preventive detention respectively (file nos. 2 BvR 2365/09, 2 BvR 740/10, 2 BvR 2333/08, 2 BvR 1152/10 and 2 BvR 571/10). The Federal Constitutional Court held that all provisions on the retrospective prolongation of preventive detention and on the retrospective order of such detention were incompatible with the Basic Law as they failed to comply with the constitutional protection of legitimate expectations guaranteed in a State governed by the rule of law, read in conjunction with the constitutional right to liberty.', '29. The Federal Constitutional Court further held that all provisions of the Criminal Code on the imposition and duration of preventive detention at issue were incompatible with the fundamental right to liberty of the persons in preventive detention because those provisions did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of establishing a difference between preventive detention and detention for serving a term of imprisonment (Abstandsgebot). These provisions included, in particular, Article 66 of the Criminal Code in its version in force since 27 December 2003.', '30. The Federal Constitutional Court ordered that all provisions declared incompatible with the Basic Law remained applicable until the entry into force of new legislation and until 31 May 2013 at the most. In relation to detainees whose preventive detention had been prolonged or ordered retrospectively, the courts dealing with the execution of sentences had to examine without delay whether the persons concerned, owing to specific circumstances relating to their person or their conduct, were highly likely to commit the most serious crimes of violence or sexual offences and if, additionally, they suffered from a mental disorder. As regards the notion of mental disorder, the Federal Constitutional Court explicitly referred to the interpretation of the notion of “persons of unsound mind” in Article 5 § 1 sub-paragraph (e) of the Convention made in this Court’s case-law. If the above pre-conditions were not met, those detainees had to be released no later than 31 December 2011. The other provisions on the imposition and duration of preventive detention could only be further applied in the transitional period subject to a strict review of proportionality; as a general rule, proportionality was only respected where there was a danger of the person concerned committing serious crimes of violence or sexual offences if released.', '31. In its judgment, the Federal Constitutional Court stressed that the fact that the Constitution stood above the Convention in the domestic hierarchy of norms was not an obstacle to an international and European dialogue between the courts, but was, on the contrary, its normative basis in view of the fact that the Constitution was to be interpreted in a manner that was open to public international law (völkerrechtsfreundliche Auslegung). In its reasoning, the Federal Constitutional Court relied on the interpretation of Article 5 and Article 7 of the Convention made by this Court in its judgment in the case of M. v. Germany (cited above).']",[],[],[],['5'],['5-1'],[],0

The applicant was born in 1958 and currently lives in Łódź.', '6. On 14 February 2007 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of several counts of fraud and incitement to murder committed in an organised criminal group.', '7. On 16 February 2007 the Katowice District Court remanded him in custody, relying on the reasonable suspicion that he had committed the offences in question. It attached importance to the serious nature of those offences and the likelihood of a severe prison sentence being imposed on the applicant. In this connection the court noted that the applicant had admitted to having committed some of the offences of which he had been suspected, including incitement to murder. It also considered that keeping the applicant in detention was necessary to secure the proper conduct of the proceedings, given the risk that he might go into hiding. As regards the latter, the court relied on the fact that he did not have a permanent place of residence in Poland and that he had already been hiding from the police. Finally, the court underlined that the applicant was a member of an organised criminal group and that some other members of that group were still at large which increased the risk that a detainee, if released, might obstruct the proceedings.', '8. The applicant’s appeal against the detention order, likewise his further appeals against decisions extending his detention and all his subsequent applications for release and appeals against refusals to release him, were unsuccessful.', '9. In April 2007 the applicant had a heart attack and had to be hospitalised three times during that year.', '10. In the course of the investigation, the applicant’s detention was extended on several occasions, namely on 7 May 2007 (to 7 October 2007), 10 September 2007 (to 7 January 2008) and on an unspecified subsequent date. In their detention decisions the courts repeatedly relied on the original grounds given for the applicant’s detention underlining the complexity of the case and the substantial volume of evidence to be examined. They also found no grounds warranting the applicant’s release from detention as provided for by Article 259 of the Criminal Code. In particular, the courts observed that it resulted from medical reports that the applicant could be treated within a penitentiary facility.', '11. On 10 June 2008 the Katowice Regional Prosecutor lodged a bill of indictment with the Katowice Regional Court. The applicant was charged with an incitement to murder as well as several counts of thefts and extortions committed while acting as a leader of an organised criminal group. The bill of indictment comprised numerous charges brought against several defendants.', '12. On 23 June 2008 the case was transferred to the Gliwice Regional Court.', '13. In an opinion of 26 February 2009 experts from the cardiology institute of the Medical University in Katowice declared the applicant fit to participate in the proceedings, though limiting the duration of the hearings.', '14. During the court proceedings the courts further extended the applicant’s detention, namely on 24 September 2008 (to 14 February 2009), on unspecified subsequent dates and 23 June 2010 (to 30 September 2010). The courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s continued detention.', '15. On 30 June 2010 the Gliwice Regional Court gave judgment. The applicant was convicted as charged and sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.', '16. The applicant and the Prosecutor appealed.', '17. On 24 March 2011 the Katowice Court of Appeal decided that the applicant be released from custody and placed under police supervision. The court also barred the applicant from leaving the country.', '18. It appears that the appellate proceedings against the applicant are still pending.', '19. The relevant domestic law and practice concerning the imposition of pre-trial detention (tymczasowe aresztowanie), the grounds for its extension, release from detention and rules governing other, so-called “preventive measures” (środki zapobiegawcze) are stated in the Court’s judgments in the cases of Gołek v.

Mr J.P. (“the second applicant”) is a Polish national born in 1954. The applicants live in Poland.', 'Since 2000 the applicants had been co-habiting. On 19 June 2001 the first applicant give birth to a boy, L.P.', 'On 6 August 2001 L.P.’s maternal grandparents, Mrs T.G. and Mr M.G., lodged with the Poznań District Court a foster family application. They asked the court to deprive the applicants of their parental rights in respect of L.P. and designate themselves as the boy’s foster family. T.G. and M.G. submitted that since 6 August 2001 L.P. had remained in Śrem Hospital as a result of the first applicant’s negligence. They pointed out that the boy, who was two months old, had been admitted to the hospital because he was emaciated. He weighed only 3,450 grams, whereas his weight at the time of his birth was 3,700 grams. Moreover, T.G. and M.G. submitted that the first applicant suffered from a serious disability. In particular, she suffered from infantile cerebral paralysis, paraparesis, and was mentally retarded. The applicants lived in a building owned by the state railway company which was located near the railway and did not have any sanitary facilities. The toilet was situated in the courtyard and there was no running water, which had to be fetched from a well. The applicants could not afford to pay the rent, electricity and heating bills, and the second applicant could not earn money to pay those bills because he was receiving a disability allowance.', 'On 20 August 2001 T.G. and M.G. made an application to the Poznań District Court for an interim residence order requiring L.P. to reside with them.', 'On 27 August 2001 the Poznań District Court made an interim residence order requiring L.P. to reside with his maternal grandparents. At the same time it decided that the foster family application should be transmitted to the Środa Wielkopolska District Court. The court referred to Article 569 of the Code of Civil Procedure and gave the following reasons for its decision:', '“The minor L. was born on 19 June 2001 out of a relationship between R.G. and J.P. Both parents are handicapped pensioners. R.G. suffered from infantile cerebral paralysis. The family lives in very bad accommodation, which does not have running water, a bathroom or a toilet. The flat is damp, neglected and requires renovation.', 'The parents are unable to properly take care of the child because of their disabilities. In addition, they are in a very difficult financial situation as they receive disability allowances in the total amount of PLN 961 and they are helped by the social services in Śrem. On 6 August 2001 the child was admitted to the hospital because of underweight and malnutrition. While the boy remained in the hospital his condition improved. He requires proper nutrition and care. The minor’s grandparents – the applicants – have proper conditions to provide the child with adequate care.', 'The court has established the foregoing facts on the basis of the information received from the Śrem Hospital, where the minor L. is hospitalised, and social services in Kórnik. This information makes it clear that the child’s parents are unable to provide him with proper care because of their disabilities and inadequate accommodation.', 'In these circumstances, the court has come to the conclusion that the well-being of the minor child is threatened – this is also shown by the child’s malnutrition. It has therefore decided to issue an interim residence order under Article 569 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The background check carried out in respect of the minor’s maternal grandparents has confirmed that they have proper conditions to take care of the child until the end of the proceedings and clarification of the situation of the family.”', 'On 31 August 2001 the applicants filed with the Poznań Regional Court an appeal against the decision of 27 August 2001. The first applicant made allegations of abuse against her parents in the appeal and submitted that they should not be given the custody of L.P. as he might suffer the same abuse.', 'On 13 November 2001 the Poznań Regional Court dismissed the applicants’ appeal. The Regional Court agreed with the reasoning of the District Court. In addition, it noted that L.P. was four months old, i.e., was of the age when the most important processes in the development of a child took place. Therefore, a situation where such a minor was in the custody of the parents who could not provide him with proper hygiene and nutrition amounted to an urgent case.', 'On an unspecified date in 2002 the applicants married.', 'In February 2002 J.P. approached the Poznań Committee for the Protection of the Rights of a Child (Terenowy Komitet Ochrony Praw Dziecka). The Committee carried out interviews in the neighbourhoods where the applicants and T.G. and M.G. lived, as well as in the health centre in Szczodrzykowo and social services in Kórnik. On 29 March 2002 the Committee sent to the Środa Wielkopolska District Court a letter in which it submitted that the application to deprive the applicants of the parental rights was unjustified. The letter was signed by a pedagogue and a psychologist and emphasised that the applicants were “morally and materially competent to take care of their child”. The letter also expressed the Committee’s astonishment that social services in Kórnik, which were responsible for helping parents, supported the removal of the child from their custody.', 'On 26 August 2002 the applicants asked the Środa Wielkopolska District Court to order T.G. and M.G. to undergo psychiatric examination.', 'On 27 August 2002 the applicants decided that they would stop visiting their son because of the hostile attitude of the grandparents.', 'On 4 September 2002 the applicants filed with the President of the Środa Wielkopolska District Court a request challenging the presiding judge.

It included the following conclusions:', '“1/ presently the emotional bonds of the minor L.P. with the grandparents are the strongest as they have been taking care of him since September 2001 (i.e. for 16 months). The minor considers the grandparents to be his closest persons, he feels loved and safe in their presence, shows them his feelings and spontaneously receives from them signs of affection and closeness;', '2/ the emotional bonds between the child and the biological parents have been loosened because of the lack of constant positive contacts between them. The meetings of the parents with the son showed emotional tension which resulted from the conflicts between the biological parents and the present carers of the child (...);', '3/ the psychological condition of R.P. does not allow her presently and in the future to take care of the child on her own. [It is characterized by] low intellectual ability, significant mental and social immaturity, low level of critical assessment of her abilities and behaviour, excessive dependence on dominant personalities – including that of her husband, lack of ability to receive and show feelings, lack of proper assessment of the development needs of a child, as well as lack of sufficient predisposition and abilities to direct a child;', 'R.P. has suffered from infantile cerebral paralysis and her mobility is limited. She needs constant support and help from others. For the above reasons the biological mother is not able to fully secure the emotional and psychomotor needs of the child as well as the proper living conditions and accommodation;', '4/ despite the help declared by the child’s father, who himself is ill and has low educational capabilities, it is impossible to provide the minor L. with the proper conditions for his development if he is given over to the permanent and direct care of the biological parents;', '5/ from the psychological and medical point of view, both parents do not guarantee the proper care of the child and the proper stimulation of his development. Both parents are disabled, have very low incomes and modest accommodation – without basic facilities (toilet located outside, no running water which is taken from a well);', '6/ in view of the above, we consider that it is in the best interest of the minor L.P. to stay with the foster family of grandparents (...) who presently give the best guarantee of providing the child with better living conditions;', '7/ in order to provide the child with direct contacts with his biological parents and to secure his proper emotional development we suggest that R.P. and J.P. take the minor L. for a walk twice a week (...) and in addition take him to their flat in the first and third weekend of the month (...);', '8/ the supervision of both parents by a court curator is necessary in order to know whether they properly fulfil their obligations relating to the care and education of the minor L.P.;', '9/ we suggest that after a year a new examination take place in our centre in order to decide whether the change of the present recommendations is necessary;', '10/ if the court curator finds gross negligence on the part of the biological parents, consideration should be given again to the application to deprive R.P. and J.P. of the parental rights over their son;', '11/ it has proved impossible to mediate between the parties in our centre in view of the lack of mutual understanding and negative attitudes to each other (...);', '12/ the most difficult problem to solve in the present case is the lack of proper relationship between the parties. We think that a psycho corrective approach should be taken in that respect (...).”', 'On 25 February 2003 the applicants submitted to the Środa Wielkopolska District Court a letter in which they contested the conclusions of the expert opinion.', 'On 27 March 2003 a hearing took place before the Środa Wielkopolska District Court.

On 1 August 1996 the Hozat public prosecutor issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction (görevsizlik kararı) and passed the investigation to the Elazığ military prosecutor’s office.', '11. On 30 November 2004 the first applicant filed a petition with the Hozat public prosecutor’s office. In her petition, she stated that forty days after the disappearance of her husband, she had found a body in the vicinity of their village. She had thought that it was her husband, as she had recognised the buttons of the shirt on the body. Noting that there had been no investigation into Hasan Çiçek’s disappearance, she requested that an investigation be conducted.', '12. On 11 January 2005 the Hozat public prosecutor heard the first applicant, who reiterated her request.', '13. On 2 February 2005 the Hozat public prosecutor issued a decision not to prosecute in respect of the first applicant’s allegations. In his decision, the public prosecutor noted that the first applicant had filed a petition with the public prosecutor’s office in 1994, at which time she had also handed over a raincoat and empty cartridges which she had found in the vicinity of their village to the public prosecutor, and that there had been a previous decision not to prosecute issued on 1 August 1996 which had been based on a lack of jurisdiction. He further noted that the first applicant had not submitted any new evidence and that her previous allegations had already been dealt with by the public prosecutor’s office. The public prosecutor concluded that there was no reason to initiate an investigation into the first applicant’s complaints.', '14. On 10 February 2005 Zeynep Çiçek objected to the decision of 2 February 2005. The objection was rejected by the Erzincan Assize Court on 21 November 2005.', '15. In the meantime, on 22 February 2005 the Malatya public prosecutor issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction in relation to six cases of disappearance, including that of Hasan Çiçek. In his decision, the public prosecutor noted that it had been alleged that Hasan Çiçek’s body had been found. The public prosecutor referred the cases to the Hozat public prosecutor’s office.', '16. On 14 April 2005 the Elazığ military public prosecutor’s office issued a decision based on a lack of jurisdiction in relation to the aforementioned six cases of disappearance, including that of Hasan Çiçek, holding that the military public prosecutor’s office at the General Gendarmerie Command had jurisdiction.', '17. The first applicant’s husband and the remaining applicants’ father, Nazım Gülmez, lived in the village of Taşıtlı, which is located within the administrative jurisdiction of Tunceli, in south-east Turkey.', '18. According to the applicants, in October 1994 Nazım Gülmez was taken from his house by a group of soldiers so that he could help them by using his familiarity with the area to act as a guide. Nine neighbours witnessed the incident. Nothing has been heard from him since that date.', '19. The mayor of the town of Hozat and mayors of the nearby towns sent a joint letter to the office of the Prime Minister. In their letter the mayors stated that large scale military operations had been conducted in their areas in October 1994. During the operations a large number of houses had been burnt down and a number of villagers – including Mr Gülmez – had been taken away by the soldiers. The bodies of two of the villagers had subsequently been found but nothing had been heard from the remaining villagers. No response was given to this letter by the Prime Minister’s office.', '20. In 2002 the applicant Meneş Gülmez made an official complaint to the Hozat prosecutor. However, on 13 December 2002 the prosecutor decided that military prosecutors had jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance. In January 2003 the applicants made an application to the Elazığ military prosecutor and asked for those responsible for the disappearance to be prosecuted.', '21. As no response was received from the military prosecutor, the family submitted another petition on 12 January 2004. They also stated in their petition that the military prosecutors were not allowing them to consult the investigation file.', '22. On 25 January 2005 the Elazığ military prosecutor’s office informed the applicants that the investigation file had been forwarded to the Malatya State Security Court’s prosecutor.', '23. On 22 February 2005 the Malatya prosecutor decided that his office lacked jurisdiction to investigate the killings and disappearances of six people, including the disappearance of Mr Nazım Gülmez. The investigation files were forwarded to the prosecutor’s office in the town of Hozat. According to this decision, the first applicant, Garip Gülmez, had been questioned by the prosecutor and had stated that her husband had been taken away from their home by soldiers.', '24. On 14 April 2005 the Elazığ military prosecutor decided that his office also lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearances and killings and sent the investigation files to the military prosecutor’s office in Ankara. It appears from this decision that the Hozat prosecutor had decided on 25 March 2005 that his office did not have jurisdiction either. It also appears from the decision that, according to the Hozat prosecutor’s decision, there was evidence showing that a number of villagers had been taken away from their villages by soldiers and that nothing had been heard from those villagers since.', '25. According to the applicants, on 7 June 1995 the first applicant’s husband, Edip Aksoy, and the second applicant’s son, Orhan Cingöz, were bundled into an unmarked car in Diyarbakır by three plain-clothed members of the security forces and taken away to an unknown location. Two of their friends witnessed the incident.', '26. In the course of the following days and years, the applicants and their families made a number of applications to various domestic authorities, including the local prosecutors, the State Security Court, local governors, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of the Interior. Most of their requests for information received no response. On some occasions they were told that the two men were not in custody. The disappearance of the two men was reported in the national media.', '27. On 9 August 2001 the first applicant, Ms Aksoy, submitted a written petition to the Diyarbakır prosecutor. She alleged that her husband had been arrested and detained on a number of occasions prior to his disappearance on 7 June 1995. She asked the prosecutor to inform her as to whether there had been any developments in the investigation into the disappearance of the two men.', '28. On 4 September 2001 the second applicant, Ms Cingöz, also submitted a written petition to the Diyarbakır prosecutor and asked for information about the investigation into the disappearance of her son.', '29. On the same date the prosecutor questioned the second applicant and recorded her statement. She gave the prosecutor the names of the eyewitnesses to the incident.', '30. On 6 July 2005 the applicants were questioned by a prosecutor in the town of Silopi in the presence of their two lawyers. The first applicant gave the prosecutor a copy of a national newspaper article published in 2004, in which it was reported that the two men had been killed by members of the security forces and then buried in a river bed next to Cudi Mountain. The newspaper article was based on information given by Mr Abdülkadir Aygan, a former agent of the JİTEM (Jandarma İstihbarat Terörle Mücadele – the anti-terror intelligence branch of the gendarmerie). A number of investigations had already been instigated into Mr Aygan’s allegations and the bodies of a number of individuals had been found in the locations described by him.', '31. When the applicants were shown photographs of the bodies of people killed in the area, they told the prosecutor that two of the dead men looked like their disappeared relatives. They asked the prosecutor to identify the bodies and, if it was established that the bodies were indeed those of their relatives, they asked for the bodies to be returned to them.', '32. The prosecutor ordered the exhumation of the remains of two people who had been killed in 1995 and whose bodies had been buried by the local authorities that year because no relative had claimed them. A DNA analysis conducted in 2006 showed that the two men were not the applicants’ disappeared relatives.', '33. On 6 August 2008 the Diyarbakır prosecutor decided to close the investigation because the statute of limitations had expired. In the prosecutor’s decision, the offence was qualified as “deprivation of liberty”, for which the prescription period was ten years. The prosecutor considered that nothing had happened in the course of the ten years to stop the running of the time-limit. According to the documents submitted by the applicants, the prosecutor’s decision was only communicated to the first applicant, Ms Aksoy.', '34. On 19 September 2008 the first applicant, with the assistance of her lawyer, lodged an objection with the Siverek Assize Court against the prosecutor’s decision. She stated that a number of newspaper articles had detailed how her husband and Mr Cingöz had been killed and where they were buried.', '35. The objection was dismissed by the Siverek Assize Court on 25 November 2008. The Siverek Court did not respond to the first applicant’s arguments concerning the newspaper articles. The decision was communicated to the applicants’ lawyer on 3 January 2009.', '36. In July 1995 the applicant’s 30-year-old son, Ahmet Yaman, was summoned to the Uludere District Gendarmerie Station. When he failed to return, the applicant went to the gendarmerie station to look for him. She was told that her son had been handed over to the military in Şırnak.', '37. After receiving no news from her son for about a week, the applicant made an official complaint at the Uludere prosecutor’s office on 11 July 1995, and asked for her son to be found.', '38. In October 1995 the Uludere prosecutor decided that he lacked jurisdiction to investigate the disappearance because, according to two eyewitnesses heard by him, the applicant’s son had disappeared in Şırnak, which was outside his jurisdiction. The prosecutor therefore forwarded the file to his opposite number in Şırnak. It also appears from the prosecutor’s decision that, in a letter sent to him on 18 July 1995, the Uludere Gendarmerie Station officials denied having summoned the applicant’s son to their station.', '39. The applicant claimed that for a period of almost fourteen years she had visited various prosecutors’ offices on hundreds of occasions and had asked unsuccessfully for information about her son.', '40. On 1 June 2009 the applicant, with the assistance of two legal representatives, sent a letter to the Şırnak prosecutor’s office and asked for information about the investigation into the disappearance. She claimed that the failure to find and prosecute those responsible for her son’s disappearance was in breach of Articles 2, 6 and 13 of the Convention and of applicable domestic law.', '41. On 4 June 2009 the Şırnak prosecutor informed the applicant that the investigation into the disappearance of her son had been closed on 18 March 1996 by a decision of his office not to prosecute on account of a lack of evidence.', '42. According to the decision of 18 March 1996, the Şırnak prosecutor’s office had been informed by the Şırnak Provincial Gendarmerie Command on 7 November 1995 that Ahmet Yaman had not been detained by them. The Şırnak prosecutor had also enquired as to the accuracy of two eyewitness statements to the effect that Ahmet Yaman had been put in a helicopter in Uludere and flown to Şırnak. In their reply of 1 December 1995 the Şırnak Gendarmerie had informed the Şırnak prosecutor that, although there were no regular helicopter flights between Uludere and Şırnak, the military did use helicopters between the two locations when the need arose. Thus, it was impossible to establish whether a helicopter flight had been made to Uludere on the day in question.', '43. It also appears from the prosecutor’s decision that the applicant had informed the investigating authorities that the Şırnak Regiment’s Commander had visited a café in Uludere and told those present in the café, which had included civilians and village guards, that Ahmet Yaman was in Şırnak and would soon be released. When questioned by the Şırnak prosecutor, however, the village guards present during the commander’s visit had stated that the commander had not said anything about Ahmet Yaman.', '44. Upon receiving the Şırnak prosecutor’s decision of 18 March 1996 on 4 June 2009, the applicant’s legal representatives filed an objection against it. They argued that the investigation by the Şırnak prosecutor had been inadequate. They submitted that important leads had not been followed up, not all eyewitnesses had been heard, and the prosecutor had been content to accept the written replies received from the military, rather than questioning them in person.', '45. The objection was rejected by the Siirt Assize Court on 13 August 2009 on the grounds that the two legal representatives “had not been representing the applicant at the time of the adoption of the prosecutor’s decision of 18 March 1996 and the objection was thus filed outside the statutory timelimit”.', '46. The Assize Court’s decision was communicated to the applicant’s lawyers on 25 August 2009.', '47. Unbeknown to the applicant, on 30 September 2009 the Minister of Justice asked the Court of Cassation to set aside the Siirt Assize Court’s judgment because, the Minister argued, the applicant had lodged the objection within the time-limit foreseen in the applicable statute.', '48. The Court of Cassation accepted the Ministry’s request on 13 January 2010 and quashed the Siirt Assize Court’s decision of 13 August 2009. Subsequently, the Siirt Assize Court examined the applicant’s objection against the Şırnak prosecutor’s decision and accepted it. The Assize Court ordered the prosecutor to carry out a new investigation into the disappearance of the applicant’s son.', '49. The new investigation started by the Şırnak prosecutor is still pending.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
001-22174,ENG,GBR,ADMISSIBILITY,2002,OYSTON v. THE UNITED KINGDOM,3,Inadmissible,Matti Pellonpää;Nicolas Bratza,"['The applicant, Owen Oyston, is a United Kingdom national, who was born in 1934 and lives in Lancaster, England. He is represented before the Court by Mr David Price, a lawyer practising in London.', 'The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', 'On 22 May 1996, the applicant was convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court of raping and indecently assaulting a young woman, J. He was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment for rape and three years’ imprisonment for indecent assault, the two sentences to run concurrently. The applicant was acquitted at the same time of raping a second woman, B.', 'The background of the case may be described as follows. When J. was aged 14 she joined a modelling agency in Manchester and began attending weekend classes. The agency was owned by Peter Martin, a friend of the applicant, and the weekend classes took place at Martin’s home. When J. was aged 15, she started staying overnight at Martin’s house on Fridays and Saturdays. A number of other girls aged between 13 and 20 also stayed at the house. Martin exerted control over the girls, to the extent that he would tell them what to wear, what to eat, when to wash and when to go to bed. J. left school when she was aged 16 and went to live permanently at Martin’s house at about Easter 1992. Martin used to take the girls to restaurants. On one such occasion, about eight weeks after J. began living with him, Martin pointed out the applicant to her, telling her that he was “a very important man and dead rich”. About two weeks later, when Martin, J. and another girl from the agency L. were at the restaurant, the applicant was also present. After the meal, Martin said that they were to drive the applicant home in Martin’s car.', 'At the trial, J. gave evidence that she got into the back of the car at Martin’s suggestion, while L. sat in the front with Martin who was driving. J. stated that during the journey the applicant forced her to have oral sex with him. On arrival at the applicant’s home, Martin told J. and L. to get out as the applicant wanted to show them his house. J. followed the applicant and L. and ended up in a bedroom. The applicant and L., who was his girlfriend, had sexual intercourse. The applicant then told J. to take off her clothes and made her have sexual intercourse with him. J. and L. then left the house and joined Martin who was waiting in the car. J. said that she did as the applicant wanted because she was dominated by Martin, and was afraid of upsetting the applicant, whom she knew to be Martin’s friend.', 'J. contacted the police in October 1994. On 9 February 1995, the applicant was arrested and charged with a number of offences of a sexual nature allegedly committed against young women from the modelling agency. Martin, who had been arrested in September 1994 was also charged with a number of offences of a sexual nature committed against young women from the modelling agency, including the rape of J.', 'The applicant was originally charged with six offences. His defence to each charge was that the event alleged had never taken place. The applicant’s evidence was that he had no recollection of J. having visited his home, and that there had been no contact of a sexual nature between him and J. at any time.', 'At the end of J.’s examination in chief by the prosecution, the applicant’s leading counsel obtained leave from the trial judge pursuant to section 2(1) of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 (see below) to cross-examine J. on her sexual experiences with Martin, and in particular on the fact that she had been raped by Martin and about the alleged control that he exerted over her. It was the defence case that J. was obsessed with a hatred of Martin and it was this which motivated her allegation against the applicant. J. was extremely distressed by this cross-examination.', 'L. gave evidence for the defence. She had started working at Martin’s agency when aged 11 and had begun a relationship with the applicant when aged 16. She stated that on one occasion she had travelled to the applicant’s home with Martin, the applicant (with whom she was then having a relationship) and J.; that Martin had driven the car, she had travelled in the front passenger seat, and the applicant and J. had travelled in the back of the car; that L. had gone into the applicant’s bedroom in order to use the toilet in the en suite bathroom. When L. came out of the toilet, she saw J. and the applicant lying on the bed, fully clothed. They all then left. Nothing improper occurred.', 'L. was asked in cross-examination by the prosecution about her relationship with the applicant, who had been introduced to her by Martin. She was also asked about sexual relationships with other men introduced to her by Martin. She accepted that she had had sexual intercourse with four of the men, when she was aged between 16 and 19 years, and in the case of two of the men, while she was still conducting a relationship with the applicant. When re-examined by defence counsel, she described these relationships as “almost dirty or sordid” and contrasted them with her relationship with the applicant, which she said was “[r]omantic, how it should have been”. L. was also asked by prosecution counsel about an abortion which she had had at around this time, and was asked whether she had had “three in a bed” sex involving the applicant.', 'No reference was made to L.’s sexual experience by either counsel in their closing speeches, or by the judge in summing up the case for the jury. The jury proceeded to convict the applicant.', 'On 12 June 1997, the Court of Appeal granted the applicant’s application for leave to appeal against conviction and sentence. The applicant applied at the same time for leave to adduce fresh evidence, in the form of a number of witnesses whose evidence was not available at the trial because, the applicant submitted, he was unaware of their existence or of the fact that they had material to make available to him. One of the witnesses was a young man with whom J. had had a sexual relationship while on holiday in Crete in 1992, and to whom she had subsequently written a letter, a copy of which formed part of the fresh evidence which it was sought to adduce. The Court of Appeal gave the applicant leave to amend his grounds of appeal in order to contend that his convictions were in all the circumstances unsafe, having regard to the fresh evidence.', 'Lord Bingham CJ said, in giving judgment granting leave:', '“While we conclude that these witnesses are not in a position to give evidence which would have been admissible at the trial, we nonetheless consider that this is material which could have been used to attack the credit of J. and which the applicant should be free to draw to the attention of the court in support of his submission that in the light of these materials and of the case as a whole this court should consider the convictions of the applicant to be unsafe.”', 'On 9 December 1997, the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal against conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal received the fresh evidence under section 23(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968, and then considered its significance in the context of the appeal. Phillips LJ said, in giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal:', '“...the full Court ruled that we should give the new material such weight as it deserves when considering the extent to which the credit of J. might have been shaken had it been available to the defence at the time of the trial. The Court did not consider, however, that it amounted to evidence which could be placed before the jury. Before us [applicant’s counsel] challenged that conclusion. He submitted that where, as here, the prosecution case turns exclusively on the evidence of the complainant, evidence that bears on the credit of the complainant is not merely collateral, but goes to the heart of the case... It seemed to us somewhat arid to invite lengthy argument about the basis upon which we should consider the significance of the new material. If it proved such as to to lead us to doubt the credibility of the complainant, we would be loth to entertain argument that the convictions should nonetheless stand because of a technical rule of evidence against the admissibility of evidence going solely as to credit. ... In these circumstances, we decided that the convenient course was to receive the evidence under section 23(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 and, having done so, to evaluate the significance of that material.”', 'As regarded the significance of the evidence of J.’s holiday on Crete when it was alleged that she had had sexual intercourse with a young man, Lord Phillips said:', '“[Applicant’s counsel] urged that this evidence was significant and could have been admitted by the Judge on three bases:', '(1) it showed that J. was not as vulnerable as she appeared.', '(2) it had significance in relation to a pregnancy test.', '(3) the evidence was in conflict with other evidence J. had given and thus tended to destroy her credibility.', 'J.’s vulnerable appearance', 'To seek to introduce this evidence simply to counter the general impression that J. was making in the witness box would have been a paradigm example of the type of conduct that section 2 of the 1976 Act is designed to prevent. We have no doubt that the judge would have refused an application made on that basis. The fact that J. had enjoyed the brief relationship with a young man, which is reflected by the letter, whether before or after the date on which the offences were alleged to have been committed by the [applicant], is of itself of no relevance to the question of whether she was raped and indecently assaulted by a man nearly four times her age.', 'The pregnancy test', 'J. had a pregnancy test on 16th June 1992. The defence were aware of this, but naturally asked her nothing about it. The new material indicates that the test probably resulted from anxiety as a result of having had sexual intercourse with [the young man in Crete] so that it would have been safe to cross-examine as to why J. did not have a pregnancy test after the alleged rape by the [applicant]. This argument does not attach intrinsic significance to the evidence itself, nor constitute any reason why it should have been introduced at trial. There are various reasons why the victim of a rape might not think it necessary to have a pregnancy test and the fact that the defence refrained from asking about this under a misapprehension does not affect the safety of the verdicts.”', 'Concerning alleged inconsistencies revealed in J.’s evidence, Lord Justice Phillips said:', '“In her evidence in chief, J. said nothing about the effect that the alleged offences had had on her. Under cross-examination she volunteered the statement that “when I came back from the house I spent a year of my life trying to forget what happened.” We do not find that the Cretan holiday, if it took place during the year in question, is inconsistent with that statement...[applicant’s counsel] submitted that the Cretan holiday was inconsistent with the statement that Martin had messed up her life completely and that she hated having sex...[applicant’s counsel] said that if all this material had been available he would have adopted a completely different approach to J.’s statement as to what happened...', 'This puzzled us for we could not envisage how [applicant’s counsel] could have hoped to persuade the Judge to allow him to adduce evidence about what J. had said in relation to events at [Martin’s house] in order to cross-examine her on the truth of those statements. Furthermore, J. had given evidence at Martin’s trial which ended in his conviction in September 1996 on counts which included rape of J. We asked [applicant’s counsel] if he was suggesting that J.’s account of the sexual abuse and rape that Martin inflicted on her was untrue. He answered that he could not say that. It seems to us that that concession, which was inevitable, undermines the points that [applicant’s counsel] has sought to make on inconsistencies. There can be no doubt that J. was subjected to appalling sexual abuse by Martin. In whatever way she behaved thereafter, her behaviour cannot be an indication that this abuse never occurred, and thus we do not see it can be an indication that abuse at the hands of the [applicant] never occurred.”', 'Section 2 of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 provides as follows:', '“(1) If at a trial any person is for the time being charged with a rape offence to which he pleads not guilty, then, except with the leave of the judge, no evidence and no question in cross-examination shall be adduced or asked at the trial, by or on behalf of any defendant at the trial, about any sexual experience of a complainant with a person other than that defendant.', '(2) The judge shall not give leave in pursuance of the preceding subsection for any evidence or question except on an application made by him in the absence of the jury by or on behalf of a defendant; and on such an application the judge shall give leave if and only if he is satisfied that it would be unfair to that defendant to refuse to allow the evidence to be adduced or the question to be asked.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
