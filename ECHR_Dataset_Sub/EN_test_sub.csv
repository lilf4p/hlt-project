The applicant is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom.', '6. At the time of the events the applicant company was the creditor of company C. which, in its turn, was the creditor of company P. On 1 October 2005 the applicant company and company C. concluded an agreement by which the debt owed by company P. to company C. was assigned to the applicant company in lieu of the debt owed by company C. to the applicant company.', '7. Later company P. became bankrupt and the insolvency procedure was commenced in its respect. On 10 May 2006 the applicant company requested that the Chişinău Economic Court allow it to replace company C. in the list of creditors of company P. In so doing, the applicant company relied on an agreement that it had concluded on 1 October 2005 with company C.', '8. On 5 June 2006 the Chişinău Economic Court held a public hearing in the case and accepted the applicant company’s request. As a result the applicant company replaced company C. in the list of creditors of company P. with a debt of some 14,015,000 Moldovan lei (MDL) (the equivalent of some 901,000 euros (EUR)).', '9. On 16 October 2006 company C. lodged an appeal against the above decision on the ground, inter alia, that the agreement of 1 October 2005 was faulty and that the persons who had signed it from both sides had acted ultra vires.', '10. On 9 November 2006 the Supreme Court of Justice examined the appeal lodged by company C. in a hearing to which the applicant company had not been summoned to appear. The other parties participated in the hearing. The Supreme Court upheld the appeal and reversed the judgment of the lower court. In particular, the Supreme Court held that the person who had signed the agreement of 1 October 2005 on behalf of company C. had acted ultra vires, because at the relevant time she had been on maternity leave. The decision of the Supreme Court of Justice was final and the applicant company was excluded from the list of creditors of company P.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

UKRAINE,4,Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions),Angelika Nußberger;Carlo Ranzoni;Erik Møse;Ganna Yudkivska;Sergiy Goncharenko;Síofra O’Leary,"['5. The applicant, Mr Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Kryvenkyy, is a Ukrainian national who was born in 1934 and lives in Velyki Gadomtsi.', '6. On 25 March 1997 the applicant obtained a certificate (cертифікат на право на земельну частку (пай)) attesting his entitlement to a nominal 3.61-ha share of the land belonging to the V.G. collective farm. At the same time, according to him, he was allocated a specific plot measuring 3.61 ha, which, he had farmed and paid land tax on since that time. It appears that the allocated land consisted of at least two different parcels, one of them measuring 0.6021 ha.', '7. In September 1998 V.G. merged with Kh., a neighbouring collective farming company, which was designated as its successor. Following the merger, Kh. did not register itself as the new owner of the land formerly allocated to V.G. Subsequently the two farms separated again.', '8. On 18 March 1999 the Parliament of Ukraine ordered the expropriation of 150 ha of Kh.’s land and its transfer to U.C.C. closed joint stock company for the exploitation of kaolin deposits. By the same decision, U.C.C. was obliged, in particular, to compensate the local council for the damage suffered by the agricultural producers in connection with the expropriation of the land.', '9. On 10 June 1999 the Berdychiv district land authority drew up a draft land-ownership certificate designating the boundaries of the plot to be allocated to U.C.C. This plot was de facto located on the land which had been registered as belonging to V.G.. The draft certificate mentioned, in particular, that U.C.C. had to obtain and register a relevant State land-use certificate.', '10. According to the applicant, until 2004 U.C.C. took no action to register its land-use rights and the plot designated for expropriation by Parliament’s decision of 18 March 1999 remained in the hands of the members of the V.G. collective farm. The 0.6021-ha parcel of the land farmed by the applicant was affected by the Parliament’s decision.', '11. Meanwhile, on 17 January 2003 the Berdychiv district administration approved a draft certificate determining the boundaries of the plots of land to be designated to individual farmers from the lands allocated to V.G. and ordered production of the respective individual land-ownership certificates.', '12. On the basis of this decision, on 4 June 2003 the applicant was issued with the land-ownership certificate for the aforementioned 0.6021-ha plot. No information concerning registration of ownership in respect of any other land parcels farmed by the applicant has been provided to the Court.', '13. On 7 July 2005 the Berdychiv district prosecutor addressed the Berdychiv district administration objecting to its decision of 17 January 2003. The prosecutor maintained, in particular, that 150 ha of land designated for exploitation of kaolin deposits had been allocated to individual farmers in breach of U.C.C.’s rights.', '14. On 22 July 2005 the Berdychiv district administration accepted the prosecutor’s objection and annulled its decision of 17 January 2003 in so far as it related to the 150 ha of land claimed by U.C.C.', '15. On 31 August 2005 U.C.C. lodged a civil action claiming the 0.6021-ha plot of land allocated to the applicant and seeking annulment of the land-ownership certificate issued to him on 4 June 2003. It noted, in particular, that the Berdychiv district administration had already annulled its own decision of 17 January 2003, which had served as the basis for the issuance of the land-ownership certificate to the applicant. The issuance had therefore been devoid of legal basis.', '16. On 17 August 2006 the Berdychiv Court allowed the aforementioned claim. It noted that the disputed plot had been allocated to the applicant mistakenly on the basis of the decision of 17 January 2003, without due regard to the fact that in 1999 this very plot had already been expropriated and transferred to U.C.C.', '17. Following this decision, U.C.C. blocked the road leading to the plot disputed by the U.C.C. and it became impossible for the applicant to access it or use it for farming.', '18. On 12 December 2006 the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal upheld the above judgment.', '19. The applicant appealed in cassation before the Supreme Court of Ukraine. He noted, in particular, that he had obtained the disputed land lawfully and in good faith. He could therefore not be deprived of it unless fair compensation was paid.', '20. In February 2007 the applicant added to his cassation appeal, informing the Supreme Court of Ukraine that on 12 February 2007 the Regional Court had annulled the decision of 22 July 2005 and revalidated the decision of 17 January 2003, on the basis of which he had obtained his land-ownership certificate (see paragraph 23 below).', '21. On 4 April 2007 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal in cassation.', '22. On an unspecified date several individuals, excluding the applicant, apparently the land owners whose land was also being claimed by U.C.C., instituted administrative proceedings against the Berdychiv district administration. They sought, in particular, to annul its decision of 22 July 2005 and to declare lawful the decision of 17 January 2003, on the basis of which their land-use certificates had been issued.', '23. On 12 February 2007 the Zhytomyr Regional Court of Appeal allowed their claim. It noted, in particular, that Parliament had ordered the expropriation of Kh.’s land, while the land, whose boundaries had been in dispute, had belonged to V.G., which had been a separate legal entity on the date of the decision at issue.', '24. On 23 July 2008 the Higher Administrative Court of Ukraine quashed the above decision and remitted the case for retrial.', '25. After several rounds of proceedings, on 14 September 2011 the Berdychiv Court found that the decision of 22 July 2005 had been unlawful in so far as it had related to the plots of land of the individuals who had instituted the proceedings. On 6 December 2011 and 27 August 2013 the judgment of 14 September 2011 was upheld by the Zhytomyr Regional Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of Ukraine respectively.']",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

On 11 October 2012 the Constitutional Court (file no. II.

It found that, within that period, the District Court had failed actively to proceed with the matter for one year and a half.', 'The Constitutional Court observed that the Court’s previous case-law – such as Ištván and Ištvánová v. Slovakia (no. 30189/07, 12 June 2012), which concerned a delay of more than six years – dealt with unjustified delays imputable to the courts that were substantially longer than those in the present case (one year and a half). The Constitutional Court considered that, because the unjustified delays in the present case had been shorter (compared to those in respect of Ištván and Ištvánová and other similar cases), it was justified in requiring – before turning for protection to the Constitutional Court – that the applicant lodge a complaint with the President of the District Court with a view to accelerating her proceedings.', '11.

His request was rejected. Subsequently, he initiated proceedings before the Van administrative court to have the said decision annulled. Relying on documents attesting to his poor financial status, the applicant requested legal aid to pay the court fees.

He was notified that he had to pay 604 Turkish Liras (TRY) (approximately 330 euros (EUR)) in court fees within one month to continue the proceedings and that failure to do so would result in the discontinuation of the proceedings.

The applicant was born in 1982 and lives in Bern, Switzerland. At the time of the events giving rise to the present application, he was the editorin-chief of Ülkede Özgür Gündem, a daily newspaper published in Turkey.', '6. On 6 July 2004 an article written by Mr B.G. entitled “Analysing the Kurdish dynamic correctly” was published in Ülkede Özgür Gündem. In his article, Mr B.G. stated his views on the role of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (an illegal armed organisation), a number of organisations associated with the PKK in regional and international politics and political developments in Turkey. Next to the article a photograph of Abdullah Öcalan shaking hands with a group of armed men was published.', '7. On 8 July 2004 the public prosecutor at the Istanbul Assize Court filed a bill of indictment, charging the applicant with disseminating propaganda in favour of the KONGRA-GEL under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713) on account of the article published on 6 July 2004. In the indictment, the public prosecutor quoted the following passage from the article:', '“... Abdullah Öcalan, who has contributed to the essential dynamic of the Kurdish movement and the HPG, the PJA and the KONGRA-GEL, organisations which have acted as military, political and ideological leaders and which have represented his leadership,... [must be well understood]”.', 'The public prosecutor stated that a photograph of Abdullah Öcalan in which he was standing in a rural area holding a weapon had been published in the newspaper, next to the article. The public prosecutor considered as a result that the applicant had disseminated propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation inciting others to violence or other methods of terrorism. Subsequently, criminal proceedings were launched against the applicant before the Istanbul Assize Court.', '8. During the proceedings the applicant maintained that the article in question had been a news article and had not contained propaganda inciting to violence.', '9. On 24 May 2005 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant of disseminating propaganda in favour of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713 and sentenced him to six months’ imprisonment and a fine. In its judgment, the Istanbul Assize Court held that the content of the article and the publication of Abdullah Öcalan’s photograph amounted to dissemination of propaganda in favour of the PKK/KONGRA-GEL.', '10. The applicant appealed. In his appeal petition, referring to a number of the Court’s judgments, the applicant claimed that he had not had the intention of disseminating propaganda in favour of a terrorist organisation and that his criminal conviction had been in breach of Articles 6 and 10 of the Convention as he had been exercising his right to impart information. He also noted that the first-instance court had failed to examine the article in its entirety.', '11.

De Gaetano;Georges Ravarani,"['5. The applicant was born in 1966 and lives in Kyiv.', '6. Prior to the events in question, he had been actively involved in Ukrainian politics. From 25 May 2006 to 15 June 2007 and from 23 November 2007 to 23 May 2008 he was a Member of Parliament and from 26 December 2007 to 24 March 2010 he was First Deputy Minister of Justice. His father-in-law was President of the Supreme Court of Ukraine from 2006 to 2011.', '7. Between November 2005 and June 2006 and then between June and March 2008 the applicant was one of the equity partners of the law firm Magisters & Partners Ltd (subsequently renamed Magisters Ltd).', '8. In December 2008 the State-owned joint-stock company Naftogaz Ukrayiny (hereinafter referred to as “Naftogaz”), which was involved in several serious disputes before the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, decided to extend the legal services agreement which it had concluded with Magisters Ltd in 2002 and which was about to expire.', '9. On 23 February 2009 the applicant, acting in his capacity as First Deputy Minister of Justice, sent a letter to Naftogaz, at the latter’s request, informing it of the existence of exceptional conditions, as provided under domestic law, for purchasing legal services from Magisters Ltd without inviting bids from other law firms. It was noted that Magisters Ltd had been providing Naftogaz with legal services for a long time, including in the proceedings before the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. Accordingly, changing the legal services’ provider would be costly and unjustified.', '10. The applicant’s letter, which was subsequently submitted to the Economy Ministry, provided the basis for Naftogaz to contract further legal services from Magisters Ltd without pursuing a bidding procedure.', '11. On 24 June 2009 the Prosecutor General’s Office (“the PGO”) opened a criminal case under Article 366 § 2 of the Criminal Code (“the CC”; see paragraph 40 below) in respect of alleged forgery of the letter of 23 February 2009 by unspecified officials at the Ministry of Justice. On 14 September 2009 the Kyiv Pecherskyy District Court (“the Pecherskyy Court”) quashed the above ruling after a complaint by the applicant. On 21 October 2009 and 15 July 2010 the Kyiv City Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) and the Supreme Court, respectively, upheld the first-instance court’s decision.', '12. On 1 July 2009 the PGO opened another criminal case in respect of the same facts, this time under Article 364 § 2 of the CC (see paragraph 38 below) on suspicion of abuse of office with grave consequences by unspecified Ministry of Justice officials. On 28 December 2009 the Pecherskyy Court quashed that ruling. Its decision was upheld by the appellate court on 10 February 2010. It appears that it was not challenged on points of law.', '13. On 5 August 2010 the PGO faxed the applicant “an invitation” to go to its offices at 10 a.m. the following day for questioning about “possible abuse of office and forgery by officials of the Ministry of Justice”.', '14. On 6 August 2010 the PGO re-sent the “invitation” to the applicant. This time his questioning was expected at 9.30 a.m. on 9 August 2010. However, he did not appear before the prosecutor.', '15. On 20 December 2010 the PGO instructed the Kyiv city police to establish the applicant’s whereabouts and to hand him a summons for questioning at 10 a.m. on 22 December 2010. The letter noted that the applicant had not been present at his address as established by the investigation.', '16. Also on 20 December 2010 the PGO enquired with the State Border Service regarding the applicant’s trips abroad in 2009 and 2010. According to the information it received on 21 December 2010, the applicant had left Ukraine more than thirty times during the period in question.', '17. On 21 December 2010 an official of the Kyiv city police wrote to the PGO that its information about the applicant’s address was outdated (he had sold the flat in 2003 and had not lived there since).', '18. On 22 December 2010 the PGO enquired with the Kyiv city and regional address bureau about the applicant’s registered address and received a reply on 23 December 2010 that he lived in Yagotyn in the Kyiv region.', '19. On 22 December 2010 the PGO instituted criminal proceedings against the applicant under Article 365 § 3 of the CC (exceeding of powers by an official leading to grave consequences – see paragraph 39 below). In describing the applicant’s actus reus, the prosecutor found that he had bypassed the registry of the Ministry of Justice when accepting the request from Naftogaz and issuing his letter in reply; that his conclusion about the existence of exceptional conditions for Naftogaz not to pursue a bidding procedure had been in contradiction with the applicable legal provisions; and that he had had no right to put that conclusion on official Ministry of Justice paper. The subsequent extension by Naftogaz of its contract with Magisters Ltd had caused considerable losses to the State budget.', '20. Later that day the investigator called the applicant by telephone to summon him for questioning. At the time, he was in hospital with his wife, who was giving birth to their third child.', '21. In the afternoon of 22 December 2010, the applicant appeared before the investigator and after being questioned was arrested at 4.50 p.m. under Articles 106 and 115 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (“the CCP”; see paragraph 41 below). According to the official report, the applicant had been arrested on the grounds that “eyewitnesses, including victims, directly identified [him] as the one who had committed the offence”. His arrest was justified by the necessity to prevent him evading justice or from obstructing the establishment of the truth, and to ensure the execution of an eventual court judgment. The arrest report had the following description of the facts giving rise to the prosecution:', '“... during the period from 5 to 27 February 2009 [the applicant], exceeding his official powers, issued an expert conclusion with knowingly false information, as a result of which considerable damage, amounting to 1,697,600 [Ukrainian] hryvnias [equal to about 152,000 euros at the time] was caused to [Naftogaz]. In other words, he is suspected of committing a criminal offence under Article 365 § 3 of the [CC].”', '22. The procedural rights of arrestees were also listed. The applicant signed it with a remark that he considered his arrest as unlawful given that he had complied with the investigator’s summons in accordance with the CCP and that there was no risk of him hindering the establishment of the truth as he was no longer a civil servant.', '23. On 23 December 2010 the applicant was officially charged under Article 365 § 3 of the CC.', '24. On 24 December 2010 the applicant challenged his arrest before a court. He claimed that the investigator had failed to refer to any factual circumstances to justify his arrest under Articles 106 and 115 of the CCP. The applicant contended that he had appeared before the investigator upon the latter’s first summons, despite the fact that on that day his wife had been in hospital giving birth. That indicated, in his opinion, that he had had no intention of absconding or hindering the investigation.', '25. Also on 24 December 2010 the investigator applied to the court for the applicant to be held in pre-trial detention. The necessity of that preventive measure was explained as follows:', '“Having regard to [the applicant’s] role in the commission of the offence and his causing serious damage to State interests, his age, state of health, family and financial situation, and other circumstances characterising him, the investigation has grounds to believe that [the applicant] will try to influence the witnesses in this case given his extensive networks in law-enforcement bodies and among judicial authorities.', 'Furthermore, the case file contains sufficient evidence showing that [the applicant] avoided appearing before the investigation authorities, that he travels abroad regularly and that he is absent from his registered address. That being so, if at liberty, he will abscond or hinder the investigation and the implementation of procedural decisions.', 'Therefore, the application of any other preventive measure in respect of the accused ... will not be able to ensure his proper procedural conduct and the fulfilment of procedural decisions...”', '26. On the same day the Pecherskyy Court found that the case file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant in order to take a decision on the investigator’s application. In particular, the file did not contain sufficient information about the applicant’s health, family and financial situation or his occupation. The court therefore extended the applicant’s preliminary detention to ten days as a temporary preventive measure. The decision was not subject to appeal.', '27. On 30 December 2010 the Pecherskyy Court allowed the investigator’s application (see paragraph 25 above) as well-founded and ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention. The court further held that that finding rendered it unnecessary to examine alternative preventive measures. It rejected the applicant’s complaint about his arrest as unsubstantiated.', '28. On 2 January 2011 the applicant appealed. He reiterated his earlier arguments on the alleged unlawfulness of his arrest by the investigator (see paragraph 24 above). Furthermore, he complained that the Pecherskyy Court had failed to justify the application of what was the most intrusive preventive measure available in his case. He argued that the court had not taken into account the fact that he was the sole breadwinner for his three children and his wife and that their newborn child was still in hospital. Positive character references and his requests for a non-custodial preventive measure had also been disregarded.', '29. On 4 January 2011 the President of the Ukrainian Bar Association applied to the Court of Appeal, offering his personal surety for the applicant’s release. In the alternative, he indicated that he was ready to pay bail for the applicant.', '30. On 13 January 2011 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal and upheld the findings and reasoning of the Pecherskyy Court’s decision of 30 December 2010. There was no reference in the ruling to the application by the Bar Association President.', '31. On 31 January 2011 the applicant was additionally charged with forging an official document under Article 366 § 2 of the CC (see paragraph 40 below).', '32. On the same day the pre-trial investigation was declared completed and the applicant was given access to the case file.', '33. On 10 February 2011 the Pecherskyy Court extended the applicant’s pre-trial detention to three months, finding that there were no grounds to change the preliminary measure to a more lenient one.', '34. On 15 February 2011 the investigator released the applicant under an undertaking not to abscond. The change of preventive measure was explained by the fact that the applicant could no longer influence witnesses or impede the investigation. The investigator also made a general reference to the applicant’s age, state of health, family and financial situation, as well as the fact that he had children to care for, permanent employment and positive character references.', '35. As known from public available material, some media outlets linked the applicant’s release to a private meeting between his father-in-law as the President of the Supreme Court and the President of Ukraine a day earlier, on 14 February 2011. The applicant publicly denied those rumours.', '36. The parties did not inform the Court of any further developments in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. Publicly available material shows that he was amnestied in December 2011.']",['5'],"['5-1', '5-3']",[],[],[],[],1

At 6 p.m. the arrest record was drawn up; it gave 6 p.m. as the time of the applicant’s arrest.', '6. On 7 June 2005 the Lukoyanovskiy District Court in the Nizhny Novgorod Region remanded the applicant in custody for an initial twomonth period.', '7. On 8 August 2005 the District Court held a hearing to decide, among other matters, on an extension of the applicant’s detention. The applicant asked for release; counsel for the applicant pointed out that, since the authorised detention period had ended on 5 August 2005, his detention in the following three days had been unlawful. The District Court extended the applicant’s detention, finding that the “preventive measure [should] remain unchanged”.', '8.

The applicant was born in 1976 and lives in Kemerovo.', '5. On 1 March 2008 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily injuries to Mr K. On 3 March 2008 the Tsentralnyy District Court of Kemerovo remanded him in custody.', '6. On 10 October 2008 the applicant and other persons were charged with running of a criminal syndicate, extortion and other offences. On 18 March 2010 the case was sent for trial to the Kemerovo Regional Court.', '7. On 28 May 2013 the Kemerovo Regional Court, further to a verdict by a jury, found the applicant guilty and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment.', '8. On 11 February 2014 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed the conviction and remitted the case for a new trial. It decided that the applicant should stay in custody:', '“Zavorin, P[.], K[.], Sp[.] and Sl[.] stand accused of serious and particularly serious offences. Having regard to the gravity of the charges and the information on their character which is available in the case materials, the court considers that the grounds listed in paragraph 1 of Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure are present. The information about the case, taken in its entirety, gives reason to consider that, if the above individuals were to be released from custody, they might abscond and thereby prevent the case from being examined within a reasonable time (the time the proceedings before the first-instance court have already taken should not be discounted) or they might influence the witnesses or victims. Under these circumstances, the court considers that these individuals must be placed into custody for a period of three months”.', '9. On 28 April 2014 the Kemerovo Regional Court returned the case to the prosecutor so that certain procedural defects could be remedied. It also extended the applicant’s and other defendants’ detention for a further three months, referring mainly to the gravity of the charges but also to the wording of the Supreme Court’s decision of 11 February 2014. In so far as the applicant sought to rely on the Government’s admission of a violation, the Regional Court held as follows:', '“The defendant A. L. Zavorin filed an application for release on an undertaking to appear and to be of good conduct, relying on the fact that his prolonged detention in the present proceedings was deemed to be unjustified in the framework of the proceedings on his application before the European Court of Human Rights and that the [Russian] Government offered him compensation ... which he refused ...', 'A.

The applicant was born in 1975 and lives in Asvag (Norway).', '6. In 2000 the applicant married a Slovak national (A.) in Norway. There were two children from the marriage, born in 2000 and 2002 respectively.', '7. The family lived together in Norway until May 2004, when the applicant left the family home. On 18 August 2004 an administrative decision was taken in Norway on the couple’s separation.', '8. On 7 September 2004 the Vesterålen District Court (tingrett) issued an interim order that, until the resolution of the matter on the merits, the children should be the joint responsibility of both parents and should remain in the care of A. The court also determined the applicant’s visiting rights and forbade both parents to remove the children from the Norwegian territory without the consent of the other parent.', '9. Nevertheless, on 8 July 2005 A. left Norway for Slovakia, taking the children with her.', '10. On 21 September 2005 the Vesterålen District Court ruled that the children be put under the exclusive parental responsibility and in the care of the applicant. It also determined the visiting rights of A. and issued an order that she should not remove the children from the territory of Norway. This judgment was upheld by the Hålogaland High Court (lagmannsrett) on 10 March 2006 following an appeal by A., and her request for leave to appeal on points of law was dismissed by the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court (Høyesteretts kjæremålsutvalg) on 23 May 2006.', '11. On 14 December 2005 the applicant initiated proceedings in Slovakia against A. under the Hague Convention, seeking an order for the return of the children to their country of habitual residence ‒ Norway.', '12. The action was examined by the courts in four rounds, two of which were followed by enforcement proceedings. They are described below in turn.', '13. The first examination resulted in the dismissal of the action by the Liptovský Mikuláš District Court (Okresný súd) on 23 May 2006 and of the applicant’s appeal (odvolanie) by the Žilina Regional Court (Krajský súd) on 28 February 2007. These decisions became final and binding (právoplatnosť).', '14. The applicant subsequently petitioned the Prosecutor General (“the PG”) to exercise his discretionary power to challenge these decisions by way of an extraordinary appeal on points of law (mimoriadne dovolanie) on the applicant’s behalf. However, in a letter of 25 October 2007 he was informed that, under the applicable procedural rules, no such extraordinary appeals were available in family law matters.', '15. Meanwhile, on 30 May 2007, the applicant had challenged the ordinary courts’ decisions by way of a complaint under Article 127 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended).', '16. Upon examining this complaint, on 12 June 2008, the Constitutional Court (Ustavný súd) found a violation of the applicant’s rights under Article 6 § 1 (fairness), but no separate issue under Article 8 of the Convention.', 'As a result, it quashed the decision of 28 February 2007 and remitted the matter to the Regional Court for reexamination of the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 23 May 2006.', '17. In consequence, on 7 October 2008 the Regional Court re-examined the appeal and decided to quash the decision of 23 May 2006 and to remit the case to the first-instance court for reexamination.', '18. In the second round of examination, an order for the return of the children was issued by the District Court on 16 April 2009 and, following an appeal by A., it was upheld by the Regional Court on 23 June 2009.', 'As the order thereby became final and binding, on 13 August 2009 the applicant petitioned for enforcement.', '19. However, the return order was quashed by the Supreme Court (Najvyšší súd) on 7 September 2010, following an appeal on points of law (dovolanie) by A. The matter was consequently remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination and, on 30 September 2010, the enforcement proceedings were discontinued.', '20. In the third round of examination, a new order for the return of the children was issued by the District Court on 22 October 2010 and, following an appeal by A., it was upheld by the Regional Court on 25 January 2011.', 'The order thus became final and binding and, on 24 February 2011, the applicant petitioned for enforcement.', '21. However, the return order was again quashed by the Supreme Court, on 27 July 2011, following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the PG on behalf of A.', 'Among other things, the Supreme Court observed that the courts were duty-bound to examine as carefully as possible the overall situation to which the children would return in the place of their habitual residence.', 'On the facts of the present case, the lower courts had based their assessment regarding the social situation of the applicant on reports drawn up by the Norwegian Central Authority responsible for implementing the Hague Convention. However, these reports dated back to February and April 2009 and, in the circumstances, they were outdated. For this reason and others, the matter was again remitted to the District Court for a fresh examination and the enforcement proceedings were terminated.', '22. The fourth and final round of examination resulted in the dismissal of the applicant’s petition by the District Court on 21 November 2011. This decision was appealed against by the applicant and the public prosecution service, who had previously joined the proceedings but later withdrew their appeal.', '23. On 8 February 2012 the Regional Court discontinued the proceedings in respect of the appeal by the public prosecution service and declared the applicant’s appeal inadmissible for being out of time.', '24. On 20 February 2012 the Regional Court corrected its decision of 8 February 2012 in so far as the applicant’s appeal was concerned. In particular, having established an error in its previous calculation of the applicable statutory time-limit, the Regional Court ruled that the applicant’s appeal had in fact been lodged in good time and that the proceedings on it were to continue. A. then challenged this decision by means of an appeal on points of law, but her appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court on 28 June 2012 as being inadmissible.', '25. The Regional Court heard the applicant’s appeal on 22 October 2012 and dismissed it on 6 November 2012.', '26. In dismissing the petition and the appeal, the courts relied on the Supreme Court’s judgment of 27 July 2011 (see paragraph 21 above) and took into account the fact that the children wished to stay with A. in Slovakia, that they had spent more than half of their lives in Slovakia, and that they were integrated there. The courts concluded that it was therefore in the best interests of the children that they should not be returned to Norway.', 'The matter was settled by force of a final and binding decision on 31 December 2012.', '27. Meanwhile, on 3 September 2012 the applicant had turned to the Constitutional Court with a fresh individual complaint. Directing it against the District Court, the Regional Court, and the Supreme Court, he alleged a violation of his rights under Articles 6 (fairness and length) and 8 of the Convention and their constitutional equivalents.', 'In particular, the applicant contended that the proceedings had been pending for nearly seven years, and that in the given situation the excessive length thereof worked against him.', 'In addition, he argued that the District Court’s decision of 21 November 2011 violated his right to respect for his private life and, challenging in substance mainly the Supreme Court’s decision of 27 July 2011, he asserted that the proceedings had been unfair inter alia because the PG had lodged an extraordinary appeal on points of law on behalf of A., although such a remedy had been denied to the applicant on the grounds that it was not available as a matter of law (see paragraphs 14 and 21 above).', '28. On 30 October 2012 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible.', 'At the time of the Constitutional Court’s decision, the applicant’s Hague Convention petition was still pending before the Regional Court on his appeal against the first-instance ruling of 21 November 2011 in the fourth round of examination (see paragraphs 22 et seq. above), after the second final and binding return order had been quashed by the Supreme Court on 27 July 2011 following an extraordinary appeal on points of law lodged by the PG on behalf of A. (see paragraph 21 above).', 'As regards the length of the proceedings, the Constitutional Court observed that the Supreme Court and the District Court had determined the matter on 27 July and 21 November 2011 respectively. Therefore, at the time the constitutional complaint was introduced, these courts were no longer dealing with the case. Examination of the length of the proceedings before these courts could thus no longer aid their acceleration and, consequently, the applicant could not be deemed to have the requisite interest in having it examined. In addition, the length of the proceedings before the Regional Court being relatively short, the remainder of the length-of-proceedings complaint was manifestly ill-founded.', 'In so far as the constitutional complaint concerned the Supreme Court’s decision of 27 July 2011, it had evidently been lodged outside the statutory two-month time-limit and, as the proceedings on the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 21 November 2011 were still pending, any complaint in relation to their outcome was premature.', 'The decision was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 4 December 2012.']","['13', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1990 and lives in Chișinău.', '6. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '7. On 5 April 2009 general elections took place in Moldova. On 6 and 7 April 2009 large crowds gathered in the streets to protest against alleged electoral fraud. Hundreds of persons were arrested on 7 April 2009 and thereafter.', '8. The applicant was arrested in the evening of 7 April 2009 and on the next day was sentenced by a court to ten days’ administrative detention. According to the applicant, he was punched in the eye by a plain-clothes police officer during his arrest and then subjected to ill-treatment in the Buiucani police station and subsequently at the General Police Directorate (“the GPD”). He was hit by groups of five to twelve persons, both in uniform and plain clothes, taken through a “death corridor” in which officers lined up and kicked or hit each victim as he or she passed through the corridor while being taken to or from the police station or, especially, the GPD.', '9. He was also hit on both ears simultaneously (a form of torture known as “the telephone”), and struck on the head with fists and rubber sticks, all while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. He was also forced to keep his hands up for long periods of time while being hit periodically. He lost consciousness several times as a result of the ill-treatment.', '10. The applicant was also allegedly held with eight other persons in a damp humid cell measuring 4 x 4 metres, where he had no access to daylight or any means of determining the time of the day or the date; he also had no access to the outside world, his relatives, a lawyer or a doctor.', '11. No water was provided to him during the first twenty-four hours of his detention. Thereafter dirty water was distributed in unhygienic plastic bottles to be used by everyone in the cell. The applicant was subsequently diagnosed with hepatitis of an unknown origin. No food was provided. In the congested damp cell he had no opportunity to sleep for three days. There was no toilet in the cell and access to the toilet outside the cell was allowed at random and only after subjecting the person to humiliation.', '12. Psychological ill-treatment was also allegedly used: the applicant was threatened with a lengthy term of imprisonment, with rape and death. He was subjected to interrogation by several persons simultaneously and was forced to sign blank papers.', '13. On 11 April 2009 the applicant was seen by a doctor, who found a haematoma on his left eye.', '14. On 15 April 2009 the applicant complained to the military prosecutor of ill-treatment by the police.', '15. On 29 April 2009 the applicant was examined at the “Memoria” Rehabilitation Centre for Torture Victims, a non-governmental organisation financed by the European Union and member of the General Assembly of the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims (IRCT). On 15 December 2009 it issued an “Extract from the medical file” (Extras din Fişa Medicală) concerning the applicant’s examination. He appears to have undergone detailed medical tests and examinations by various medical specialists. According to the document, the applicant was suffering from, inter alia, the consequences of a head injury, which included intracranial hypertension syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as a post-traumatic ear condition.', '16. The prosecutor in charge of the case interviewed the police officers in charge of the applicant’s arrest, who declared that they had not used force against him. On 29 May 2009 the prosecutor decided not to initiate a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations as he found that there was no evidence that a crime had been committed. On 5 February 2010 the applicant complained to the Prosecutor General’s Office, noting that he had been sent a copy of the prosecutor’s decision only on 22 January 2010. On 18 February 2010 the Prosecutor General’s Office confirmed the decision of 29 May 2009.', '17. On 25 March 2010 the applicant challenged in court the decisions of 29 March 2009 and 18 February 2010. On 19 April 2010 the investigating judge at the Buiucani District Court annulled the two decisions and ordered that a supplementary investigation be carried out. The court found that the prosecutors’ decisions had been based only on the statements of the police officers accused of ill-treating the applicant. Moreover, while one of the prosecutors had found that force had been used to apprehend the applicant, which could explain any injuries on his body, the arresting officers had denied the use of any force.', '18. On an unknown date prior to 10 May 2010 a formal criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations was initiated.', '19. On 19 May 2010 the applicant was officially recognised as a victim in the investigation of the alleged crime. He described the circumstances of his alleged ill-treatment and participated in a photograph identity parade, but did not recognise any of the persons in the photographs.', '20. On 25 May 2010 the prosecutor in charge of the case suspended the investigation on the basis that no suspect had been identified.', '21. Following the Court’s communication of the present application to the respondent Government on 12 December 2011, on 8 February 2012 the Prosecutor General’s Office recommended to the Chișinău Military Prosecutor that the proceedings in respect of the applicant’s complaints should be reopened. The prosecutor considered that the decision of 25 May 2010 had been groundless and drew up a list of twelve investigative actions be taken in the new investigation of the complaint. This list included actions such as hearing S., who had been arrested together with the applicant; hearing the persons detained together with the applicant during the events of April 2009; hearing the doctor who had examined him at the Buiucani police station; obtaining various medical evidence concerning the applicant’s state of health prior to and after his detention in April 2009, including the report of the “Memoria” centre; examining the documents in the file concerning the accusations against the applicant; and organising cross-examinations involving both the applicant and the officers who had arrested him on 7 April 2009.', '22. On 22 March 2012 the doctor who had examined the applicant at the Buiucani police station was heard as a witness. He declared that he had noted all the injuries present on the applicant’s body. He added that a police officer had been present in the room during the examination, but had not put pressure of any kind on the applicant.', '23. On 26 March 2012 two officers were officially declared suspects in the case and were interviewed by a military prosecutor. The parties did not inform the Court of any further developments in this regard.', '24. The relevant non-Convention material is summarised in Taraburca v.

The cells were equipped only with one tap and a toilet, separated from the living area only by a curtain. The dining table was fixed to the floor just a metre away from the toilet. The applicant had a daily onehourlong outdoor activity. The yards were closed premises measuring 40 by 20 metres, about 100-150 persons being taken to the yard at a time.', 'The applicant was also entitled to thirty minutes’ exercise in the gym three times a week. He attended secondary school classes three times a week, six hours on each occasion.', '7.

The cells had no ventilation system and were infested with parasites. Detainees were permitted to take a shower once a week, according to the applicant, in unhygienic conditions and for no longer than 1-2 minutes.', 'The applicant was entitled to a daily walk of about one hour in the prison yard measuring 20 by 20 metres.

Between 12 May 2010 and 27 May 2011 the applicant continued to serve his sentence in Unit “A” of Budapest Prison. He was kept in five cells described as follows: cell nos. 8, 9 and 141 (8 square metres, three inmates), and cell nos. 3 and 252 (6.5 square metres, two inmates). Only a curtain was used as a partition between the toilet and the living area.', 'Throughout his detention the applicant had no out-of-cell activities other than a daily one-hour walk in the yard of the prison facility, gym exercise twice a week for about 50 minutes each time and a weekly visit to the library for about 15 minutes.', 'The inmates were allowed one shower per week. The shower room was equipped with four shower heads. There were about 25 inmates taken to have a shower at the same time, making it impossible to move around because of the sheer number of prisoners.', '9. On 27 May 2011 the applicant was transferred back to Unit “B” of Budapest Prison, where he spent two years in five different cells.', 'The size of those cells was 27 square metres.

The applicant was born in 1973 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Bozoy, Irkutsk Region.', '6. According to the applicant, and not contested by the Government, at approximately 11 p.m. on 5 April 2007 she was arrested on suspicion of abducting, raping and murdering S. According to the arrest record, she was arrested at 3.30 a.m. on 6 April 2007.', '7. Following the arrest, the applicant was taken to a police station where she was questioned by an investigator in the presence of a lawyer. Prior to the questioning, she wrote a statement admitting to S.’s abduction. According to her, police officers threatened to beat her if she refused to make a written statement. She did not explain whether she had been denied access to a lawyer prior to writing the statement.', '8. According to the applicant, on the morning of 6 April 2007 she was taken to the town prosecutor’s office. She was taken to an office where policemen started beating her and urging her to confess to S.’s murder. They hit her on the head and threatened to rape her, and then handcuffed her and pushed her to the floor. They put a hat on her head and pulled it down over her eyes. They also threw a coat over her. They punched her in the solar plexus and the stomach, and pulled her by the legs. They attached a wire to her right leg and placed a metal object between her shoulders, then subjected her to electrocution while gagging her mouth to muffle her screams.', '9. On the same day the applicant was questioned by the investigator and confessed to S.’s abduction. She was later taken to the location where she had last seen S. alive and was questioned again afterwards. The applicant’s lawyer was present during the questioning.', '10. Later that day the applicant was taken to a temporary detention centre, where an officer conducted a medical examination and noted numerous bruises on her belly and scratches below the right clavicle. It appears that the administration of the detention facility informed the investigator from the town prosecutor’s office accordingly, who ordered that the applicant undergo a forensic medical examination.', '11. At approximately 5 or 6 p.m. that evening the applicant underwent a forensic medical examination which, in addition to the injuries noted before, revealed two bruised areas on her chest, possibly caused by blunt solid objects one to two days before the examination. At the time, the applicant did not offer any explanation as to the cause of the injuries.', '12. On 13 April 2007 the investigator questioned the applicant again the in the presence of her lawyer. She denied having any intent to kill S. According to her, it was two other co-defendants who had decided to do so.', '13. On 10 May 2007 a local newspaper published an article about S.’s murder and the opening of the investigation. The names of the alleged perpetrators were not disclosed.', '14. On 28 June 2007 the town prosecutor’s office received a complaint from the applicant alleging that she had been ill-treated.', '15. On 10 March 2008 investigator T. from the town prosecutor’s office refused to open a criminal investigation into the applicant’s and her codefendants’ allegations of ill-treatment in police custody. The investigator noted as follows:', '“In the course of the investigation, [the applicant and three other defendants] alleged that their initial statements had been coerced by police officers and the prosecutor’s office and were false. In addition, the medical examination conducted revealed that they had sustained injuries. However, in the course of the investigation ... the [defendants’] statements were obtained in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure. The [defendants’] allegations should be considered with criticism. They are charged with serious offences. They have not pleaded guilty and wish to evade criminal liability. Accordingly, no objective information has been found that would confirm the defendants’ allegations that they sustained injuries while in [custody].”', '16. It appears that the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment in police custody were subject to additional pre-investigative inquiry. On 10 September 2008 investigator M. from the regional prosecutor’s office refused to open criminal proceedings against the alleged perpetrators. He took into account the fact that the applicant had been convicted as charged (see paragraph 22 below). He further relied on statements made by the police officers involved in the applicant’s arrest and questioning, who denied having beaten or tortured her. He summarised his findings as follows:', '“The analysis of the collected material shows that the [applicant’s] allegations of illtreatment are not confirmed by objective information and are refuted by the explanations provided by the police officers and investigators from the town prosecutor’s office. [The applicant] complained of ill-treatment after a considerable length of time, and only when she was charged with serious offences, even though nothing had precluded her from communicating her complaint to the investigator who had questioned her in the presence of a lawyer or during the inspection of the crime scene or subsequent questionings, etc. Furthermore, when admitted to the temporary detention facility, [the applicant] did not complain of her injuries allegedly inflicted by police officers. In the absence of a forensic medical examination, it is impossible to determine that [the applicant] sustained the injuries, the degree of their severity, the time of their infliction, or their cause. Regard being had to the above, it should be concluded that the [applicant’s] allegations of ill-treatment should be considered with criticism and viewed as an attempt by [the applicant] to avoid criminal liability for the serious crimes committed. Such a conclusion is substantiated by the [applicant’s] conviction by the Irkutsk Regional Court ... [Her] allegations of ill-treatment were subject to verification by the court, which ruled [that there was] no case to answer against the police officers and investigators from the prosecutor’s office, who had not abused their powers or infringed the [applicant’s] rights in contravention of the law.”', '17. On 18 June 2009 investigator T. refused to institute criminal proceedings against the police officers who had allegedly subjected the defendants to ill-treatment following their arrest. The parties did not provide a copy of this decision.', '18. On 26 October 2009 the Irkutsk Regional Court, within the framework of the trial, issued a separate ruling concerning the applicant’s and other defendants’ allegations of ill-treatment in police custody, advising the regional prosecutor that an additional inquiry should be conducted. In the ruling, the court considered that the inquiry conducted in response to the defendants’ complaints had been incomplete. In particular, the court stated as follows:', '“In the course of the trial, each of the defendants alleged that they had been subjected to physical and psychological pressure by law-enforcement officers ... who demanded that they confess to [the crimes] ...', 'As it transpires from the material in the case file, during the preliminary investigation in the present case each of the defendants lodged complaints with the [town] and [regional] prosecutors’ offices alleging an abuse of power and the use of force by law-enforcement officers ... Following the inquiry in response to the [applicant’s] complaint, on 10 September 2008 [senior investigator M. from the investigating committee of the regional prosecutor’s office] refused to institute criminal proceedings on [the grounds that] no offence had been committed.', '...', 'The court cannot subscribe to [M.’s] finding that it was impossible to establish objectively that [the applicant] had bodily injuries because [allegedly] she had not undergone a forensic medical examination ... [T]he material in the case file ... contains information showing that all the defendants had sustained bodily injuries ...', 'For instance, witness Sh., who saw [the applicant] immediately prior to [her] arrest ... and witness Shin., [one of the police officers] who had taken [the applicant] to [the police station] on the night of 6 April 2007 testified that [she] did not have any visible injuries and ... did not complain about her health to Sh.', '...', 'The records on the initial examination and registration of provision of medical aid to detainees admitted to [the temporary detention centre] ... contain the following entries ... On 6 April 2007 [the applicant] had bruises on her body ... On 7 April 2007 [she] had bruises on the abdomen and scratches on the right clavicle.', 'The findings of the forensic medical experts are as follows ... [The applicant] had bruises on the abdomen and two areas of subcutaneous haemorrhage on the right side of the chest which were caused by the impact of blunt solid objects approximately one to two days ago and could not cause damage to her health. The origin of the injuries was not indicated. [The applicant] did not inform the forensic medical expert as to the origin of the bodily injuries.', 'In 2008, when conducting an inquiry in response to the [applicant’s] complaint, investigator M. did not examine the findings of the forensic medical expert ... at all.', '...', 'Regard being had to the above, the court considers that ... investigator M. ... did not conduct a comprehensive and objective inquiry in response to the [applicant’s] allegations of [ill-treatment]. The investigator’s decision ... does not contain an answer as to how and when [the applicant] sustained bodily injuries.', 'In accordance with the [statutory] rules of criminal [procedure], no party to the proceedings can be subjected to abuse, torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. Accordingly, the court draws the prosecutor’s attention to the fact that a comprehensive and thorough examination is necessary in order to verify the defendants’ allegations of ill-treatment.”', '19. On 26 November 2009 the investigating committee of the regional prosecutor’s office informed the Irkutsk Regional Court, in response to the decision of 26 October 2009 (see paragraph 18 above), that investigators M. and T. had been subjected to a disciplinary warning and reprimand respectively for failing to properly discharge their duties. According to the first deputy head of the investigating committee, the decision of 18 June 2009 had been reversed and the committee had conducted an additional preinvestigative inquiry into the defendants’ allegations of ill-treatment. The Government did not submit a copy of this decision or state whether its content had been communicated to the applicant.', '20. According to the Government, on 6 December 2009 the investigating committee refused to open a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegations. The Government did not submit a copy of this decision or state whether its content had been communicated to the applicant.', '21. On an unspecified date the investigation against the applicant and the three other co-accused was completed and the case was transferred to the Irkutsk Regional Court for trial.', '22. On 29 August 2008 the court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced her to twenty years’ imprisonment.', '23. On 31 March 2009 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation quashed the applicant’s conviction on appeal. The court noted that the trial court had failed to ensure the defendants’ right to an adequate defence and had held hearings in the absence of defence counsel.', '24. During the new trial, the applicant admitted that she had participated in S.’s abduction and battery but denied any involvement in organising S.’s rape and murder. She further claimed that she had been subjected to illtreatment while in police custody and forced to confess.', '25. In response to the applicant’s allegations of ill-treatment by police officers, the trial court questioned forensic expert R., who had examined the applicant on 6 April 2007. R. confirmed his earlier findings and stated that the applicant might have sustained the injuries at least twenty hours prior to the examination. He also considered it impossible, given the nature of the applicant’s injuries, that she had been subjected to electrocution.', '26. On 26 October 2009 the Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced her to sixteen years’ imprisonment. The court relied, inter alia, on her statements of 6 and 13 April 2007. As regards the written statement made prior to her first questioning by the investigator (see paragraph 7 above), the court considered it admissible in so far as she had informed the investigator about S.’s abduction. The court also considered admissible the record of the applicant’s questioning by the investigator. In this connection, it noted that prior to the questioning the applicant had been advised of her rights, and had been assisted by a lawyer throughout. The applicant appealed.', '27. On 17 March 2010 the Supreme Court reclassified the charges against the applicant to bring them in line with amendments to the Russian Criminal Code and reduced her sentence by two years. The court also upheld on appeal the Regional Court’s findings concerning the inadequacy of the inquiry in response to the defendants’ allegations of ill-treatment.']","['3', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

On 9 May 2010, following an order issued by the Bakırköy public prosecutor, the police arrested the applicant at Istanbul Atatürk International Airport on suspicion of illegal entry into Turkey with a false passport.', '9. At 8.15 a.m. on 10 May 2010 the applicant was questioned by the police at the airport. He was subsequently detained at the airport police facility for three days without any judicial order to that effect. He submitted that he had been kept in an overcrowded room.', '10. On 12 May 2010 the police took the applicant to the Kumkapı Removal Centre for Foreigners (“the Kumkapı Removal Centre”) pending his deportation.', '11. The applicant alleged that he had been detained in unhygienic, unhealthy and overcrowded conditions at the Kumkapı Removal Centre.', '12. On 29 September 2010 the applicant’s lawyer lodged a complaint with the Istanbul public prosecutor’s office against police officers from the foreigners’ department of the Istanbul police headquarters alleging that he had been unlawfully detained by State officials. He also complained about the conditions of detention at the Kumkapı Removal Centre, particularly overcrowding, insufficient ventilation and poor hygiene.', '13.

He submitted that some documents had not been provided as they had been classified as “confidential” and that such practice by the police was not prescribed by law.', '18.

On an unspecified date the Istanbul governor’s office decided not to authorise the prosecution of the police officers. Subsequently, on 13 September 2011 the Istanbul public prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation opened at the applicant’s request.

The applicant was sent a notification about the divorce.', '7. Later in February 2005 the applicant and his new female partner, K., were prevented from marrying as the applicant had not obtained a divorce certificate, as required by Article 116 of the Family Code. That document could be obtained exclusively by the applicant at the relevant civil status registry.', '8. The applicant requested that he be escorted to the registry in order to obtain the divorce certificate. His request was refused as the domestic law did not provide for the escorting of prisoners on such grounds.', '9.

However, this would be possible only after his release from prison.', '10. On 17 August 2005 the Deputy Minister of Justice considered a complaint lodged by the applicant concerning the authorities’ failure to provide him with a divorce certificate for the purpose of remarriage.

De Gaetano,"['8. The applicant was born in 1967 and is living in The Hague.', '9. In March 1987 the applicant met and started a relationship with Mr W., who – like the applicant – was born and had always lived in Suriname. Both of them had acquired Surinamese nationality in 1975 when Suriname gained its independence (Article 3 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Suriname concerning the assignment of nationality (Toescheidingsovereenkomst inzake nationaliteiten tussen het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden en de Republiek Suriname), see paragraph 62 below). In September 1989, the applicant and Mr W. started to cohabit in the house of the latter’s paternal grandfather in Suriname.', '10. On 19 October 1991, Mr W. travelled from Suriname to the Netherlands, holding a Netherlands visa for the purpose of stay with his father in the Netherlands. In 1993, Mr W. was granted Netherlands nationality which entailed the renunciation of his Surinamese nationality.', '11. Mr W. has one sister, two brothers and one half-brother who are living in the Netherlands. Two other half-brothers and one half-sister are living in Suriname. The applicant has one brother, G., who was expelled from the Netherlands to Suriname in 2009. The applicant has also one half-brother and one half-sister who are living in the Netherlands. She has another half-sister who is living in Suriname.', '12. Between 1991 and 1995, the applicant filed five unsuccessful requests for a Netherlands visa for the purpose of visiting a relative. These requests were rejected because her sponsor (referent) was insufficiently solvent, had failed to sign the required affidavit of support (garantverklaring) or had failed to supply sufficient information required for the assessment of the visa request. The applicant did not challenge any of these rejections in administrative appeal proceedings.', '13. On 19 November 1996 the applicant filed a sixth visa request for the purpose of visiting a relative. After this request had been granted on 4 March 1997, the applicant entered the Netherlands on 12 March 1997 and did not return to Suriname when her visa expired 45 days later. To date, she has been staying in the Netherlands. She lived in Rotterdam until 20 July 1998, when she moved to The Hague. Since 17 December 1998 she has been living at the same address in The Hague.', '14. On 20 October 1997, the applicant applied for a residence permit. According to the applicant, she had done so for the purpose of taking up residence with her Netherlands-national partner Mr W. According to the Government, the applicant’s stated aim had been to take up “paid employment”. On 16 February 1998, the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) decided not to process the application (buiten behandeling stellen) as the applicant had on two occasions failed to appear in person before the immigration authorities for the purpose of giving further information about her application. When, on 13 February 1998, the applicant’s lawyer had requested a new appointment on the ground that she would be unable to attend the interview scheduled for 16 February 1998, she was informed by the immigration authorities that – despite her lawyer’s absence – the applicant should appear in person. The applicant did not appear on 16 February 1998. The Deputy Minister’s decision of 16 February 1998 was notified to the applicant on 23 February 1998 and she was ordered to leave the Netherlands within seven days.', '15. The applicant filed an objection (bezwaar) against the decision of 16 February 1998. As this objection was denied suspensive effect, she applied for a provisional measure (voorlopige voorziening) in the form of a court injunction preventing her expulsion pending the determination of her objection. This application was rejected on 23 December 1999 by the Acting President of the Regional Court (rechtbank) of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. The applicant’s objection against the decision of 16 February 1998 was rejected by the Deputy Minister on 17 January 2000. The applicant’s appeal against this decision to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure were rejected on 12 July 2001 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Utrecht. No further appeal lay against this ruling.', '16. In the meantime, the applicant had married Mr W. on 25 June 1999 and, in September 2000, a son was born of this marriage. Under the Netherlands nationality rules, the applicant’s child is a Netherlands national. Since the child was unwell, he required lengthy treatment in hospital. He is currently attending secondary school and has no health problems.', '17. On 20 April 2001, the applicant applied unsuccessfully for a residence permit on the basis of the so-called three-year policy (driejarenbeleid) or for compelling reasons of a humanitarian nature. Under this three-year policy a residence permit could be granted if a request for such a permit had not been determined within a period of three years for reasons not imputable to the petitioner and provided that there were no contra-indications such as, for instance, a criminal record. In the course of the proceedings on this request, the provisional-measures judge (voorzieningenrechter) of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam granted the applicant’s request for a provisional measure (injunction on removal) on 23 February 2004. The final decision was given on 17 May 2004 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam.', '18. On 10 December 2005, a second child was born of the applicant’s marriage. This child also holds Netherlands nationality.', '19. On 23 January 2007, the applicant filed a request for a residence permit for the purpose of stay with her children in the Netherlands. This request was rejected because the applicant did not hold the required provisional residence visa (machtiging tot voorlopig verblijf). Such a visa has to be applied for at a Netherlands mission in the petitioner’s country of origin and it is a prerequisite for the grant of a residence permit (verblijfsvergunning) which confers more permanent residence rights. The applicant was not exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. She challenged this decision unsuccessfully in administrative appeal proceedings in which the final decision was taken by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem on 19 April 2007.', '20. On 7 May 2007, the applicant requested the Deputy Minister of Justice to reconsider (heroverwegen) the negative decision on her last request. On 28 September 2007, the applicant filed a complaint with the Deputy Minister on account of the latter’s failure to reply to her request for reconsideration. By letter of 12 November 2007, the Deputy Minister informed the applicant that although her complaint concerning delay was well-founded there was no reason for a reconsideration of the decision.', '21. On 28 September 2007, the applicant applied for a grant of a residence permit at the discretion of the Deputy Minister (conform beschikking staatssecretaris) based on grounds of special and individual circumstances (vanwege bijzondere en individuele omstandigheden).', '22. On 7 July 2008, the Deputy Minister of Justice rejected this application. The applicant filed an objection with the Deputy Minister against this decision as well as an application to the Regional Court of The Hague for a provisional measure (injunction on removal pending the objection proceedings). On 17 November 2008, having noted that this request was not opposed by the Deputy Minister, the Regional Court of The Hague granted the provisional measure. On 11 March 2009, after a hearing on the applicant’s objection held on 15 January 2009, the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant’s objection.', '23. The applicant’s appeal against the decision of 11 March 2009 to the Regional Court of The Hague and her accompanying application for a provisional measure in the form of an injunction on her removal pending the determination of her appeal were rejected on 8 December 2009 by the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Haarlem. In its relevant part, this ruling reads as follows:', '“2.11 It is not in dispute that the appellant does not hold a valid provisional residence visa and that she is not eligible for an exemption from the requirement to hold such a visa under section 17 § 1 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000) or section 3.71 § 2 of the Aliens Decree 2000 (Vreemdelingenbesluit 2000). It is only in dispute whether reason dictates that the defendant should exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on the basis of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree [for reasons of exceptional hardship (onbillijkheid van overwegende aard)].', '2.12 The Regional Court finds that the defendant could reasonably conclude that in the present case there are no special and individual circumstances on the basis of which insistence on compliance with the visa requirement would entail exceptional hardship. ...', '2.18 The appellant’s reliance on Article 8 of the Convention fails. There is family life between the appellant and her husband and her minor children, but the defendant’s refusal to exempt her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa does not constitute an interference with the right to respect for family life as the defendant’s decision did not deprive her of a residence permit enabling her to enjoy her family life in the Netherlands.', '2.19 It does not appear that there is a positive obligation for the Netherlands State under Article 8 of the Convention to exempt the applicant, contrary to the policy pursued in this area, from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. It is of importance at the outset that there has been no appearance of any objective obstacle to the enjoyment of family life outside the Netherlands. Taking into account the young age of the appellant’s children, it can also reasonably be expected that they would follow the appellant to Suriname for the duration of the proceedings relating to the provisional residence visa. This is not altered by the fact that both children are Netherlands nationals. The fact that the appellant’s husband is currently being detained gives no cause for finding that ... there is an objective obstacle.', '2.20 The appellant has cited the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva [and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands, no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006I], Said Botan [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1869/04, 10 March 2009] and Ibrahim Mohamed [v. the Netherlands (striking out), no. 1872/04, 10 March 2009]. This cannot succeed, for the following reasons. The case of Rodrigues da Silva did not concern a temporary separation in connection with maintaining the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, so the case cannot be said to be comparable. In the cases of Said Botan and Ibrahim Mohamed the European Court found that the reasons for lodging the complaints had been removed, because a residence permit had been granted to the complainants in those cases. For that reason, their complaints were not considered further. The Regional Court fails to see in what manner the European Court’s findings in those two cases could be of relevance to the appellant’s case.', '2.21 The appellant has further invoked Article 2 of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. In so far as the provisions invoked entail a directly applicable norm, they have no further implications beyond the fact that in proceedings such as those at hand, the interests of the children concerned must be taken into account. In the decision of 11 March 2009, the situation of the appellant’s two minor children was explicitly taken into account in the assessment. As the provisions invoked do not contain a norm as regards the weight that must be given in a concrete case to the interests of a child, there is no ground for finding that those provisions have been violated.', '2.22 The Regional Court will declare the appeal unfounded.”', '24. On 2 August 2009, upon his return to the Netherlands from a trip to Suriname for the funeral of his foster mother, the applicant’s husband had been found to have swallowed cocaine pellets. He was placed in pre-trial detention. On 8 October 2009, a single-judge chamber (politierechter) of the Haarlem Regional Court convicted him of offences under the Opium Act (Opiumwet) and sentenced him to seven months’ imprisonment. On the basis of this conviction, the Netherlands Royal Constabulary (Koninklijke Marechaussee) included his name on a blacklist provided to airline companies operating direct flights between the Netherlands and Aruba, the former Netherlands Antilles, Suriname and Venezuela. His name was to remain on the list for a period of three years, the aim being to prevent him from reoffending. On 31 December 2009, after having served his sentence, the applicant’s husband was released from prison. His name was removed from the airline blacklist on 2 August 2012.', '25. The applicant’s appeal of 7 January 2010 to the Administrative Jurisdiction Division of the Council of State (Afdeling bestuursrechtspraak van de Raad van State) against the judgment of 8 December 2009 of the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague was dismissed on 6 July 2010. The Administrative Jurisdiction Division found that the appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned ruling (kan niet tot vernietiging van de aangevallen uitspraak leiden). Having regard to section 91 § 2 of the Aliens Act 2000, no further reasoning was called for as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interest of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against this decision.', '26. In the meantime, the applicant filed a fifth request on 16 April 2010 for a residence permit with the Minister of Justice (Minister van Justitie) for the purpose of stay with a child, arguing that she should be exempted from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa on grounds of special and individual circumstances.', '27. This request was rejected on 11 May 2010 by the Minister, who held that there was no reason to exempt the applicant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa and that the refusal of a residence permit was not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention. While accepting that there was family life within the meaning of Article 8 between the applicant, her husband and their children, the Minister found that there was no interference with the right to respect for family life as the refusal to grant the applicant’s request for exemption did not deprive her of a residence permit which enabled her to exercise her family life in the Netherlands.', '28. As to the question whether the applicant’s rights under Article 8 entailed a positive obligation for the Netherlands to grant her a residence permit, the Minister found that the interests of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy outweighed the applicant’s personal interest in exercising her right to family life in the Netherlands. In balancing these competing interests, the Minister took into account the following: already in Suriname and before her arrival in the Netherlands the applicant had been in a relationship with her current spouse; she had entered the Netherlands without having been granted entry clearance for joining her partner as required under the relevant immigration rules; and she had created her family in the Netherlands without holding a residence permit. When it transpired in the course of the proceedings that the applicant was pregnant, the Minister further held that it had not been established, nor did it appear that the applicant would be unable – should hospitalisation be necessary – to give birth in a hospital in Suriname or that there would be any insurmountable objective obstacles to the exercise of family life in Suriname. On this point, the Minister noted that Dutch was spoken in Suriname and that the transition would not therefore be particularly difficult for the applicant’s children, who could continue their education in Suriname in a normal manner.', '29. The Minister added that the mere fact that the applicant’s spouse and children were Netherlands nationals did not entail an automatic obligation for the Netherlands authorities to grant the applicant a residence permit, or lead to the conclusion that the exercise of family life would only be possible in the Netherlands. The Netherlands authorities could not be held responsible for the consequences of the applicant’s personal choice to come to, settle and create a family in the Netherlands without any certainty as to her entitlement to permanent residence. In the balancing exercise, the Minister attributed decisive weight to the fact that the applicant had never resided lawfully in the Netherlands and that there was no indication whatsoever that it would be impossible to exercise family life in Suriname.', '30. The Minister further rejected the applicant’s argument that she ought to be exempted from the visa requirement, on the basis that inter alia the length of the applicant’s stay in the Netherlands was a consequence of her personal choice to continue to remain there. She had met with several refusals of her applications for a Netherlands residence permit but had nevertheless opted each time to file a fresh request, thus accepting the risk that, at some point in time, she would have to leave the Netherlands, at least, temporarily. The Minister further considered that the applicant had been born and raised in Suriname where she had resided most of her life and, given her age, she should be regarded as capable of returning to and fending for herself in Suriname, if need be with financial and/or material support from the Netherlands, pending the determination of an application for a provisional residence visa to be filed by her in Suriname. The Minister concluded on this point that the case disclosed no circumstances warranting a finding that the decision not to exempt the applicant from the visa requirement constituted exceptional hardship within the meaning of section 3.71 § 4 of the Aliens Decree 2000.', '31. On 17 May 2010, the applicant filed an objection against this decision with the Minister. She filed additional grounds for her objection and furnished further information by letters of 20 and 25 May and 8 June 2010.', '32. On 2 July 2010, the applicant requested the Regional Court of The Hague to issue a provisional measure (injunction on expulsion pending the outcome of the objection proceedings).', '33. On 3 August 2010, following a court hearing held on 28 July 2010 and having regard to pending proceedings taken by the applicant seeking deferral of her removal under section 64 of the Aliens Act 2000 (see paragraph 53 below), the provisional-measures judge of the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Amsterdam rejected the request for a provisional measure on the basis that it was moot.', '34. On 19 December 2011 the Minister rejected the applicant’s objection of 17 May 2010. An appeal by the applicant against that decision was rejected on 17 July 2012 by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Dordrecht. In so far as relevant, its judgment reads:', '“2.4.1. It must be examined whether the defendant could have refused to exempt the appellant from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa, as required under section 3.71 § 1 of the Aliens Decree 2000, on the ground that removal is not contrary to Article 8 of the Convention.', '2.4.2. It is not in dispute between the parties that there is family life between the appellant and her husband and their three minor children. Refusing the application [for a residence permit] does not constitute interference within the meaning of Article 8 § 2 of the Convention. No residence permit which actually enabled the appellant to enjoy family life in the Netherlands has been taken away from her. The subsequent question arises whether there exist such facts and circumstances that the right to respect for family life may be said to entail a positive obligation for the defendant to allow the applicant to reside [in the Netherlands]. In making this assessment, a ‘fair balance’ must be found between, on the one hand, the interests of the alien concerned in enjoying family life in the Netherlands and, on the other, the general interest of the Netherlands State in pursuing a restrictive immigration policy. In this balancing exercise, the defendant has a certain margin of appreciation.', '2.4.3. It was reasonable for the defendant to attach more weight to the general interest of the Netherlands State than to the personal interests of the appellant and her family members. The defendant did not have to accept an obligation to grant the appellant residence in the Netherlands on the basis of Article 8 of the Convention. In this balancing exercise, the defendant was entitled to weigh heavily to the appellant’s disadvantage the fact that she had started family life in the Netherlands when she had not been granted a residence permit for this purpose, and that she had further intensified her family life despite the refusal of her requests for residence. This is not altered by the fact that for a certain period the appellant was lawfully resident while awaiting the outcome of proceedings concerning a request for a residence permit.', '2.4.4. The defendant was entitled to take the position that the consequences of the appellant’s choices were at her own risk. According to the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights (Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer v. the Netherlands [no. 50435/99, ECHR 2006I]), where family life has started while no residence permit for that purpose has been granted, removal will lead to a violation of Article 8 only in the most exceptional circumstances. The appellant has not established that, as regards her and her family, there are such exceptional circumstances. Her reliance on the judgments in Rodrigues da Silva and Hoogkamer and Nunez v. Norway (no. 55597/09, 28 June 2011) fails, as her situation is not comparable to the one in the cases of Rodrigues da Silva and Nunez. In those cases it was established that the children could not follow their mother to the country of origin. With the removal of the mother, contact with the children would become impossible. However, in the appellant’s case, it has not become sufficiently apparent that her husband and children could not follow her to her country of origin to continue family life there. The appellant has insufficiently demonstrated that her family members will encounter difficulties in entering Suriname. The consequence of her husband’s inclusion on a blacklist is that airlines can refuse to allow him on direct flights from the Netherlands to the Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Suriname and Venezuela during the period between 2 August 2009 and 2 August 2012. This does not mean that it is self-evident that the husband will not be admitted to Suriname. The appellant has not established that it would be impossible for her husband to travel to Suriname in another manner. In addition, it is important to note that registration on the blacklist is only of a temporary nature.', '2.4.5. No other circumstances have appeared on the basis of which the existence of an objective obstacle to continued family life in Suriname must be accepted. There is also no question of excessive formalism. The appellant’s situation is not comparable to the one in the case of Rodrigues da Silva. The defendant has taken the interests of the minor children sufficiently into account in the balancing exercise. The children were all born in the Netherlands and hold Netherlands nationality. At the time the impugned decision was taken, they were respectively eleven, six and one year old. The children have always lived in the Netherlands. Although the oldest child has built up bonds with the Netherlands, the defendant did not have to accept this as a basis for holding that the children could not take root in Suriname. In this connection it is also relevant that Dutch is spoken in Suriname and that both parents hail from Suriname.', '2.4.6. This is not altered by the fact that the appellant’s husband and children hold Netherlands nationality and, on the basis of Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter ‘TFEU’), can derive rights from their EU citizenship. It can be deduced from the considerations of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter ‘ECJ’) in the Dereci et al. judgment of 15 November 2011 (C-256/11), in which a further explanation is given of the Ruiz Zambrano judgment of 8 March 2011 (C-34/09), that in answering the question whether a citizen of the EU who enjoys family life with a third-country national will be denied the right to reside in EU territory flowing directly from Article 20 of the TFEU, only a limited importance is given to the right to respect for family life. As follows from paragraphs 68 and 69 of the Dereci judgment, this right is not, as such, protected by Article 20 of the TFEU but by other international, EU and domestic rules and regulations, such as Article 8 of the Convention, Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, EU Directives and section 15 of the Aliens Act 2000. In answering this question the desire of family members to reside as a nuclear family unit in the Netherlands or the European Union is, inter alia, also of limited importance.', '2.4.7. The situation of an EU citizen being denied the right to reside in EU territory arises only when the EU citizen is so dependent on the third-country national that, as a consequence of the decision by the defendant, he has no other choice than to stay with that national outside EU territory. In the appellant’s case, that has not occurred. The appellant’s children can be cared for by their father. The father also has Netherlands nationality. The appellant’s husband and children are not obliged or actually compelled to go with her to Suriname in connection with the application for a provisional residence visa. Their rights as EU citizens are thus not breached.', '2.4.8. It was reasonable for the defendant to take the view that there was no appearance of very special individual circumstances leading to undue hardship. The proceedings concerning the appellant’s previous requests for a residence permit and the course of events during her placement in aliens’ detention for removal purposes cannot be regarded as such. The lawfulness of the decisions taken in those proceedings cannot be examined in the present appeal proceedings. The appellant has further not substantiated her claim that, when she submitted her first request for a residence permit, she complied with all the requirements and that she should then have been granted a residence permit. ...”', 'The Regional Court went on to find that the applicant had not substantiated her alleged medical problems or why these problems should lead to exempting her from the obligation to hold a provisional residence visa. The court further found that the applicant had not demonstrated her claim that, apart from the requirement to hold a provisional residence visa, she met all requirements for the issuance of a residence permit.', '35. On 14 August 2012, the applicant filed a further appeal with the Administrative Jurisdiction Division. No further information about the proceedings on this latest request for a residence permit has been submitted by the parties.', '36. On 5 January 2007, the aliens’ police ordered the applicant to report to them on 10 January 2007 so that she could be served with notice to leave the country within two weeks. This order was withdrawn owing to the applicant’s third request for a residence permit filed on 23 January 2007 (see paragraph 19 above).', '37. On 26 February 2010, the applicant’s lawyer was informed by the aliens’ police that – as the applicant’s appeal against the judgment of 8 December 2009 (see paragraphs 23 and 25 above) did not have suspensive effect – they would proceed with the applicant’s removal.', '38. On 10 April 2010, having failed to respond to a summons of 4 March 2010 to report to the aliens’ police, the applicant was placed in aliens’ detention (vreemdelingenbewaring) for removal purposes in accordance with section 59 § 1 (a) of the Aliens Act 2000. She was taken to the Zeist detention centre where she was found to be pregnant, her due date being 14 December 2010.', '39. The applicant’s three successive release requests were rejected by the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in Rotterdam on 27 April, 1 June and 8 July 2010, respectively. In each decision, the Regional Court found that there were sufficient prospects of expulsion within a reasonable time frame and that the Netherlands authorities were pursuing the applicant’s removal with sufficient diligence. In its rulings, the Regional Court also rejected the applicant’s arguments that her pregnancy rendered her detention contrary to Article 3 and that, against that background, her conditions of detention were incompatible with that provision. In this context, in a letter of 29 June 2010 and addressed to the applicant’s lawyer who submitted it in the proceedings to the Regional Court, the Netherlands section of Amnesty International expressed its concern about the applicant’s placement in aliens’ detention. Although aware that the applicant had failed to respect the duty to report imposed on her, Amnesty International considered that a less severe measure than deprivation of liberty would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the applicant’s case.', '40. In the course of her placement in aliens’ detention, the applicant, on 28 June, 15 July and 3 August 2010, also filed complaints about her conditions of detention with the competent Supervisory Board (Commissie van Toezicht) of the two detention centres where she was held. These complaints were decided in two decisions given on 12 and 29 November 2010, respectively. Apart from the applicant’s complaint of 28 June 2010 that she had been required to wear restraints during transports to hospital, which was accepted as well-founded in the decision of 29 November 2010, the applicant’s complaints were dismissed. On 6 June 2011 the Appeals Board (beroepscommissie) of the Council for the Administration of Criminal Justice and Juvenile Protection (Raad voor Strafrechtstoepassing en Jeugdbescherming) gave final decisions on the applicant’s appeals against the decisions of 12 and 29 November 2010. It held that the use of restraints for pregnant women was impermissible. It also held that the applicant had received too little supplementary nutrition upon arrival at the Rotterdam detention centre. These complaints were considered by the Court in its decision on admissibility of 4 December 2012 (see paragraph 4 above) and were declared inadmissible for the reasons set out therein.', '41. The applicant was released from aliens’ detention on 5 August 2010 and her third child was born on 28 November 2010.', '42. On 25 September 2012, the Consulate General of Suriname in Amsterdam issued a Surinamese passport to the applicant, which is valid until 25 September 2017.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The first applicant was born in 1971 and is serving a prison sentence in the Vologda Region. The second applicant was born in 1975 and is serving a prison sentence in the Kostroma Region.', '6. On 24 October 2005 the first applicant was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. He remained in custody pending investigation and trial. His defence was carried out by a State-appointed lawyer, M.', '7. On 24 July 2006 the Vologda Town Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to nine and a half years’ imprisonment. The applicant, but not his State-appointed lawyer, appealed.', '8. On 13 and 21 November 2006 the applicant informed the Vologda Regional Court that he did not wish to be represented by M. in view of the perfunctory nature of the services that she had provided.', '9. On 6 December 2006 another lawyer, Ye., was appointed to represent the applicant before the appeal court. On the same date she studied the case file.', '10. On 7 December 2006 the Regional Court examined the applicant’s case on appeal. The applicant was in a special room in a detention facility from which he could participate in the appeal hearing by means of a video link. Ye. was present in the courtroom. She did not submit fresh grounds for appeal and made oral submissions to the court that appeared to be based on the grounds for appeal originally filed by the applicant. The court upheld the applicant’s conviction.', '11. According to the applicant, at the beginning of the hearing he asked the court to provide him with an opportunity to meet with Ye. in private to discuss his line of defence. His request was refused. He was then removed from the room where the video conference equipment was installed and thus was prevented from following the appeal hearing which took place in his absence.', '12. According to the Government, the applicant had had ample opportunity to communicate with Ye. prior to the appeal hearing via video link. He did not argue before the appeal court that he had been unable to discuss his case with Ye. in order to make sure that she had a sufficiently thorough knowledge of the case as to be able to carry out his defence effectively. The applicant stayed in the video-conference room throughout the appeal hearing and was not prevented in any way from participating in it.', '13. On an unspecified date the second applicant was arrested and charged with murder and robbery. He remained in custody pending investigation and trial.', '14. On 26 December 2006 the Kostroma Regional Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to seventeen years’ imprisonment. The applicant appealed, stating that he was not guilty and that the trial court had erred in assessing the evidence before it.', '15. On 12 April 2007 the applicant asked the Supreme Court (acting as the appeal court) in writing to appoint a lawyer to represent him.', '16. On 18 April 2007 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. The applicant participated in the hearing by means of a video link. According to the applicant, the quality of the sound was very poor. He could not hear or understand the judges. He stated that he reiterated his request to be represented before the appeal court; that request was refused.', '17. On 16 September 2010 the Court gave notice of the application to the Government.', '18. On 16 March 2011 the Presidium of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation considered a supervisory review appeal lodged by Deputy Prosecutor General. The court acknowledged that the applicant’s right to be provided with legal counsel had been infringed, quashed the appeal judgment of 18 April 2007, and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appeal court. The applicant participated in the proceedings by means of a video link. He was represented by a Stateappointed lawyer, U.', '19. On an unspecified date another lawyer, M., was appointed to represent the applicant. Prior to the hearing before the appeal court, she studied the material in his case file.', '20.

The applicant participated in the proceedings by means of a video link. According to the transcript of the appeal hearing, the applicant agreed that his defence would be carried out by lawyer M. He further asked the court for additional time in which to meet with M. to discuss his defence. The court adjourned the hearing in order to ensure that the applicant could meet with M.', '22. On 20 May 2011 the Supreme Court resumed the hearing. The applicant informed the court that he had discussed the case with M. by means of a video link. The court heard the applicant, M., and the prosecutor.

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Sofia.', '6. On 15 October 1993 the applicant got married. At the time of the marriage, the applicant’s wife had an almost three-year old son, who had been born on 20 September 1990 and whose father had been registered as “unknown”. On 21 September 1993 the applicant was registered as having recognised paternity in respect of that child.', '7. The spouses apparently stopped living together about two years after their marriage and divorced in 1997.', '8. In 1999 the applicant brought a claim in court to declare his recognition of paternity null and void. In particular, he asserted that the declaration, with which the child had been recognised and which had been enclosed in the case file, bore a signature that was not his. The Sofia City Court examined his case and found that the legal requirements for recognition of the child had not been met. More specifically, the applicant had not personally expressed his will to recognise the child before the State agent authorised to receive such declarations; in addition, it had been established on the basis of an expert report during the proceedings that the signature on the documents with which the child had been recognised in 1993 was not that of the applicant. The court declared the recognition of the child by the applicant null and void in a final decision of June 2001, which entered into force the following month.', '9. In March 2002 the applicant’s former wife brought a claim on behalf of her child to establish the applicant’s paternity. She asked the court to order gynecological and blood tests in the context of the proceedings. She indicated in the claim the applicant’s “permanent address” as the address where he could be reached.', '10. The applicant was not found at his “permanent address” when the authorities visited it once in April 2002. According to a note by the summons officer, a neighbour had indicated that the applicant no longer lived there. The authorities proceeded by summoning the applicant with a publication in the State Gazette in July 2002. As he did not appear in court, a lawyer was appointed ex officio to represent him. The lawyer attended the court hearing before the Sofia City Court which took place on 2 December 2002; it appears that she had no contact with the applicant at any point in time, either before or after the hearing.', '11. In a judgment of 16 December 2002 the Sofia City Court allowed the claim, declaring the applicant the biological father of the child. The court also held that the child was to carry the applicant’s names (as a patronymic and family name) and determined a monthly amount of child maintenance which the applicant had to pay. The court remained silent on the request for blood tests made by the applicant’s former wife. Instead, it based its findings on the date of the child’s birth and on testimony submitted by the applicant’s former wife’s cousin and aunt. The latter stated that, at the time of the child’s conception, the mother had been in an intimate relationship only with him. The court held that this was sufficient to conclude that the applicant was the child’s father. The applicant was also ordered to pay about 50 euros (EUR) in legal fees to each of the ex officio lawyers appointed by the court to represent him and the child respectively.', '12. On 19 December 2002 the Sofia City Court prepared two notifications of the judgment, one for the attention of the applicant and another for the attention of the child. The notification to the child was handed in person to the child’s lawyer on 8 January 2003. As for the notification to the applicant, on 13 January 2003 a court officer indicated on the court papers for notification that according to information from the applicant’s neighbours he no longer lived at his “permanent address” and no new address was known for him. On 16 January 2003 the court ordered that the notification be sent to the applicant’s ex officio lawyer; the latter was personally served a notice of the judgment on 18 January 2003. The notice indicated that an appeal against the judgment could be filed within 14 days from the moment of notification. The applicant’s ex officio lawyer did not appeal against the judgment and it became final.', '13. The applicant found out about the judgment on 26 April 2004 when he was informed, at his “permanent address”, of his obligation to pay child maintenance in accordance with a writ of execution following the 2002 Sofia City Court judgment. A later certificate, issued on 25 May 2011 by the bailiff service and enclosed in the case file, indicated that no payments had been received in connection with the writ.', '14. On 26 July 2004, the applicant filed a request for reopening, relying on Article 231 (e) and Article 231 (ж) of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 in force at the time (see paragraph 28 below). He claimed in particular that he had been deprived of the opportunity personally to participate in the court proceedings in which he had been declared the father of the child.', '15. The Supreme Court of Cassation (SCC) examined his request for reopening. It observed that the applicant had only learned about the Sofia City Court 2002 decision on 26 April 2004. It found his request for reopening procedurally admissible as lodged within the statutory time-limit. Nevertheless, the SCC rejected the request on the ground that the procedure for summoning him to the hearing had been observed, namely, attempted service at the applicant’s last known address and publication in the State Gazette. The Court also noted that a legal representative had been appointed ex officio and had represented the applicant during the proceedings. The court concluded, in a final judgment of 11 November 2005, that the applicant’s right to take part in those proceedings and to exercise his defence had not been infringed.']",['8'],['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1954 and prior to his arrest lived in the town of Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. He is currently being detained in a temporary detention facility in Rostov-on-Don.', '8. In 1993 the applicant, at the material time the deputy Prime Minister of the Dagestan Republic, survived an assassination attempt. However, his spine was badly wounded and he became paralysed. He cannot walk and is confined to a wheelchair. He also lost his ability to urinate or defecate without special medical procedures, such as catheters and enemas.', '9. Since 1998 the applicant has been mayor of Makhachkala, the Dagestan Republic.', '10. Сriminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion of organised aggravated murder and attempted murder of State officials, including several prosecutors, investigators, a member of the town council and the head of the investigative committee in the Dagestan Republic. The investigation was assigned to a group of senior investigators and criminologists from the investigative committees of various regions of the Russian Federation and led by the deputy head of the Russian Federal Investigative Committee, a major-general. The applicant was arrested on 1 June 2013.', '11. On the following day the Basmanniy District Court of Moscow ordered the applicant’s detention pending trial, citing the gravity of the charges against him and the risk that he might abscond, interfere with the investigation, in particular influence witnesses, and reoffend. The District Court’s decision was based on the applicant’s official powers and his significant contacts with various persons involved in the investigation, as well as his consequent ability to influence the investigation. The court referred to the case-file materials, according to which a number of defendants arrested on suspicion of participating in the murders were also public officials and law-enforcement agents, investigators or police officers. They had identified the applicant as the “master-mind” of the murders, had provided details of the murders and had argued that certain victims had been murdered in retaliation for their failure to obey the applicant’s orders.', '12. At the same time, the District Court dismissed the applicant’s arguments pertaining to his poor state of health, his stable family situation, his age and his standing in the community, having considered that they did not outweigh the reasons warranting his detention. The District Court was also not convinced by the description given by the head of the Makhachkala police department portraying the applicant as “an example of compliance with the law and public order”.', '13. The decision of 2 June 2013 was upheld on appeal on 3 July 2013 when the Moscow City Court found the District Court’s finding reasonable and convincing. The City Court also noted that no alternative measure, such as house arrest or a written undertaking, could ensure the proper course of the criminal proceedings.', '14. On 26 July 2013 the Basmannyy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 11 November 2013, having again linked the gravity and nature of the charges against him, as well as his standing in society, to the likelihood that he would obstruct the course of justice, reoffend or abscond. The District Court once again relied on the applicant’s connections to support the conclusion that if released he would tamper with the evidence. At the same time, the District Court took into account a medical opinion issued on 17 July 2013 (cited in detail below), according to which the applicant’s state of health did not preclude his detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility. It also noted that there was no evidence that the authorities had delayed the pre-trial investigation. The District Court concluded by stressing that the case was particularly complex, involved a large number of defendants and required a series of investigative steps to be taken.', '15. On 20 September 2013 new charges were brought against the applicant. He was charged with firearms trafficking and attempting to organise a terrorist attack on a public official, his political rival. According to the investigation, the applicant and his accomplices had intended to shoot down, with a portable anti-aircraft rocket launcher, a civilian aircraft in which the public official was to travel from Makhachkala to Moscow with other passengers.', '16. On 7 November 2013 the Basmannyy District Court accepted the investigators’ request to extend the applicant’s detention again until 28 February 2014. The District Court noted the gravity of the charges, including the new ones, and the fact that the applicant was facing a sentence of up to life imprisonment. It once again cited the risks of the applicant absconding, reoffending and obstructing the course of justice, and expressed concern for the safety of the witnesses and victims. The District Court noted that the investigation of certain criminal offences with which the applicant was charged was at an active stage and that the risk of his interfering with the investigation, if he were released, was well-founded. More than eleven defendants had been arrested and certain suspects were yet to be apprehended. The District Court placed particular weight on the complexity of the case and the progress that the investigators were making with it.', '17. The District Court also examined in detail the arguments put forward by the defence in favour of the applicant’s release and the application of a more lenient measure of restraint. It concluded that neither his family ties nor his state of health outweighed the reasons for his continued detention. In particular, the District Court relied on the medical opinions of 17 July and 7 August 2013, which had found that the applicant’s illness was not among those listed in Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011 preventing the detention of a suspect. It further stressed that on a daily basis at least three medical specialists from municipal and State medical facilities (“generalists, surgeons, neurologists, urologists, endocrinologists, proctologists, an infectious diseases specialist, and a rehabilitation specialist”) had examined the applicant and that he had received the prescribed drug treatment in full. Moreover, he had undergone all the necessary laboratory testing and clinical examinations in certified civilian laboratories in Moscow and on 5 November 2013 he was to undergo yet another expert examination to determine whether he was suffering from any illness warranting his release. Having cited a long list of the applicant’s illnesses, the District Court noted that there was no evidence that his condition had deteriorated or that he required treatment in a specialised medical facility. The District Court dismissed as unreliable various expert opinions and medical records prepared by specialists, including foreign ones, in various related fields of medicine and produced by the defence in support of their argument that the applicant’s life was being put at risk by his prolonged detention in the conditions of an ordinary detention facility and in the absence of adequate medical assistance.', '18. On 25 February 2014 the Basmannyy District Court extended the applicant’s detention until 1 June 2014. Having again assessed the materials presented to it by the investigation and the defence, the District Court concluded that the risks of the applicant influencing witnesses, reoffending, obstructing the investigation by other means and absconding were still present. In particular, the criminal proceedings against the applicant were at a crucial stage of collecting evidence and there was a risk that, using his connections in the criminal underworld, the applicant might try to influence witnesses and victims who feared him. The District Court also cited the medical reports of 17 July, 7 August and 8 November 2013, which supported its conclusion that the applicant’s state of health did not preclude his further detention.', '19. It appears that the applicant’s detention was further extended. However, neither party provided the Court with an update.', '20. On 9 July 2014 the North-Caucasian Military Court found the applicant guilty of conspiring to organise a terrorist attack and sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment. The applicant was stripped of all State awards and commendations. It appears that the criminal proceedings on the remaining charges against the applicant are still pending.', '21. Numerous medical certificates and expert opinions submitted by the parties show that the applicant is suffering from a spinal cord injury, paraplegia, chronic urinary tract infection, chronic pyelonephritis (kidney infection), chronic urinary retention, rectal prolapse (a condition in which the rectum protrudes out of the anus), paraproctitis (an inflammation of the cellular tissues surrounding the rectum), ischemic heart disease, chronic heart failure, hypertension, a thyroid gland disease, hepatitis C and non-insulin-dependent diabetes.', '22. At the request of the applicant’s representatives a panel comprising experts in neurology, urology and general medicine examined the applicant’s medical records dating from the period between 2001 and 2008. Their report dated 2 July 2013 found that, due to his inability to satisfy his most basic needs (such as moving, urinating or defecating) without help and to his very serious diseases, the applicant required constant medical supervision, treatment and assistance and that he should therefore be placed in a specialised medical facility. His detention in a temporary detention facility could aggravate his condition and, in the absence of a swift reaction to such an aggravation, could result in his death. The report also found that the applicant was suffering from diseases which, according to Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011, were incompatible with detention.', '23. On 17 July 2013 a panel of three doctors from State hospital no. 20 in Moscow examined the applicant at the investigator’s request. Having studied the applicant’s medical history, the results of his recent clinical blood and urine analyses, as well as the results of his ultrasound scan and MRT examinations, the doctors confirmed the diagnoses and found that the applicant “was not suffering from any of the serious diseases included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention of a suspect or an accused”. The report did not indicate the field of medicine in which the doctors specialised.', '24. In response to a request by the investigator, on 25 July 2013 the director of the medical unit of temporary detention facility (SIZO-2) in Moscow, where the applicant was detained, prepared a certificate describing the applicant’s state of health. Citing extracts from the medical records, the director reported that the applicant was examined by him almost every day and also by various specialist doctors, including a urologist, a neurologist, a surgeon, a cardiologist and an endocrinologist. Blood and urine tests were regularly performed. He was prescribed and administered various medications. The applicant used disposable catheters to urinate. He performed that procedure himself, as he had done before his arrest, up to ten times a day without the facility administration having the possibility of ensuring the requisite level of asepsis. An enema was carried out by a doctor two or three times a week to make the applicant defecate. The applicant’s condition was stable and no deterioration in his health had been noted, although he had continued to raise various health complaints.', '25. At the same time, the director of the medical unit also noted that, because the applicant was confined to a wheelchair, he could not be transported to the medical unit of the detention facility. He was therefore held in an ordinary cell where he was visited by the doctors and where all the necessary medical procedures were performed. In particular, the neighbouring cell which was used to perform the enemas was not suitable for that medical procedure as it was difficult to ensure the requisite sterility. The director stressed that lack of sterility could result in a serious complication.', '26. The applicant’s lawyers submitted the medical report of 17 July 2013 for assessment by two medical specialists: a deputy president of the Russian Scientific Society of Medical Experts, academician and honorary doctor of the Russian Federation, Mr K.; and a member of the Russian and International Neurosurgeons’ Association, academician and highly respected professor-neurosurgeon, Mr S. On 25 July 2013 the two experts issued their review of the report. Having noticed the lack of information on the medical qualifications and specialisation of the three doctors who had issued the report, the two experts considered that the report contained a number of “significant and important contradictions”. In particular:', '- a urologist had not examined the applicant or participated in the preparation of the report of 17 July 2013, even though the applicant was suffering from a serious urological disorder;', '- although the three doctors had been provided with a complete set of medical records comprising the applicant’s medical history, including those related to his injuries and complications, the report was only based on “fragments of that information”; major complications arising from the applicant’s condition, such as chronic cystitis and pyelonephritis, remained unassessed;', '- Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011 listed, among the serious illnesses precluding the detention of a suspect, “serious progressive forms of atrophic and degenerative illnesses of the nervous system accompanied by a stable disorder of the motor, sensory and vegeto-trophic functions”, which fully corresponded to the applicant’s diagnosis. However, that medical condition had not been taken into account by the three doctors who had prepared the report of 17 July 2013;', '- the applicant was also suffering from a life-threatening post-traumatic pathology of the kidneys and urinary tracts. However, despite the fact that a similar condition was also listed by the Governmental decree among the illnesses precluding detention, the three doctors had paid no attention to it.', '27. The two experts concluded that the report of 17 July 2013 was incomplete and was not objective, as it did not fully reflect the “true picture of [the applicant’s] pathology, which undoubtedly fell within the serious illnesses precluding detention pending trial, as determined by Governmental Decree no. 3 of 14 January 2011”.', '28. On 7 August 2013 the three doctors from hospital no. 20 issued another report confirming the findings in their previous report of 17 July 2013. The doctors again concluded that the applicant’s condition did not warrant his release as he was not suffering from any illness listed in Governmental Decree no. 3. The findings of the two reports were similar, the only difference being that part of the second report was based on more recent clinical tests and examinations of the applicant.', '29. On 13 August 2013 the applicant asked the Court to apply Rule 39 of the Rules of Court and to authorise his transfer to a specialised medical facility as an interim measure.', '30. The applicant claimed that the medical assistance he was receiving in the temporary detention facility was insufficient in view of his very serious diseases, which required constant medical supervision by specialised medical staff. The facility’s medical staff were not competent to deal with such serious conditions. The treatment he was receiving there did not correspond to the treatment he had received before his arrest. Moreover, he was unable to satisfy his most basic needs without help. In particular, when he wanted to defecate, he had to wait, suffering, until an external specialist was called, as the facility staff were not qualified to carry out an enema. According to the applicant, such inadequate medical assistance could result in a brutal aggravation of his condition and ultimate death.', '31. On 16 August 2013 the Court decided to indicate to the Russian Government, under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, that it was desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings that the applicant be immediately examined by medical experts independent from the prison system with a view to determining: (1) whether the treatment he was receiving in the detention facility was adequate for his condition; (2) whether his current state of health was compatible with detention in the conditions of a detention facility; and (3) whether his current condition required his placement in a hospital.', '32. On 26 August 2013 the Government responded to the Court’s letter of 16 August 2013, having submitted a handwritten copy of the report prepared when the applicant was examined on admission to the detention facility SIZO-2 in Moscow; documents showing that the detention facility was licensed to provide medical services to inmates; certificates issued jointly by the head of the detention facility and the director of its medical unit describing the state of the applicant’s health and listing the medical procedures to which he had been subjected; extracts from the applicant’s medical history dating back to 2007; a certificate issued by the same two officials informing the Court that there was no risk to the applicant’s life and limb and that his condition was considered stable; a handwritten copy of the applicant’s medical record drawn up in the detention facility in which the most recent entry had been made on 21 August 2013 by a prison doctor; a record drawn up during the applicant’s stay in hospital no. 20 in Moscow from 11 to 17 July 2013, noting the applicant’s diagnosis and assessing his condition as moderately serious; a medical record from a psychiatric prison hospital where he had stayed from 12 to 17 June 2013 and where he had been treated for an “adaptation disorder affecting emotions and behaviour”; copies of the two medical reports issued on 17 July and 7 August 2013, respectively, by a medical commission of three doctors from hospital no. 20 who, having cited the applicant’s medical history and the results of his examinations by various specialists and clinical tests performed in the hospital in July 2013 and the beginning of August 2013, concluded that the applicant was “not suffering from an illness included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention of suspected or accused persons”.', '33. The Government also answered the three questions which, in its letter of 16 August 2013, the Court had asked them to address to independent medical experts. In particular, having provided an answer to the first question related to the adequacy of the applicant’s treatment, the Government stressed that the applicant had been placed under dynamic medical supervision by the medical personnel of the detention facility in relation to illnesses of the musculoskeletal, endocrine, hepatobiliary and urinary systems. They acknowledged that the applicant, as a wheelchair- bound inmate, required systematic care and permanent medical attention, which were being provided to him in a special cell. He was performing the remaining hygiene procedures himself. The Government submitted that the applicant received the necessary medical attention and that no additional medical procedures were required.', '34. In their response to the second question about the compatibility of the applicant’s state of health with the conditions of the detention facility, the Government stressed that the applicant was under the medical supervision of the personnel of the detention facility and was also being seen by various civilian medical specialists. The prison doctors were fully complying with the treatment plan developed by the civilian specialists.', '35. In replying to the third question as to whether the applicant needed to be transferred to a hospital, the Government relied on the two reports issued by the three doctors from hospital no. 20 on 17 July and 7 August 2013, according to which the applicant was not suffering from any condition included in the list of serious illnesses precluding the detention of suspected and accused persons in detention facilities, as provided for by in Decree no. 3 of the Government of the Russian Federation of 14 January 2011.', '36. On 29 August 2013 the Court reminded the Russian Government that on 16 August 2013 an interim measure had been imposed under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, in accordance with which independent medical experts were to examine the applicant and provide their expert opinion on the three questions, assessing the quality of the applicant’s treatment, the compatibility of his state of health with the conditions of the detention facility and the need to transfer him to a hospital. The Government’s attention was also drawn to the fact that the failure of a Contracting State to comply with a measure indicated under Rule 39 may entail a breach of Article 34 of the Convention.', '37. On 13 September 2013 the Government submitted an English translation of their submissions of 26 August 2013.', '38. The applicant submitted a large number of medical reports and opinions issued by various Russian and foreign experts. In particular, he provided the Court with a copy of an opinion issued by Dr P. of the Nurnberg Centre of Gastroenterology in Germany, where he had undergone treatment on a number of occasions since 2004. The doctor who had attended to the applicant on those occasions stressed that he was in need of permanent medical supervision by qualified specialists. The lack of such assistance, in the doctor’s opinion, was life-threatening. He also noted that the conditions of a detention facility were not suitable for a person in the applicant’s state of health.', '39. The applicant also provided the Court with an assessment report issued on 15 August 2013 by a deputy president of the Russian Scientific Society of Medical Experts, academician and honorary doctor of the Russian Federation, Dr K., in response to the medical opinion prepared on 7 August 2013 by the three doctors from hospital no. 20. Dr K. again criticised the opinion for the same defects as those identified in the previous report of 17 July 2013.', '40. According to another report prepared on 2 August 2013 by Professor B., a surgeon from the Caspari Clinic in Munich, Germany, the applicant required complex daily medical examinations and procedures to control his diabetes, hepatitis C and urological problems. The doctor, who had treated the applicant in December 2012 and January 2013, insisted that the lack of such care would be critically dangerous for the applicant’s life.', '41. Another medical expert from Germany, a urologist from a hospital in Dillenburg, in his opinion of 5 August 2013, described the complexity of the applicant’s health condition and listed the treatment which he should receive on a daily basis. He concluded that the applicant’s detention in the absence of such treatment posed a threat to his life.', '42. Two more specialist reports were issued in November 2013: the first, by a professor of urology/andrology from Salzburg, Dr J.; and the second by a professor of surgery and intensive surgical medicine from the Paracelsus Private Medical University of Salzburg, Dr W. The reports were based on the applicant’s medical record and answers to their questions prepared by the applicant’s defence team. Having noted the poor sanitary conditions in which the applicant had to undergo necessary procedures and his “reduced immune system”, their prognosis for him was “very bad”, with the likelihood that “over time he would suffer from antibiotic-resistant urinary tract infection that [could] cause urosepsis with a very high risk of [death]”. Dr J. concluded that from the medical evidence before him, the applicant already had a permanent urinary tract infection which would probably soon develop into urosepsis. There was a 60% to 90% chance of developing septic shock and death in such a case, even in optimal clinical conditions. That chance became far more probable in a prison environment. The risk was even higher than for otherwise healthy paraplegic men given that the applicant was suffering from diabetes. Having listed various medical procedures and recommendations for treatment, Dr J. concluded that the applicant’s life “was in acute danger” and that “high-quality medical management of [the applicant’s] problems [was] mandatory”.', 'Dr W. concluded his analysis of the applicant’s health and the treatment to which he was being subjected with the following assessment:', '“In my 40 years of professional experience as a surgeon, I have never encountered such inhuman, demoralizing and humiliating treatment of [a disabled person] bound to a wheelchair. A paraplegic patient has the same life expectancy as a [non-disabled] person, provided the measures described above are followed. Based on the documents presented to me, I have no reason to assume that this is the case.', 'Given the circumstances described here, one may expect the patient to experience severe and agonizing pain. Due to the non-existent medical care, one may anticipate severe complications or his demise.”', '43. On 17 December 2013 Dr W. amended his expert opinion. Having again listed all the illnesses with which the applicant had been diagnosed by the Russian prison authorities, Dr W. stated as follows:', '“From the medical view it is absolutely insignificant if one or more of those diseases are not in the list of serious diseases preventing the holding in custody of suspects or accused of the commission of crimes.', 'On the other hand, it is proved in international medical literature that the combination of all these serious diseases causes an enormous life threatening situation for [the applicant]. The patient is really very critically ill.”.', '44. In the meantime, relying on the Court’s letter of 16 August 2013, on 27 September 2013 the applicant’s lawyers asked the investigators in the case to provide the applicant with an opportunity to be examined in person by a number of medical experts from various civilian hospitals, including those who had prepared the reports assessing the doctors’ opinions of 17 July and 7 August 2013. The lawyers insisted that the named specialists had agreed to provide their expert opinion in response to the three questions put by the Court before the Russian Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.', '45. On 3 October 2013 the lawyers received a letter from the senior investigator “fully refusing” their request. Having pointed out that the applicant had already been examined twice by doctors from hospital no. 20, a civilian hospital, and that the doctors had concluded that the applicant was not suffering from an illness included in the list of serious illnesses precluding detention pending trial, the senior investigator dismissed the request.', '46. The lawyers sent a similar request to the director of the applicant’s detention facility. The director responded that he did not “in principle” object to such an examination by medical experts, but that the decision authorising the examination could only be taken by the investigator.', '47. The applicant was again sent for an examination to hospital no. 20, where the three doctors confirmed their previous findings of 17 July and 7 August 2013. The new report issued on 5 November 2013 was very similar.', '48. The lawyers also submitted to the Court a large number of certificates issued by the administration of the detention facility showing that the applicant’s daily needs in terms of medicines and medical materials, including catheters, were covered by his relatives. The director of the detention facility also confirmed that fact in his letter of 23 October 2013.', '49. On 1 April 2014 the applicant was transferred to temporary detention facility no. 4 in Rostov-on-Don. A prison doctor attending on the applicant in that facility issued a record listing a number of visits to the applicant by various medical specialists and registering the applicant’s mounting complaints. In the same record she stated that while the applicant remained under permanent medical supervision and was subjected to regular clinical examinations, with his condition, due to those procedures, being satisfactory, any of his illnesses at any time could lead to a significant deterioration in his health and become acute or chronic, with an unpredictable prognosis for his life expectancy.']","['3', '34']",[],[],['5'],['5-3'],[],1

The applicant, a former police officer, was born in 1962 and lives in Zaporizhzhya. He is also acting on behalf of his son, V., who was born in 1991.', '6. On 13 September 2003 four people, including the applicant, were apprehended by officers of the Zaporizhzhya office of the Security Service of Ukraine (Служба Безпеки України – “the SBU”) in Novokateshchino village while attempting to transport opiate drugs with a view to selling them on. They were taken to the SBU’s premises for questioning. After being informed of his privilege against self-incrimination, the applicant made a written statement to the effect that he had appeared at the crime scene by chance, at the request of a friend with whom he and his son had been looking for a place to fish.', '7. Later the same day criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and two other people on suspicion of illegal production, storage and sale of drugs.', '8. On 14 September 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant and the two others on suspicion of membership of an organised crime group.', '9. On the same date the applicant was arrested. Having been informed of his procedural rights as a suspect, he refused to give evidence without a lawyer present.', '10. On 15 September 2003 the applicant’s wife hired a lawyer, G., to represent the applicant.', '11. On 16 September 2003 the applicant’s pre-trial detention was ordered by a court.', '12. On 19 September 2003 the applicant requested that G. be admitted to the proceedings as his lawyer.', '13. On the same date, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant denied his involvement in the crime.', '14. On 23 September 2003, in the presence of his lawyer, the applicant was charged with drug-related crimes and questioned. He did not want to be informed of his rights and stated that he would not give any evidence during the pre-trial investigation.', '15. On 2 October 2003 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer. He provided some biographical details as well as information on his family status, state of health and place of residence.', '16. On 18 November 2003 the applicant was again questioned in the presence of his lawyer.', '17. On 15 December 2003 all the criminal proceedings against the applicant were joined.', '18. On 18 December 2003 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his lawyer. He did not confess to the crimes.', '19. On 22 and 23 December 2003 confrontations between the applicant and his co-accused were conducted with his lawyer present.', '20. On 24 December 2003 amended charges were brought against the applicant in his lawyer’s presence. The applicant pleaded not guilty.', '21. On 6 February 2004 the applicant’s wife was admitted to the proceedings as the applicant’s lay representative.', '22. On 10 February 2004, upon his written consent, the applicant was questioned without a lawyer.', '23. On 9 March 2004 the criminal case against the applicant and his coaccused was sent to the Leninsky District Court of Zaporizhzhya (“the District Court”). During the trial the applicant pleaded not guilty. He maintained that the case had been fabricated by his enemies and that all the evidence had been falsified and was inadmissible. In fact, he, a retired police officer, had been arrested in the company of drug addicts with whom he had been in contact as an advisor to the local police. They might have been producing drugs for their own use. He further claimed that his case should benefit from being examined in camera by a judge who had security clearance, to protect State secrets concerning the functioning of his network of informants.', '24. In May 2004 F., a lawyer hired by the applicant’s wife, was admitted to the proceedings to represent the applicant.', '25. On 25 October 2005, after having heard the case in public hearings, the District Court convicted the applicant and his co-defendants of drugrelated offences. The applicant was sentenced to eight-and-a-half years’ imprisonment and the confiscation of his personal property was ordered.', '26. The applicant, represented by his lawyer and his wife, appealed. He repeated his arguments advanced at trial and complained that he had been unable to defend himself properly during the trial as he had been reticent in order to safeguard confidential information concerning the network of informants. He also complained of various procedural breaches in the collection of evidence. He alleged, with no further details, that he had had no access to a lawyer from the first questioning and, even after his lawyer had been allowed access, the authorities had tried to carry out a number of investigative steps without the lawyer present.', '27. On 26 April 2006 the Zaporizhya Regional Court of Appeal allowed the defence’s request to have the proceedings held in camera to prevent public disclosure of information concerning the network of informants and required all the defence lawyers and representatives to undergo security clearance to continue taking part in the proceedings. The applicant’s wife did not receive security clearance in time for the appeal hearing and did not attend it.', '28. On 22 June 2006 the Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s judgment.', '29. On 18 December 2007, following a prior appeal by the applicant, the Supreme Court of Ukraine quashed this decision and remitted the case for fresh consideration. It noted, in particular, that the applicant’s right to defence had been breached since the applicant’s wife had been unable to take part in the appeal hearing. It further found that the Court of Appeal had addressed the parties’ arguments in a summary way only, while it should have given detailed explanations in response to those arguments.', '30. On 22 December 2008 the Court of Appeal reviewed the case in the presence of the applicant’s wife. It upheld the applicant’s conviction, reduced his sentence to eight years’ imprisonment and ordered the confiscation of his personal property. The conviction was mainly based on the records of the crime-scene inspection and the testimonies of the applicant’s co-defendants, which the trial court found to be corroborated by witness statements, and other evidence in the case.', '31. On 2 July 2009 the Supreme Court of Ukraine rejected the applicant’s request for leave to appeal on points of law.', '32. The applicant’s twelve-year-old son was with him when he was apprehended on 13 September 2003. He was taken with him to the SBU and remained in the same room with the applicant for most of the time. No other family members were informed of the boy’s whereabouts.', '33. On the morning of 14 September 2014, after the applicant had been formally arrested, his son was returned to his mother.', '34. On 3 January 2004 the applicant’s wife lodged a criminal complaint with the Zaporizhzhya regional prosecutor’s office (“the prosecutor’s office”) in which she alleged, inter alia, that her son had been unlawfully detained at the SBU’s premises between 13 and 14 September 2003.', '35. On 9 February 2004, having questioned the applicant and the SBU officers, the prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings as it had been established that no pressure had been applied to the applicant’s son and that he had been able to move freely and had not been deprived of his liberty. It was further noted that the applicant had not complained of the SBU staff’s attitude towards his son.', '36. On 20 April 2004 the applicant’s son challenged the above decision before the Prosecutor General.', '37. In April 2004 the applicant and his wife lodged another complaint concerning the alleged unlawful detention of their son with the prosecutor’s office.', '38. On 7 May 2004 the prosecutor’s office, having questioned the applicant, his wife and son, as well as the SBU officers and some witnesses, refused to institute criminal proceedings in respect of the above complaint, having found no corpus delicti in the officers’ actions. It was established during the relevant investigation that the applicant’s son had been taken to the SBU’s premises at the applicant’s request and had not been arrested or detained and had been returned to his relatives as soon as the decision to arrest the applicant had been taken; and that the applicant had raised no complaints during his son’s stay at the SBU. It was also noted in the relevant resolution that the applicant’s wife had refused to provide her son’s medical file to prove her allegations concerning the worsening of his state of health and that there had been a contradiction in the applicant’s statements and between his and his son’s account of events. The prosecutor thus concluded that the allegations of unlawful deprivation of liberty or of other violations of the applicant’s son’s rights appeared to be ill-founded. He noted that no intention on the part of the officers to interfere with the applicant’s son’s personal security, specifically his freedom of movement, had been established. Likewise, there had been no evidence that the applicant’s son had been subject to any form of pressure or ill-treatment.', '39. On 11 May 2004 the applicant’s wife and son instituted civil proceedings against the SBU before the Zhovtnevy District Court of Zaporizhzhya claiming damages for the unlawful detention of her son. Following a request of the applicant’s wife of 15 October 2004, her civil claim was joined to the criminal proceedings against the applicant.', '40. On 23 July 2004 the deputy prosecutor of Zaporizhzhya Region quashed the resolution of 7 May 2004 as being premature, given that no evidence regarding the applicant’s son’s state of health had been obtained.', '41. On 31 July 2004, having questioned the applicant’s son’s doctors who had observed him in the course of his care previously, the prosecutor again refused to institute criminal proceedings for the same reasons as before. It was noted, inter alia, that none of the doctors had observed any worsening of the applicant’s son’s state of health and that no worsening of his health had been evident from his medical file either.', '42. On 14 October 2004 the prosecutor’s office instituted disciplinary proceedings against two officers of the SBU for their negligence towards the applicant’s son. It noted, inter alia, that the applicant’s son had not been formally arrested (затриманий) but had been kept at the SBU’s premises for no reason and no measures had been taken to return him to his relatives. The prosecutor further observed that the applicant’s son had not been subject to any form of ill-treatment. He also stressed the fact that the applicant’s arrest report had been drafted only the next day after the applicant’s initial arrest, in breach of the requirements of the domestic law. This resolution had been sent to the SBU for relevant measures to be taken.', '43. On 27 October 2004 the SBU informed the prosecutor’s office that the respective officers could no longer be disciplined as the one-year statutory time-limit had expired. It was also observed in that letter that no violations of domestic law by the SBU officers had been established by a number of investigations into the events complained of and that the applicant’s son had stayed with the applicant at the SBU’s premises from 13 to 14 September 2003 at the applicant’s own request.', '44. On 5 November 2004 the applicant’s wife complained to the Prosecutor General about the prosecutor’s decision of 31 July 2004.', '45. On 25 October 2005, when convicting the applicant, the District Court delivered a separate ruling, in which it listed the procedural violations committed by the investigating authorities in the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The fact that the applicant’s son had remained in the SBU’s premises for about twenty-four hours after the applicant’s initial arrest, without his relatives having been informed of his whereabouts and with no medical assistance provided in view of the stress he had been under, was listed among the violations referred to by the court. The Chief of the SBU in Zaporizhzhya was invited by the court to take appropriate measures in view of the above mentioned violations.', '46. On 25 January 2006 the applicant appealed to the Ordzhonikidzevsky District Court of Zaporizhzhya against the prosecutor’s refusal of 31 July 2004 to institute criminal proceedings against the SBU officers.', '47. On 3 April 2006 the applicant’s complaint was left without consideration on the merits. The court noted in this connection that the relevant investigation files had been joined to the criminal case against the applicant and that therefore the prosecutor’s decision was not subject to appeal outside of those criminal proceedings.', '48. During the proceedings in his criminal case before the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court the applicant and his wife repeatedly requested, referring to the separate ruling of 25 October 2005 by the District Court (see paragraph 45 above), that measures be taken to bring the respective officers to trial for the unlawful detention of their son. The case file does not suggest that in their appeals the applicant or his wife claimed damages in this connection.', '49. On 22 December 2008, in its judgment upholding the applicant’s conviction, the Court of Appeal observed that the complaint related to the unlawful detention of the applicant’s son had been considered by the prosecutor’s office and no corpus delicti under criminal law had been found on the part of the SBU officers. The court made no separate ruling in this connection. The Supreme Court did not address this issue in its decision of 2 July 2009.']",['3'],[],[],"['3', '6']","['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],1

The applicants were born in 1980 and 1971 respectively and live in Zubutli-Miatli, Kizilyurt district, Dagestan, Russia. They are the wife and the sister of Mr Kamil Mutayev who was born in 1976.', '6. Between 2010 and 2012 the applicants’ relative Mr Kamil Mutayev had been detained on at least three occasions by representatives of lawenforcement agencies on suspicion of illegal activities and subsequently released. In particular, in 2010 he had been detained pending trial for about six months on suspicion of illegal possession of firearms and assault of a representative of the State and had then been subsequently sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The sentence was suspended.', '7. At about 1 p.m. on 2 May 2012 Mr Kamil Mutayev and his twelveyear old son Muradis were driving in their VAZ-21099 car in Shamil Street in the centre of the town of Kizilyurt, Dagestan, when they were blocked by two silver-coloured VAZ Priora cars with heavily tinted windows, one of which had an official registration number containing the digits “78”. Eight masked men in black uniforms and armed with pistols and machine guns got out of the Priora cars, knocked Mr Kamil Mutayev off his feet and forced him into one of their vehicles. They threatened his son with firearms and ordered him to stay in the car. The abduction took place approximately two hundred metres from the district police station (the department of the interior) and the public prosecutor’s office. After the abduction the perpetrators drove away through the local traffic police checkpoint.', '8. The applicants submitted to the Court the witness statements of Ms Ya.R. dated 7 February 2013 and of Ms As.I. dated 25 February 2013. According to both women, they did not see the abduction but both saw two Priora cars speeding away from the vicinity of where the incident took place around the time of the abduction. It does not appear that either of the witnesses provided a statement to the investigation.', '9. The Government did not dispute the facts as presented by the applicants. At the same time they denied any involvement of State agents in the abduction.', '10. In reply to the Court’s first request for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government provided documents from the file, amounting to 43 pages, which showed the steps taken by the investigators from 14 May to 27 June 2012.', '11. In reply to the Court’s second and third requests for a copy of the contents of the investigation file, the Government submitted copies of its contents, some 688 pages long, which showed the steps taken by the investigators from the beginning of the proceedings to 15 August 2015. From the documents submitted, the investigation can be summarised as follows.', '12. Immediately after the abduction, on 2 May 2012 the applicants complained to the Kizilyurt police station (Отдел внутренних дел по г .Кизилюрт) (hereinafter “the OVD”).', '13. On 2 May 2012 the police questioned the second applicant who provided a detailed account of the events similar to the one submitted to the Court and stated that she had learnt of Mr Kamil Mutayev’s abduction from her nephew Muradis.', '14. On 2 May 2012 the police examined the crime scene. No evidence was collected.', '15. On 2 and then on 10 May 2012 the police questioned Mr Kamil Mutayev’s son Muradis, whose account of the events was similar to that submitted by the applicants to the Court. In addition, the witness stated that the abductors had scared him by threatening to shoot him if he disobeyed their orders not to move.', '16. On 2 or 3 May 2012 the police examined Mr Kamil Mutayev’s VAZ21099 car. Fingerprints taken from the vehicle on that date were submitted for expert examination on 18 May 2012.', '17. On 14 May 2012 the applicants lodged an abduction complaint with the Kizilyurt town prosecutor’s office.', '18. On 14 May 2012 the investigations department of the Kizilyurt town prosecutor’s office opened criminal case no. 207127. The applicants were informed thereof on 24 May 2012.', '19. On 19 May 2012 the investigators questioned Mr Kamil Mutayev’s son Muradis who reiterated his previous statements and added that he would not be able to identify any of the abductors as he had been scared.', '20. On 19 May 2012 the investigators questioned the first applicant whose statement was similar to the applicants’ account submitted to the Court. In particular, the applicant pointed out that when driving away the abductors’ vehicle had gone through the traffic police checkpoint.', '21. On 21 May 2012 the first applicant was granted victim status in the criminal case and questioned again. She reiterated her previous statements.', '22. On 23 May 2012 the Dagestan Forensic Expert Examinations Bureau informed the investigators that they did not have matches in their database for the fingerprints found on Mr Kamil Mutayev’s car.', '23. On 24 May 2012 the investigators again questioned the second applicant whose statement was similar to the applicants’ account submitted to the Court.', '24. On 6 June 2012 the investigators again examined the crime scene.', '25. On 7 June 2012 the investigators again questioned the first applicant who stated that her husband Mr Kamil Mutayev did not have financial debts or enemies. At the same time she stated that on several occasions he had received threats from unidentified persons on account of his religious beliefs. Those persons had visited their house and had thrown hand-written threats inside. The applicant did not specify whether she had had any suspisions or theories concerning the identities of those persons.', '26. On 15 June 2012 the local police informed the investigators that Mr Kamil Mutayev was a member of an illegal armed group, belonged to an extremist religious movement and had, therefore, most probably, staged his own abduction.', '27. On 29 June 2012 the investigators questioned five local residents, all of whom stated that they had not witnessed the abduction and found out about it from others.', '28. On 6 August 2012 the investigators examined the registration log of detainees of the OVD. No records concerning Mr Kamil Mutayev were found therein.', '29. On 6, 7 and 12 August 2012 the investigators questioned police officers from the OVD: Mr M.M., Mr Z.S., Mr R.A., Mr A.M. and Mr D.D. All of them stated that on the date of the abduction they had been on duty at the police station and neither Mr Kamil Mutayev nor his car had been brought in.', '30. On various dates between June and November 2012 the investigators received the list of calls made from and to Mr Kamil Mutayev’s mobile telephone as well as replies to their numerous information requests concerning Mr Kamil Mutayev from hospitals, morgues, retirement homes, mosques and detention centres in various regions of Russia. No information pertatining to his whereabouts or the perpetrators’ identities was obtained.', '31. On 14 September 2012 the investigation was suspended. It is unclear whether the applicants were informed thereof.', '32. On 9 November 2012 the investigation was resumed in order to take further steps.', '33. On 30 November 2012 the investigators questioned the head of the OVD officer R.S. who stated that according to their information Mr Kamil Mutayev was an avid follower of the extremist religious movement Wahhabi and that he had staged his abduction to join an illegal armed group.', '34. On an unspecified date in 2013 the investigation was resumed.', '35. Between March 2013 and February 2014 the investigators questioned a number of Mr Kamil Mutayev’s relatives and neighbours, whose statements did not provide new information. They also questioned again his son Muradis and the first applicant who reiterated their earlier statements.', '36. From the documents submitted it follows that between November 2012 and August 2015 the investigation was suspended and resumed on several occasions. The last resumption of the investigation took place on 10 September 2015. The proceedings are still pending.', '46. The applicants alleged that State agents were responsible for Mr Kamil Mutayev’s disappearance. They stressed that the authorities had suspected him of membership of illegal armed groups and, therefore, had motives for his abduction. The abductors had used Priora cars with heavily tinted windows; only law-enforcement agencies could use such vehicles. Moreover, after the abduction the perperators had passed through a permanent road traffic police checkpoint. The applicants referred to statements of local residents who had not witnessed the abduction but had seen vehicles similar to those of the abductors driving to that police station. Lastly, the applicants referred to a number of cases of abduction perpetrated in Dagestan in which some of the abducted persons had been later found in State custody.', '47. The Government submitted that the applicants’ relative Mr Kamil Mutayev had been abducted by unidentified men or could have staged his own abduction. The only witness to the events was Mr Kamil Mutayev’s son Muradis, who was a minor, and the other persons, including the applicants, learnt of the events from him. In such circumstances the applicants’ allegations concerning involvement of State agents in the incident were groundless.', '48. A summary of the principles concerning the assessment of evidence and establishment of facts in disappearance cases and the life-threatening nature of such incidents may be found in Sultygov and Others v. Russia, nos. 42575/07, 53679/07, 311/08, 424/08, 3375/08, 4560/08, 35569/08, 62220/10, 3222/11, 22257/11, 24744/11 and 36897/11, §§ 393-96, 9 October 2014).', '49. The Court notes that in reply to its request for a copy of the investigation file into the abduction the Government produced the relevant documents from the file (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above).', '50. The Court has already found the Russian authorities responsible for disappearances of civilians perpetrated in Dagestan (see, for example, Umarovy v. Russia, no. 2546/08, 12 June 2012, and Alpatu Israilova v. Russia, no. 15438/05, 14 March 2013). In doing so, it has taken into account the length of time during which the applicants had not had any news of their missing relatives and witness statements and other documents attesting to the presence of security or law-enforcement personnel in the area concerned at the relevant time. It has relied on witness accounts and other information on security operations.', '51. However, in the present case the circumstances in which the events occurred cannot warrant an unequivocal conclusion that State agents were responsible for the abduction of the applicants’ relative for the following reasons. As regards the general background, the events complained of took place in May 2012 and there was neither a curfew in place nor any restrictions on driving in civilian vehicles. Furthermore, from the documents submitted it appears that the applicants’ version of the events was based on the statements of the only witness, Mr Kamil Mutayev’s son, who according to his own statement had been scared during the incident (see paragraph 19 above), and of persons who had not witnessed the actual abduction and whose statements were not included in the investigation file (see paragraph 8 above). In addition, the Court notes that the first applicant stated to the investigation that Mr Kamil Mutayev had received threats but did not specify whom she had suspected or the nature of the threats received (see paragraph 25 above). In such a situation the Court has little evidence on which to draw such conclusions as the factual circumstances of the incident as presented by the applicants do not include any evidence corroborating their account to a decisive extent.', '52. Accordingly, the information in the Court’s possession does not suffice to establish that the perpetrators belonged to the security forces or that a security operation was carried out in respect of Mr Kamil Mutayev.', '53. To sum up, it has not been established to the required standard of proof that State agents were implicated in the disappearance of Mr Kamil Mutayev; nor does the Court consider that the burden of proof can be entirely shifted to the Government, having regard, in particular, to the fact that they submitted a copy of the relevant documents from the investigation file as requested by the Court.']",['2'],['2-1'],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],1

The applicant was born in 1982 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Lepoglava.', '6. On 23 October 2008 I.P., a well-known Croatian journalist, and his business associate N.F. were killed by the explosion of an improvised device placed under I.P.’s car, which was parked in front of his publishing company. The explosion also caused injuries to two employees of the publishing company and considerable material damage on the surrounding buildings and nearby parked cars.', '7. On 23 October 2009 the State Attorney’s Office for the Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime (Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta; hereinafter: the “State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office”) indicted several persons in the Zagreb County Court (Županijski sud u Zagrebu) on charges of conspiracy to kill I.P. and for putting that into action. The applicant was indicted for having participated in the group by aiding and abetting the direct perpetrators.', '8. On 3 November 2010 the Zagreb County Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to sixteen years’ imprisonment.', '9. The applicant’s conviction was upheld by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) on 8 February 2012.', '10. Following the attack against I.P. and his publishing company, the intelligence available to the police showed that the applicant and several other persons could be implicated in the events and it was therefore decided to arrest them.', '11. The Police Director (Glavni Ravnatelj Policije) issued an oral order that the arrests be carried out by an antiterrorist team of the Special Police Forces (Specijalna policija, Antiteroristička jedinica Lučko; hereinafter: the “ATJ”).', '12. On 29 October 2008, at around 6.05 p.m., the ATJ stormed into the applicant’s flat, where he was at the moment together with his sister and grandmother.', '13. According to the applicant, immediately after breaking into the flat, the AJT officers threw him on the floor and started punching him over the head and body.', '14. According to the Government, an ATJ team of six officers broke into the applicant’s flat and ordered him to lie down. As he started resisting, the police officers applied the throwing technique of “foot sweep”, which made the applicant to lose his balance and while falling on the ground he hit the table with his head. He was immediately offered medical assistance but he refused.', '15. A report available to the Court signed by the Commander-in-chief of the Special Police Forces (Zapovjednik Specijalne Policije) of 30 October 2008, which is essentially a verbatim of a report of one of the arresting ATJ officers (see paragraph 36 below), in its relevant part concerning the circumstances of the applicant’s arrest, reads:', '“... the intervention with a view to arrest [the applicant] started by the ATJ officers forceful breaking the front doors using the [battering ram]. Inside the flat they found the suspect and an older woman to whom they issued several orders: “Police, lie down on the floor”. As the suspect resisted, two officers approached him and grabbed him by the arms but he continued to resist. [The officers] then applied the technique of foot sweep and pulled him to the ground. As he was still trying to set himself free he was handcuffed. While he was falling on the ground he hit the table with his face ... Afterwards ... [the officers] offered to the suspect medical assistance but he refused it saying that he felt good.”', '16. According to the applicant, following his arrest he was blindfolded and taken to a remote place by a river, where he was again beaten up and his head was immersed in the water, forcing him to confess to the murders of I.P. and N.F. and some other crimes. The police officers also continued to beat him up while taking him to the police station.', '17. According to the Government, following the applicant’s arrest he was taken to the parking area of the police station used by the Organised Crime Unit of the Zagreb Police Department (Policijska uprava zagrebačka, Sektor kriminalističke policije, Odjel organiziranog kriminaliteta; hereinafter: the “police”) where he was kept in the minivan of the ATJ in the period between 6.45 and 8.30 p.m., awaiting other suspects to be arrested and brought to the police station.', '18. The available report of the arresting ATJ officer (see paragraph 36 below) in this respect indicates that the applicant was brought to the parking area of the police station at 7.00 p.m. where he was kept in the minivan of the ATJ until 7.40 p.m. and then surrendered to the police inspectors.', '19. Once when he was brought to the police station on 29 October 2008 at around 8.30 p.m. the applicant was placed in a room under the control of two police inspectors M.A. and M.M.', '20. According to reports of these two police inspectors dated 18 April and 14 May 2012 respectively, the applicant was for a while guarded by an ATJ officer but then, at unspecified time, they requested that officer to leave the room. The police inspectors also submitted that the applicant had been handcuffed when he was brought to the police station and then, at unspecified time but sometimes soon after his arrival, the handcuffs were taken off. They also acknowledged that they had seen visible injuries on the applicant’s head and nose for which he had been allegedly offered medical assistance but he had refused it. The emergency had been called in only after the order of their superiors.', '21. The emergency service came to the police station on the same day at 10.55 p.m. The relevant record of the applicant’s examination, in so far as legible, reads:', '“Brought to the police station. Visible open injury above the left eye; 1,5 centimetre long. Contusion and haematoma of the nose with the possible fracture. Regular general status. The patient refuses to go to the hospital and further treatment.”', '22. The applicant stayed in the police station until 30 October 2008 at 8.30 p.m. During that period he was taken to searches of his house and car and he was questioned by the police inspectors M.A. and M.M. in the presence of a lawyer and a Deputy at the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office.', '23. According to the applicant, throughout his stay in the police station he was tightly constrained, beaten and threatened that he should make no problems concerning his injuries.', '24. According to the Government, during his stay in the police station the applicant was kept in one of the offices ordinarily used by the police officers. Apart from several minutes upon his arrival to the police station, the applicant was not handcuffed. He also had access to the toilet and drinking water. He was obliged to sit on a chair as there were no beds but it was impossible to take him to the detention unit as the investigative actions were still ongoing. In any case, he had an opportunity to ask for a rest and food but he did not make any such request.', '25. On 30 October 2008, at around 8.30 p.m., the applicant was taken to the Police Detention and Escort Unit (Jedinica za zadržavanje i prepratu; hereinafter: “JZP”) for a rest. A report accompanying his transfer, signed by the Chief of the police and dated 30 October 2008 indicated, inter alia, that he had no visible injuries.', '26. A report signed by the on-duty officer at JZP, dated 30 October 2008, indicated that the applicant was admitted to the detention unit with visible injuries of his face.', '27. According to the applicant, during his stay in JZP he was offered a sandwich but he could not eat due to a strong jaw pain.', '28. According to the Government, during his stay in JZP the applicant was placed in a room which was equipped with beds and sanitary facility. The room was appropriately heated and ventilated and had access to natural and artificial light. The hygiene and sanitary conditions were good and the applicant was provided with food and water.', '29. On 31 October 2008 at 9.15 a.m. the police took the applicant from JZP to participate in a further search of his premises.', '30. On the same day, at around 6.45 p.m., the applicant was brought for questioning before an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court. He decided to remain silent concerning the charges held against him, but with regard to his injuries the applicant stressed:', '“The only thing I would point out is that before I was taken in [to the police station] I fell in my flat and according to the findings of the doctors who were called in to the police station, I sustained a nose fracture, most probably with dislocation. I refused the medical assistance in order to get out from the police station as soon as possible.”', '31. The investigating judge put no additional questions concerning this matter nor did he take any further actions in that respect.', '32. Following the applicant’s questioning, an investigation into the explosion was opened in respect of him and several other persons. At the same time, an investigating judge of the Zagreb County Court ordered his pre-trial detention.', '33. On 3 November 2008 the applicant was examined in Zagreb Prison Hospital (Zatvorska bolnica u Zagrebu) and several medical records were drafted.', '34. One medical record available to the Court indicates that the applicant sustained his injuries after a fall on 30 October 2008, whereas two other medical reports refer to several blows on the applicant’s head and nose.', '35. Based on his medical examination in Zagreb Prison Hospital, the applicant was diagnosed with contusions of head, nose and shoulder and a nose fracture without dislocation, as well as a distortion of a metal implant in his hand related to an old injury. His general medical condition at the time was regular and he had a smaller hematoma on the left side of his head and nose and smaller hematomas below both eyes. He also had a smaller hematoma on the left shoulder and a visible dislocation of the metal implant in his hand but without a fresh fracture. In July 2009 the applicant again saw a doctor who indicated testicular problems.', '36. On 29 October 2008 one of the arresting ATJ officers reported on the applicant’s arrest to the Commander of the ATJ. In his report, he indicated that the ATJ had been requested to arrest the applicant in connection with a suspicion of double murder. The report also provides the details of the arrest already observed above (see paragraphs 15 and 18 above).', '37. On 30 October 2008 the Commander of the ATJ requested the Commander-in-chief of the Special Police Forces to assess the lawfulness of the ATJ’s actions; and the latter forwarded that request to the Police Director.', '38. On the same day the Police Director assessed the reports concerning the ATJ actions by indicating the following:', '“This is to inform you that I find the use of force, namely the physical force and the measures of restraint, used by the ATJ team on 29 October 2008 during the arrest of Amir Mafalani ... lawful within the meaning of sections 54, 55 and 57 of the Police Act and sections 30, 31, 32 and 35 of the By-law on the police conduct.”', '39. In October 2011 the applicant, through lawyers, requested Zagreb Prison Hospital and the emergency services to provide him the relevant medical records concerning the injuries he had sustained during his arrest on 29 October 2008. He also requested the police to provide him the relevant documents related to his arrest.', '40. On 2 November 2011 the police replied that all relevant reports were confidential and could not be disclosed. This reply was forwarded for information to the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office.', '41. On 11 November 2011, after receiving the reply, the applicant complained to the State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office asking why an effective investigation, within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention, had not been conducted.', '42. The State Attorney’s Organised Crime Office replied on 16 November 2011, indicating that the applicant should consult the relevant domestic law on the use of police force and that, in case of any complaint to that effect, he could always lodge a criminal complaint with the competent State Attorney’s Office.', '43. In the meantime, the applicant obtained the requested medical records.', '44. On 15 February 2012 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Zagrebu) against unidentified perpetrators alleging ill-treatment during his arrest and stay in the police station.', '45. On 20 February 2012 the Zagreb Municipal State Attorney’s Office informed the applicant that his criminal complaint had been forwarded to the Zagreb County State Attorney’s Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Zagrebu) for further examination.', '46. On 3 March 2014 the Zagreb County State Attorney’s Office rejected the applicant’s criminal complaint on the grounds that there was no reasonable suspicion that a criminal offence had been committed. It relied on a written report of the Police Director and written reports of the police inspectors M.A. and M.M. It also observed the applicant’s medical documentation and search and seizure records as well as the interrogation records in the criminal proceedings against him.', '47. On 31 January 2012 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court (Općinski građanski sud u Zagrebu) against the State claiming damages in connection with his alleged ill-treatment by the police during his arrest and stay in the police station.', '48. The Zagreb Municipal State Attorney’s Office, representing the State, challenged the applicant’s civil action on the grounds that the police had acted in accordance with the law and that their use of force had been caused by the applicant’s conduct.', '49. During the proceedings, the Zagreb Municipal Civil Court heard the applicant and several witnesses, including the applicant’s sister and grandmother, one of the applicant’s co-suspects and the police inspectors M.A. and M.M. , as well as the Police Director.', '50. The applicant’s grandmother testified that she had seen the police officers immediately attacking and hitting the applicant as they had entered the flat, and his sister confirmed that she had heard him screaming and had also seen him being dragged around by the police.', '51. The applicant’s co-suspect in his testimony submitted that he had seen the applicant seriously injured in the police station, while the police inspectors M.A. and M.M. denied any ill-treatment, as did the Police Director who also stated that the police had monopoly of the use of force.', '52. In his statement of 14 January 2015 the applicant contended that during his arrest he had been severely beaten by the ATJ officers all over his head and body. Afterwards he had been taken near a river and again beaten, subjected to mock execution and immersed in the water. When he was finally brought to the police station, the uniformed police officers continued to beat him with the acquiescence of the police inspectors M.A. and M.M. He was also tightly constrained to a chair and at one point, while he was dragged from one office to another, he felt strong pain in his shoulder. Later on, during his transfer to the investigating judge, two uniformed police officers who escorted him said that he should say nothing about the ill-treatment and that he would soon go home. In the ensuing period, he started feeling various health problems related to the ill-treatment and has been seeing doctors regularly.', '53. The civil proceedings are still pending.']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1973 and lives in Brčko, Bosnia and Herzegovina.', '7. On 29 December 2011 the applicant lodged a request for a residence permit in Croatia on the grounds of family reunification with her partner, Ms D.B., who was living in Sisak. She submitted that she had been educated in Croatia and that she had lived in Zagreb for seventeen years. She also explained that she wanted to live with D.B., with whom she had been in a relationship for two years, and with whom she wanted to establish a household and start a business.', '8. By a letter dated 28 December 2011 D.B. stated that she owned a house in Sisak where she wanted to live with the applicant. She explained that she had been in a relationship with the applicant for two years and that they wanted to live together so as to avoid constant travelling and the distance between them.', '9. During the proceedings the Sisak Police Department (Policijska uprava Sisačko-moslovačka) found that the applicant and D.B. had been in a relationship since October 2009 and that in order to maintain their relationship they had been travelling to see each other. It was also established that the applicant had recently stayed with D.B. in the period between 16 September and 4 December 2011.', '10. On 24 February 2012 the Sisak Police Department dismissed the applicant’s request with a summary reasoning indicating that all the relevant requirements under the Aliens Act had not been met.', '11. The applicant appealed against that decision to the Ministry of the Interior (Ministarstvo unutarnjih poslova; hereinafter: the “Ministry”), arguing that it could be inferred from the decision of the Sisak Police Department that her request had been dismissed because the Aliens Act did not allow family reunification for same-sex couples. She considered that there had been no grounds for a difference in treatment based on sexual orientation and that the relevant law should not be construed in a manner that allowed for such a possibility. She relied, inter alia, on the Constitution and the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, arguing that even if she was not to be considered as D.B.’s “immediate family member”, within the meaning of the Aliens Act, she should in any case be considered as her “other relative” within the meaning of that Act.', '12. On 8 June 2012 the Ministry dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the Sisak Police Department. The relevant part of the Ministry’s decision reads:', '“Concerning the family reunification, based on which the request for the regularisation of the status of an alien in Croatia has been submitted in the case at issue, [it is to be noted that] the case file shows that the appellant relies on the existence of a same-sex relationship with the Croatian national D.B., which has allegedly lasted for two years ...', 'The impugned decision shows that the [first-instance body], other than citing the [relevant] provisions of the Aliens Act, also cited section 3 of the Family Act, according to which the effects of an extramarital relationship, that is to say the rights and obligations following from its existence, relate to a union between an unmarried woman and man which has lasted for at least three years, or less if a child was born of [the union]; and section 2 of the Same-Sex Union Act ... which defines a same-sex union as a union between two persons of the same sex (partners) who are not married, or in an extramarital relationship or other same-sex union, which has lasted for at least three years and which is based on the principles of equality of partners, mutual respect and assistance as well as the emotional bonds of partners.', '...', 'It follows that the [Same-Sex Union] Act does not define a same-sex union as a family and the Family Act does not cover same-sex unions. It should also be taken into account that the provisions of the Aliens Act concerning temporary residence for family reunification do not provide for a possibility of regularisation of the status of an alien on the grounds of [the existence of] a same-sex union, nor does such a union fall within the scope of [the term] ‘immediate family member’ incorporated in that Act, which makes it clear that there is no legal ground for granting the request of the appellant.', 'Therefore, the appellant wrongly considers that the first-instance body should have applied section 56 § 4 of the Aliens Act in her case ... because that provision clearly provides that exceptionally to the provision defining immediate family members, ‘other relative’ could be so considered if there are specific personal or serious humanitarian reasons for a family reunification in Croatia.”', '13. On 24 July 2012 the applicant lodged an administrative action with the Zagreb Administrative Court (Upravni sud u Zagrebu), arguing that she had been discriminated against in comparison to different-sex couples who had a possibility to seek family reunification under the Aliens Act. She relied on the domestic anti-discrimination legislation, including the Prohibition of Discrimination Act, as well as the Convention and the Court’s case-law.', '14. The Zagreb Administrative Court dismissed the applicant’s action on 30 January 2013. The relevant part of the judgment provides:', '“The cited section 56 § 3(1) and (2) of the Aliens Act provides that the immediate family members are spouses or persons who live in an extramarital relationship in accordance with Croatian legislation. The cited sections 3 and 5 of the Family Act show that marriage and extramarital relationship are unions between a man and a woman. Thus, union between two same-sex persons cannot be considered under the relevant legal provisions as marriage or an extramarital relationship.', 'Union between two same-sex persons can be considered under the legal term same-sex union under the conditions provided for in section 2 of the Same-Sex Union Act. However, given the limited legal effects of a same-sex union, the possible existence of such a union does not represent a basis for family reunification. It should be noted that section 56 of the [Aliens] Act explicitly enumerates persons who are to be considered immediate family members or who are to be exceptionally considered [so], which leads to a conclusion that it cannot be extended to cover persons living in a same-sex union.', 'Accordingly, the granting of a request for temporary residence of an alien on the grounds of family reunification depends on the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 52 and 56 of the Aliens Act. In the case at issue the plaintiff is neither married nor in an extramarital relationship with the Croatian national D.B., which is not in dispute between the parties. It therefore follows that the plaintiff cannot be considered an immediate family member within the meaning of section 56 § 1(1) and (2) of the [Aliens] Act and thus she did not justify the purpose (in the concrete case: family reunification) for which a temporary residence of an alien in Croatia can be granted ...', 'In view of the cited legal provisions, and the facts of the case, this court finds that in the concrete case it was not possible to grant the plaintiff’s request.”', '15. On 8 March 2013 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), contending that she had been discriminated against on the basis of her sexual orientation. She relied on the Convention and the relevant domestic anti-discrimination legislation, and she cited the Court’s case-law on the question of discrimination related to sexual orientation.', '16. On 29 May 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint, endorsing the reasoning of the lower bodies. The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“8. The Constitutional Court reiterates that discrimination under Article 14 of the Constitution does not have an independent standing for a constitutional complaint but must be submitted in conjunction with another (substantive) constitutional right. Discrimination means difference in the treatment of persons in the same or relevantly similar situations without an objective and reasonable justification. Article 14 of the Constitution contains constitutional guarantee against discrimination on any ground in securing a concrete right.', 'Although the appellant relied in her constitutional complaint in Article 35 of the Constitution and the related Article 8 of the Convention, the Constitutional Court finds that these provisions are not applicable in the case at issue.', '8.1. In the proceedings before it, the Constitutional Court did not find facts or circumstances which would suggest that in the proceedings before [the lower bodies] the appellant was discriminated against on any ground ... Thus her complaint of a violation of Article 14 § 1 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court finds unfounded.', '8.2. The Constitutional Court also notes that the appellant, in the concrete case, did not show that she has used the legal avenue under the Prohibition of Discrimination Act ...', 'There has therefore been no violation of her constitutional right under Article 14 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution.', '9. The case-law of the European Court cited in the constitutional complaint is of no relevance for the case at issue since it relates to cases concerning health insurance and inheritance of tenancy rights by same-sex partners living in a stable (de facto) relationship.”']","['14', '8']",['8-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The first applicant was born in 1979, the second and third applicants were born in 1974, and the date of birth of the fourth applicant is unknown. The fourth applicant is the common-law wife of Mr Pavel Aleksandrovich Bazhenov (“the fourth applicant’s partner”). The second and fourth applicants live in Irkutsk Region and Irkutsk respectively. The first and third applicants are serving prison sentences in Irkutsk Region.', '6. On 14 October 2003 the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner were arrested and taken to the police station on suspicion of murder. They were allegedly intimidated by police officers seeking to extract self-incriminating statements.', '7. On 15 October 2003 a forensic medical examination was conducted in respect of the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner. It revealed that the first applicant had abrasions on his left shoulder, and bruises on both ears and on the back of his thorax; the third applicant had bruises on his left hip and under his jaw. The expert concluded that those injuries had been sustained the day prior to the examination and that they had not caused any permanent damage to the applicant’s health. The fourth applicant’s partner was discovered to have a closed nose fracture which amounted to slight damage to his health.', '8. On 16 October 2003 the Oktyabrskiy District Court of Irkutsk (“the District Court”) authorised the detention of the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner pending the investigation. It relied on the gravity of the charges and the risk that they might interfere with the administration of justice (abscond, resume their criminal activity or threaten witnesses). They were placed in remand prison IZ-38/1 in Irkutsk.', '9. On 24 October 2003 charges of aggravated murder were brought against them.', '10. On 11 December 2003 the District Court extended the detention of the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner until 5 March 2004 on the same grounds. Those decisions were upheld on appeal by the Irkutsk Regional Court (“the Regional Court”) in respect of the first applicant on 29 January 2004 and in respect of the third applicant and the fourth applicant’s partner on 3 February 2004.', '11. The first and third applicants’ detention was subsequently extended, on the same grounds, on 3 March and 4 March 2004 respectively, until 5 June 2004. The Regional Court upheld those decisions on appeal in respect of the first applicant on an unspecified date and in respect of the third applicant on 21 April 2004.', '12. According to the first applicant, between 14 and 16 October 2003 the police subjected him to beatings, torture with electric wires, and deprivation of food and sleep.', '13. Subsequently, for several days starting from 17 October 2003 the first applicant was intimidated by one of his cellmates, S. Ye. (nicknamed “the Nazi”), who had been instructed by the police to extract the applicant’s confession. As a result, on 21 October 2003 the applicant attempted suicide by cutting his left forearm.', '14. On the same day the applicant was examined by a doctor, who reported superficial cuts on his left forearm.', '15. On 4 November 2003 the applicant was taken to the police station. Throughout the day police officers allegedly beat him in the head, kidneys and genitals, tortured him with electric wires and threatened to kill him and to rape him. As a result, he attempted suicide by cutting his neck with a blade.', '16. On the same day the applicant was examined by a doctor, who recorded the following injuries: a four-centimetre long cut on his neck and six superficial two-centimetre long cuts on his left forearm.', '17. On 11 November 2003 the third applicant was taken for questioning to the police station, where he was beaten up by police officers S.Sh., S.S. and Ye.Kh. For an hour and a half the police officers allegedly kicked and punched the applicant, who was handcuffed and kneeling, and beat him with a stick. Unable to withstand the torture, the applicant jumped out of a third-floor window of the police station. However, as the applicant’s action was considered an attempt to escape, criminal proceedings were brought against him under Articles 30 § 3 and 313 § 1 of the Criminal Code (attempted escape).', '18. The following day, on 12 November 2003 the third applicant was taken to hospital and diagnosed with a fracture to his right upper arm and contusions on his thorax and spinal cord, allegedly caused by the jump from the window.', '19. As indicated above the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner were placed in remand prison IZ-38/1. The fourth applicant submitted that as from 24 October 2003 and for several days onwards her partner was beaten up by other inmates. He was not given any food and not allowed to sleep, and in the mornings he was taken to the police station where the ill-treatment continued.', '20. From 25 November to 11 December 2003 the applicant’s partner was kept in detention facility IZ-24/1 in Krasnoyarsk, where, allegedly with the tacit consent of the facility’s officers, he was constantly ill-treated by other inmates.', '21. From 11 December 2003 until 15 January 2004 the fourth applicant’s partner was detained again in remand prison IZ-38/1 in Irkutsk. Two of the inmates – S.Ye. and A. – deprived him of food and sleep, and threatened him with murder and rape. The chief of police, A.S., threatened him with rape. Several days later the applicant’s partner was raped by other inmates and the act was videotaped. He was then blackmailed with the tape. Finally, on 12 January 2004 he confessed. On 3 February 2004 the applicant’s partner was transferred to a solitary confinement cell.', '22. On 5 February 2004 the applicant’s partner was found hanged.', '23. The first and the third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner complained to the prosecutor’s office of their ill-treatment at the hands of the police. The initial complaint concerned the alleged ill-treatment on 14 October 2003. Separate complaints were brought later in connection with other alleged instances of ill-treatment (see paragraphs 12, 13, 15 and 17 above).', '24. On 20 November 2003 the Deputy Prosecutor of Irkutsk Region refused to open criminal proceedings against the police officers. The decision read as follows:', '“...', '[The first applicant] submitted that on 14 October 2003 he had been arrested by the police. When being brought to the police station he had been ill-treated by the police officers [description of the beatings].

They showed active resistance during the arrest and therefore physical force and cuffing were applied to them. After the arrest [the above persons] were brought to the police station. The first applicant and the fourth applicant’s partner had injuries which had been inflicted on them at the arrest. Subsequently the first applicant and the fourth applicant’s partner were taken to the investigator for participation in the investigative actions. No physical or mental coercion was applied to them ...', 'Similar statements were given by police officers Sh., S. and P. [The latter] added that on 4 November 2003 [the first applicant] participated in an investigative action at the police station. After the investigative action was completed, he and the [first applicant] remained waiting in office no. 302 for the applicant to be taken back to the remand prison. [The first applicant] was nervous, [he] expressed his fears of receiving a long sentence. During the conversation he cut his neck. He was provided with medical aid and taken to the remand prison, where he was examined by a doctor.', 'According to the reports of the forensic medical examinations, the injuries of [the first and third applicants] did not cause any permanent damage to their health, and the injuries of [the fourth applicant’s partner] caused slight damage to his health. The [above] injuries could have originated from the impact of hard blunt objects with a limited surface area, which could be a fist or a foot.', 'These injuries were caused to [the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner] at their arrest by the police officers. An inquiry was carried out in accordance with Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which established that [the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner] had shown active resistance during their arrest and the police had applied physical force and special means to them pursuant to Articles 12-14 of the Law on police. On 18 November 2003 the institution of the criminal proceedings against the police officers was refused in the absence of constituent elements of a crime in their actions.', 'An inquiry was carried out in accordance with Article 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure into [the first applicant’s] causing himself injuries on 21 October 2003. On 22 October 2003 the institution of the criminal proceedings was refused.', 'Bodily injuries in the form of cutting wound of the neck were self-inflicted by the [first applicant], which is confirmed by the latter’s statements. No other injuries were discovered on [the first applicant] at his examination on 4 November 2003. This fact disproves [the first applicant’s] allegation of having been beaten up by the police on that day.', 'On 11 November 2003 [the third applicant] jumped out from the third-floor window of the police station in an attempt to escape. Criminal proceedings were instituted against him under Articles 30 § 3 and 313 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', 'No evidence was established during the inquiry to substantiate the allegations that police officers Sh., S., G. and P. had applied physical and mental coercion to [the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner]. The submissions made in this respect by [the latter] are unsubstantiated and far-fetched.', '...”', '25.

Apart from visible marks on his neck, the following injuries were recorded: abrasions on the neck, the lumbar region, the chest, the right forearm, the right wrist and the right hand; bruises and abrasions on the forehead; bruises in the soft tissues of the neck; and a hemorrhage in the mucous membrane of the anus.', '29. On 26 June 2006 the criminal proceedings were discontinued owing to the absence of evidence of a crime. It was established that on 3 February 2004 the fourth applicant’s partner had been transferred to a solitary confinement cell after his lawyer had complained that the former had been subjected to abuse by other inmates. Thereafter, on 5 February 2004 the fourth applicant’s partner was found hung in the cell. The forensic medical expert concluded that the death had occurred as a result of strangling. It was further established that on the day of his death the fourth applicant’s partner had been kept in the cell alone, and that the lawyer’s allegations that his client had been ill-treated by other inmates had not been confirmed.', '30. The lawfulness of the above decision was challenged before the court by the father of the deceased, Mr A. Bazhenov, who was granted victim status in the relevant proceedings.', '31. On 16 July 2007 the Kuybyshevskiy District Court of Irkutsk found the above decision lawful and justified. It was not appealed against to the Regional Court.', '32. On 25 December 2006 the Regional Court convicted the first and third applicants, along with five other co-defendants, of banditry, aggravated murder and robbery. It sentenced the first applicant to life imprisonment and the second applicant to twenty years’ imprisonment. The trial court examined the allegations of police ill-treatment in so far as the admissibility of evidence was at issue. It heard the applicants, examined the medical evidence, and questioned the applicants’ former cellmates and the police officers allegedly involved in the ill-treatment. Having taken into account the conclusions of the investigation, the court held that no unlawful methods of interrogation had been used against the applicants.', '33. On 25 September 2007 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld the judgment on appeal.', '34. On 5 September 2003 the flat of one of the victims was searched within the framework of the murder case involving the first and third applicants and the fourth applicant’s partner. The second applicant, who was found armed inside the flat, was taken to the police station for identification and questioning. He was kept there until 7 September 2003. According to the second applicant, police officers struck him in the area of his only kidney, tried to throw him out of the window, then forced him out onto the windowsill, from where he lost his balance and fell three floors down.', '35.

The applicant was born in 1986 and lives in Botârlău.', '6. On 23 February 2007 X, a plain-clothes police officer from the Buzău County police organised crime unit, approached the applicant in a nightclub. According to a report drafted on 1 March 2007, the meeting had been planned in order to verify information received by the police that the applicant might have been dealing drugs. The report mentioned that X had discussed with the applicant, who claimed that he could get drugs and promised to call with more details. In a second report drafted on 14 April 2007 it was stated that the applicant had called X to ask whether he was interested in buying 2,000 ecstasy tablets at a cost of 10 euros (EUR) each.', '7. On 18 April 2007 a prosecutor from the Buzău County department for the investigation of organised crime (“the organised crime department”) opened a criminal investigation against the applicant on suspicion of drug trafficking. A request to intercept his telephone conversations and make ambient voice recordings was authorised by a judge of the Buzău County Court.', '8. On the same date the prosecutor from the organised crime department authorised the use of X as undercover police agent in order to determine the facts of the case, identify the offenders and obtain evidence. The prosecutor justified the issuing of the authorisation on the basis that there was reason to believe that the applicant was about to commit a drug trafficking offence.', '9. In a report dated 17 May 2007 the chief of the Buzău County police organised crime unit stated that X had called the applicant several times in April and May in order to enquire when the transaction might take place. The report also mentioned that the applicant had replied on several occasions that he was not in possession of the drugs, which were to be brought into the country by friends of his who had not yet returned from abroad.', '10. In the early evening of 19 July 2007 the applicant called X and set up a meeting for later that evening. He and a friend, G.G., picked up X by car. X was accompanied by Y, a colleague in plain clothes. The four of them drove to a petrol station where a meeting had been arranged with C.A.O. to buy drugs. The applicant and Y went inside the petrol station while X remained outside and talked to C.A.O. As the deal got underway in the car park of the petrol station, the case prosecutor and ten police officers suddenly intervened and arrested the applicant, C.A.O. and G.G. In the car driven by C.A.O. the police found 742 ecstasy tablets. The offence report drafted on the spot by the police was signed by everyone, including the applicant, without any objection. The police operation was recorded on video.', '11. On 25 October 2007 the applicant was indicted with C.A.O. and G.G. for trafficking “high risk” drugs.', '12. On 17 January 2008 the applicant and C.A.O. testified before the Buzău County Court. The applicant averred that he had acted as an intermediary for the meeting and subsequent deal between C.A.O. and X because the latter had asked him whether he could get drugs for him. Moreover, X had set the price for the drugs. C.A.O. stated that the drugs found on him had been for his own personal use and that he had had no intention of selling them.', '13. The applicant’s lawyer argued before the court that the applicant had in fact been incited by X to act as an intermediary in the drug deal and requested that X be called to give evidence, along with two witnesses in the applicant’s defence. The court allowed the request.', '14. On 14 February 2008 the court heard evidence from X, G.C. and one of the witnesses proposed by the applicant who appeared in court. X stated that the applicant had called him in order to arrange the drug deal without any incitement on his part. The applicant’s lawyer had the opportunity to cross-examine X. He asked whether the reports of 1 March and 14 April 2007 had been signed by him and whether the criminal investigation had already been open when he had been authorised to investigate undercover. The two questions were disallowed by the court because they were considered an attempt to disclose X’s identity.', '15. The Buzău County Court gave judgment on 22 February 2008. It convicted the applicant of drug trafficking and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment. The conviction was based on the reports of 1 March and 14 April 2007 and the offence report of 19 July 2007 (see paragraphs 6 and 10 above), as well as on transcripts of the applicant’s telephone conversations with X, ambient recordings of discussions between X and C.A.O. and the in-court testimonies given by the applicant, the codefendants and X. The court considered that the applicant’s allegations that he had been incited by X were clearly disproved by the abovementioned evidence taken as a whole.', '16. The applicant appealed against the judgment. He alleged that X had exceeded his authority and that Y should have also been called to testify in court. He also claimed that X had incited him to commit the offence under coercion and that the first-instance court had failed to respond appropriately to his arguments on that issue.', '17. On 26 May 2008 the Ploieşti Court of Appeal rejected the appeal. In reply to the applicant’s arguments, the court held that the authorisation and actions of the undercover police officer had been in accordance with the law. The statement of Y was irrelevant to the case since he had not directly witnessed the deal. The court considered that the applicant had not been incited by X since it was apparent from the evidence in the file that he had called the officer on several occasions and had planned the meeting of 19 July 2007 (see paragraph 10 above).', '18. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs), reiterating his previous arguments.', '19. In a final judgment of 22 October 2008 the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed the appeal on points of law. Basing its findings on the reports of 1 March and 14 April 2007 (see paragraph 6 above), the court considered that there had been serious reason to suspect that the applicant would commit a criminal offence at the time of authorisation of the covert operation. It further noted that it was apparent from the documents in the file that X had acted lawfully. In addition, the information collected by X and the applicant’s active participation in the crime in question were supported not only by the police reports, but also by transcripts of the telephone conversations that the applicant had with C.A.O. and X. The court stated that it was clearly apparent from those transcripts that the applicant had initiated calls to X on two occasions in order to act as an intermediary in the drug deal. It also noted on this point that the applicant and the other co-defendants had signed the offence report without any objection (see paragraph 10 above). The applicant’s allegations concerning the unlawfulness of the covert operation and the police incitement were therefore considered to be ill-founded.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1948 and lives in Kallithea-Attaki, Greece.', '7. The applicant is one of the heirs of Mr Serkis Gövderelioğlu, who used to live in Istanbul. On 7 July 1988 Mr Gövderelioğlu purchased movable and immovable goods from the bankrupt estate of a company by way of a public tender.', '8. On 5 February 1996 the sale in question was annulled by a court order on the ground that the instalments had not been paid in time. The decision annulling the sale became final on 3 October 1997 and on 14 November 1997 Mr Gövderelioğlu was requested by the Istanbul Bankruptcy Office to return the purchased goods within seven days. He did not comply with that request.', '9. On 10 August 2000 Mr Gövderelioğlu died.', '10. Due to his non-compliance with the Bankruptcy Office’s order to return the goods, on 5 June 2001 the bankrupt estate of the aforementioned company filed an action against Mr Gövderelioğlu’s heirs, including the applicant, before the Şişli Court of First Instance (hereinafter “the Şişli Court”) for the recovery of the goods or their equivalent value.', '11. A lawyer acting on behalf of the applicant and the other heirs of Mr Gövderelioğlu submitted a petition to the Şişli Court on 3 December 2001, arguing, inter alia, that the case had been lodged outside the statutory time-limit and thus had to be rejected. The lawyer submitted that the statutory one-year time-limit had started to run on 14 November 1997 but that the plaintiffs had not lodged their action until 2001.', '12. On 15 April 2002 three experts appointed by the Şişli Court submitted their opinion on the value of the goods. Two of the experts considered the value to be approximately 245,000 euros (EUR), whereas the third expert considered it to be in the region of EUR 45,000.', '13. On 11 June 2002 the Şişli Court issued an interim decision, rejecting a request to hear two witnesses who, according to the applicant, would have provided pertinent information about the value of the goods in question. The Şişli Court considered that the existence of the expert reports made it unnecessary to hear the applicant’s witnesses.', '14. In its decision of 13 December 2002 the Şişli Court ordered Mr Gövderelioğlu’s heirs to return the goods which were still in their possession and to pay a certain sum of money corresponding to the value of the goods which had been disposed of in the meantime. The amount of money ordered was based on the calculations made by the two experts. The Şişli Court further awarded statutory interest on this amount accruing from 21 November 1997, the original due date for the return of the goods. No response was given by the Şişli Court in its decision to the applicant’s objection concerning the issue of the time-limit.', '15. The applicant appealed against the judgment and argued, inter alia, that the action for recovery should have been dismissed by the Şişli Court as it had been instituted outside the statutory time-limit. He also submitted that the Şişli Court had acted unlawfully by ordering the payment of interest on the amount due, given that no request for interest had been made by the plaintiff. He also added that the Şişli Court had failed to hear the witnesses he had proposed. The applicant asked the Court of Cassation to hold a hearing before rendering its decision.', '16. On 10 July 2003 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the Şişli Court without holding a hearing and without providing any answers to the applicant’s objections.', '17. On 22 December 2003 the Court of Cassation rejected a request by the applicant for rectification of its previous decision.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

For the purposes of his conscription he had a combined psychological evaluation and physical examination on 3 December 1993, as a result of which he was found to be fit for military service. The detailed report, which was not disclosed to the applicant (until 21 September 2010 in the course of pension proceedings), considered that the applicant was slow in understanding and executing a task but logical in its exercise, although prone to giving up. In an evaluation covering language and cultural skills, motivation, mental performance and behaviour, he obtained a grade of 4 out of 10 in each area.', '7. Upon his conscription, the applicant underwent another medical examination on 14 June 1994, as a result of which he was again found to be fit for military service on the basis that he was not suffering from any illness. He was assigned to Battalion no. 123 in Chieti, where he was subject to intensive physical and mental training, including in the use of firearms.', '8. On 9 July 1994 the applicant was transferred to the provincial command unit in Aquila, where he remained until 30 December 1994. During this time, from 1 September to 2 November 1994 he temporarily formed part of its logistical battalion. While in Aquila the applicant was subjected to multiple punishments. According to the documentation presented, he was subjected to eight punishments between July and December, amounting to twenty-four days of confinement, including periods of solitary confinement, for reasons ranging from negligent care of his camp-bed area to failure to report to his supervisor, or informal behaviour towards his superior. During the time he spent with the logistical battalion he was hospitalised at least four times for medical care unrelated to his mental problems (see below).', '9. On 30 December 1994 the applicant was transferred to Lecce, where a commander noted that the applicant suffered from nervous tics and twitches, difficulty in socialising and learning, and absent-minded behaviour. The commander ordered the applicant to undergo a specialised medical assessment to test his fitness to perform military service.', '10. On 24 January 1995 he was admitted to hospital, where he was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and considered to be in a fragile state of mind.', 'A medical report by the NHS of Tricase of 6 February 1995 considered that in his youth the applicant had suffered from affection-relational problems and learning difficulties. He was physically weak and insecure, had a low aptitude for learning and was prone to isolation, was dysfunctional and incapable of taking up responsibilities. Tests revealed that he was unable to perform assigned tasks, had difficulty orienting himself and impaired cognitive functions (a deficit in logic and memory). He was considered to have a slight intellectual deficit (an IQ of 67) and to be incapable of creating positive relationships with people. This inadequacy caused him to live military life with anxiety and fear of his fellow soldiers, who he considered were aggressive towards him, even if they had only been joking. The report considered that the longer he remained in military service, the more severe his anxiety would become, and his defensive attitude arising from his fears would intensify.', '11. The applicant remained on medical leave for recovery purposes until April 1995, when, following a specialised assessment to determine his suitability for military service, on 8 April 1995 the applicant was found to suffer from “dysphoria and borderline personality [disorder]” and was discharged due to unfitness.', '12. Following his discharge, the applicant underwent further medical examinations. A report by the NHS of Tricase of 20 October 1995 considered that the applicant no longer had a defensive attitude, nor was he suffering from dysphoria and nervous tics. He was still, however, insecure, prone to isolation, unstable and unwilling to take up responsibilities. Following the tests performed, the report concluded that the stressful situation, namely his military service, having ended, the applicant had slightly improved. However, he still displayed signs of intellectual deficit.', '13. At the time a report by the applicant’s doctor (Dr Russo) considered that the applicant had fallen sick because of military service or that there was at least a causal link between the two. In consequence, on 13 January 1996 the applicant asked the Defence Ministry to pay damages under Law no. 416 of 1926 and presidential decree no. 686 of 1957.', '14. In the course of the examination of his request for damages, on 30 September 1999 the Medical Commission of the Bari Military Hospital diagnosed the applicant with “obsessive-compulsive disorder” (“OCD”), which it considered was not a result of his military service. It opined that the mental infirmity at issue was a pre-existing condition. It did not appear that during his military service the applicant had been involved in any events or had to carry out any duties which, given their importance, duration and nature, could have seriously influenced the onset or progression of this mental health problem. It further considered the request to have been made out of time.', '15. In the meantime the applicant had repeatedly asked the relevant authorities to provide him with a copy of the pertinent documents regarding the period in which he had served in the military to enable him to substantiate his claims. On 24 November 1999 he further asked the Lecce Military District to provide him with the administrative and health documents related to his case together with the minutes of the Medical Commission’s meeting in his respect. This request was repeated four times in the year 2000 and remained unanswered.', '16. On 19 June 2000 the second instance Medical Commission of Bari confirmed the findings of the Medical Commission dated 30 September 1999.', '17. On 11 July 2000 the Ministry of Defence rejected the applicant’s request for damages, noting that the Medical Commission (second instance) of the Command of the Naples Health Service had, on 19 June 2000, determined that the OCD from which the applicant suffered had not been caused by his military service.', '18. According to a medical certificate submitted by the applicant to this Court, issued by the Maglie Local Health Centre (mental health department) on 29 July 1999, the applicant, who had been treated by the department since 1977 for a fragile state of mind, a low IQ, and OCD which had become chronic, had developed behavioural problems to the extent of violent outbursts towards his family following his military service.', '19. On 21 July 2000 the applicant instituted proceedings before the Lecce Regional Administrative Tribunal (“TAR”) for the recognition of the causal link between his mental health problems and his compulsory military service, and in the event that the court considered his condition to be preexisting he asked it to ascertain the military’s liability for recruiting him and in consequence to make an award of damages in his favour.', '20. On 4 August 2000 the applicant lodged an urgent request with the relevant authorities to access medical documents relating to the fitness-for-service examination prior to conscription, details about his time in the military – training, work, and so on, his disciplinary record, i.e. of the punishments endured, and a record of his hospital stays, an assessment by his commander of his personality and professionalism and all other relevant material held by the Military Administration. On 22 September 2000 he was informed that the unit in Aquila had been disbanded. He was further informed that he had spent twenty-three days in “consegna semplice” (a punishment prohibiting an individual from leaving the base) and one day of “consegna di rigore” (a punishment confining the individual to a specified area on the base) and that any further information had to be requested from the Lecce Recruiting Office. The applicant lodged a request with the Lecce Recruiting Office on 28 September 2000 and on 16 October 2000 the office replied, sending the applicant an excerpt containing his disciplinary record and noting that he had spent twenty-eight, rather than twenty-three, days in “consegna semplice”. No other documentation was sent to the applicant. Following further requests on 19 October 2000, the Lecce Recruiting Office sent the applicant the psycho-physical training file.', '21. On 28 December 2002 the TAR appointed Dr S. as a court expert to ascertain the nature of the applicant’s infirmity and submit a report within sixty days.', '22. Following an examination of the applicant, Dr S. failed to deliver the requisite report. Thus, on 30 January 2007, the applicant asked the TAR to replace the expert.', '23. By a judgment filed in the relevant registry on 20 July 2007 the TAR, considering the applicant’s interlocutory request as an application for renewal (“rinnovo”), rejected the request, noting that for seven years the applicant had failed to solicit any action whatsoever. Considering that no more evidence was necessary, it proceeded to give judgment. It held that the two Medical Commissions had agreed about the source of the applicant’s infirmity and that it had resulted from a pre-existing condition. Indeed the first-instance Medical Commission had referred to a diagnosis of the applicant made in 1997 (when he had been admitted to hospital) which evidenced a fragile and vulnerable mental state. The court went on to note that it transpired that the medical examination of June 1994 to determine the applicant’s fitness for service had not been accurate, since it should already have transpired that the applicant was not entirely fit to take up military service.', '24. On 9 July 2008 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court (“CS”). He complained, inter alia, that: the outcome of the case had been illogical – even though the TAR had considered that his fitness-for-service examination had not been accurate it had failed to pronounce itself on any liability and to award damages; the TAR had considered the applicant’s interlocutory request for the replacement of the expert as an application for renewal, even though replacement of the expert was clearly due given the delay in performing his functions, leading to the court taking a decision to dismiss the action without the relevant information.', '25. By a partial judgment of 19 January 2010, the CS considered that a specialised medical examination was indeed necessary to determine the connection, if any, between the applicant’s infirmity and his military service. It ordered that such an examination be carried out by the Defence Ministry’s Medical Board (Collegio Medico Legale della Difesa – the “Medical Board”), by means of a medical assessment in the presence of the applicant’s general practitioner, and that a report be submitted within thirty days. It appears from the documents that the Medical Board appointed for the applicant’s case was made up of four full members, three from the military and one from the State Police, and an external expert in neurology.', '26. In June 2010 the Medical Board’s report was filed. Its findings took into consideration a report produced that year by an expert engaged by the applicant which he had been allowed to submit to the Board (before being submitted to the CS). The Medical Board’s report noted that when the applicant was discharged he had been suffering from dysphoria, anxiety disorder and borderline personality disorder and had been considered to suffer from slight intellectual disability. It confirmed the reports submitted by the Bari Medical Commissions and highlighted the relevance of the preexisting nature of the applicant’s condition, also noting that upon examination by the Bari Military Hospital’s Medical Panel on 30 September 1999 and at the date of the report in 2010 the applicant had been suffering from “chronic OCD, a slight degree of intellectual disability, displayed personality changes and was prone to have marginal traits”. It concluded that at the date of review, according to the information available, the infirmity could not be considered to have been the direct result of or aggravated by ordinary military service.', '27. On an unspecified date the report of 6 May 2010 prepared by the applicant’s expert (Dr Russo) was filed with the court. It noted that the applicant, a mentally healthy subject upon undergoing medical assessments prior to being drafted, had never shown any symptoms of mental illness before conscription into the military service and it was only after repeated punishment that such traits had emerged. Therefore, even assuming that he was predisposed to mental health problems, it was evident that it was the treatment he had been subjected to during military service that had caused the emergence of the illness. The implications of military service were generally of great emotional impact and a source of stress, which for a person who was in a fragile state of mental health or predisposed to mental health problems, unlike in the case of a healthy person, could trigger mental illness. The applicant’s being away from his family and his inability to relate to colleagues and superiors, in the absence of the necessary psychological support and in view of the repeated punishments imposed on him, had caused him to develop dysphoria which had later evolved into chronic OCD. Thus, in the applicant’s case there had been a causal link between his mental health problems and his military service, or the latter had at least contributed to the development of his condition.', '28. On 12 November 2010 the applicant filed pleadings contesting the findings of the Medical Board and arguing that its report could not be considered objective and impartial given its nature and composition, as it was an organ of the opposing party in the proceedings. He argued that there had been a lack of transparency in the production of the report, which was highlighted by the fact that he had recently become aware of other documents related to the case which had never been disclosed to him by the authorities, the substance of which had been reflected in the report. On 14 December the applicant made further oral pleadings.', '29. By a judgment filed in the relevant registry on 4 February 2011 the CS rejected the applicant’s appeal, holding that the applicant’s infirmity was antecedent to his military service and that it had not been detectible during the examination in 1994, as had been established by the Medical Board. As to the failure to disclose documentation, it considered that such documentation did not relate to the period during which the applicant had carried out military service. In any event the crux of the applicant’s complaint had concerned the conclusions of the Medical Board’s report which did not accord with his claim. However, the CS considered that the report was not contradictory or illogical in itself and it had not ignored relevant facts. It followed that given that the CS (in its limited powers of judicial review of administrative acts) (in sede di legittimità) was not allowed to assess the merits of that report, the applicant’s challenge could not be upheld. In respect of the original medical examination to determine the applicant’s fitness for military service, the CS again adopted the findings of the Medical Board, which had considered that it was possible that the applicant’s health problems had not manifested themselves in the absence of particular stimuli.']","['3', '6']",['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

CROATIA,4,Violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Protection of property (Article 1 para. 1 of Protocol No. 1 - Peaceful enjoyment of possessions),Nebojša Vučinić;Paul Lemmens;Stéphanie Mourou-Vikström;Georges Ravarani;Ksenija Turković,"['5. The applicant was born in 1932 and lives in Domitrovec.', '6. On 12 February and 29 August 2003 the daily newspaper Večernji list published two articles in which the applicant accused his neighbour, a certain Mr I.M., of “stealing” his house and orchard.', '7. In the ensuing two sets of criminal proceedings instituted by I.M. by way of private prosecution, the applicant was found guilty of two counts of defamation (kleveta). By a judgment of 17 December 2004 the Varaždin Municipal Court (Općinski sud u Varaždinu – hereinafter “the Municipal Court”) fined the applicant 3,475 Croatian kunas (HRK) and ordered him to pay I.M. HRK 2,660 for the costs of the proceedings. By a judgment of 12 January 2005, amended by the Varaždin County Court (Županijski sud u Varaždinu – hereinafter “the County Court”) on 15 November 2005, the Municipal Court judicially admonished (sudska opomena) the applicant and ordered him to pay I.M. HRK 2,208 in costs.', '8. In subsequent civil defamation proceedings which I.M. instituted against the applicant, the civil courts also found in favour of the plaintiff and awarded him damages. By a judgment of 31 May 2006, amended by the County Court on 4 September 2007, the Municipal Court ordered the applicant to pay I.M. HRK 20,000 as compensation for non-pecuniary damage, together with statutory default interest and HRK 6,942 in costs.', '9. Meanwhile, another set of civil proceedings between the same parties had also ended unfavourably for the applicant. By a judgment of 2 May 2005 the Municipal Court dismissed the applicant’s action to declare an in-court settlement between him and I.M. of 15 January 1997 null and void, and ordered him to pay the defendant HRK 2,318 in costs.', '10. Since the applicant did not pay the sums stipulated above (hereinafter “the debt”) on time, on 7 September and 31 October 2007 I.M. instituted two sets of enforcement proceedings in the Municipal Court, seeking enforcement against the applicant’s immovable property, specifically his share in the house and surrounding land he owned with his wife. The property in question consisted of the house, a yard and arable land (fields) measuring 150, 500 and 204 square meters respectively (hereinafter “the property”).', '11. On 5 November 2007 and 4 January 2008 respectively the court issued two writs of execution (rješenja o ovrsi) ordering the seizure and sale of the applicant’s share in the property.', '12. On 10 March 2008 and 2 June 2009 the Varaždin County Court dismissed appeals lodged by the applicant and upheld the writs.', '13. By a decision of 18 March 2010 the Municipal Court joined the two sets of enforcement proceedings.', '14. At a hearing on 8 April 2010 the court, on the basis of information provided by the tax authorities, determined that the value of the applicant’s share in the property was HRK 131,200. The applicant did not attend the hearing even though he had been duly notified.', '15. By a ruling of 27 July 2010 the court ordered the sale of the applicant’s share in the property (zaključak o prodaji, see paragraph 48 below) and scheduled a public auction for 14 October 2010 at which, in accordance with the law, the property (or share of it) could not be sold for less than two-thirds of its value (see paragraph 50 below).', '16. The auction was not attended by any interested buyers. The applicant, however, submitted a certificate confirming that on 8 September 2010 he had paid HRK 14,400 of the debt, and promised to pay the rest by New Year.', '17. Since he did not do so, on 12 January 2011 I.M. asked the court to schedule a second public auction.', '18. On 17 January 2011 the applicant submitted another certificate confirming that on 14 January 2011 he had paid HRK 7,340 of the debt, and asked the court not to schedule a second auction because he would gradually pay the rest of the debt.', '19. On 1 February 2011 I.M. reiterated his request for a second auction and stated that, by repeatedly promising to gradually pay the debt within self-imposed deadlines he did not observe, the applicant was merely protracting the enforcement proceedings which had thus far lasted three and a half years.', '20. By a decision of 3 February 2011 the court scheduled the second public auction for 17 March 2011 at which, in accordance with the law, the property (or share of it) could not be sold for less than one-third of its value (see paragraph 50 below).', '21. At the second auction only I.M. offered to buy the applicant’s share in the property, for HRK 43,734. This was the minimum price allowed by law and corresponded to one-third of its value. The applicant’s representative asked the court to postpone the auction and promised that the applicant would pay the rest of the debt within three months. The court refused this request and issued a decision declaring that I.M. had “satisfied the conditions to be awarded [the share in] the property”. It also specified that the decision actually awarding him the share in the property (rješenje o dosudi, see paragraphs 25 and 50 below) would be delivered at a later date.', '22. On 21 March 2011 the applicant paid HRK 21,450 of the debt.', '23. On 2 May 2011 he informed the court that earlier that day he had paid a further HRK 15,225.75, and had thereby settled the debt of HRK 58,415.75 in full (consisting of the principal amount of HRK 34,128.43 and HRK 24,287.32 of statutory default interest). What remained to be paid were the costs of the enforcement proceedings. He therefore asked the court to discontinue the enforcement and issue a decision specifying those costs, which he promised to pay immediately.', '24. At a hearing on 26 October 2011 I.M. confirmed that on 2 May 2011 the applicant had paid the debt in full, but had not covered the costs of the enforcement proceedings. He thus asked the court to issue a decision on costs, and the award decision.', '25. On 18 November 2011 the court delivered its award decision (rješenje o dosudi, see paragraph 21 above and paragraph 50 below). It specified that the property would be surrendered (transferred) to I.M. after he deposited the purchase price, within three months of the decision becoming final. The court found the fact that the applicant had paid the debt in full on 2 May 2011 irrelevant, since the decision on the sale of the applicant’s share in the property to I.M. had been adopted earlier, on 17 March 2011 (see paragraph 21 above). It noted however that the fact that the applicant had paid off the debt would be taken into account when distributing the proceeds of sale (see paragraph 32 below). In particular, the court held as follows:', '“Given that the property was sold on 17 March 2011 at the second public auction when it was established that the bidder I.M. had made the best bid and had offered [to pay] HRK 43,734, and thereby met the conditions to be awarded the property, the court adopted [the present] award decision ... regardless of the fact that the enforcement debtor on 2 May 2011 settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest. When settling the enforcement creditor’s claim, the court will deliver a distribution decision whereby it will take into account the fact that the enforcement debtor had settled the debt in respect of the principal amount and the interest.”', '26. On 5 December 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision. He argued that he had settled the debt in full several months before the court had issued the contested award decision. In that sense I.M. “had got it both ways” as he had both been paid the debt and acquired the share in the property. There had been no reason to sell his share in the property to pay the same debt. He further stated that he would also have covered the costs of the enforcement proceedings that remained due if the court had issued a decision specifying the amount, which it had not done.', '27. On 16 January 2012 the County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the contested decision, which thereby became final. It held that the necessary conditions for selling the applicant’s share in the property to I.M. had already been met on 17 March 2011. The fact that he had later paid off the debt had no bearing on the validity of the sale. In particular, that court held as follows:', '“Having regard to the fact that on 17 March 2011 the second public auction was held at which the enforcement creditor appeared as a bidder and made the best (the only) bid, and given that after the auction the court established that the enforcement creditor had offered the highest price and had met the conditions to be awarded the property in accordance with section 98(3) of the Enforcement Act, the first-instance court was, pursuant to section 98(4) of [that] Act, entitled (and obliged to) adopt the contested [award] decision ...', 'The fact that the enforcement debtor after the [second public] auction, on 2 May 2011 settled the creditor’s claim in full is of no relevance for the validity of the contested decision, regardless of the unjustified (time) gap between the auction and the adoption of the impugned decision. [That is because] at the auction of 17 March 2011, which was held in line with the [relevant] provisions of the Enforcement Act, it was established that the enforcement creditor offered the highest price and that he met the conditions to be awarded the property. [Therefore] the events that occurred subsequently cannot call into question the award of the property, nor can the said event constitute grounds for discontinuation of enforcement under the Enforcement Act.”', '28. On 27 February 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint against the County Court’s decision, alleging a violation of his constitutional right to fair procedure.', '29. On 7 March 2012 I.M. informed the court that he had deposited the purchase price, and submitted proof thereof.', '30. By a ruling of 24 April 2012 (zaključak o predaji, see paragraph 51 below) the Municipal Court surrendered (transferred) the applicant’s share in the property to I.M. On 29 June 2012 the court’s land registry department recorded him in the land register as co-owner of the property instead of the applicant.', '31. By a decision of 24 May 2012 the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint of 27 February 2012 inadmissible (see paragraph 28 above). It held that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review.', '32. On 17 September 2012 the Municipal Court issued a distribution decision (rješenje o namirenju, see paragraph 54 below), distributing the HRK 43,734 deposited with the court by I.M. for the applicant’s share in the property. The court specified the costs of the enforcement proceedings, which were incumbent on the applicant, as HRK 10,703.12, and returned that amount to I.M. The remaining HRK 33,030.88 was paid to the applicant.', '33. On 14 December 2012 the County Court dismissed an appeal by the applicant against that decision. On 27 February 2013 lodged a constitutional complaint against the decision of the County Court.', '34. By a decision of 25 April 2013 the Constitutional Court declared that constitutional complaint inadmissible, holding that the contested decision was not open to constitutional review.', '35. By a decision of 20 January 2013 the Municipal Court declared the enforcement completed. An appeal by the applicant against that decision was dismissed by the County Court on 26 March 2013.', '36. On 23 May 2013 I.M. instituted non-contentious proceedings in the Municipal Court against the applicant’s wife by lodging a petition for partition of co-ownership. Since the property could not be physically divided, he sought a partition by sale, whereby the proceeds would be distributed to the co-owners.', '37. As the applicant’s wife opposed the partition, by a decision of 2 July 2013 the court discontinued the non-contentious proceedings and instructed I.M. to institute separate civil proceedings against her to that end.', '38. On 17 July 2013 I.M. brought a civil action against the applicant’s wife as instructed, in the same municipal court. He sought a partition of co-ownership in the same way as in his petition of 23 May 2013.', '39. By a judgment of 6 November 2014 the Municipal Court ruled for the plaintiff and ordered a partition by sale and distribution of the proceeds to the co-owners. It also ordered the applicant’s wife to pay the plaintiff HRK 4,050 in costs.', '40. She appealed and the proceedings are currently pending before the second-instance court.', '41. Meanwhile, on 3 July 2013 I.M., had also instituted another set of civil proceedings before the Municipal Court against the applicant, seeking payment of rent for the use of the property. He explained that the applicant had remained living in the house even after he acquired the applicant’s share. As a co-owner he was thus entitled to seek from the applicant half of the rent under which the house could be rented out. These proceedings are still pending before the first-instance court.']",['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1941 and lives in Kadzidło.', '5. The applicant’s parents owned land within the administrative borders of Warsaw. It was expropriated by way of an administrative decision issued on an unspecified date under the provisions of the Decree on Ownership and Use of Land in Warsaw of 26 October 1945. In February 1949 the applicant’s legal predecessor requested to be granted a right of perpetual use (użytkowanie wieczyste) for another plot of land situated in Warsaw as compensation provided for by the provisions of the 1945 Decree. His request was dismissed by way of an administrative decision given in 1961 and ultimately upheld in 1968.', 'A judicial decision given in 1975 confirmed that the applicant was his parents’ general heir.', '6.

On 20 September 1994 the Minister of Construction and Land Planning (Minister of Gospodarki Przestrzennej and Budownictwa) gave a decision. It noted that in 1961 the authorities had failed to examine whether the substantive conditions for granting the owners the right of perpetual use of the land specified in section 7 of the 1945 Decree (see paragraph 46 below) had been met at that time. He declared, referring to Article 156 § 1 item 2 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (CAP) (see paragraph 39 below), that decision null and void in so far as it related to the part of the land concerned which was used as family gardens. In so far as this decision related to the part of the land which had already been used for construction purposes, he considered that the contested decision had given rise to irrevocable legal consequences within the meaning of Article 156 § 2 of the CAP (see paragraph 41 below). Therefore under Article 158 § 2 he could merely declare that it had been issued contrary to law within the meaning of this provision.', '8. The municipality of Warsaw did not lodge an appeal against this decision. It accordingly became final within thirty days after its service on the applicant.', '9.

On 7 September 1995 the Minister of Minister of Construction and Land Planning stayed the compensation proceedings instituted by the applicant under Article 160 of the Code of Administrative Procedure (see paragraphs 29-33 below). He observed that the decision given on 20 September 1994 (see paragraph 7 above) made it necessary in law to reexamine the former owners’ request for grant of the right to perpetual use submitted in 1949 and that it created a compensation claim for the applicant.

On 15 January 2008 the applicant again complained about the administrative authorities’ failure to give a decision. On 29 August 2008 the Board of Appeal found in a decision that his complaint was ill-founded as the file of the case had been forwarded to the civil court and the administrative authorities could not deal with the case. The applicant lodged an appeal against this decision with the Supreme Administrative Court.', '24. On 28 October 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court obliged the Mayor of Warsaw to give a decision on the merits of the case within a twomonth time-limit.', '25.

The applicant was born in 1961 and lives in Adana.', '6. On 16 February 2006 a gathering was held in Adana on the anniversary of the arrest of Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers’ Party), an illegal armed organisation. The protesters gathered in front of the building of the Adana branch of the Democratic Society Party (Demokratik Toplum Partisi) (DTP), where a press statement was read out. Being a member of the DTP, the applicant participated in the gathering.', '7. Subsequently, clashes occurred between police officers and some demonstrators who were attempting to block the traffic. According to police reports, two police officers were injured as a result of objects thrown from the DTP building. The police then entered the DTP building and arrested 223 people, including the applicant. The next day, the applicant was detained on remand.', '8. On 10 March 2006 the Adana public prosecutor charged the applicant and sixteen other people with membership of the PKK under Articles 220 § 6 and 314 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor alleged that the accused had participated in the public gathering in question in response to calls made by the PKK and had resisted the police officers, and that they had therefore acted on behalf of the PKK.', '9. On 5 May 2006 the applicant was released pending trial.', '10. On 10 September 2008 the Adana Assize Court convicted the applicant under section 7(2) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Law no. 3713). The assize court did not find it established that the applicant had attended the reading out of the press statement in response to calls made by the PKK or that she had injured any police officers. It therefore concluded that the applicant could not be convicted of membership of the PKK or resistance to the police. The court nonetheless considered that on 16 February 2006 the applicant had gone to the DTP building with a view to disseminating propaganda in support of the PKK and that she should therefore be convicted under section 7(2) of Law no. 3713. The applicant was sentenced to ten months’ imprisonment.', '11.

The applicant was born in 1984 and lives in Berehove.', '6. In the early hours of 22 August 2004 M. was robbed and killed in Berehove, where the applicant was also living. On the same date the applicant and two other people, K.A. and St., were arrested on suspicion of robbing and killing M.', '7. According to the applicant, he was apprehended by the police task force at about 10 a.m. on 22 August 2004 in the apartment of his girlfriend and taken to the police station, where he was beaten up and threatened in an attempt to force him to confess to the robbery and murder of M.', '8. The case file contains two arrest warrants – one issued by a police officer and another one by the prosecutor investigating the murder (hereinafter “the investigator”), both indicating that the applicant had been arrested by the above-mentioned officials on 22 August 2004 at 6.30 p.m. at their offices. The arrest warrant issued by the investigator indicates that the applicant acknowledged his guilt, had no observations regarding his arrest and that he wished to be legally represented. It bears the applicant’s signature, with no comments. The lower part of the last page of the record contains a printed statement (“довідка”) that was added later (it was dated 2007); this additional statement is signed by the investigator only and asserts that the applicant’s relatives were informed of his arrest. The applicant alleged that his family had been informed of his arrest on the evening of the following day (that is to say 23 August 2004).', '9. After his arrest, the applicant signed a record, bearing no time, explaining his rights as a suspect, including the right to remain silent and to consult a lawyer before he was first questioned. The relevant entry in the record indicates that the applicant expressed his wish to be represented by S., a lawyer who lived in Uzhhorod, some 70 kilometres from Berehove, and noted the address of the latter.', '10. At about 4 p.m. on 22 August 2004, according to the applicant, and from 9 until 10 a.m. on that day, according to the official record, the applicant was questioned as a suspect by the investigator in the presence of B., a lawyer. The record of the questioning noted that the applicant had been informed of his rights as a suspect from 6.30 until 6.45 p.m. on that day and that a separate procedural document existed in this respect evidencing that he had wished to be legally represented. The handwritten entry in the record furthermore stated that the applicant wanted to have B. as his lawyer and that he acknowledged in full his guilt in respect of the robbery and murder. During the questioning, the applicant provided details regarding the robbery and admitted that he had hit M. in the head with a bat during the robbery but that he had done so instinctively, in self-defence. The applicant did not state what had become of the bat – namely where or in what circumstances he had hidden the bat after the murder. The applicant and B. signed the verbatim record, making no objections as to its contents. B. then left.', '11. Later that day, from 8 until 8.30 p.m., the applicant took part in a videotaped reconstruction of the crime in the presence of a forensic expert, an investigator from the local police, two attesting witnesses and the investigator in the case. According to the Government, B. was apparently busy and was not able to participate in the reconstruction. No other lawyer was instructed to assist the applicant during this investigative step. According to the applicant, he repeated his request for S. to be called, but this was not done and he was forced by means of threats to testify.', '12. During the reconstruction, which commenced near the place where the bat used for the murder had been hidden, the applicant pointed to the exact place where the bat was; the bat was then uncovered and retained as evidence. A copy of the verbatim record of the reconstruction provided to the Court by the applicant indicates that he was informed of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself. The verbatim record bears a handwritten “not” next to the following printed “agreed to testify”. The relevant part of the text is not visible on the copy of the record provided by the Government. The record furthermore contains the applicant’s statement that he had not been forced to testify by means of any psychological or physical violence. The applicant signed the record without indicating any objections as to its contents next to his signature.', '13. At an unspecified time on the same date St. and K.A were questioned as suspects. St., being represented by B. (the same lawyer who represented the applicant), acknowledged his guilt in respect of the robbery. He stated, inter alia, that he had seen the applicant carrying a bat when they had been entering the victim’s house. K.A., having waived his right to legal assistance, admitted that he had taken part in the robbery. He furthermore participated, still unrepresented, in a videotaped reconstruction of the crime during which he stated, inter alia, that he had seen the applicant with a bat in his hands but had not seen who had murdered M.', '14. On 23 August 2004 the investigator appointed B. to represent the applicant, and St., and admitted him to the proceedings.', '15. On the same day the applicant, in the presence of B., participated in another videotaped reconstruction of the crime in the victim’s house. The applicant admitted his guilt and gave further details about the robbery and murder. He reiterated that he had hit M. on the head with the bat and stated that another suspect in the case had helped him to hide the bat afterwards.', '16. On 26 August 2004 the applicant’s mother signed a contract with the lawyer S. concerning her son’s legal representation. On the same date S. contacted the prosecutor, who allowed S. to represent the applicant instead of B. The applicant furthermore made a written statement declaring that he was refusing the services of B. and wanted S. to act as his lawyer.', '17. On 8 October 2004 medical experts examined the applicant following his complaint that he had been ill-treated by the police. No injuries were discovered on the applicant’s body.', '18. On 14 October 2004 the video recording of the reconstruction of the crime of 23 August 2004 was played to the applicant in the presence of S. The applicant retracted his earlier confession and explained that he had only given it because he had been threatened and beaten up by the police on 22 August 2004.', '19. On 2 September 2004, and 20 and 28 January and 17 February 2005 the applicant was questioned in the presence of his defence lawyer but refused to give any evidence.', '20. On 19 January 2005 the prosecutors refused to institute a criminal investigation into the applicant’s allegation that he had been beaten up by the police, having found the police officers’ actions to be lawful.', '21. On 18 February 2005 the pre-trial investigation was completed and the applicant – together with St. and K.A. – was charged with robbery and murder. It was established that another person, I.K., had also participated in the robbery, but as he had absconded, he would have to be tried separately.', '22. During the trial the applicant denied having participated in the robbery and the murder and refused to give any evidence. He stated that his earlier confessions to the crimes should not be admitted as evidence as they had been made under duress and in breach of his defence rights, including his right to be represented by a lawyer of his own choosing. He also argued that the bat which had been retained as evidence and examined by experts during the investigation had not been the same bat as that which he had pointed out during the reconstruction. He supported his allegation by referring to the fact that in the verbatim record, the prosecutor had described the bat as blue, while the experts who had subsequently examined it had described it as grey.', '23. In April 2005 the police detained I.K. In the course of the trial St., A.K. and I.K all pleaded guilty to robbery but denied killing M.', '24. On 29 August 2006 the Zakarpattya Regional Court of Appeal, acting as the first-instance court, convicted the applicant of murder and robbery and sentenced him to fifteen years’ imprisonment. St., A.K. and I.K. were also found guilty of robbery but acquitted of murder. The hearing was held in the presence of the applicant’s new lawyer, D., who had replaced the lawyer S. on an unspecified date.', '25. The court based the applicant’s conviction, among other evidence, on the confessions he had made during his questioning by the investigator on 22 August 2004, the reconstructions of the crime on 22 and 23 August 2004, the statements of his co-defendants that they had seen him with a bat in M.’s house, and physical evidence, including an expert’s report suggesting that the traces of blood found on the bat (the location of which had been pointed out by the applicant during the reconstruction of the crime on 22 August 2004) could have belonged to M.', '26. By the same judgment, the court rejected as unsubstantiated the applicant’s submissions that he had made his self-incriminating statements under duress, referring to the results of the medical examination of 8 October 2004 (see paragraph 17 above) and the prosecutors’ decision of 19 January 2005 (see paragraph 20 above).', '27. The court also found no violation of the applicant’s defence rights. It noted, inter alia, that on 22 August 2004 the prosecutor’s decision to appoint B. as the applicant’s lawyer had been lawful, because at the material time the applicant had not had a contract with S. for legal representation. It also observed that on 22 August 2004 the applicant had raised no objections to the questioning record. The court also suggested, without giving details, that there had been some technical errors in the procedural documents, in particular as regards the time of the applicant’s arrest and questioning, but that they did not affect the fairness of the respective investigative actions.', '28. The court refuted the applicant’s allegation that the bat retained as evidence had been switched with another (see paragraph 22 above), noting that the disparity in the bat’s description by the experts and the prosecutor could have been explained by the fact that the latter was colour blind.', '29. The applicant lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court on points of law, reiterating his complaints. He stated, in particular, that he had not been represented by the lawyer of his choice, S., on 22 and 23 August 2004, but by B., who had been appointed by the investigator against the applicant’s will. He further stated that he had not been assisted by any lawyer when he had been forced to confess during the crime reconstruction of 22 August 2004. He also complained about the fact that B. had represented him and his co-accused St. at the same time (see paragraph 13 above) – a conflict of interest (as there had been important discrepancies in their respective statements) that should have prevented him from being allowed to do so.', '30. On 12 April 2007 the Supreme Court, acting as the second-instance court, upheld the applicant’s conviction and sentence in his presence. The applicant was not represented by a lawyer during the hearing, but he did not provide any further details in this regard.', '31. The Supreme Court found that the applicant’s guilt was proved, inter alia, by the statements he had made during his questioning of 22 August 2004 and during the reconstructions of the crime. It noted in this respect that those statements had been corroborated by other evidence, including the testimony of his co-accused, and concluded that the lower court had correctly admitted the applicant’s self-incriminating statements as evidence. The court also noted that the details of the crime which the applicant had revealed in his statements could not have been known to him unless he had been the direct perpetrator.', '32. Without mentioning the applicant’s arguments regarding the alleged breach of his defence rights, the Supreme Court found no procedural violations during the proceedings serious enough to necessitate it quashing the judgment.', '33. On an unspecified date the applicant was released from prison.']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

In September 2003 the applicants’ father made them beneficiaries under his life insurance and accident insurance policies. The total amount payable in case of death as a result of accident under the accident insurance policy was 10,000 Bulgarian levs (BGN), or BGN 5,000 in respect of each brother. The applicants’ father died on 29 June 2004 as a result of an allergic reaction to a wasp sting.', '8. In September 2004 the applicants were informed by the insurance company that a “wasp sting” was not a risk covered by the accident insurance policy, and the company accordingly refused to pay out on the claim.', '9. In 2005 the applicants, represented by counsel, brought a claim under the Commerce Act for the payment of compensation under the accident insurance policy. During a hearing on 12 April 2005, the applicants informed the court that, after their father’s death, they had handed the original insurance policy documents to the insurance company upon its request. Although the applicants had sought to recover those documents from the company, the latter had only returned to them the “additional conditions”. During the same hearing, upon a request by the applicants, the court ordered the insurance company to produce the complete insurance policy file, referring to Article 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, in force at the time. The company produced the file during a hearing on 10 May 2005 and the court accepted it as evidence in the case.', '10. By a judgment of 26 July 2005 the Sofia District Court allowed the applicants’ claim. The court noted that, in so far as allergic reactions were not included in the disclaimer to the accident insurance policy signed on 15 September 2003, the applicants were entitled to benefit from the compensation payable in the event of their father’s death as a result of an accident.', '11. The insurance company appealed against the judgment. In its appeal it acknowledged, inter alia, that the existence of a valid contract was not disputed. However, it claimed that the allergic reaction did not fall under the “accident” category as defined in the insurance policy.', '12. On 16 May 2006 the Sofia City Court allowed the appeal and dismissed the applicants’parties, that did not in itself prove its existence.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

Mrs Anca Mocanu and Mr Marin Stoica were born in 1970 and 1948 respectively. They live in Bucharest.', '12. The Association “21 December 1989” (Asociaţia 21 Decembrie 1989) was set up on 9 February 1990 and is based in Bucharest.', '13. The applicant association brings together mainly individuals who were injured during the violent suppression of the anti-totalitarian demonstrations which took place in Romania in December 1989 and the relatives of persons who died during those events. It was one of the groups which supported the anti-government demonstrations held in Bucharest between April and June 1990, at which demonstrators called, inter alia, for the identification of those responsible for the violence committed in December 1989.', '14. The main facts concerning the crackdown on anti-government demonstrations from 13 to 15 June 1990 were described in the decisions of 16 September 1998 (see paragraphs 99-110 below) and 17 June 2009 (see paragraphs 152-63 below), issued by the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice (which in 2003 became the High Court of Cassation and Justice), and in the decisions to commit for trial (rechizitoriu) issued by the same prosecutor’s office on 18 May 2000 and 27 July 2007.', '15. On 13 June 1990 the security forces’ intervention against the demonstrators who were occupying University Square and other areas of the capital resulted in several civilian casualties, including Mrs Mocanu’s husband, Mr Mocanu, who was killed by a shot fired from the headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior.', '16. On the evening of 13 June 1990 Mr Stoica and other persons, some but not all of whom were demonstrators, were arrested and ill-treated by uniformed police officers and men in civilian clothing, in the area around the headquarters of the State television service and in the basement of that building.', '17. On 14 June 1990 thousands of miners were transported to Bucharest, essentially from the Jiu Valley (Valea Jiului) mining region, to take part in the crackdown on the demonstrators.', '18. At 6.30 a.m. on 14 June 1990 the President of Romania addressed the miners, who had arrived in the square in front of the Government building, inviting them to go to University Square, occupy it and defend it against the demonstrators; they subsequently did so.', '19. The violent events of 13 and 14 June 1990 resulted in more than a thousand victims, whose names appear in a list attached to the decision issued on 29 April 2008 by the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice.', '20. The headquarters of several political parties and other institutions, including those of the applicant association, were attacked and ransacked. The latter association subsequently joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party.', '21. The criminal proceedings into the unlawful killing by gunfire of Mr Velicu-Valentin Mocanu are still pending. The investigation opened on 13 June 1990 into the ill-treatment allegedly inflicted on Mr Stoica was closed by a decision not to bring a prosecution, dated 17 June 2009, subsequently upheld by a judgment of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of 9 March 2011.', '22. The facts as set out by the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice in its decisions of 16 September 1998 and 17 June 2009 and in the decisions to commit for trial of 18 May 2000 and 27 July 2007 may be summarised as follows.', '23. University Square in Bucharest was considered a symbolic location for the fight against the totalitarian regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu, given the large number of persons who had died or were injured there as a result of the armed repression initiated by the regime on 21 December 1989. It was therefore in this square that several associations – including the applicant association – called on their members to attend protest events in the first months of 1990.', '24. Thus, the first demonstrations against the provisional government formed after the fall of the Ceauşescu regime took place in University Square in Bucharest on 12 and 24 January 1990, as indicated in the decision issued on 17 June 2009 by the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice. That decision also states that a counter-demonstration was organised by the National Salvation Front (Frontul Salvării Naţionale – the FSN) on 29 January 1990. On that occasion, miners from the coal-mining regions of the Jiu Valley, Maramureş and other areas appeared in Bucharest. The headquarters of the National Liberal Party were vandalised at that time.', '25. From 25 February 1990, demonstrations were held every Sunday. According to the decision to commit for trial of 27 July 2007, they were intended to denounce the non-democratic attitude of those in power, who were accused of having “betrayed the ideals of the revolution”, and sought to alert the population to the threat of a new dictatorial regime.', '26. Election campaigns were subsequently launched for parliamentary elections and the office of President of the Republic, to be held on 20 May 1990.', '27. It was in this context that unauthorised “marathon demonstrations” (manifestaţii maraton) began on 22 April 1990 in University Square, at the initiative of the Students’ League and other associations, including the applicant association. These demonstrations lasted fifty-two days, during which the demonstrators occupied University Square. The decisions of 16 September 1998 and 17 June 2009 indicate that the demonstrators, who had gathered in large numbers, were not violent and were essentially demanding that persons who had exercised power during the totalitarian regime be excluded from political life. They also called for a politically independent television station.', '28. They called further for the identification of those responsible for the armed repression of December 1989 and demanded the resignation of the country’s leaders (particularly the Minister of the Interior), whom they considered responsible for the repression of the anti-communist demonstrations in December 1989.', '29. On 22 April 1990 fourteen demonstrators were arrested by the police on the ground that the demonstration had not been authorised. Faced with the reaction of the public, who had arrived to boost the number of demonstrators in University Square, the police released the fourteen arrested demonstrators. The authorities did not use force again over the following days, although the Bucharest City Council had still not authorised the gathering.', '30. Negotiations between the demonstrators and the provisional government resulted in stalemate.', '31. On 20 May 1990 the presidential and parliamentary elections took place. The FSN and its leader, who was standing for President, won the elections.', '32. Following those elections the protests continued in University Square, but were reduced from their original scale. Of the approximately 260 persons still present, 118 had gone on hunger strike.', '33. On the evening of 11 June 1990 the new President elect of Romania and his Prime Minister convened a government meeting, attended by the Minister of the Interior and his deputy, the Minister of Defence, the director of the Romanian Intelligence Service (Serviciul Român de Informaţii – the SRI), the first deputy president of the ruling party (the FSN) and the Procurator General of Romania. This is established in the prosecution service’s decisions of 16 September 1998 and 17 June 2009.', '34. At that meeting it was decided to take measures to clear University Square on 13 June 1990. In addition, it was proposed that the State organs, namely the police and army, would be assisted by some 5,000 mobilised civilians. Implementation of this measure was entrusted to the first deputy president of the FSN. Two members of that party’s steering committee opposed the measure, but without success. According to the decision of 17 June 2009, an action plan drawn up by General C. was approved by the Prime Minister.', '35. On the same evening the Procurator General’s Office (Procuratura Generală) broadcast a statement on State television calling on the government to take measures so that vehicles could circulate again in University Square.', '36. At a meeting held on the same evening with the participation of the Minister of the Interior, the head of the SRI and the head of police, General D.C. set out the plans for the police and gendarmerie, in collaboration with civilian forces, to clear University Square. Under this plan, the action was “to begin at 4 a.m. on 13 June 1990 by cordoning off the square, arresting the demonstrators and re-establishing public order”.', '37. At about 4.30 a.m. on 13 June 1990 members of the police and gendarmerie brutally charged the demonstrators in University Square. The arrested demonstrators were driven away and locked up at the Bucharest municipal police station. The 263 arrested individuals (or 262, according to the decision to commit for trial of 18 May 2000) included students from the Architecture Institute, who had been on the premises of their establishment, located on University Square, and who had not taken part in the demonstrations. The decision of 17 June 2009 indicated that the 263 persons who had been arrested were taken to the Măgurele barracks after being held in the police cells.', '38. The police operation led to protests by many people, who demanded that the arrested demonstrators be released. According to the decision of 16 September 1998, those persons launched violent attacks on the security forces, hurling projectiles and setting cars on fire. According to the decision to commit for trial of 18 May 2000, those actions were the work of a few aggressive individuals who had infiltrated groups of peaceful demonstrators.', '39. At about 10 a.m., workers from the factories of a large metallurgical company in Bucharest (IMGB) headed en masse for University Square to help the police arrest the demonstrators. According to the decision of 16 September 1998, they acted in a chaotic and heavy-handed manner, hitting out blindly and making no distinction between demonstrators and mere passers-by.', '40. On the afternoon of 13 June 1990, the demonstrations intensified around the television building, University Square, the Ministry of the Interior and the municipal police station, all locations where, according to the demonstrators, the persons who had been arrested could be held prisoner.', '41. Following those incidents, the army intervened and several armoured vehicles were sent to the headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior.', '42. According to a report by the Ministry of the Interior, referred to by the Government in their observations, at about 6 p.m. the headquarters of the Ministry of the Interior were surrounded by between 4,000 and 5,000 demonstrators; on the orders of Generals A.G. and C.M., servicemen posted inside the Ministry fired at the ceilings of the entrance halls with a view to dispersing the demonstrators.', '43. Three persons were killed by the shots fired in the Ministry of the Interior.', '44. It was in those circumstances that, at about 6 p.m., when he was a few metres away from one of the doors of the Ministry, the first applicant’s husband was killed by a bullet which hit the back of his head after having ricocheted. Those events are described in detail in the decisions of 18 May 2000 and 27 July 2007 committing for trial the Minister of the Interior at the relevant time, a general and three colonels. According to the first decision to commit for trial, the applicant’s husband and the other victims, who were returning from their workplaces on that day, were unarmed and had not previously taken part in the marathon demonstrations in University Square. Mere spectators of the events, they had been killed by bullets which had ricocheted.', '45. The security forces shot and killed a fourth person in another district of Bucharest. Another died shortly after having been stabbed in the area around the television headquarters.', '46. On 13 June 1990 no servicemen were subjected to violence by the demonstrators, as attested by the decision to commit for trial of 27 July 2007. According to that document, the army had fired 1,466 bullets from inside the Ministry of the Interior headquarters on that date.', '47. In addition, other persons, including Mr Stoica, were beaten and detained by police officers and civilians in the headquarters of the State television station, in the circumstances described below.', '48. The headquarters of the State television station were at that time guarded by 82 servicemen, backed by 14 armed vehicles, and subsequently reinforced by other groups of armed forces, the largest of which contained 156 servicemen (who arrived at 7 p.m.), a detachment of parachutists (7.30 p.m.), 646 servicemen (8 p.m.), 118 parachutists (11 p.m.) and 360 servicemen with 13 other armed vehicles (11 p.m.).', '49. At about 1 a.m. the demonstrators were chased out of the television headquarters following this mass intervention.', '50. Towards the end of the afternoon on 13 June 1990, while he was walking to his workplace along a street near the State television headquarters, the applicant was brutally arrested by a group of armed individuals and taken by force into the television building. In sight of the police officers and servicemen present, civilians struck and bound him, then took him to the basement of the building. He was then led into a television studio, where several dozen other persons were already present. They were filmed in the presence of the then director of the State television station. The recordings were broadcast during the night of 13 to 14 June 1990, accompanied by commentary which described the persons concerned as employees of foreign secret services who had threatened to destroy the television premises and equipment.', '51. In the course of the same night the applicant was beaten, struck on the head with blunt objects and threatened with firearms until he lost consciousness.', '52. He woke up at around 4.30 a.m. in the Floreasca Hospital in Bucharest. According to the forensic medical report drawn up on 18 October 2002, the medical certificate issued by the hospital’s emergency surgery department stated that the applicant had been admitted at about 4.30 a.m. on 14 June 1990 and diagnosed as suffering from bruising on the left side of the abdomen and ribcage, abrasions on the left side of his ribcage resulting from an assault, and craniocerebral trauma.', '53. Fearing further ill-treatment, he fled from the hospital, which was surrounded by police officers, at about 6.30 a.m.', '54. His identity papers had been confiscated during the night of 13 to 14 June 1990. Three months later he was invited to collect them from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations at the General Inspectorate of Police. In the meantime, he had remained shut away at home for fear of being arrested again, tortured and imprisoned.', '55. According to the decision of 16 September 1998, witness M.I., an engineer, who at the relevant time was head of department at the Craiova agency of the national railway company (Regionala CFR Craiova), had stated that, on the evening of 13 June 1990, the director of that agency had ordered that the scheduled trains be cancelled and that 4 train convoys, or a total of 57 wagons, be made available to the miners at Petroşani station, in the heart of the Jiu Valley mining area.', '56. M.I. had added that the order seemed to him unlawful and that he had attempted to prevent the miners’ transportation to Bucharest by cutting the electricity provision to the railway line on the journey indicated. He had stated that, faced with his insubordination, the director of the Craiova CFR agency had ordered that he be replaced and had the railway line restored to use by about 9 p.m. It appears that M.I. was subsequently dismissed and brought before the prosecution service.', '57. According to the decision issued on 10 March 2009 by the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice, on 14 June 1990 11 trains – a total of 120 wagons – transporting workers, especially miners, had travelled to Bucharest from several industrial regions around the country. The first had reached Bucharest at 3.45 a.m., the last at 7.08 p.m.', '58. The decision of 16 September 1998 states that the miners had been informed that they were to help the police re-establish public order in Bucharest, and that they were armed with axes, chains, sticks and metal cables.', '59. The decision of 10 March 2009 indicates that the miners had been mobilised by the leaders of their trade union. Questioned as a witness, the President of the Federation of Miners’ Unions, who became mayor of Lupeni in 1998, stated that 5 trains carrying the miners had arrived at Bucharest station at about 1 a.m. on 14 June 1990, that the miners had been greeted by the deputy Minister for Mines and a Director General from that Ministry, and that these two senior government officials had led them to University Square.', '60. On the morning of 14 June 1990, groups of miners first stopped at Victory Square (Piaţa Victoriei), at the government headquarters.', '61. At about 6.30 a.m., the Head of State addressed the miners who were gathered in front of the government building, inviting them to cooperate with the security forces and to restore order in University Square and in other areas where incidents had occurred. In this speech, which is reproduced in full in the decision of 17 June 2009, he urged them to head towards University Square and occupy it, informing them that they would be confronted with “openly fascist elements who had committed acts of vandalism” by setting fire to the headquarters of both the Ministry of the Interior and of the police and “besieging the television building”.', '62. Immediately afterwards groups of miners were led “by unidentified persons” to the headquarters of opposition parties and associations perceived as hostile to the authorities.', '63. The miners were flanked by troops from the Ministry of the Interior, with whom they formed “mixed teams”, and set out to look for demonstrators. The decision of 17 June 2009 indicates that “acts of extreme cruelty [took place] on this occasion, with violence being used indiscriminately against demonstrators and Bucharest residents who were totally unconnected with the demonstrations”. The decision of 10 March 2009 indicates that the miners also attacked the homes of persons of Roma ethnicity. According to that decision, the miners had “selection criteria” for identifying those persons who, in their opinion, were suspected of taking part in the University Square demonstrations, and attacked “as a general rule, Roma, students, intellectuals, journalists and anyone who did not recognise their legitimacy”.', '64. The groups of miners and the other persons accompanying them ransacked the headquarters of the National Farmers’ Party (Partidul Naţional Ţărănesc Creştin şi Democrat) and the National Liberal Party, and the headquarters of other legal entities, such as the Association of Former Political Prisoners (Asociaţia Foştilor Deţinuţi Politici), the League for the Protection of Human Rights (Liga pentru Apărarea Drepturilor Omului) and the Association “21 December 1989” (the applicant association).', '65. According to the decision of 16 September 1998, no one present in the headquarters of those political parties and associations at that time was spared by the miners. All were attacked and had their possessions confiscated. Many were apprehended and handed over to the police – who were there “as though by coincidence” – and detained in an entirely unlawful manner.', '66. Other groups of miners had gone to University Square. On arrival, they broke into the University premises and the Architecture Institute, located on University Square. They attacked the staff and students whom they encountered there, subjecting them to violence and humiliating acts. The miners apprehended everyone on the premises and handed them over to the police and gendarmes. The arrested persons were taken by the law-enforcement officers to police stations or to the Băneasa and Măgurele military barracks.', '67. The miners then moved into the streets surrounding University Square and continued their activities there.', '68. According to the decision of 17 June 2009, 1,021 individuals – including 63 who were then under age – were apprehended in those circumstances. Of those individuals, 182 of them were placed in pre-trial detention, 88 received an administrative penalty and 706 were released “after checks”.', '69. The decision of 16 September 1998 states that “the miners [ended] their law-enforcement activities on 15 June 1990, after the President of Romania had thanked them publicly for what they had done in the capital, and authorised them to return to their work”.', '70. That decision also indicates that some of those who were beaten and imprisoned were unlawfully detained for several days and that several of them were released on 19 and 20 June 1990.', '71. The other persons in police custody were placed in pre-trial detention, on a decision by the prosecutor, for causing a breach of the peace; their number included the current president of the applicant association, who was subsequently acquitted of all the charges against him.', '72. The decision of 17 June 2009 states that the miners acted in close collaboration with the security forces and on the instructions of the State’s leaders. The relevant passages read as follows:', '“On 14 and 15 June 1990 the miners, in groups coordinated by civilians on behalf of and with the agreement of the State’s leaders [în numele şi cu acordul conducerii de stat], committed acts in which the State’s law-enforcement forces fully collaborated [deplină cooperare] and which caused not only physical harm to the persons who were apprehended for checks, but also significant damage to the premises of the University of Bucharest, the Architecture Institute, several political parties and civilian associations, and the homes of figures from so-called ‘historical’ parties ...', 'The investigations conducted by the military prosecutors have not permitted identification of the persons in civilian clothing who had infiltrated the miners’ groups; the victims who were questioned had distinguished between the miners and their other attackers by describing the first as ‘dirty miners’ and the second as ‘clean miners’.', '73. On 13 June 1990 the applicant association publicly condemned the violent interventions of the same day.', '74. At about 11 p.m. the leaders of the association decided, as a security measure, to spend the night in its headquarters. Seven of them remained there during the night.', '75. At 7 a.m. on 14 June 1990, a group of miners forcibly entered the applicant association’s premises after breaking a window pane. In the first few minutes after entering they were not violent, and were rather reserved. Shortly afterwards an unidentified civilian, who was not a miner, arrived on the scene and began hitting one of the members of the association. The miners followed his lead, brutally attacking the seven members of the association, who were then arrested by the security forces.', '76. During that day all of the association’s property and documents were seized, in breach of the legal formalities, under the supervision of troops from the Ministry of Defence.', '77. On 22 June 1990 the leaders of the association were able to return to the association’s premises, accompanied by the police.', '78. The above-cited decisions of the prosecutor’s office indicate that, instead of immediately returning to their homes, 958 miners remained in Bucharest, “ready to intervene should the protests recommence”, notably with a view to the impending swearing-in of the newly elected President. From 16 to 19 June 1990 those miners were accommodated in military barracks in Bucharest, where they received military uniforms.', '79. The decision of 16 September 1998 indicates that the investigation was unable to elucidate who had given the order to house and equip the miners, but specifies that “such a measure had to have been taken at least at Ministry of Defence level”.', '80. According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Health on 15 June 1990 and reproduced in the decision of 17 June 2009, during the period between 13 June and 6 a.m. on 15 June 1990, 467 persons went to hospital following the violent incidents; 112 were kept in hospital and 5 deaths were recorded.', '81. According to the same decision of 17 June 2009, police officers, miners and later the military conscripts responsible for supervising the miners used excessive force against the 574 demonstrators and the other persons – including children, elderly persons and blind people – who had been arrested and detained in the Măgurele military barracks. The decision states that the detainees on those premises were subjected to violence and assaults of a “psychological, physical and sexual” nature and held in inappropriate conditions, and that they received belated and inadequate medical care.', '82. The violent events of June 1990, in the course of which the husband of the applicant Anca Mocanu was killed and Mr Stoica was allegedly ill-treated, and which resulted in the ransacking of the applicant association’s headquarters, gave rise to the opening of an investigation. It was initially divided up into several hundred different case files.', '83. On 29 May 2009 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice sent a letter to the Government’s Agent, in which the facts were summarised as follows:', '“Over the period from 1990 to 1997, hundreds of complaints were registered on the rolls of the prosecutor’s office at the Bucharest County Court and the district prosecutor’s offices concerning the offences of theft, destruction, armed robbery, assault causing bodily harm, unlawful deprivation of liberty and other offences committed in the context of the acts of violence committed by miners in Bucharest on 14 and 15 June 1990. In the majority of those cases, it having proved impossible to identify the perpetrators, a decision was issued not to bring a prosecution.”', '84. No decision to discontinue the proceedings was communicated to Mrs Mocanu or to the applicant association, which had joined the proceedings as a civil party.', '85. Those case files were subsequently joined and the scope of the investigation was broadened from 1997 onwards, the events having been given a different legal classification involving aggravated criminal responsibility. Senior army officers and State officials were successively charged and the entire investigation was transferred to the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice (Parchetul de pe lângă Curtea Supremă de Justiţie – Secţia Parchetelor Militare) as case no. 160/P/1997.', '86. Between 22 October 1997 and 27 October 1999, 183 previously opened cases were joined to case no. 160/P/1997, of which 46 were joined on 22 October 1997, 90 on 16 September 1998 and 69 on 22 October 1999.', '87. On 26 June 2000 the same military prosecutor’s section was assigned 748 cases concerning the events of 13 to 15 June 1990, including, in particular, the unlawful deprivations of liberty on 13 June 1990.', '88. In the decision of 17 June 2009, the state of the file as it existed after the joinder of all those cases is described as follows:', '“Many of the documents included in the 250 volumes of the file are photocopies which have not been stamped or have not been certified as corresponding to the original. The documents in each of those volumes are not filed by date, subject or another criterion, but in a disorderly fashion. Some of them have nothing to do with the case (for example, volume 150 contains files concerning disappearances which occurred after June 1990). ...”', '89. On 16 September 1998 case no. 160/P/1997 was split into four cases and the subsequent investigation was assigned to the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice.', '90. On 8 January 2001 three of those four cases were joined. After that date the investigation focused on two main cases.', '91. The first concerned charges of incitement to or participation in aggravated unlawful killing, particularly that of Velicu-Valentin Mocanu. The persons accused of that offence were the President of Romania at the relevant time and five senior army officers, including the Minister of the Interior.', '92. The decision of 19 June 2007to bring charges, and the subsequent decision of 19 July 2007 to sever the charges, state that, on orders from the then President, on the evening of 13 June and the night of 13 to 14 June 1990 the security forces and army personnel used their weapons and heavy ammunition against demonstrators, killing four persons, injuring three others and endangering the lives of other persons.', '93. The charges against the former President were subsequently severed from those against the other defendants, who were high-ranking military officers, and a decision to discontinue proceedings against him was issued.', '94. At 2 October 2013 this first branch of the investigation was still pending in respect of two of the officers in question, the three others having died in the meantime.', '95. The other case concerning the events of June 1990, which investigated, in particular, the criminal complaint for violence lodged by Mr Stoica and the ransacking of the applicant association’s premises, concerned charges of incitement to commit or participation in acts of sedition (subminarea puterii de stat), sabotage (actele de diversiune), inhuman treatment (tratamentele neomenoase), propaganda in favour of war (propaganda pentru război) and genocide, within the meaning of Article 357 (a) to (c) of the Criminal Code.', '96. The persons accused of those acts were the former President, several high-ranking officers and dozens of civilians. Proceedings were brought in respect of these charges against the former President on 9 September 2005 and against the former head of the SRI on 12 June 2006.', '97. This second branch of the investigation was closed by a decision not to bring a prosecution, adopted on 17 June 2009. That decision was upheld by a judgment delivered on 9 March 2011 by the High Court of Cassation and Justice following an appeal by Mr Stoica.', '98. The main stages of the investigation are described below.', '99. On 16 September 1998 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice issued its decision in case no. 160/P/1997, following an investigation concerning sixty-three persons who had been victims of violence and unlawful arrests, including Mrs Mocanu and three members of the applicant association, as well as the applicant association itself and eleven other legal entities whose premises had been ransacked during the events of 13 to 15 June 1990.', '100. Of the sixty-three victims listed in the table contained in the decision of 16 September 1998, three had been assaulted and deprived of their liberty at the headquarters of the State television station. In the final column, indicating the stage reached in the investigations, the table notes that “the case has not been investigated” (cauza nu este cercetată) in respect of those three persons.', '101. In its decision, the military section of the prosecutor’s office indicated that other complaints were pending before the civilian prosecutors’ offices.', '102. It added that its decision also concerned “the presumed unlawful killing of about one hundred individuals during the events of 13 to 15 June 1990, [whose corpses] were allegedly incinerated or buried in common graves in cemeteries in villages near Bucharest (notably Străuleşti)”.', '103. It also indicated that, to date, the investigation had been unable to identify the persons who had implemented in practice the executive’s decision to summon civilians to restore order in Bucharest. According to the prosecution service, this failing in the investigation was due to the “fact that none of the persons who held posts of responsibility at the relevant time [had] been questioned”, particularly the then President of Romania, the Prime Minister and his deputy, the Minister of the Interior, the head of the police, the director of the SRI and the Minister of Defence.', '104. In its decision, the military section ordered that the case be split into four separate case files.', '105. The first of those files was to focus on the continued investigation into the unlawful killing by gunfire of four civilians, including the first applicant’s husband.', '106. The second file targeted those persons who had exercised functions pertaining to civilian and military command. The authorities decided to pursue the investigation in respect of them, in particular for abuse of power against the public interest entailing serious consequences, an offence punishable under Article 248 § 2 of the Criminal Code, and also to investigate the fact that one social group had been enlisted alongside the security forces to combat other social groups.', '107. The third file concerned the continuing investigations into the possible existence of other victims who had been killed during the violent incidents of 13 to 15 June 1990 (see paragraph 102 above).', '108. Lastly, considering that the prosecution was statute-barred, the military section of the prosecutor’s office decided to discontinue the proceedings against unidentified members of the security forces and groups of miners in respect of the offences of armed robbery, unlawful deprivation of liberty, abusive conduct, improper investigation, abuse of power against private interests, assault, actual bodily harm, destruction of property, theft, breaking and entering homes, malfeasance and rape, committed between 13 and 15 June 1990.', '109. This part of the decision of 16 September 1998 was set aside in a decision issued on 14 October 1999 by the head of the military section of the prosecutor’s office (Şeful Secţiei Parchetelor Militare) at the Supreme Court of Justice, which ordered that the proceedings and investigations intended to identify all the victims be resumed, specifying in that respect that it had been established that the number of victims greatly exceeded that of the injured parties listed in the impugned decision.', '110. In addition, the decision of 14 October 1999 noted that the investigators had so far failed to conduct investigations into the “known collusion” between the Ministry of the Interior and the leaders of the mining companies “with a view to organising a veritable apparatus of unlawful repression”, that collusion having been established, according to the decision by the evidence contained in the case file.', '111. After the decision of 16 September 1998, the investigations into the unlawful killing of Mr Velicu-Valentin Mocanu continued under case no. 74/P/1998 (see paragraph 105 above).', '112. Mrs Mocanu and the two children she had had with the victim joined the proceedings as civil parties.', '113. Two generals – the former Minister of the Interior and his deputy – and three senior-ranking officials were charged with the unlawful killings committed on 13 June 1990, including that of the applicant’s husband, on 12, 18 and 21 January and 23 February 2000 respectively.', '114. All five were committed for trial on the basis of a decision to that effect (rechizitoriu) of 18 May 2000, on the ground that they had called for – and, in the case of the two generals, ordered – the opening of fire with heavy ammunition, an act which resulted in the death of four individuals and which caused serious injury to nine other persons.', '115. By a decision of 30 June 2003, the Supreme Court of Justice remitted the case to the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice for additional investigation intended to remedy various deficiencies, and reclassified the offence as participation in aggravated unlawful killing. It also ordered a series of investigative measures to be taken.', '116. Mrs Mocanu, other civil parties and the military section of the prosecutor’s office appealed against that decision on points of law. Their appeals were dismissed by the High Court of Cassation and Justice (as the Supreme Court of Justice was renamed in 2003, see paragraph 14 above) in a judgment of 16 February 2004.', '117. After the investigation was resumed, the proceedings against the five defendants were discontinued by a decision of 14 October 2005. That decision having been overturned on 10 September 2006, the proceedings were reopened.', '118. After carrying out an additional investigation in line with the instructions set out in the judgment of 30 June 2003, the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice committed the former Minister of the Interior, his deputy and two other senior army officers for trial in a decision to that effect of 27 July 2007. It discontinued proceedings against the fifth officer, who had died in the meantime.', 'According to the decision to commit for trial, “the lack of reaction by the public authorities” and the lack of an immediate effective investigation “[had] endangered the very existence of democracy and the rule of law”.', '119. By a judgment of 17 December 2007, the High Court of Cassation and Justice ordered that the case be sent back to the military section of the prosecutor’s office for a breach of procedural rules, primarily on the ground that criminal proceedings against a former minister could only be brought through a special procedure requiring prior authorisation by Parliament.', '120. On 15 April 2008 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice lodged an appeal on points of law against that decision, but this was dismissed on 23 June 2008.', '121. On 30 April 2009 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice stated that it did not have jurisdiction to examine this branch of the case, mainly because members of the police force – including the Minister of the Interior – had become civil servants following a legislative amendment, and the military courts and prosecutors thus no longer had jurisdiction over their criminal acts, even where those had been committed while they were still military officers. It therefore relinquished jurisdiction to one of the ordinary criminal sections of the same prosecutor’s office, namely the Criminal Proceedings and Criminalistics Section (Secţia de urmărire penală şi criminalistică).', '122. By a decision of 6 June 2013, that Section discontinued the proceedings against the former minister and his deputy, both of whom had died on 2 November 2010 and 4 February 2013 respectively.', '123. By the same decision, the same Section of the prosecutor’s office declared that it did not have jurisdiction in respect of the last two surviving defendants, Colonels C.V. and C.D., and referred their cases to the military prosecutor’s office at the Bucharest regional military court.', '124. This investigation was pending before that prosecutor’s office on 2 October 2013.', '125. This part of the investigation concerned the charges against the former President of the Romanian Republic with regard to the victims who were killed or injured by gunshots fired by the army on 13 June 1990.', '126. The former President of Romania, in office from 1989 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2004, was charged on 19 June 2007, by which date he was exercising the functions of senator and was a member of parliament. He was accused of having “deliberately incited servicemen to use force against the demonstrators in University Square and in other districts of the capital, an act which resulted in the death or injury by gunfire of several persons”. Those facts were characterised as participation lato sensu in aggravated unlawful killing, a crime punishable under Articles 174, 175 (e) and 176 (b) of the Criminal Code, taken together with Article 31 § 2 of that Code.', '127. On 19 July 2007 those charges were severed from case no. 74/P/1998. The investigation continued under case no. 107/P/2007.', '128. In the meantime, on 20 June 2007 the Constitutional Court, ruling in a case unrelated to the present one, had delivered a judgment ruling that the military courts did not have jurisdiction to judge or prosecute civilian defendants. In consequence, by a decision of 20 July 2007 the military section of the prosecutor’s office held that it did not have jurisdiction to examine case no. 107/P/2007 and relinquished jurisdiction to one of the ordinary criminal sections.', '129. On 7 December 2007 the Procurator General of Romania set aside, for procedural errors, the indictment of 19 June 2007, and ordered that the investigation be resumed.', '130. By a decision of 10 October 2008, the Criminal Proceedings and Criminalistics Section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice issued a decision not to bring a prosecution, on the ground that there was no causal link between the order to clear University Square issued by the former President and the decision taken by three officers, with the agreement of their superiors – General A. and General C. (Minister of the Interior) – to give the order to open fire on the demonstrators.', 'In so ruling, the prosecutor’s office held that the objectives of the action plan drawn up on 12 June 1990 had been fulfilled by 9 a.m. on the following morning, and that the following events, including the subsequent orders to open fire, had had nothing to do with that plan and could not have been foreseen by those who prepared it.', '131. On 3 November 2008 Mrs Mocanu and other injured parties challenged this decision not to bring a prosecution.', '132. On 18 December 2009 a three-judge bench of the High Court of Cassation and Justice dismissed their appeals, finding them inadmissible, out of time or unfounded, depending on the case. It concluded that there was no causal link between the acts imputed to the former President and the unpredictable consequences of the demonstrations which had resulted in the deaths of several persons. Moreover, it noted that three of the injured parties – widows or relatives of the victims who died on 13 and 14 June 1990 –, including Mrs Mocanu, had stated at a hearing on 11 December 2009 that they did not intend to challenge the decision not to bring a prosecution in respect of the former President and that they wished only that those responsible for the unlawful killings be identified and that they be held liable. Following an appeal on points of law by the civil parties, that decision was upheld by a nine-judge bench of the High Court in a judgment of 25 October 2010.', '133. According to the forensic autopsy report carried out on Mrs Mocanu’s husband, he died as a result of gunshot wounds inflicted by a third party.', '134. The applicant made her first specific request to join the proceedings as a civil party on 11 December 2000. On the same date the applicant and the other civil parties – relatives of the three other persons who had been killed during the events of 13 and 14 June 1990 – filed joint pleadings containing their observations as to the identity of those responsible for the deaths of their relatives, and their claims for compensation.', '135. On 14 February 2007 the applicant was questioned for the first time by the prosecutor’s office for the purposes of the investigation. Assisted by a lawyer of her own choice, she stated that her husband had not returned home on the evening of 13 June 1990, that this had worried her, that she had searched for him the following day without success, and that she had subsequently learned from the press that he had been killed by a shot to the head. No investigator or official representative had visited her, nor had she been summoned for the purposes of the investigation; only a few journalists had come to see her. She stated that, aged 20 and without employment at the relevant time, since her husband’s death she had raised their two children, a daughter of two months (born in April 1990) and a two-year-old son, alone.', '136. The documents in the file submitted to the Court do not indicate whether Mrs Mocanu was kept informed about developments in the investigation into the aggravated unlawful killing of her husband following the High Court of Cassation and Justice’s judgment of 17 December 2007 ordering that the case be remitted to the prosecutor’s office.', '137. Between 26 November 1997 and 12 June 2006, criminal proceedings were brought against 37 persons – 28 civilians and 9 servicemen – essentially for acts of sedition committed in the course of the events of June 1990. The former President of Romania was among those prosecuted. He was charged on 9 June 2005 with participation in genocide (paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article 357 of the Criminal Code), propaganda in favour of war (Article 356), inhuman treatment (Article 358), sedition (Article 162) and acts of sabotage (Article 163).', 'The vast majority of the 28 civilians charged were directors of mining companies, heads of miners’ trade unions and senior civil servants in the Ministry of Mines.', '138. On 16 September 1998 this branch of the investigation was allocated the file number 75/P/1998 (see paragraph 106 above).', '139. On 19 December 2007 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice ordered that the case in file no. 75/P/1998 be split into two parts, one concerning the criminal charges against the 28 civilians, including the former President of Romania and the former head of the SRI, and the other concerning the charges against the 9 servicemen. The investigation with regard to the 28 civilians was to be pursued before the relevant civilian section of the same prosecutor’s office.', '140. By a decision of 27 February 2008, the head prosecutor in the military section of the prosecutor’s office set aside the decision of 19 December 2007, finding that, given the close connection between the events, a single prosecutor’s office, namely the relevant civilian section, was to examine the entirety of the case in respect of all of the defendants, both civilians and servicemen.', '141. In line with that decision, on 29 April 2008 the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice also relinquished jurisdiction to the relevant civilian section for examination of the criminal charges against the 9 servicemen – including several generals, the former head of police and the former Minister of the Interior.', '142. The decision of 29 April 2008 contained a list of more than a thousand victims who had been held and subjected to ill-treatment, notably on the premises of the Băneasa Officers’ School and the Măgurele military unit. Mr Stoica was included in this list of victims. The decision also contained a list of the legal entities which had sustained damage during the crackdown of 13 to 15 June 1990, including the applicant association.', '143. That decision also referred to “identification of the approximately 100 persons who died during the events of 13 to 15 June 1990”.', '144. It also contained a list of the State-owned companies which had provided workers for the intervention in Bucharest. That list included, in particular, twenty mining companies from all around the country and factories in eleven towns (Călăraşi, Alexandria, Alba-Iulia, Craiova, Constanţa, Deva, Giurgiu, Galaţi, Braşov, Slatina and Buzău), as well as three factories in Bucharest.', '145. Following that decision, on 5 May 2008 the military section of the prosecutor’s office sent the 209 volumes, containing a total of some 50,000 pages, from case no. 75/P/1998 to the relevant civilian section of the prosecutor’s office.', '146. On 26 May 2008 the section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice which had received the entire file, namely the Criminal Proceedings and Criminalistics Section, stated that it did not have jurisdiction, and relinquished jurisdiction to another section of the same prosecutor’s office, namely the Directorate for Investigating Organised Crime and Terrorism (Direcţia de Investigare a Infracţiunilor de Criminalitate Organizată şi Terorism – DIICOT).', '147. By a decision of 10 March 2009, the relevant directorate of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice, namely the DIICOT, decided that no prosecution would be brought against the former head of the SRI on the charge of sedition, as that offence had become time-barred, and that no prosecution would be brought against the majority of the 27 civilian defendants – directors of mining companies, heads of miners’ trade unions, senior civil servants at the Ministry of Mines and in local government – on the ground that the constituent elements of the offence had not been made out.', '148. In so ruling, the prosecutor’s office considered that, in their respective capacities as Head of State, Minister of the Interior, deputy minister or Head of Police, some of the defendants exercised State authority, and it would have been illogical to think that they could have committed acts capable of undermining their own power. As to the miners and other workers who had travelled to Bucharest on 14 June 1990, the prosecutor’s office considered that they had “turned themselves into security forces” and been persuaded that their actions served State power. In addition, it noted that their intervention had been pointless, since the operation conducted by the parachutists at the television headquarters had enabled order to be restored in the capital at about 1 a.m. on 14 June 1990.', '149. The prosecution also discontinued the proceedings against three of the defendants, who had died in the meantime.', '150. Lastly, the DIICOT decided to relinquish jurisdiction to the Criminal Proceedings and Criminalistics Section with regard to the remainder of the case, namely the charges of inhuman treatment, propaganda in favour of war and genocide, within the meaning of Article 357 (a) to (c) of the Criminal Code. Those facts concerned only nine of the persons who had been charged during the period 2000-06, including the former president.', '151. On 17 June 2009 a decision was taken not to bring a prosecution in respect of those charges; its content is set out below.', '152. On 17 June 2009 the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice issued a decision not to bring a prosecution in the case, concerning essentially charges of inhuman treatment arising from 856 complaints by persons injured as a result of the violence committed from 13 to 15 June 1990.', '153. The decision in question indicated that the former Head of State had not been examined as a defendant in the course of the investigation.', '154. It gave a comprehensive description of the violence – classified as extreme cruelty – inflicted on several hundred persons.', '155. It was indicated that the investigations conducted over approximately nineteen years by the civilian prosecutor’s offices and, subsequently, by the military prosecuting authorities, had not made it possible to establish the identity of the perpetrators or the degree of involvement of the security forces. The relevant passage from the decision reads as follows:', '“The investigations carried out over a period of about nineteen years by the civilian prosecutors’ offices and, subsequently, by the military prosecuting authorities, the findings of which are contained in case file ... have not made it possible to establish the identity of the miners who committed the attack, the degree of involvement in their actions by the security forces and members and sympathisers of the FSN and their role and degree of involvement in the acts of violence carried out against the residents of the capital on 14 and 15 June 1990.”', '156. This decision ordered that proceedings be discontinued against one of the defendants, who had died in the meantime, and that no prosecution would be brought (scoatere de sub urmărire penală) in respect of the eight remaining defendants for those offences which had become statute-barred, in particular harbouring a criminal.', '157. With regard to the offences which had not become time-barred, especially those of inhuman treatment, the decision stated that there was no case to answer, since the constituent elements of the offences had not been made out or because the reality of the events complained of had not been proven.', '158. In this connection, it was indicated that the then Head of State could not be criticised for any form of participation in the joint actions by the miners and the armed forces, as he had merely approved the actions which occurred on the morning of 13 June 1990 and the army’s intervention on the afternoon of the same date, for the stated purpose of restoring order. It was also mentioned that there was no information (date certe) to substantiate accusations against him with regard to the preparations for the miners’ arrival in Bucharest and the instructions they had been given. It was noted that his request to the miners to protect the State institutions and to restore order – following which 1,021 persons had been deprived of their liberty and subjected to physical assault – could only be classified as incitement to commit assault and that criminal liability in that respect was time-barred.', '159. The prosecutor’s office considered that the demonstrators and other persons targeted by the miners belonged to various ethnic groups (Romanians, Roma, Hungarians) and social categories (intellectuals, students, school pupils, but also workers), and that they could not therefore be regarded as a single group or an identifiable community on objective geographical, historical, social or other grounds, and for that reason the events complained of could not be classified as genocide. Relying on the case-law of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the prosecutor’s office also considered that the persons deprived of liberty had not been systematically subjected to ill-treatment.', '160. The decision further indicated that the speech by which the Head of State had encouraged the miners to occupy and defend University Square against the demonstrators camping out there could not be interpreted as propaganda in favour of war, as the accused had not sought to instigate a conflict of any kind, but had, on the contrary, asked the miners “to put an end to excess and acts of bloodshed”.', '161. It was also indicated that the miners had been motivated by simplistic personal convictions, developed on the basis of collective hysteria, which had led them to act as arbitrators of the political situation and zealous guardians of the political regime – the leaders of which had recognised them as such –, authorised to “correct” those who opposed its legitimacy. The prosecutor further noted the legal requirement that, to be punishable, the inhuman treatment had to target “individuals who [had] fallen into enemy hands” and considered that this criterion had not been met here, since the miners no longer had any enemy against whom to fight on 14 June 1990.', '162. With regard to the accusations of torture, the prosecutor considered that Romanian law contained no provisions against torture at the material time.', '163. The decision of 17 June 2009 analyses each of the charges in respect of each defendant, but refers to none of the victims by name and does not mention the individual acts of violence complained of by each of them, referring to an appendix which has not been submitted to the Court. It mentions the number of victims and their membership of such or such a category, noting, for example, the 425 persons who were arrested and held on the premises of the Băneasa Officers’ School or the 574 demonstrators who were arrested and imprisoned on the premises of the Măgurele military base.', '164. The applicant association, other legal entities and individuals lodged an appeal against the decision of 17 June 2009 not to bring a prosecution, which was dismissed on 3 September 2009 by the head prosecutor of the relevant section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice. In so ruling, the prosecutor’s office considered that no actions which could be classified as a crime against humanity, such as inhuman treatment or genocide, had been committed.', '165. Mr Stoica and four other injured parties also lodged an appeal against the same decision. It was dismissed on 6 November 2009. Mr Stoica lodged on appeal on points of law before the High Court of Cassation and Justice.', '166. On 9 March 2011, having dismissed the plea of res judicata raised by the former Head of State, the High Court of Cassation and Justice ruled on the merits of the decision not to bring a prosecution, and dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '167. In its judgment, it classified the assault against the applicant as grievous bodily harm (Article 182 of the Criminal Code), unlawful arrest, ill-treatment (Article 267), torture, unjust repression and blackmail. It considered that the decision of 17 June 2009 had been correct in ruling that no prosecution was to be brought, on the ground that the offences in question had become time-barred and that torture had not been a criminal offence at the material time.', '168. In contrast, it did not rule on the criminalisation of inhuman treatment (Article 358 of the Criminal Code), which had been the subject of the decision of 29 April 2008, in which the applicant was named as a victim of the inhuman treatment imputed to five generals.', '169. According to the Government, the main investigative measures carried out in the period between 1990 and 2009 were as follows: more than 840 interviews with injured parties; hearing of witnesses on more than 5,724 occasions; and more than 100 forensic medical reports. The results of those measures were set out in several thousand pages of documents.', '170. On 18 June 2001, when he was received by a prosecutor at the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice, Mr Stoica lodged an official complaint concerning the violence of which he claimed to have been victim on the night of 13 to 14 June 1990.', '171. His complaint was joined to the investigation file already opened in respect of other charges, especially inhuman treatment (case file no. 75/P/1998).', '172. On 18 October 2002, for the purposes of the investigation into the alleged assault against him, the applicant underwent an examination at the State Institute of Forensic Medicine, which produced a forensic medical report. That report indicated that the injuries described in the medical file opened by the emergency unit on 14 June 1990 had required three to five days of medical treatment and had not been such as to endanger the applicant’s life.', '173. It was also indicated that the applicant had been hospitalised for major epileptic fits from 31 October to 28 November 1990, in February 1997, March 2002 and August 2002, and that he had been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic secondary epilepsy and other cerebral and vascular disorders (transient ischemic attacks – TIAs). The expert report noted that the post-traumatic epilepsy had appeared following an injury sustained in 1966.', '174. On 9 and 17 May 2005 the applicant was questioned and was able to give his point of view on the events complained of and submit his claims for compensation in respect of the alleged pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage.', '175. By a letter of 23 May 2005, he was informed by the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Cassation and Justice that his complaint concerning the injuries inflicted on 13 June 1990 by unidentified servicemen, which had resulted in his hospitalisation “in a coma”, was being investigated in the context of case no. 75/P/1998.', '176. A certificate issued on 26 April 2006 indicates that, according to the entries in the register held by the military section of the prosecutor’s office at the High Court of Justice and Cassation, the applicant had been received by a prosecutor in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006, mainly for the purposes of the investigation or to enquire about progress in the investigation. The applicant lodged two additional complaints, on 12 September and 4 October 2006 respectively.', '177. On 23 April 2007 the prosecutor questioned two witnesses indicated by the applicant.', '178. When questioned on 9 May 2007 as an injured party, the applicant asked the military prosecutor to order a second forensic medical report, since he considered that the 2002 report had entirely failed to emphasise the seriousness of the injuries sustained in 1990 and the continuing after-effects of those injuries.', '179. The prosecutor ordered a new report. Among other things, he asked the forensic specialists to examine whether a causal link existed between the injury sustained by the applicant in June 1990 and the medical conditions from which he was suffering on the date on which the report was ordered.', '180. During his questioning, the applicant was invited to watch a video recording of the events of 13 June 1990, including those at the headquarters of the State television station. He recognised himself, and asked that the video recording be added to the investigation file.', '181. On 25 June 2007 the new medical report was added to the case file. It specified, again on the basis of the medical records drawn up on 14 June 1990, that the applicant’s injuries had required three to five days of medical treatment and that they had not been life-threatening. It specified that there was no causal link between the injuries sustained on the night of 13 to 14 June 1990 and the applicant’s medical problems, which had subsequently required numerous periods of hospitalisation.', '182. On 30 October 2007, at the applicant’s request, the medical observation files on his condition prepared by the emergency unit of Bucharest Hospital in 1992 were added to the file.', '183. The medical board at the National Social Security Fund had previously issued the applicant with a certificate, dated 24 May 2007, indicating that he was suffering from “overall accentuated impairment” resulting in total inability to work. The relevant passages of this certificate read as follows:', '“In view of the medical records in the patient’s file, the documents which have been added recently ... and the clinical psychiatric examination conducted on 24 May 2007, the specialist committee and the higher committee reach the following clinical diagnosis: mixed personality disorders, aggravated by organic causes. Acute traumatic brain injury 1990 (assault). Epilepsy with partial generalised secondary crises, confirmed clinically and by EEG, currently rare...., supraventricular incidents in his medical history (irregular heart rhythm (flutter) and atrioventricular block ..., with a return to sinus rhythm ... after cardioversion).', 'Functional diagnosis: overall accentuated impairment.', 'Fitness for work: totally lost, 2nd level invalidity.', 'Adaptive incapacity: 72%”', '184. In the meantime, on 10 May 2004 the prosecutor’s office at the Bucharest County Court had issued a decision not to bring a prosecution in another case, following a complaint of attempted murder lodged by the applicant on the basis of the same facts.', '185. On 9 July 1990 Bucharest military unit no. 02515 sent the applicant association a letter informing it that “an inventory of the items found on 14 June 1990 [at the association’s headquarters] [had] been drawn up by the representatives of the Procurator General’s Office (Procuratura Generală) and placed, with an official report, at the headquarters of the Bucharest Prosecutor’s Office (Procuratura Municipiului Bucureşti)”.', '186. On 22 July 1990 two police officers went to the applicant association’s headquarters. They noted that the windows had been broken and the locks destroyed, and that the items in the headquarters had “all been ransacked”. They drew up a report in the presence of the association’s leaders and a witness.', '187. On 26 July 1990 the applicant association lodged a criminal complaint with the Bucharest Prosecutor’s Office, complaining about the ransacking of its headquarters and the attacks sustained by some of its members on 14 June 1990, and demanded the restitution of all the materials and documents which had been confiscated. It requested leave to join the criminal proceedings as a civil party.', '188. On 22 October 1997 the General Inspectorate of Police sent the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice twenty-one case files, opened following criminal complaints by several individuals and legal entities with regard to the events of 13 and 14 June 1990. Those files included case file no. 1476/P/1990, which concerned the applicant association’s complaint regarding the ill-treatment inflicted on several of its members. The General Inspectorate of Police invited the prosecutor’s office to inform it of the steps to be taken with a view to conducting interviews for the purpose of the investigation.', '189. The applicant association contacted the prosecutor’s office at the Supreme Court of Justice, subsequently the High Court of Cassation and Justice, on a regular basis for information concerning progress in the investigation or to request additional investigative measures, until the investigation was closed by the decision of 17 June 2009 not to bring a prosecution.']","['2', '3', '6']","['2-1', '6-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Vidin. She is a member of the Board of Directors of the Animal Protection Society in Vidin. On 16 September 2002 she was authorised to represent the organisation before any and all institutions in Bulgaria in relation to its activities.', '7. On 11 April 2002 the applicant asked the mayor of Vidin for access to information about an agreement, concluded between the municipality and the municipal company “Cleanliness” EOOD, for the collecting of stray animals on the territory of Vidin municipality.', '8. The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of “Cleanliness” EOOD, considering that that was a statutory condition under section 31 (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. The head of “Cleanliness” EOOD refused to give consent on 28 May 2002. The mayor issued a decision on 4 June 2002 in which he refused to provide the applicant with access to the information she sought. The mayor referred to section 37 (1) (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000, which at the time listed the absence of a third interested party’s explicit written consent for the provision of information among the grounds for refusal to grant access to information.', '9. The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. The Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim on 27 June 2003, finding that the information sought did not affect the rights of “Cleanliness” EOOD and therefore section 37 (1) (2) was not applicable. The court accordingly ordered the mayor to provide the information to the applicant.', '10. Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment on 25 May 2004. It held that the information was of high public interest, the rights of third parties were not affected and the mayor’s decision denying access to information to the applicant was not reasoned.', '11. On 20 January 2003 the applicant again asked the mayor of Vidin for information. This time the information she sought concerned the annual statistics for 2001 and 2002 about animals held in an animal shelter called “Municipal Care”. In particular she asked how many animals were placed there, how many of them died or were put to death, and how much their care had cost the municipal budget.', '12. The mayor sought the explicit consent to that effect of the head of the public utilities company concerned, “Titan Sever” OOD, considering once again that that was a statutory condition under section 31 (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. In a letter of 10 February 2003 the head of “Titan Sever” OOD refused to give consent. On 14 February 2003 the mayor refused to provide the applicant with access to the information, referring to section 37 (1) (2) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000.', '13. The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. The Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim on 27 June 2003. It found that, if third parties objected to the provision of information concerning them, section 31 (4) of the Access to Public Information Act 2000 obliged the mayor to grant access to that information in a manner not disclosing the parts related to the third party. It then sent the case back to the municipality ordering it to provide the information to the applicant.', '14. Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court’s judgment on 25 May 2004. It held that the information was of high public interest, the rights of third parties were not concerned and that, even if they were, the information could be provided without disclosing the parts concerning the third parties. Finally, that court found that the mayor’s decision denying access to information to the applicant was not reasoned.', '15. On 17 June 2003 the applicant once again asked the mayor for information. The information concerned a public procurement procedure which had been organised by the mayor and aimed at reducing the number of stray dogs in Vidin. The applicant wanted to know the number of the organisations which had tendered for a contract with the municipality, which ones had passed the pre-selection stage, and - in respect of those who have - the following information: the type and number of qualified staff they employed; the infrastructure and facilities they had for humane catching and transportation of dogs; the proof they had presented for their capacity to deliver quality services; and, the price they asked for providing the services.', '16. On 1 July 2003 the mayor refused to provide that information in a reasoned decision. The explanation he gave was that the information requested concerned solely the participating candidates in that procurement procedure and their bids in accordance with the Public Procurement Act 2004; that it was of an economic nature; that it was related to the preparation of the mayor’s administrative actions in relation to the procurement procedure; and, that it had no significance of its own.', '17. The applicant brought court proceedings against the decision of the mayor refusing access to the information. On 10 December 2003 the Vidin Regional Court allowed the applicant’s claim and overturned the mayor’s refusal to provide the information sought. The court found that the information in question had not been classified, that the mayor’s decision was not issued within the statutory time-limit and that its content was not in conformity with the requirements of section 38 of the Access to Public Information Act 2000. The court sent the case back to the mayor, specifically ordering him to provide information to the applicant about the organisation which had won the municipal contract at the end of the public procurement procedure and the conditions of that contract.', '18. Following a cassation appeal by the mayor, on 20 October 2004 the Supreme Administrative Court partly upheld the lower court’s judgment. It quashed the judgment’s part which ordered the mayor to provide the applicant with information about the organisation which had won the municipal contract and the conditions of that contract. It held that the mayor had to provide the rest of the requested information.', '19. On 10 June 2004, referring to the two decisions of the Supreme Administrative Court of 25 May 2004 which concluded the proceedings in her first two requests for information, the applicant asked the mayor of Vidin to provide her with the information requested.', '20. On 10 December 2004, referring to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 20 October 2004 which concluded the proceedings in her third request for information, the applicant asked the mayor to provide her with the information requested.', '21. On 27 December 2004, the mayor refused in a written decision to provide the information sought by the applicant following the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment of 20 October 2004. In particular, he repeated the findings of the Supreme Administrative Court that he was not expected to provide information about the company which had won the municipal contract and remained silent in respect of the rest of the information he had been ordered to provide. It would appear that the mayor did not react to the applicant’s request for information following the two Supreme Administrative Court’s judgments of 25 May 2004.', '22. In a letter of 15 September 2010, the applicant informed the Court that there were no further developments and the information she sought had not been provided to her.']","['10', '13']",['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicants are a mother and child born in 1990 and 2012 respectively.', '8. On 16 January 2012 the first applicant, who was in the fifth month of pregnancy, was detained by the police on suspicion of robbery.', '9. On 26 January 2012 the Dzerzhynskyy District Court of Kharkiv (“the Dzerzhynskyy Court”) ordered her pre-trial detention as a preventive measure pending trial.', '10. On the same date she was placed in the Kharkiv SIZO.', '11. On 22 May 2012 the first applicant was taken to Kharkiv Maternity Hospital no. 7 (“the maternity hospital”).', '12. On the same date she gave birth to the second applicant. He measured 49 cm and weighed 2.9 kg.', '13. Three female security officers guarded the first applicant in the hospital. According to her, they stayed on the ward at all times. The Government submitted that they had left the ward during the delivery.', '14. The first applicant alleged she had been continuously shackled to her hospital bed or to a gynaecological examination chair, the only exception being during the delivery when the shackles had been removed. It is not clear from her submissions exactly how she had been shackled; on one occasion, she submitted that after the delivery she had had her foot shackled to the bed. At the same time, she submitted that the guards had only removed the shackles from her wrists for breastfeeding.', '15. According to the Government, the first applicant was never handcuffed or shackled in the maternity hospital.', '16. On 25 May 2012 the applicants were discharged.', '17. On 12 November 2012 the first applicant wrote in a statement for the SIZO administration (see paragraphs 41 and 76) that the maternity hospital staff had treated her well, that she had not been handcuffed or shackled, and that the two female security officers who had been on her ward had been helping her take care of the baby.', '18. In December 2012 and January 2013 the prosecution authorities questioned some maternity hospital staff and the security officers who had guarded the first applicant with a view to verifying her allegations, particularly as regards her shackling (see also paragraphs 76-82 below).', '19. On 21 December 2012 the chief doctor of the maternity hospital wrote to the governor of the Kharkiv SIZO, in reply to an enquiry by the latter, to say that during her stay in the maternity hospital the first applicant had been guarded by SIZO officers at all times, that the officers in question had not been on the delivery ward, and that the first applicant had not been handcuffed or shackled during the delivery.', '20. On 24 December 2012 the chief obstetrician, Ms Ti., gave a written statement to the prosecution authorities. She submitted that the first applicant had been shackled by the wrists to the gynaecological examination chair during her examinations both in the admissions unit and later in the obstetric unit, and that it was usual practice for detainees to be shackled and guarded by three guards.', '21. Two other obstetricians, Ms F. and Ms S., and a nurse, Ms To., made similar statements. Ms F. submitted that she could not remember any details regarding the second applicant’s delivery. Ms To. specified that the first applicant had not been shackled during the delivery or subsequently during breastfeeding.', '22. The chief doctor of the neonatal unit Ms Vl. also submitted that the first applicant had been shackled to a gynaecological examination chair. Furthermore, she indicated that two guards had been staying on the ward near the applicants, with a third near the door.', '23. The security officers who had guarded the first applicant denied that she had been handcuffed or shackled in hospital.', '24. The applicant’s lawyer enquired with a former nurse, Ms P., about the conditions faced by women in detention during delivery, with reference to her related work experience. On 7 February 2013 Ms P. wrote to him indicating that she had indeed worked as a nurse at Donetsk Regional Childcare and Maternal Health Centre from 1996 to 2005, and that in 2004 or 2005 a detained woman had been shackled to her bed during her baby’s delivery there.', '25. While the first applicant was held in several different cells in the SIZO, her application form referred only to the conditions of her detention with her baby in cell no. 408, in which she had been held from 14 March to 8 November 2012. The summary of facts below therefore only concerns that cell.', '26. The cell, situated in a semi-basement, was cold and damp. There was no hot water and only an irregular supply of cold water. The first applicant therefore rarely had the opportunity to take a shower and bath her new-born son. She also had to store cold water in plastic bottles for her own use. She boiled water on a defective electric cooker in a kettle, which she had to borrow from the administration and which was provided to her for no longer than fifteen minutes each time. The toilet and shower were in a niche not separated from the living area. The toilet was often blocked. There was no baby changing table or cot in the cell.', '27. The first applicant was not provided with any baby hygiene products. Nor did she receive nutrition suitable to her needs. On the days of court hearings her only meal was breakfast, which consisted of bread and tea. No packed lunches were provided to her.', '28. The applicants were able to have outdoor walks of about ten minutes per day, but not every day, in a communal walking area.', '29. Lastly, one of the inmates she shared with was HIV positive.', '30. Cell no. 408 was a high-comfort cell designed for pregnant women and women with children. It was located on the ground floor, measured fifty-two square metres and could accommodate up to six people. The first applicant shared it with two or sometimes three inmates.', '31. The cell had three windows measuring over eight square metres in total. There was hot and cold water, as well as a drinking water cooler with a capacity of ten litres.', '32. Furthermore, there were all the necessary furniture and facilities such as air conditioning, a refrigerator, an electric stove, a baby cot and a pram. There was also a supply of nappies and hygiene products. The toilet and shower were separated from the living area.', '33. The first applicant was provided with adequate nutrition in accordance with the applicable standards (the total energy value of her daily meals being 3,284 kilocalories). She received three hot meals per day with the exception of hearing days, when she missed lunch. She breastfed her son and refused the baby food provided by the SIZO. There were no restrictions on food or other parcels she received from her relatives.', '34. The applicants had a daily two-hour walk in a specially designated area.', '35. They never shared a cell with inmates with HIV.', '36. The Government provided four colour photographs of cell no. 408, showing a spacious and light room in a visually good state of repair. There were three large windows with sheer curtains. The cell had a washbasin. There was also a lavatory with a bidet and a shower cubicle, both separated from the living area by opaque glass doors. Also on the photographs were a wardrobe, two beds with bedside cabinets, a cot, a table with two stools, a baby stool, a shelf with some tableware, a microwave, a television and a baby changing table.', '37. Another photograph showed a walking area for detained mothers with babies, with a flowerbed and a wall with a nature mural. The first applicant and her baby were on the photograph, as well as another woman with a pram.', '38. On 1 and 2 February 2012 the local sanitary and epidemiological service inspected the SIZO in the context of an unspecified investigation. It observed that there was a special cell for women with babies, with all the essential amenities. It was noted in the report that there had been no pregnant inmates or inmates with babies in the SIZO at the time of the inspection.', '39. On 24 May 2012 the sanitary and epidemiological service also inspected the drinking water in the SIZO to check that it complied with the relevant standards. No irregularities were found.', '40. On 22 October 2012 the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office informed the Agent of the Government that there had been no complaints from the first applicant regarding the conditions of detention or the second applicant’s medical care in the SIZO.', '41. On 12 November 2012 the first applicant wrote a statement giving a detailed description of her cell in the SIZO similar to that submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 30-37 above). The last paragraph also concerned her stay in the maternity hospital (see paragraph 17 above).', '42. On 13 November 2012 one of the SIZO staff wrote to the State Prisons Service to say that the first applicant’s statement had been made freely.', '43. During her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO the first applicant received about thirty food parcels from her mother, often with basic foodstuffs such as bread, butter, tea, sugar and milk.', '44. The first applicant lodged numerous requests for release with the trial court dealing with her criminal case, subject to an undertaking not to abscond (dated 6 July, 6, 26 and 31 August, 3 September and 9 October 2012). She alleged, in particular, that the conditions in the SIZO were not adequate for her baby. The court rejected those requests.', '45. The applicants’ case received some media coverage. For example, in November 2012 the article “Baby as a victim of inhuman treatment” was published online by the Kharkiv Human Rights Group. In December 2012 a television programme was broadcast, in which the first applicant and the State authorities gave accounts, particularly as regards the conditions of the applicants’ detention in the SIZO. The parties did not submit to the Court a copy of the relevant article or video footage or a transcript of the television programme.', '46. On 12 December 2012 one of the detainees, Ms B., wrote a statement addressed to the head of the local department of the State Prisons Service. She submitted that in November 2012 she had been held in the same cell as the first applicant and had been satisfied with the conditions of detention there. It was noted in the statement that there had been large windows in the cell, a shower cubicle with hot and cold water and all the necessary furniture and appliances, including a refrigerator and a television.', '47. On 19 December 2012 the Kharkiv Regional Department of the State Prisons Service issued a memorandum stating that the first applicant had not submitted any complaints during her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO.', '48. The case file contains three statements by detainee Ms M. concerning the conditions of detention in the SIZO. She wrote two of them while detained there (on an unspecified date and on 25 December 2012), and a third on 30 January 2013 when she had already begun serving her prison sentence elsewhere. In the first two statements Ms M. described the conditions of her detention in cell no. 408 as quite satisfactory and comfortable. Her account was similar to that given by the Government (see paragraphs 30-32 above). The first two statements also contained critical remarks regarding the first applicant claiming, in particular, that she had displayed a careless attitude towards her baby and had acted in bad faith in applying to the Court. In her third statement, Ms M. stated that the food in the SIZO had been poor. More specifically, the bread had been stale and the meat had been tinged blue. She also submitted that there had been no hot water in cell no. 408. Lastly, she submitted that on two occasions she had witnessed the first applicant requesting medical care for her baby when he had had stomachache, but her requests had been ignored.', '49. On 28 December 2012 a former detainee, Ms Sa., wrote a statement for the first applicant’s lawyer and had it certified by a notary. She stated that she had shared cell no. 408 with the first applicant from an unspecified date in March to 19 April 2012. Ms Sa. had been pregnant at the time. She described the conditions of their detention as follows. The cell was located in a semi-basement and inmates saw practically no daylight. The windows were so high that they could not be opened without the assistance of a guard. There were about seven inmates in the cell, some of them with HIV and some suffering from other illnesses. The toilet was separated from the living area by a waist-high wall and leaked. As a result, there was always a bad smell. The shower also leaked and the cubicle door was broken. It was so humid in the cell that the plaster had fallen off the ceiling and the walls were covered in mould. The cell was infested with mice and lice. There were no household appliances like a kettle or microwave. Nor were there any beds or bedside cabinets as shown by the State Prisons Service on television (see paragraph 45 above). Ms Sa. specified that in fact none of the detainees had ever been held in the cell presented by the authorities on television. There was no hot water and the pressure in the cold water taps was so low that inmates had to store water for their own use. Furthermore, the SIZO administration did not provide them with any tableware. Their daily walk lasted only twenty minutes and took place in a small walking area covered with bars. Furthermore, according to Ms Sa., the food in the SIZO was neither fresh nor tasty. Lastly, she stated that she had been shackled to her bed when undergoing some treatment in the maternity hospital in Kharkiv while pregnant.', '50. On an unspecified date Ms Ve., who had also shared cell no. 408 with the first applicant (the exact period is unknown), wrote a statement about the conditions of detention there. Her description was similar to that given by Ms Sa. as regards the leaking toilet, high humidity levels, lack of hot water and irregular supply of cold water, as well as the duration and conditions of the daily outdoor walks and poor nutrition.', '51. On 25 May 2012 the applicants were discharged from the maternity hospital. The second applicant was found to be in good health.', '52. According to a letter from its chief doctor to the first applicant’s lawyer dated 12 December 2012, on 25 May 2012 the second applicant was transferred to Children’s Hospital no. 19 (“the children’s hospital”). All the other relevant documents in the case file indicate that on 25 May 2012 both applicants were taken to the Kharkiv SIZO.', '53. As submitted by the first applicant and noted in a letter by the chief doctor of the children’s hospital to the first applicant’s lawyer dated 6 September 2012, a paediatrician from that hospital had examined the second applicant on 28 May 2012. The baby was found to be in good health but to have phimosis (a condition of the penis where the foreskin cannot be fully retracted).', '54. However, according to the second applicant’s medical file kept by the SIZO, the first time a paediatrician of the children’s hospital examined him was on 31 May 2012. He was found to be in an adaptation period and the first applicant received advice regarding childcare.', '55. According to the second applicant’s medical file, on 12 June 2012 he was examined again by a paediatrician, who diagnosed him with intestinal colic and recommended Espumisan, massage, feeding on demand and outdoor walks. The doctor also suspected that the boy had a patent (open) foramen ovale (PFO; the foramen ovale allows blood circulation in the fetal heart and closes in most individuals at birth).', '56. The second applicant’s next medical examination appears to have taken place on 20 July 2012. It was noted in his medical file that the paediatrician had given advice to the first applicant regarding feeding and care.', '57. The first applicant denied that any of the examinations following that on 28 May 2012 had taken place. She alleged that her baby had not been examined by a paediatrician until 10 September 2012. She submitted that the records of her son’s earlier examinations in the medical file had been forged. According to her, the first page of that book referred to an examination on 10 September 2012, whereas the records of his earlier examinations had been written on separate pages and subsequently glued into the file. The case file as it stands before the Court contains a separate copy of each page of the file, which makes it impossible to verify the first applicant’s allegation.', '58. On 28 August 2012 the first applicant’s lawyer asked the Kharkiv SIZO administration to provide him with details of when the second applicant had been examined by a paediatrician and whether the conditions of detention had been appropriate for such a small baby. He also requested copies of the relevant documents.', '59. On 4 September 2012 the SIZO administration replied that it would be able to provide comprehensive information on the second applicant’s health after a complete medical examination in the children’s hospital, which was due to take place.', '60. On 31 August 2012 the first applicant asked the judge dealing with her case to order a medical examination of her son “given that the SIZO administration [was] ignoring her requests to that effect”. It appears that her request was rejected.', '61. On 6 September 2012 the chief doctor of the children’s hospital wrote to the first applicant’s lawyer in reply to an enquiry by him dated 5 September 2012. He said that with no paediatrician at the Kharkiv SIZO, a paediatrician from that hospital monitored babies born there. He also indicated that the second applicant had been examined by the hospital paediatrician on 28 May 2012 (see also paragraph 53 above). In so far as the lawyer enquired about the baby’s medical condition at the material time, the chief doctor stated that it was impossible to provide him with such information because the first applicant had not requested any medical care for him until then.', '62. On 10 September 2012 a dermatologist, cardiologist, ear, nose and throat specialist, neurologist and paediatrician all examined the second applicant. He was found to have allergic dermatitis, dysplastic cardiomyopathy and phimosis. Furthermore, the patent foramen ovale diagnosis had been called into question (see paragraph 55 above). The doctors concluded that the second applicant did not require any medical treatment, but recommended that the mother follow a hypoallergenic diet.', '63. According to the first applicant, the examination was carried out in the context of custody proceedings initiated by the second applicant’s stepfather. She specified that it had been done with her consent so that the second applicant could be taken from the SIZO, where he was not receiving adequate care.', '64. On 14 September 2012 the SIZO sent a copy of the second applicant’s medical file to the applicants’ representative, further to a request made by him on 28 August 2012 (see paragraph 58 above).', '65. On 18 October 2012 the chief doctor of the children’s hospital wrote to the first applicant’s lawyer, in reply to an enquiry made on 10 October 2012, to say that hospital was in charge of the medical supervision of children in the Kharkiv SIZO where needed, subject to the SIZO administration making the relevant application. It was also noted that the second applicant required an additional examination in the regional cardiology centre, and that the children’s hospital had already requested the SIZO administration’s cooperation in that regard.', '66. On 19 October 2012 a paediatrician and a cardiologist examined the second applicant again. He was diagnosed with a patent foramen ovale (a heart condition, see paragraph 55 above for further details) and an additional examination was recommended.', '67. On the same date the second applicant underwent an echocardiogram and was found to be healthy.', '68. On 14 November 2012 the first applicant refused to allow her son to undergo a paediatrician examination, which she had been offered.', '69. The following day the first applicant was released (see also paragraph 75 below).', '70. On 30 November 2012 the first applicant’s lawyer enquired with the children’s hospital whether it had kept a medical file in respect of the second applicant and whether he had been vaccinated during his stay with the first applicant in the SIZO.', '71. On 4 December 2012 the chief doctor replied that the children’s hospital provided medical care to children residing permanently in its catchment area. As regards children residing there temporarily, a written application by one of the parents was required. The first applicant had never submitted such an application. Accordingly, the hospital had not opened a medical file in respect of the second applicant. At the same time, its doctors had examined him when requested by the SIZO administration. The results of each examination had been reflected in the medical file provided by the SIZO. In so far as the second applicant’s vaccinations were concerned, it was noted that he had always been brought for examinations without his mother, and without her consent no vaccinations had been given.', '72. On 12 April, 17 May, 15 June, 2 and 31 August and 15 November 2012 the first applicant participated in court hearings, during which she was held in a metal cage. Her requests not to be placed in a cage were rejected.', '73. On 14 March 2013 the judge of the Dzerzhynskyy Court, who had been in charge of the first applicant’s case, wrote to the Agent of the Government, in reply to the latter’s request, to say that the first applicant had indeed been held in a metal cage in the courtroom during hearings. The judge emphasised that it was a legal requirement to place criminal defendants in a metal cage and there were no exceptions to this rule. Furthermore, he considered that allowing the first applicant to remain outside the cage in the courtroom would have been equal to her temporary release, contrary to the custodial preventive measure applied.', '74. On 15 March 2013 the Ministry of the Interior confirmed once again to the Agent of the Government that the first applicant had been held in a metal cage in the courtroom during hearings. It further specified that the second applicant had remained with the SIZO medical specialist outside the cage and had been passed to her for breastfeeding when requested.', '75. On 15 November 2012 the first applicant was released on an undertaking not to abscond.', '76. On 25 December 2012 she complained to the Kharkiv Regional Prosecutor’s Office that she had been shackled to her bed in the maternity hospital at all times, including during the delivery. She also complained that the conditions of detention and nutrition in the SIZO had been inadequate. Lastly, the first applicant alleged that the statement she had written on 12 November 2012 expressing her satisfaction with the conditions of detention had been made under psychological pressure (see paragraphs 17 and 41 above).', '77. On 27 December 2012 the State Prisons Service completed the internal investigation it had undertaken following the media coverage of the applicants’ case (see paragraph 45 above). The first applicant’s allegations were dismissed as unsubstantiated.', '78. On 2 January 2013 the first applicant complained to the Kharkiv Zhovtnevyy District Prosecutor’s Office (“the Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor’s Office”) that she had not been provided with adequate medical care during her pregnancy and the delivery; that she had been shackled by her wrists and feet to a gynaecological examination chair or her bed in the maternity hospital at all times, including during the delivery; that the conditions of her detention in the Kharkiv SIZO had been poor; and that neither she nor her baby had received adequate medical care there. On the same date her complaint was registered in the Integrated Register of Pre-trial Investigations and the investigation was started.', '79. On 18 January 2013 the Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor’s Office ordered a forensic medical examination of the case material with a view to establishing: (i) whether the first applicant had any injuries and, if so, how they had been caused; (ii) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the first applicant had been handcuffed or shackled between 26 January and 15 November 2012; (iii) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the Kharkiv SIZO; (iv) whether there was any forensic medical evidence that the applicants had not been provided with adequate or sufficient medical care in the maternity hospital; and (v) if the applicants had not received adequate or sufficient medical care, whether this had had any negative impact on their health.', '80. The aforementioned examination continued from 18 January to 26 March 2013. The answers in the report to all five questions were negative.', '81. On 1 April 2013 the Zhovtnevyy Prosecutor’s Office discontinued the criminal investigation for lack of evidence of a criminal offence.', '82. Also in April 2013 the State Prisons Service, following an enquiry by the Government’s Agent, undertook an internal investigation as regards the lawfulness of the second applicant’s detention in the SIZO. On 22 April 2013 it was completed, with the conclusion that there had been no violation. It was noted in the report that, although in August 2012 the first applicant had verbally expressed her intention to transfer the custody of her baby to her mother, she had later changed her mind as she had been breastfeeding.']",['3'],[],[],[],[],[],1

XXXVI of 2012 on Parliament.', '9. The Speaker proposed that the maximum fine as regards Mr Szilágyi (a third of his monthly remuneration) be applied, since he was an elected official of Parliament, not just an ordinary MP.', 'A decision approving the proposal of the Speaker was adopted by the plenary on 13 May 2013, without a debate.', '10.

The proposal stated that an increased fine was necessary, since similar, seriously disruptive conducts had occurred before.', 'The plenary adopted the proposal on 27 May 2013 without a debate.', '12.

It held in particular that the restrictions imposed on him for conduct falling under the above provisions – that is, “gravely offensive expression” – were in compliance with the Fundamental Law. His complaint in respect of section 49(4) was rejected because this provision, concerning “gravely offensive conduct”, was not applicable in that case.', 'The Constitutional Court went on to observe that there was no remedy available to that complainant against the measure.', 'Lastly, the Constitutional Court held that parliamentary disciplinary law concerned Parliament’s interior business and the MPs’ conduct as parliamentarians, rather than citizens’ rights or obligations; and that therefore no requirement of a remedy against a parliamentary disciplinary measure could be deduced from Article XXVIII(7) of the Fundamental Law.']","['10', '13']",['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

Counsel Sh. was appointed to represent him during investigation and trial.', '6. On 10 December 2004 the Astrakhan Regional Court held a preliminary trial hearing. The applicant opted for a jury trial.

On 8 March 2005 the court refused to appoint a lawyer referring to the relevant legal provisions that did not provide for a right to have a state-appointed lawyer before the appeal court.', '12. On 21 July 2005 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the judgment of 21 February 2005 on appeal. According to the official documents, the applicant was not provided with legal assistance.', '13. On 6 June 2007 the Presidium of the Supreme Court quashed the appeal judgment of 21 July 2005 by way of supervisory review. The court noted that the applicant had not been provided with legal assistance in the appeal proceedings and remitted the matter for fresh consideration to the appeal court. The applicant did not attend the hearing. He was represented by counsel O.', '14. On an unspecified date the applicant was transferred to Moscow. Counsel R. was appointed to represent him. From 1 to 3 August 2007 R. studied the case-file. On 7 and 14 August 2004 he met with the applicant at the remand prison.', '15. On an unspecified date the applicant submitted a revised statement of appeal.', '16. On 16 August 2007 the Supreme Court held a new appeal hearing. According to the applicant, he participated in the hearing by means of a video link. R. was present in the courtroom. He did not submit a statement of appeal and made oral submissions to the court. Having examined the applicant’s appeal, the court upheld, in substance, his conviction. The court also dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant’s complaint about the alleged ineffectiveness of the legal assistance provided by counsel Sh. In this connection, the court noted that the applicant had consented to be represented by Sh. both during the investigation and trial. The court also concluded, on the basis of the trial record, that Sh. had taken an active part in the trial. In his closing argument, Sh. had supported the applicant’s non-guilty plea and argued that the applicant had not been proved guilty. Lastly, the court took into account that, prior to the jury verdict, the applicant had not complained about the quality of the defence provided by Sh.', '17. On 18 August 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s supervisory review complaint against the judgment of 16 August 2007.']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],[],[],[],1

POLAND,4,Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-1 - Reasonable time),Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Päivi Hirvelä;Zdravka Kalaydjieva,"['5. The applicant was born in 1967 and is currently detained in Łódź Remand Centre.', '6. On 29 November 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of committing a number of offences in an armed organised criminal group.', '7. On 6 December 2006 the Łódź District Court (Sąd Rejonowy) remanded the applicant in custody until 28 February 2007. The court relied on a strong suspicion that the applicant had committed the offences he had been accused of. The risk of the applicant fleeing was also taken into account as a ‘wanted’ notice (list gończy) against him had been issued in October 2006. At that time he had not been residing at his permanent address and his whereabouts had not been established. The court further anticipated a heavy prison sentence to be imposed on the applicant if convicted.', '8. The applicant’s pre-trial detention was extended by the Łódź Regional Court (Sąd Okręgowy) on 27 February 2007, 26 June 2007 and on 19 September 2007. Subsequently, it was extended by the Łódź Court of Appeal (Sąd Apelacyjny) on 21 November 2007, 19 December 2007, 28 March 2008, 18 June 2008, 22 October 2008 and on 23 December 2008.', 'In their decisions to extend the applicant’s pre-trial detention the courts relied on a reasonable suspicion, supported by evidence given by witnesses and other members of the criminal group, that the applicant had committed the offences in question. The courts further emphasised the risk of the applicant fleeing or obstructing the proceedings and the likelihood of a heavy prison sentence being imposed on him if convicted. The domestic courts attached importance to the complex character of the case, to the complex structure of the criminal group and the number of suspects involved and the necessity of collecting additional evidence for the inclusion in the already voluminous case file.', '9. On 18 March 2009 the State Prosecutor (Prokurator Krajowy) lodged a bill of indictment against the applicant with the Łódź Regional Court. The applicant was charged with several counts of extortion and drug-trafficking committed in an organised and armed criminal group. The bill of indictment comprised 94 charges brought against 28 defendants. The prosecution authorities requested that 318 witnesses be heard before the court.', '10. On 30 March 2009 the Łódź Court of Appeal extended the applicant’s detention on remand until 31 December 2009. Subsequently, the same court ordered prolongation of his detention on 21 December 2009 (detention extended until 30 September 2010), on 22 September 2010 (detention extended until 31 March 2011) and on 23 March 2011 (detention extended until 30 September 2011). The applicant lodged a number of motions to be released as well as appeals against the decisions extending his pre-trial detention, all in vain.', 'In their decisions the courts repeated the grounds previously given for the applicant’s detention.', '11. Meanwhile, the court scheduled fifteen hearings for November and December 2009. Due to sick-leaves of the presiding judge and of some of the accused those hearings did not take place.', '12. The trial was eventually opened on 18 January 2010. Subsequent scheduled hearings were adjourned due to absences of some of the coaccused and due to problems with sound system in the court room.', '13. In May 2010 the Regional Court gave a severance order and decided to determine charges against two co-accused separately.', '14. The bill of indictment was only finally read out to the defendants at the hearing held on 27 May 2010.', '15. At the hearing of 28 May 2010 the Regional Court started taking evidence from the accused. It subsequently held fourteen hearings until the end of 2010, during which some of the accused gave evidence. Five of the scheduled hearings were adjourned due to sick-leaves of the accused. One hearing was adjourned because of the motion for disqualification of the judge lodged by one of the co-accused.', '16. In 2011 the Regional Court continued taking evidence from the defendants. Of the twenty nine hearings scheduled for this year, eleven took place. The trial court adjourned fifteen hearings due to justified absences of the parties, three hearings were cancelled due to sick-leaves of the presiding judge and the lay judges.', '17. Meanwhile, on 17 August 2011 the Łódź Regional Court ordered that the applicant’s detention on remand be lifted on condition that he paid the bail in the sum of 20,000 Polish zlotys (PLN) within the period of two weeks from the date of the decision.', 'On the same date the applicant was released on bail and police supervision. He was also prohibited from leaving the country.', '18. The Regional Court scheduled twenty hearings for 2012, of which six hearings were eventually held. At the hearing of 16 April 2012 the trial court started taking evidence from witnesses.', 'Of the fourteen hearings cancelled this year, two were adjourned because of a sick-leave of the presiding judge, three because of absences of witnesses, and the remaining nine hearings – because of absences of the parties.', '19. Until 30 July 2013 the Regional Court scheduled nine hearings for 2013, of which seven were adjourned due to justified absences of the defendants.', '20. The criminal proceedings against the applicant are still pending before the first-instance court.', '21. On 27 April 2011 the applicant lodged a complaint with the Łódź Court of Appeal under the Law of 17 June 2004 on complaints about a breach of the right to a trial within a reasonable time (ustawa o skardze na naruszenie prawa strony do rozpoznania sprawy w postępowaniu przygotowawczym prowadzonym lub nadzorowanym przez prokuratora i postępowaniu sądowym bez nieuzasadnionej zwłoki – “the 2004 Act”). He sought a finding that the length of the criminal proceedings against him had been excessive and PLN 20,000 in compensation.', '22. On 27 July 2011 the Łódź Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The court found that, considering the complexity of the case and the number of co-accused who had actively tried to obstruct the proceedings, the Łódź Regional Court had conducted the proceedings in a correct and timely manner. Consequently, the appellate court refused to award the applicant compensation.']",['6'],['6-1'],[],[],[],[],1

E.R. reported the incident to the police on the same day.', '9. On 8 January 2011 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant by the Nasimi District Police Office under Article 221.3 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.

On 10 January 2011 the applicant was charged under Articles 127.2.3 (deliberate infliction of less serious injury to health) and 221.3 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code.', '12. On the same day the Nasimi District Court, relying on the charges brought against the applicant and an application from the prosecutor to apply the preventive measure of remanding the applicant in custody, ordered his detention pending trial for a period of two months. The court justified the application of the preventive custodial measure by the gravity of the offences imputed to him, the risk of his reoffending and the likelihood that he might abscond if released.', '13. On 12 January 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision, stating that there was no justification for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody and that the court had failed to substantiate the necessity for his detention pending trial. He also submitted that the court had failed to take account of his personal situation and to consider the possibility of another preventive measure, such as house arrest or release on bail.', '14. On 17 January 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that there were no grounds to quash the first-instance decision.', '15. On 2 March 2011 the prosecutor in charge of the criminal case applied to the court for an extension of the applicant’s pre-trial detention for a period of one month. He submitted that more time was needed to complete the investigation.', '16. On 3 March 2011 the Nasimi District Court extended the applicant’s detention pending trial by one month, until 8 April 2011. The court justified its decision by the need for more time to carry out further investigative actions, the complexity of the criminal case and the likelihood that the applicant might abscond and obstruct the investigation if released.', '17. On 4 March 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision, arguing that the first-instance court had failed to substantiate its decision on his continued detention.', '18. On 9 March 2011 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the Nasimi District Court’s decision of 3 March 2011.', '19. No further extension decisions are available in the case file.', '20.

In July and August 2011 the police opened four criminal investigations into three incidents of theft and an incident of robbery. On 29 August 2011 these investigations were joined.', '8. On 12 August 2011 the police arrested the applicant on suspicion of robbery. He was held in custody on this basis until 14 August 2011, when he was placed under arrest on suspicion of theft.', '9. On 15 August 2011 the police lodged an application with the Ludza District Court (Ludzas rajona tiesa) for the applicant’s pre-trial detention in relation to the theft investigation.', '10. On 16 August 2011 an investigating judge granted the application. With regard to the suspicion of theft, he reasoned as follows:', '“there are reasons to suspect that [the applicant] has committed the crime under section 175(3) of the Criminal Law (Krimināllikums) [theft] ... These suspicions are confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.”', '11. On 18 August 2011 the applicant appealed against that decision.', '12. On 2 September 2011 the Latgale Regional Court (Latgales apgabaltiesa) dismissed the appeal. With regard to the suspicion of theft, the judge stated:', '“The ... suspicion that [the applicant] has committed the crime ... is confirmed by the information contained in the file.”', '13. No appeal lay against the aforementioned decision.', '14. On 19 September 2011 the public prosecutor charged the applicant with robbery, theft, involving a minor in theft and petty theft on the basis of the facts as alleged.', '15. On 26 September 2011 the applicant familiarised himself with the case material.', '16. On 28 September 2011 the prosecutor transferred the case to the Ludza District Court for adjudication. She set out the case against the applicant and detailed the evidence upon which the prosecution intended to rely.', '17. On 17 October 2011 the investigating judge decided to keep the applicant in detention. He gave the following reasoning:', '“the accusation against [the applicant] of the crimes under sections 175(3) [theft], 176(2) [robbery], 180(2) [petty theft] and 172 [involving a minor in theft] of the Criminal Law ... is confirmed by the evidence gathered in the criminal case.”', '18.

The applicant was born in 1951 and lives in Nova Kakhovka.', '6. On 4 July 2001 the applicant’s wife, Mrs Yelena Fukleva, was admitted to the gynaecological ward of the Kherson Regional Clinical Hospital (Херсонська обласна клінична лікарня – “the hospital”) with metrofibroma. An operation was scheduled for 5 July 2001. According to the medical file, she signed a written consent to undergo the operation. On that date she underwent an unsuccessful intubation of the trachea for the purpose of anesthetisation. The operation was therefore postponed to 9 July 2001. The applicant’s wife was discharged until that date.', '7. On 9 July 2001 the applicant’s wife underwent an operation for metrofibroma in the hospital. According to the medical file, she signed a written consent to undergo that operation.', '8. After the operation her condition started to deteriorate rapidly.', '9. On 15 July 2001 a panel of doctors found that the applicant’s wife was suffering from post-operative peritonitis. Although she was then treated for peritonitis, she died of peritonitis and sepsis on 18 July 2001.', '10. An autopsy was carried out shortly after her death and confirmed that Mrs Fukleva had died of post-operative peritonitis complicated by sepsis.', '11. Following the incident, the local health-care authorities set up a commission consisting of three members to investigate the quality of the medical treatment provided to the applicant’s wife by the hospital. Having examined the case, the commission found that the medical staff had committed no errors which could have aggravated the patient’s state of health or accelerated her death. The commission concluded that the patient’s death had not been caused by the medical staff.', '12. On 8 August 2001 the hospital commission examined the case and found that the surgical treatment had been carried out correctly; that post-surgical treatment had been fully provided to the patient; and that, despite appropriate treatment, the fatal outcome had been inevitable.', '13. Following a complaint by the applicant, on 7 September 2001 the Ministry of Health set up a commission to investigate the adequacy of Mrs Fukleva’s treatment at the hospital.', '14. The ministerial commission found that (i) the applicant’s wife had not been properly prepared for the planned operation and had been operated on urgently on 9 July 2001; (ii) the antibacterial and infusion treatment for the peritonitis and sepsis had been insufficient; (iii) the peritonitis had developed due to the decline of the patient’s immune system; and (iv) the difficulties in the early diagnosis of the peritonitis had been caused by the vague clinical symptomatology (namely, subdiaphragmatic and subhepatic abscesses) and, as a result, a relaparotomy had been conducted only on the sixth day.', '15. On 24 September 2001 the Health Department of the Kherson Region State Administration (“the Health Department”), having regard to the conclusions of the ministerial commission, ordered that (i) an inspection of the gynaecological ward of the hospital be carried out; (ii) the obstetrician-gynaecologist S. undergo training on the medical treatment for sepsis in obstetrics and gynaecology; and (iii) the case of the applicant’s wife be discussed at the meeting of the regional association of obstetrician-gynaecologists.', '16. In a letter of 8 October 2001 the Ministry of Health recommended to the Health Department that it consider disciplinary measures in respect of the doctors involved in the treatment of the applicant’s wife, and advised an early reassessment of the doctors by the qualification commission as to their suitability for the categories that had been granted to them. The Ministry noted that the ministerial commission had found substantial errors in the treatment of the applicant’s wife. The Ministry specified that the death of the applicant’s wife had been caused by the aftereffects of the operation performed on 9 July 2001 in the hospital; the medical file suggested that on 5 July 2001 the patient had not undergone the necessary supplementary examinations and had not been provided with antianaemic treatment; after the unsuccessful anesthetisation procedure on 5 July 2001 the patient had been discharged from the hospital, a measure that had been contraindicated; on 9 July 2001 the patient had been operated upon without having been tested for the most important indicators of homeostasis and correction of anaemic status; the peritonitis had been diagnosed and treated too late; and during the post-operative period the antibacterial and infusion therapy had been insufficient and the antianaemic treatment miserable. The Ministry concluded that the medical treatment afforded to the applicant’s wife had been unsatisfactory.', '17. On 30 October 2001 the Health Department informed the Ministry of Health that a thorough inspection of the gynaecological ward of the hospital had been carried out and that it had not revealed any substantial deficiencies in the functioning of the ward. However, the head of the ward had been reprimanded. As to the doctors who had treated the applicant’s wife, it was noted that they would be sent for an extraordinary assessment by the qualification commission. The Health Department further noted that the doctor who had been in charge of the applicant’s wife had resigned of his own volition.', '18. On 30 November 2001 the Health Department informed the applicant that the circumstances of his wife’s death had been investigated by the health-care institutions and that it had not been found that his wife had been provided with inappropriate medical treatment.', '19. On 27 July 2001 the Suvorivsky District Prosecutor’s Office of Kherson (“the District Prosecutor’s Office”) decided not to institute criminal proceedings, finding, in the light of the results of the autopsy and the medical specialists’ opinions, that there had been no element of criminal negligence in the conduct of the medical staff.', '20. On 1 August 2001, at the applicant’s request, the Kherson Regional Prosecutor’s Office (“the Regional Prosecutor’s Office”) quashed that decision as unfounded and ordered further pre-investigation enquiries.', '21. On 22 August 2001 the District Prosecutor’s Office decided not to institute criminal proceedings, finding that the death of the applicant’s wife had not resulted from the actions of the medical staff.', '22. On 18 September 2001 the Regional Prosecutor’s Office, at the applicant’s request, quashed the decision of 22 August 2001 on the ground that the pre-investigation enquiries had been inadequate. It noted in particular that the file did not contain any final conclusions with regard to the cause of the applicant’s wife’s death, the reasons for the development of the peritonitis or the adequacy of the medical treatment. The Regional Prosecutor’s Office further noted that the impugned decision had been based essentially on the statements of the medical staff whose actions had been complained of, while the other specialists, as well as the applicant and his relatives, had not been questioned. It therefore instituted criminal proceedings for medical malpractice and remitted the case to the District Prosecutor’s Office for the investigation.', '23. On 24 September 2001 the investigator ordered a forensic expert opinion on the quality of the medical treatment provided to the applicant’s wife. In reply, the Bureau of Forensic Medical Examinations at the Mykolayiv Regional Health Department provided a report suggesting that the applicant’s wife had been properly treated in the hospital.', '24. On 1 October 2001 the applicant was granted the status of victim in the criminal proceedings.', '25. On 3 January 2002 the District Prosecutor’s Office, having obtained further evidence, decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings into the death of the applicant’s wife on the ground that there had been no corpus delicti in the conduct of the medical staff. The applicant challenged that decision in court.', '26. On 31 January 2002 the Suvorovsky District Court of Kherson (“the District Court”) quashed the decision of 3 January 2002 as unfounded and ordered a further investigation. The District Court noted that it was necessary to investigate allegations of forgery in respect of the medical file and, in particular, in relation to the signature of the applicant’s wife indicating her consent to the operation of 9 July 2001. It also found it necessary to question witnesses, and to take other measures.', '27. On 26 March 2002 the Kherson Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) quashed the District Court’s decision of 31 January 2002 as unfounded and remitted the case to the District Court for fresh consideration.', '28. On 28 August 2002 the District Court upheld the decision of 3 January 2002 discontinuing the criminal investigation. It considered that the District Prosecutor’s decision was well founded and supported by the available evidence. The applicant appealed.', '29. On 12 November 2002 the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of 28 August 2002. The applicant appealed on points of law to the Supreme Court.', '30. On 19 December 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as inadmissible.', '31. On 11 March 2003, following a complaint by the applicant, the General Prosecutor’s Office quashed the District Prosecutor’s decision of 3 January 2002 and ordered a further investigation, noting that additional measures had to be taken in order to determine all the relevant circumstances in the case. In particular, it had to be determined whether or not the signatures of the applicant’s wife had been forged in her medical file, certain pieces of evidence had to be enclosed in the investigation file, and contradictions in the medical evidence had to be resolved.', '32. On 29 October 2003 the Main Bureau of Forensic Medical Examinations at the Ministry of Health issued a report concluding, inter alia, that the applicant’s wife had been properly and fully diagnosed in the gynaecological ward of the hospital; it had been necessary to operate on the applicant’s wife; however, she should have undergone supplementary examinations and measures to control the bleeding should have been taken; the correct surgical method had been chosen and the operation had been conducted correctly. According to the report, the death of the applicant’s wife had been caused by several factors: (i) a weak immune system which had led to the development of post-operative peritonitis; (ii) the failure by the gynaecologists to use all possible means to control the bleeding without resorting to urgent surgical intervention; and (iii) belated treatment for the peritonitis. It was specified that if the peritonitis had been diagnosed and treated in time it was possible that the patient’s life would have been saved.', '33. On 3 January 2004 the investigator ordered an additional forensic medical examination, finding that the report of 29 October 2003 was incomplete and contradictory.', '34. On 31 March 2005 the Main Bureau of Forensic Medical Examinations at the Ministry of Health issued another report concluding, inter alia, that the applicant’s wife’s death had been caused by several factors, including the gravity of the pathology, the patient’s obesity, which had diminished her immunity and contributed to the development of post-operative complications, and the shortcomings in the medical treatment of the patient. It concluded that there was an “indirect relationship” between the shortcomings in the medical treatment in the gynaecological ward of the hospital and the death of the patient.', '35. On 11 July 2005 the senior investigator of the Regional Prosecutor’s Office discontinued the criminal proceedings for lack of corpus delicti in the conduct of the medical staff. He found that the death of the applicant’s wife had been caused by the cumulative effect of several factors and it could not be argued that there was a direct relationship between the shortcomings in the medical treatment and the fatal outcome.', '36. On 5 August 2005 the Deputy Prosecutor of the Kherson Region quashed the decision of 11 July 2005 as unfounded and ordered a further investigation. He specified that additional measures were necessary to investigate the cause of the applicant’s wife’s death and the alleged forgery of her signatures in the medical file.', '37. In the course of the subsequent proceedings, the investigator ordered further expert inquiries on various aspects of the treatment of applicant’s wife. Apart from these issues, the experts concluded that the signatures in the medical file were indeed those of the applicant’s wife.', '38. On 11 October 2007 the Regional Prosecutor’s Office decided to discontinue the criminal proceedings into the death of the applicant’s wife on the ground that there had been no corpus delicti in the conduct of the medical staff. On the basis of the expert examination reports and other evidence, the investigator found that the death of the applicant’s wife had been caused by the cumulative effect of several factors, including shortcomings in the medical treatment in the gynaecological ward of the hospital; however, there was no direct causal link between those shortcomings and the death of the patient.', '39. At the material time the applicant owned a shop in Nova Kakhovka.', '40. On 2 October 2003 a tax police squad visited the applicant’s shop in order to carry out an unscheduled inspection due to the applicant’s alleged failure to submit tax returns.', '41. The inspection was not conducted, as the applicant, his relatives and his employees prevented the officers from accessing the store’s tax records. It led to a fracas.', '42. As was later established by the investigation, at some point the applicant switched off the light and one of the employees screamed that she had been punched in her face by tax officer K. This escalated the scuffle and K. tried to leave the scene in his car. The applicant tried to prevent K. from leaving and jumped on the bonnet of the car, then broke a side window and tried to pull officer K. out of the car.', '43. According to the applicant, during the incident he was injured by the officers.', '44. On 3 October 2003 the applicant lodged a complaint with the law-enforcement authorities, arguing that on 2 October 2003 he had been ill-treated by the tax police.', '45. On the same day the applicant was examined by a doctor, who documented injuries on the applicant’s forearm and lip.', '46. On 15 October 2003 a forensic medical expert, relying on the results of the medical examination of 3 October 2003, reported that the applicant had sustained numerous scratches to the right forearm and a bruise to the lower lip. The expert classified the injuries as light and stated that they could have been sustained on 2 October 2003.', '47. On 27 October 2003 the investigator of Nova Kakhovka Prosecutor’s Office (“the Town Prosecutor’s Office”) decided not to open criminal proceedings against the officers as their conduct did not disclose any elements of a criminal offence. He found that the scratches on the applicant’s forearm had been caused by the applicant himself, when he had attempted to pull the officer out of the car through the broken window. Similarly, the bruise on his lip could have been caused by the applicant himself at any time during the incident, including the moment when he had jumped on or off the car or broken the window. No evidence had been found which suggested that the bruise had been inflicted by the officers.', '48. On 11 February 2004, at the applicant’s request, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office quashed the decision of 27 October 2003, finding that further enquiries were necessary. In particular, the Regional Prosecutor’s Office instructed the investigator to question the applicant and officer K.', '49. Subsequently, in the course of additional enquiries on 4 March, 7 June, 4 and 30 December 2004 and 16 December 2005, the investigator of the Town Prosecutor’s Office decided not to institute criminal proceedings for similar reasons to those set out in the decision of 27 October 2003. Those decisions were quashed by the supervising authorities and additional measures were ordered.', '50. On 2 February 2006 the Deputy Prosecutor of Nova Kakhovka refused to open criminal proceedings against the officers, finding that their conduct disclosed no elements of a criminal offence. On the basis of the additional evidence gathered, he gave similar reasons for that decision to those set out in the decision of 27 October 2003.']",['2'],['2-1'],[],[],[],[],1

The applicant, Ms Gazal Dülek, is a Turkish national who was born in 1979 and lives in Istanbul. She is represented before the Court by Ms G. Tuncer, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.', '5. On 25 April 2000 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation, namely the PKK.', '6. On 26 April 2000 she was arrested for interrogation at the AntiTerrorism Branch of the Istanbul Security Directorate (“the Anti-Terrorism Branch”). In her statement, taken in the absence of a lawyer, the applicant declared that she had worked as a secretary at a local branch of HADEP for approximately five months and that she had been a member of the youth branch of HADEP since 1999. She also admitted that she was a member of the PKK, that on one occasion she had hidden a bomb in her house upon the request of another PKK member, that she had assisted in sending a number of persons to PKK camps in eastern Turkey and Iran and that she had acted as a messenger for some PKK members detained at the Ümraniye prison. The applicant duly signed her statement.', '7. At 11.20 a.m. on 30 April 2000 the applicant was examined by a doctor, who stated that there were no traces of ill-treatment on her body.', '8. Subsequently, on the same day, the applicant was brought before the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court, again in the absence of a lawyer. The applicant alleged that at the Anti-Terrorism Branch, she had been forced to sign a statement which had been prepared by the police officers and stated that she did not even know the content of the statement. When her police statement was read out to her, she denied any involvement in the activities mentioned therein, apart from her membership of the youth branch of HADEP and her work experience there.', '9. On the same day, the applicant was further interrogated by a single judge at the Istanbul State Security Court, in the absence of a lawyer. She denied all the accusations against her, reiterating the statement she had made before the public prosecutor. At the end of the questioning, the judge ordered her pre-trial detention.', '10. On 4 May 2000 the Public Prosecutor at the Istanbul State Security Court filed an indictment with that court against the applicant and four other persons, accusing the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation under Article 168 (2) of the former Criminal Code (Law no. 765).', '11. On 7 August 2000 the Istanbul State Security Court, composed of three civilian judges, held its first hearing. The applicant made her defence statement at the fourth hearing held on 18 April 2001, and denied all the charges against her. The applicant also denied her police statement, alleging that she had been forced to sign it without knowing its content. At the end of the hearing the Istanbul State Security Court ordered the applicant’s release.', '12. On 3 September 2003 the Istanbul State Security Court convicted the applicant under Article 169 of the former Criminal Code of aiding and abetting an illegal organisation. Accordingly it sentenced her to three years and nine months’ imprisonment. In convicting her, the State Security Court mainly relied on the applicant’s police statement, and the statements made by her co-defendants.', '13. On 19 October 2004 the Court of Cassation quashed the judgment of the Istanbul State Security Court.', '14. In the meantime, by Law no. 5190 of 16 June 2004, published in the Official Gazette on 30 June 2004, State Security Courts were abolished. The case against the applicant was accordingly transferred to the Istanbul Assize Court.', '15. On 14 April 2008 the Istanbul Assize Court convicted the applicant of membership of an illegal organisation under Article 314 (2) of the new Criminal Code (Law no. 5237) based on the evidence in the file and sentenced her to six years and three months’ imprisonment.', '16. On 27 October 2009 the Court of Cassation upheld the judgment of the first-instance court.

The applicant, Ms Dana Ruxanda Atudorei, is a Romanian national who was born in 1984 and lives in Bucharest.', '6. In her initial letter to the Court, the applicant stated that from an early age she had been subjected to repeated physical and psychological abuse by her family. Her parents, especially her mother, had been aggressive towards her both verbally and physically, had refused to allow her to go anywhere unsupervised and had taken her to a psychologist because she had not achieved the highest possible marks when she was in second grade. In addition, her parents’ abuse had continued after they discovered that she had been attending weekly yoga classes organised by the Movement for Spiritual Integration into the Absolute (Mişcarea pentru Integrare Spirituală în Absolut – “MISA”).', '7. According to some reports, including an Amnesty International report of 27 May 1997 (AI Index EUR 39/03/97), from 1995 there had been several accounts of alleged police abuse of individuals who practised yoga and who were members of MISA. The reports noted that the authorities seemed to condone public intolerance of MISA as they perceived the leader of the organisation as an individual who urged his sympathisers to leave their way of life in order to pursue a communal life and to practice sexual perversion.', '8. In March 2004 a large-scale negative press campaign and police operation targeted MISA. The leader and some members of the organisation faced criminal investigation for the alleged sexual corruption of minors. MISA’s leader left the country for Sweden. In 2005 the Swedish authorities refused an extradition request by the Romanian authorities.', '9. On 30 July 2003 the applicant, who was of full legal age, was hospitalised in the Socola Psychiatric Hospital. According to her, she was taken to the said hospital by her parents against her will after they had discovered that she was attending yoga classes.', '10. The medical reports produced by the said hospital stated that it was the first time the patient had been admitted to the Socola Hospital, and that she had been admitted at her mother’s request because of anxious and negative behaviour, irritability, a tendency to cry easily and depression, which were a reaction to psychological trauma, in particular a conflict with her parents. She was diagnosed with reactive depression and anxiety. The applicant’s condition had improved after group psychotherapy. She had been recommended medical treatment, psychotherapy and been advised to avoid psychotraumatic situations.', '11. Her hospitalisation ended on 8 August 2003.', '12. On 19 January 2005 the applicant travelled to her hometown, Bârlad, accompanied by M.A., her fiancé, in order to obtain a copy of her birth certificate, which she needed inter alia for her marriage to M.A.', '13. While she was in the building housing the register office (Oficiul de Stare Civilă), her family appeared and surrounded her.', '14. According to the applicant, her mother convinced her to go outside and talk to them before applying for her birth certificate. Once outside the building, her family became aggressive. After they pushed M.A. to the ground, they forced her into a vehicle and drove her to her grandparents’ house. Once there, her family took away her regular clothes and replaced them with old clothes and slippers. They also took away her money and identity papers. In addition, she was kept indoors continuously, supervised, threatened and psychologically pressured by them.', '15. On 21 January 2005 Dr F., a general practitioner, referred the applicant to a psychiatric hospital with a diagnosis of schizo-paranoid behavioural disorder (tulburare de comportament de tip schizoparanoidă). There is no evidence in the file if Dr F. assessed the applicant prior to the drafting of the referral note, or on how the diagnosis was established.', '16. On 3 February 2005 the applicant’s parents took her to the Nifon Unit of the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital. According to the hospital’s public webpage, it is located in a forest 25 kilometres from the town of Buzău and can be reached only by private car or minibus.', '17. On the same date, the applicant’s mother signed an informed consent form provided by the hospital on behalf of the applicant, acknowledging that she had read, understood and had time to consider all the information in the leaflet entitled “Information on Clozapin (Leponex) for patients and their families” (Informații despre Clozapin pentru pacienți si familii), that all her questions had been answered adequately and she had clarified any unknown words with the doctor or a member of the medical team, and that she was willing to accept the risks of the treatment.', '18. The applicant’s mother was admitted to the hospital together with the applicant and remained there for the first five weeks of the latter’s hospitalisation.', '19. According to a clinical observation paper on the applicant produced by the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital, she had been hospitalised on the basis of Dr F.’s referral and diagnosis. The diagnosis on the day of hospitalisation had been “evolving borderline [disorder]” (borderline ȋn evoluție). That diagnosis remained unchanged during her hospitalisation and on the day of her discharge. During her hospitalisation the applicant was given psychotropic drug treatment which included Leponex. Her condition and progress were regularly monitored. She repeatedly suffered from, inter alia, constipation, lack of insight, lack of communication and drowsiness. She also presented a risk of orthostatic hypertension, which was monitored. In addition, on 4 March 2005 she “mentioned discharge” (aminteşte despre externare).', '20. On 11 March 2005 the Vaslui Police Department informed M.A. that, inter alia, the applicant had been admitted to a specialised medical clinic for treatment and that the doctors had prohibited any contact with her during the full course of treatment.', '21. On 16 March 2005 the applicant signed a written statement to the effect that she refused to allow the disclosure of the information in her observation paper.', '22. The applicant was discharged from hospital on 1 April 2005.', '23. On 24 August 2005, following an enquiry by Dr F., Dr I. agreed that the applicant was fit to enrol at a university.', '24. On 16 October 2010 the management of the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital informed the Government that according to Dr I. the applicant’s hospitalisation had been voluntary. On account of the applicant’s clinical condition, the informed consent form had been signed by the applicant’s mother on her behalf. The applicant could have left the hospital at any time. The hospital was located in the middle of a forest but had no fence or guards. The applicant had had access to two mobile phones and two landline phones. She had not been guarded at any time during her hospitalisation because the Nifon Unit of the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital was not designed for forced hospitalisation and was used only for voluntary hospitalisations. The informed consent form signed by the applicant’s mother had amounted to an agreement to both hospitalisation and treatment because at that time, that is, on 3 February 2005, a standardised informed consent form had not been required. The hospital had applied the full procedure for non-voluntary hospitalisation as per the rules of enforcement contained in Law no. 487 of 11 July 2002 on mental health and the protection of people with mental disorders (“Law no. 487/2002”) from 2006, when that legislation was enacted.', '25. On 19 January 2005 M.A. brought criminal proceedings against the applicant’s parents and brother, for unlawful deprivation of liberty.', '26. The preliminary criminal investigation was assigned to police officer G.C.', '27. On 20 January 2005 the applicant’s father gave a statement to the police officer. He mentioned that the applicant had refused to join them in returning home. Nonetheless, disregarding her refusal, they had taken her to her grandparents’ house and then had her hospitalised. They had taken those measures because they considered that it was their duty to help their daughter in view of the negative reports they had heard about MISA.', '28. On 16 March 2005 police officer G.C. recommended, on the basis of the available evidence, that the Bârlad prosecutor’s office should not initiate criminal proceedings. The police officer had established that in 2003 the applicant had left her parents’ home and had started attending yoga classes organised by MISA. Subsequently, she had abandoned her studies and ceased to communicate with her family except for a few telephone conversations and a publicly televised argument. According to her parents, they had a family history of mental illness affecting consent. In this context, after discovering the applicant’s visit to her home town they had tried to talk to her outside the register office, but M.A. opposed. After a skirmish, the applicant’s mother had taken her to the family car in order to continue the discussion. M.A. had attempted to stop the car and had subsequently fallen to the ground. According to the staff members of the register office the applicant’s parents had not acted against her will. From 19 January to 3 February 2005 the applicant had lived with her maternal grandparents and had then been hospitalised in the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital. An attempt had been made to question the applicant while she was there, but this had not been possible because she had been administered psychotropic medication.', '29. By a decision of 13 April 2005, the Bârlad prosecutor’s office, in particular prosecutor N.C., relying on the facts established by police officer G.C., decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant’s parents and brother on the ground that no offence had been committed.', '30. The applicant’s fiancé challenged that decision before the hierarchically superior prosecutor. He argued that the criminal investigation had been superficial because, inter alia, the authorities had failed to take a statement from the applicant, establish the type of medical treatment administered to her, and ascertain whether she had been taken away by her parents against her will.', '31. By a final decision of 23 May 2005, the Bârlad prosecutor’s office, in particular the head prosecutor R.F., dismissed M.A.’s challenge as illfounded. It held that it had not been possible to take a statement from the applicant because she had been in a situation and state which prevented her from engaging in conversation as a result of psychotropic medication she had been administered, which had a negative psychopathological effect. Moreover, it would have been immoral to find that the applicant’s parents had unlawfully deprived her of her freedom given that she had been unable to express her own will because she was constantly accompanied by MISA members and was not allowed to attend meetings alone. M.A. was sixteen years older than the applicant and he had not been able to prove that he was her fiancé. He had initially informed an employee at the mayor’s office that he was the applicant’s boyfriend, and had stated that he was her fiancé only after a telephone conversation with a third party, and only in order to justify his own interests in respect of the applicant. It had been natural for the applicant’s parents to attempt to bring their daughter back home by any means necessary and to try to ensure her physical and emotional recovery, given that they had seen the press campaign concerning what happened to young women at the MISA premises. According to her parents, they had made considerable efforts to recover the applicant physically, while psychologically it had been clear that she was unable to express herself as long as MISA members accompanied her everywhere, including to family meetings. As to the medical treatment the applicant had been administered, the parties would have to ask the doctor who had treated her. The applicant’s fiancé appealed against that decision before the domestic courts.', '32. By a judgment of 21 October 2005, the Bârlad District Court dismissed the applicant’s fiancé’s appeal. It held that he had refused to substantiate his action before the court. Moreover, there was no evidence in the file that the applicant’s parents had unlawfully deprived her of her freedom.', '33. There is no evidence in the case-file that the applicant’s fiancé lodged any appeal on points of law (recurs) against that judgment.', '34. On 1 April 2005 the applicant was released from hospital and taken by her parents to her grandparents’ house. According to the applicant, during her stay there she was kept under supervision and isolated from the outside world.', '35. On 23 May 2005 the applicant brought criminal proceedings against her parents, alleging, inter alia, that they had forcibly detained her and that she had been unable to leave the house. She urged the authorities to do everything necessary to help her leave, given that she was of age and wanted to live her own life.', '36. By a decision of 27 September 2005, the Bârlad prosecutor’s office, dismissed the applicant’s complaint on the ground that her parents’ actions did not disclose any elements of an offence. It noted that the applicant’s parents had been worried because she was a MISA member, and that was why they had taken her to her grandmother’s home and then to a psychiatric hospital. According to the applicant’s statement following her questioning, she had not been forcibly detained by her parents but they had helped to get her admitted to a psychiatric hospital. There is no evidence in the file that the applicant challenged the above-mentioned decision before the domestic courts.', '37. According to the applicant, on 10 October 2005, helped by friends and her fiancé, she managed to leave her grandparents’ house. Afterwards she settled in Bucharest and on 5 November 2005 she married M.A.', '38. On 3 August 2005 the applicant brought disciplinary proceedings before the Buzău Disciplinary Commission against Dr I. in respect of her forced placement in the Nifon Unit of the Săpoca Psychiatric Hospital and the medical treatment that she had received there.', '39. On 13 December 2005 and 3 October 2007, Dr P., the applicant’s private psychiatrist, issued two medical certificates stating that she was psychologically healthy. The certificates noted that the applicant had been monitored by Dr P. since 15 October 2005 and that during that time she had not received any treatment and had shown no signs of a psychological condition.', '40. On 1 March 2006 the Buzău Disciplinary Commission dismissed the applicant’s complaint. The applicant challenged the decision before the Higher Disciplinary Commission (Comisia superioară de disciplină a Colegiului Medicilor din România).', '41. On 20 April 2007 the Higher Disciplinary Commission quashed the Buzău Disciplinary Commission’s decision of 1 March 2006, finding that Dr I. had acted in breach of the rules of good medical practice, and gave him a warning (avertisment). It held that according to the available evidence the applicant and her parents had been in a state of conflict and she had been opposed to her hospitalisation. Consequently, the doctor had been required to examine the patient’s clinical situation and the circumstances she was facing. Regardless of his decision, the doctor had to protect the patient. If he had assessed the patient’s clinical condition as amounting to an imminent risk for her or others, or if failure to hospitalise her would have aggravated her condition, non-voluntary hospitalisation would have been required even if the patient objected to her hospitalisation. However, there was no evidence that the relevant procedure had been initiated.', '42. At the same time, only medical reasons could justify a decision to hospitalise. However, the observation sheet produced by the hospital mentioned as one of the reasons for hospitalisation – none of them of a psychotic intensity to suggest a psychotic development in the borderline disorder – that the patient had joined counter-cultural informal groups (agregă ȋn grupuri informale disculturale). Moreover, the observation sheet did not contain a full psychological assessment. Consequently, the treatment with Laponex had not been justified.', '43. Furthermore, the Buzău Disciplinary Commission’s arguments that the hospitalisation had not been forced because the patient could have left the hospital, and that Dr I. had a professional duty to examine the patient and to prescribe adequate treatment, could not be taken into consideration. The doctor’s conduct had to be in accordance with the law, which stated that the treatment had to be discussed with the patient and that the patient’s consent had to be sought prior to treatment. The aforementioned conditions became less important only in the circumstances of forced hospitalisation. However, it did not appear that a forced hospitalisation procedure had been initiated in the applicant’s case.', '44. Leponex treatment was to be used exclusively in the advanced stages of schizophrenia or in cases of severe borderline personality disorder involving frequent relapses and self-harm, if no other medication proved to offer a satisfactory improvement in the patient’s condition. The use of that medication in the applicant’s case from the early stages of her treatment had been unusual. In some cases the medication could cause agranulacytosis (a low white blood cells count which favours fevers and infections). Consequently, doctors who prescribed it were required to comply strictly with the necessary safety measures. However, in the applicant’s case there was no evidence that the required weekly blood tests had been carried out.', '45. Furthermore, the necessary tests for establishing whether she was suffering from a borderline personality disorder had not been conducted at all.', '46. On 14 December 2005 the applicant brought criminal proceedings for unlawful deprivation of liberty between 19 January and 10 October 2005, serious bodily harm, and cooperation with a view to committing an offence, against her family, police officer G.C. and Dr I. She argued that the culprits had cooperated in order to unlawfully deprive her of her liberty, to hospitalise her against her will and to damage her health as a result of the medical treatment she received in the hospital.', '47. On 1 June 2006 the Bacău prosecutor’s office questioned the applicant. She stated, inter alia, that on arrival at the hospital she had informed the nurse who had told her that she was being hospitalised that she opposed the measure. She had subsequently been taken to Dr I.’s office, where she had had a short conversation with him and she had expressly informed him that she did not wish to remain in the hospital. The doctor had informed her that her general practitioner had referred her to the hospital, and he forced her to take medication, which had made her drowsy and numb. Afterwards she had been taken out of the doctor’s office and one of the nurses had asked her to sign a document which she was unable to read owing to her situation. The nurse had not informed her of the document’s content. Although she had signed the document automatically, she had only later been told that she had signed her hospitalisation papers.', '48. The applicant further stated that during her hospitalisation she had been constantly supervised by her mother. In addition, she had received inappropriate medication and had constantly felt ill. In particular, she had suffered nausea, headaches, drowsiness, constipation, urinary incontinence, excess salivation, low immunity, loss of motor control and loss of insight. She had also gained fifteen kilos and had developed anaemia as a result of suffering haemorrhages.', '49. She also stated that during her hospitalisation she had informed police officer G.C. that she had been hospitalised against her will, and because he had refused to act on that information she had refused to grant him access to her medical file. In July 2005 the same police officer had visited her at her grandparents’ house to question her after her fiancé had brought criminal proceedings against some of her family members. On that occasion the police officer had dictated the content of her statement and had omitted some of the facts presented by her.', '50. On 21 June 2006, the applicant informed the Bacău prosecutor’s office that she had joined the criminal proceedings as a civil party.', '51. On 28 November 2006, the Bacău prosecutor’s office decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against G.C. on the ground that no offence had been committed, ordered that the criminal investigation be continued in respect of the applicant’s family members, and referred the case to the Moineşti prosecutor’s office. It noted that police officer G.C. had visited the applicant at the hospital in order to take a statement from her. While initially Dr I. had denied G.C. access to the applicant because of her medical condition, in the following days he had agreed to allow him to speak to her. The prosecutor’s office also noted that according to G.C. the applicant had refused to provide a statement or to allow him to copy her medical observation papers, and had not informed him that she had been hospitalised against her will. Lastly, it noted that there was no evidence to suggest that police officer G.C. had been informed that the applicant had been deprived of her liberty when he questioned her at her grandparents’ home in July 2005. The applicant challenged the decision before the hierarchically superior prosecutor.', '52. By a decision of 5 February 2007, the head prosecutor at the Bacău prosecutor’s office allowed the applicant’s challenge, quashed the decision of 28 November 2006 and ordered that the investigation be reopened. The head prosecutor considered that the applicant and the defence witnesses indicated by her should be heard. In addition, the medical documents concerning the applicant’s state of health, the reasons for her hospitalisation and her medical recovery were to be attached to the investigation file.', '53. On 8 May 2007, the Bacău prosecutor’s office decided not to initiate criminal proceedings against police officer G.C., the applicant’s family members or Dr I. on the ground that no offence had been committed. It held that according to the medical report of 21 March 2005 produced by the Psychiatric Centre of the Nifon Unit, the applicant had been suffering from a schizo-paranoid behavioural disorder which had required her hospitalisation in a specialised medical facility for treatment and medical supervision. Her family’s actions had been caused by the applicant joining MISA, and they had only been attempting to provide her with the opportunity to continue her treatment. The applicant challenged that decision before the hierarchically superior prosecutor.', '54. By a final decision of 13 June 2007, the head prosecutor of the Bacău prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s challenge and upheld the decision of 8 May 2007. The applicant appealed against the decision before the domestic courts. She argued that after the investigation of the case had been reopened on 5 February 2007, the authorities had failed to gather any additional evidence, in particular to hear witnesses, to determine the circumstances of her confinement, and to examine the medical treatment she had received, which had affected her health.', '55. By a judgment of 16 November 2007, the Bacău County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the decision of the prosecutor’s office. It held that no offence of cooperating in order to commit an unlawful act could have been committed given that it could not be concluded that the alleged perpetrators had met one another other than by chance, or that they had made detailed plans to commit an offence. In addition, the available evidence did not confirm the existence of an offence of serious bodily harm. There were no medical reports supporting the allegations of trauma, and the medical report of 21 March 2005 produced by the Psychiatric Centre of the Nifon Unit had stated that the applicant was suffering from a schizoparanoid behavioural disorder which required her hospitalisation in a specialised medical facility for treatment and medical supervision. Lastly, the available evidence did not confirm the existence of an offence of unlawful deprivation of liberty either. On the basis of the witness statements, it could not be concluded that on 19 January 2005 the applicant’s family had acted against her will. The applicant had also failed to inform officer G.C. that her family had deprived her of her liberty either at the hospital or at her grandparents’ home. Consequently, given the absence of clear and concrete evidence of guilt, the alleged perpetrators’ right to the presumption of innocence could not be rebutted.', '56. The court further dismissed the applicant’s argument that after the re-opening of the criminal investigation no further evidence had been added to the file, on the grounds that she had been heard by the prosecutor’s office and that she had not requested the hearing of witnesses or additional evidence. The applicant’s argument that the authorities had failed to review the circumstances of her confinement and the medical treatment she had received was also dismissed on the ground that the medical documents attached to the file had stated her diagnosis and the doctor’s recommendation of hospitalisation, treatment and medical supervision.', '57. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law (recurs) against that judgment.', '58. By a final judgment of 14 February 2008, the Bacău Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law on the ground that the available evidence did not clearly and unequivocally prove the guilt of the alleged perpetrators. The judgment was drafted on 20 February 2008 and appears to have been made available to the applicant on 18 June 2008.', '59. On 27 February 2007, following the referral of the Bacău prosecutor’s office of 28 November 2006 (see paragraph 51 above), the Moinești prosecutor’s office decided not to institute criminal proceedings against the applicant’s family members, Dr I., and police officer G.C., on the ground that no offences had been committed. It noted, inter alia, that the applicant had been committed to hospital with a diagnosis of paranoid behavioural disorder. Moreover, her condition required continuous outpatient medical care for an undetermined period of time. The applicant challenged the decision before the hierarchically superior prosecutor.', '60. On 7 June 2007 the head prosecutor of the Moinești prosecutor’s office declined to examine the applicant’s challenge on the ground that the prosecutor who had delivered the decision of 27 February 2007 was his wife, and he referred the case to the Bacău prosecutor’s office.', '61. By a final decision of 15 June 2007, the Bacău prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s challenge on the ground that it had already examined the issues raised by it in its decision of 8 May 2007. The applicant appealed against the decision before the domestic courts. She argued that the authorities investigating her case had failed to gather all available evidence, or hear all parties to the proceedings, and that the decision of the Bacău prosecutor’s office had concerned a different person and different offences.', '62. By a judgment of 22 November 2007, the Moineşti District Court allowed the applicant’s appeal, quashed the decision, ordered the Moineşti prosecutor’s office to continue its investigation of the case, to gather the evidence requested by the parties and to question the parties, the staff members of the hospital, and the neighbours of the grandmother in whose house the applicant had been held. It held that the previous decisions by the prosecutor’s offices had addressed the applicant’s complaints in respect of only some of the parties concerned. In addition, the medical report of 21 March 2005 had been contradicted by the conclusions of the Higher Disciplinary Commission’s decision. Further, according to the applicant’s psychiatrist, from 15 October 2005 the applicant had not received any treatment and had not shown any symptoms of illness.', '63. The Moineşti prosecutor’s office and the defendants appealed on points of law. The prosecutor’s office argued that the statements that had been taken by the Bacău prosecutor’s office were relevant on account of the hierarchical relationship between the two prosecutors’ offices, and therefore the re-questioning of the applicant and of the perpetrators had no longer been required. In addition, the applicant had failed to identify the witnesses she wished to have questioned. The questioning of all medical staff had no legal basis and the court had not identified which of the neighbours of the applicant’s grandmother should have been questioned, or the scope of such questioning. Moreover, the applicant had failed to prove that any offences had actually been committed, had not submitted any medical report attesting to a bodily injury, and had herself acknowledged that she had signed the hospitalisation papers automatically, and that during her stay at her grandparents’ home she had had access to a visiting room (vorbitor) and thus had been able to communicate with others. Furthermore, according to the Higher Disciplinary Commission the hospitalisation of a patient was possible against his or her will. The same body had concluded that the applicant’s hospitalisation had been voluntary. Lastly, the psychiatrist had been disciplined on account of the inappropriate treatment administered to the applicant and not because the applicant had not been suffering from of 14 February 2008.', '64. By a final judgment of 11 April 2008, the Bacău County Court declared the Prosecutor Office’s appeal on points of law inadmissible on procedural grounds, allowed the defendants’ appeal on points of law, quashed the judgment of the lower court, and dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 15 June 2007. It held that thed during the sets of proceedings which had ended with the final decision of 23 May 2005 and the final judgment of 14 February 2008, and that the applicant had not adduced any new information or evidence in order to justify the opening of criminal proceedings in respect of the same acts and persons.', '65. On 30 January 2006 the applicant brought criminal proceedings for abuse of office and aiding and abetting an offender against prosecutors R.F. and N.C. The applicant complained about the quality of the prosecutors’ investigations.', '66. On 14 May 2008 the prosecutor’s office attached to the Court of Cassation decided, on the basis of the available evidence, not to initiate criminal proceedings against the two prosecutors on the ground that no offence had been committed. It held that although insufficiently reasoned, the examination of the merits of the case by the Bârlad prosecutor’s office had been accurate. In addition, it noted that those events which had taken place after 19 January 2005 had not been known at the time and therefore had not been investigated. Consequently, it referred the case to the Bârlad prosecutor’s office in order for it to investigate the applicant’s parents for the alleged deprivation of the applicant’s liberty in the period between 19 January and 10 October 2005. The applicant challenged the decision before the hierarchically superior prosecutor.', '67. By a final decision of 25 June 2008, the head prosecutor of the prosecutor’s office attached to the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s challenge as ill-founded. The applicant appealed against that decision before the domestic courts.', '68. By a decision of 11 November 2008, the Bârlad prosecutor’s office dismissed the applicant’s action concerning the alleged deprivation of her liberty by her parents in the period between 19 January and 10 October 2005. It held that the applicant’s complaint had already been dismissed in the final judgments of 14 February and 11 April 2008 in accordance with the relevant rules of criminal procedure, and in the absence of any new relevant information the criminal proceedings could not be reopened or reinitiated. There is no evidence in the file that the applicant appealed against that decision before the domestic courts.', '69. By a judgment of 21 January 2009, the Court of Cassation dismissed the applicant’s appeal against the decision of 25 June 2008 as ill-founded. It held that there was no evidence suggesting that the prosecutors had committed an offence, or that the decisions taken by them had been unlawful. The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment.', '70. By a final judgment of 6 July 2009, the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal as time-barred.', '71. The applicant submitted to the Court a large number of press articles, photographs and transcripts of television talk-shows concerning the conduct of the leader of MISA, the criminal investigation against him, the applicant’s conflict with her parents, and the measures and efforts undertaken by her parents to reconnect with her.', '72. By a decision of 13 April 2006 the Romanian Council for Combating Discrimination dismissed the applicant’s complaint that the actions of her parents and Dr I. had amounted to discrimination on the basis of her beliefs. It held that the facts of the applicant’s case did not indicate discrimination. There is no evidence in the file that the applicant challenged that decision before the domestic courts.']","['5', '8']","['5-1', '8-1']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicants’ dates of birth and places of residence are given in the Appendix.', '6. On 12 January, 26 January, 10 March and 29 December 2013 demonstrations were planned to be held in Baku. It appears that the organisers of the demonstrations gave no proper prior notice to the relevant authority, the Baku City Executive Authority (“the BCEA”). Information about the demonstrations was disseminated through Facebook or the press.', '7. According to the applicants, the demonstrations were intended to be peaceful and were conducted in a peaceful manner. The demonstrations of 12 January and 10 March 2013 were aimed at protesting about the deaths of soldiers in the army. The demonstration of 26 January 2013 condemned the use of force by the police against the participants of previous demonstrations, while those taking part in the demonstration of 29 December 2013 were protesting against bureaucratic injustices which had allegedly caused a disabled war veteran to set himself on fire on 25 December 2013.', '8. Each applicant attended one of the demonstrations (see Appendix), but shortly after they had begun the police started to disperse those who had gathered. All the applicants were arrested during the dispersal operations and were taken to various police stations.', '9. The applicants were questioned at the police stations they were taken to.', '10. On the day of each applicant’s arrest administrative offence reports (inzibati xəta haqqında protokol) were issued, which stated that the applicants had committed an administrative offence under Article 298.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences (“the CAO”) (participation in a public assembly that had not been organised in accordance with the law).', '11. Some of the applicants refused to sign the administrative offence reports (applications nos. 52270/13, 26424/14 and 26994/14).', '12. According to most of the applicants, they were never served with copies of the administrative offence reports or with other documents from their case files. They were not given access to a lawyer after their arrest or while they were in police custody.', '13. According to statements (ərizə) written by the applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 33164/13 at the police stations on the day of their arrest (12 January and 10 March 2013 respectively), they refused the services of a lawyer.', '14. The applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were released after being kept in police custody for a few hours, subject to an undertaking to reappear at the police station on various dates.', '15. Most of the applicants were taken to trial courts directly from the police stations, either on the day of their arrest or the following day. The applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were brought before first-instance courts on the day they returned to the police station.', '16. According to most of the applicants, the court hearing in each case was very brief. Members of the public were not allowed in the courtroom, even though the court had not taken a formal decision to close the hearing to the public.', '17. According to most of the applicants, they were not given an opportunity to appoint lawyers of their own choosing. State-funded lawyers were asked to assist some of them. The applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 33164/13, 33593/13 and 26994/14 were not represented by a lawyer. According to documents from the case files, the applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 33164/13 and 26994/14 refused the assistance of a State-funded lawyer and decided to defend themselves in person.', '18. According to the transcript of the hearing concerning the applicant in application no. 20589/13, the State-funded lawyer stated briefly in his oral submissions that the applicant was guilty and asked the court for lenience. Similarly, the State-funded lawyer for the applicant in application no. 26424/14 stated in general terms that the applicant was not guilty and asked the court to discontinue the case. In addition, none of the material submitted to the Court contains any record of showing that the State-funded lawyer, Mr V.M., made any oral or written submissions on behalf of the applicant in application no. 52270/13.', '19. The only witnesses questioned during the court hearings with respect to the applicants in applications nos. 20589/13 and 26424/14 were the police officers who, according to the official records, had arrested them. The police officers testified that the applicants had staged unauthorised demonstrations. No witnesses were questioned by the courts in the other applicants’ cases.', '20. The first-instance courts found that the applicants had participated in unauthorised demonstrations. The applicants were convicted under Article 298.2 of the CAO and sentenced to a period of administrative detention, varying from thirteen to seventeen days, or to a fine of 400 or 500 Azerbaijani manats (AZN) (see Appendix).', '21. On various dates the applicants lodged appeals with the Baku Court of Appeal, arguing that their convictions had been in violation of their rights because the demonstrations in which they had participated or attempted to participate had been peaceful. The applicants also complained that their arrests had been unlawful and that the hearings before the first-instance courts had not been fair. They asked the Baku Court of Appeal to quash the first-instance courts’ decisions in their cases.', '22. The applicants in applications nos. 21219/13, 52270/13 and 26424/14 were assisted before the Baku Court of Appeal by lawyers of their own choosing. The other applicants were not represented by a lawyer.', '23. On various dates the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicants’ appeals and upheld the decisions of the first-instance courts (see Appendix).', '24. In its decision with regard to the applicant in application no. 33593/13 the Court of Appeal noted, inter alia, that he had voluntarily refused legal assistance at the pre-trial stage.']","['11', '6']","['11-1', '6-1', '6-3']",[],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1949 and lives in Van.', '6. On 30 April 2001 the applicant went to Muş prison during visiting hours to see her brother, who was being held there in connection with a case related to the PKK, an illegal armed organisation.', '7. The staff responsible for body searches found on the applicant “close to the left side of her abdomen”, a piece of paper that had been folded several times and wrapped in tape. It was an unsigned letter dated 24 April 2001, written by a member of the PKK and addressed to another member.', '8. The applicant was taken into police custody on the same day and questioned in Turkish by the gendarmes the following day. During the interview she stated that she had picked up the object in question in Van at the bus stop where she was waiting for the bus to Muş. She had thought that the object might have some value and had intended to remove the wrapping once she was alone.', '9. On 1 May 2001 she gave a statement to the same effect before the public prosecutor and then before the District Court. As she was illiterate, she signed the statements with her fingerprint.', '10. She was remanded in custody after being examined and was released on 5 July 2001.', '11. On 27 September 2001 the State Security Court of Van acquitted the applicant, considering her version of events to be credible.', '12. On 17 December 2001 the applicant visited her brother again in Muş prison during a religious festival. After the visit she was taken into police custody.', '13. The police report drawn up that same day stated that the staff responsible for body searches had discovered, hidden in the lining of the applicant’s dress, a sixteen-page document consisting of rolled-up onionskin paper protected by adhesive tape. According to the report, the document contained, in particular, information about the PKK’s strategy and its activities in prisons, about the conduct to be adopted vis-à-vis the prison authorities and about prison staff.', '14. She was questioned in Turkish by two gendarmes on 18 December 2001. The report stated that she had been reminded of her right to the assistance of a lawyer but had waived that right. As to the facts, she had stated that she had seen a wrapped object in the prison waiting room and had picked it up out of mere curiosity, placing it in her bra. She added that, during the search, the prison officers had discovered the object and had unwrapped it. She had noticed pieces of paper covered in writing. During her visit to her brother she had told him about the incident but he had not said anything about it. The gendarmes had then arrested her as she was leaving the prison.', '15. In response to a question about her personal status, she replied that she was married to G.I. on the basis of a religious marriage, not a civil one, and that they had had five children together. Her husband had another partner with whom he had had six children.', '16. When asked whether she worked for the PKK, she replied in the negative. She added that, on the first occasion, she had picked up the object thinking it might contain gold and that it was with the same thought in mind that she had taken the paper in the waiting room.', '17. In response to a question about ten pieces of gold discovered on her during the search, she stated that half of them belonged to her daughter and the other half were hers.', '18. After she had been questioned, the public prosecutor called for her to be remanded in custody. As a result she was brought before the District Court judge.', '19. Finding that she did not speak Turkish with sufficient fluency, the judge asked a member of the applicant’s family who was waiting in the corridor outside the courtroom to act as interpreter. The relative accepted.', '20. The applicant stated once again that she had found the document in question in the waiting room. Immediately afterwards, she claimed that this statement, and the one previously taken by the gendarmes, concerned events that had occurred seven months earlier; that no document had been discovered on her person when she last visited the prison; that she had thought the gendarmes were questioning her about earlier events; and that, not being able to read or write, she had signed the police report with her fingerprint without knowing what it said. When she was informed of the report’s content she disputed its veracity.', '21. On 18 December 2001, after the hearing, the applicant was remanded in custody and criminal proceedings were brought against her before the State Security Court of Van for membership of an illegal armed organisation and, in the alternative, for aiding and abetting such an organisation.', '22. At the various hearings before that court the applicant was assisted by a lawyer and an interpreter.', '23. In the course of the proceedings, the defence disputed the prison officers’ version of events. Counsel argued that no document had been found on the applicant, adding that, according to her, a document had certainly been found on a female visitor during the search carried out on entering the premises and that person had nevertheless been authorised to visit on the grounds that it was a public holiday. The prison officers had failed to arrest her when she left the prison on account of the large number of visitors that day. Having realised that the visitor in question had evaded their control, the officers had decided to arrest the applicant instead, because they knew that a similar accusation had already been made against her. In addition, the defence stated that in her statement to the gendarmes the applicant had said that the impugned object had been found in her bra, whereas the record of the incident indicated that it had been found in the lining of her dress.', '24. On 12 May 2002 two female prison officers were interviewed on the basis of a warrant. The first, C.A., stated that she had personally found the impugned document in the lining of the applicant’s dress during the body search. The second, F.A., confirmed this version and stated that she had been called immediately by her colleague after the discovery.', '25. Testimony was also taken from a number of defence witnesses. Two women who were visiting the prison on the day of the incident stated that they did not know if the applicant had been searched on entering the prison. Another testified that she had entered the prison at the same time as the applicant but not had seen her being searched. One of the applicant’s brothers testified that he had arrived at the prison with her but that they had become separated during the body search before coming together again to visit their brother. In their conversation with the latter, the applicant had never mentioned any incident during her body search.', '26. On 29 May 2002 the applicant was given a prison sentence of three years and nine months for aiding and abetting an illegal armed organisation. In its reasoning, the State Security Court observed that, in the first case, the applicant had claimed to have found the impugned document at a bus stop in Van, and that, in the second, she had stated during the investigation that she had found the document in the prison waiting room. It noted that the applicant had reiterated this statement to a district judge before claiming that she had been talking about the first case and that no document had in fact been found on her during the body search of 17 December 2001. The court took the view that there were some serious inconsistencies in the applicant’s explanations. It noted that if she had really believed that the questioning by the gendarmes and the district judge concerned the events of 30 April 2001 she should logically have stated that she had found the impugned document not in the waiting room of Muş prison but in Van. It concluded that the version of events given by the applicant and the defence witnesses was not credible, and it accepted the testimony of the two prison officers, which confirmed the findings in the relevant police report. The court thus found the applicant guilty as charged.', '27. On 7 October 2002 the Court of Cassation quashed that judgment on a procedural ground.', '28. On 18 April 2003 the State Security Court convicted the applicant again and handed down the same sentence. Moreover, taking into account the time she had already served, it ordered her release.', '29. That judgment was quashed on 19 January 2004 on an appeal on points of law by the applicant. The Court of Cassation took the view that the offence with which she was charged had been incomplete and had remained at the attempt stage. It dismissed the applicant’s other grounds of appeal on points of law, including the question of the absence of an interpreter in police custody.', '30. On 3 May 2004 the State Security Court sentenced the applicant to one year and three months’ imprisonment for attempting to aid and abet an illegal armed organisation. It adopted the same reasoning as that of its previous judgments.', '31. On 6 June 2005 the Court of Cassation referred the case back to the first-instance court stating that, in accordance with Law no. 5252, setting out the rules and procedures for the application of the new Criminal Code which had recently entered into force, the case had to be re-examined in the light of that new code to determine whether the applicant could be granted the benefit of a more lenient provision.', '32. On 19 September 2005 the Van Assize Court (formerly the State Security Court) convicted the applicant once again, adopting the same reasoning as that of its previous judgments, and specifying that the provisions of the former code were more lenient.', '33. The applicant appealed on points of law against that judgment, submitting in particular that she had not been assisted by an interpreter while in police custody.', '34. Her appeal was dismissed on 31 October 2006.']",['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-e'],[],[],[],1

The applicant was born in 1974 and lives in Vsesvyatskaya.', '6. At the material time the applicant was a journalist at a Lithuanian weekly publication.', '7. He was also a civil activist. As was later established by the domestic courts, since approximately the summer of 1998 the applicant had identified himself as a member of an informal liberal democratic movement, Revolyutsionnoye Kontaktnoye Obyedineniye (“the Revolutionary Contact Union” – hereinafter “the RKO”). Also, in the period from 2000 until 2004 the applicant was the founder, owner, publisher and editor-in-chief of a monthly newsletter entitled Radikalnaya Politika (“Radical Politics”). He determined the contents of the newsletter and published his own articles in it, as well as articles by people with similar views and excerpts from official and non-official sources of information and the mass media. He, himself, prepared each issue of the newsletter at his home address by typing it up on his personal computer, and then had it printed out and reproduced in multiple copies. The exact number of copies of each issue is unknown. The applicant then distributed the newsletter in person or through other unidentified individuals by selling it or giving it out for free at various places in Moscow. The articles touched, to a great extent, on the events in the Chechen Republic.', '8. An article headlined “From the interview given by M. Udugov to the Kavkaz Center press agency” (“Из интервью М. Удугова агенству Кавказ Центр”) mentioned the large-scale hostage-taking at the Dubrovka Theatre in Moscow in October 2002 referring to it as “the action of Movsar Barayev’s heroic Chechen rebels in Moscow” (“акция героических чеченских повстанцев Мовсара Бараева в Москве”). It stated, in particular:', '“Russia has clearly demonstrated that it is at war and permanently in danger of being hit by retaliatory blows, because its rulers have perpetrated a despicable attack on a sovereign State and are killing innocent civilians there. Even the western community is compelled to admit that Putin’s Russia is waging a war aimed at the physical extermination of Chechens as an ethnic group.”', '9. An article entitled “Insanity [defence] of Budanov [is] a guarantee of victory for Basayev” (“Невменяемость Буданова – залог победы Басаевa”) commented on the case of a high-ranking Russian officer who was standing trial on charges of torture and murder for the strangulation of an 18-year-old Chechen woman and, in particular, on the judgment of the first-instance court by which the defendant had been found not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. The article, of which the applicant was one of the authors, stated, in particular:', '“... The whole of Chechnya is filled now with the same Budanovs – maniacs, bloodthirsty sadists, murderers and degenerates in epaulettes. Russia’s whole occupying army consists of those Budanovs.”', '10. It also stated that:', '“... The fact that a [someone who posed a] danger [to] society, an insane maniac was in command of a regiment ... sets a new task before the revolutionary-democratic forces of Russia. From now on we should require immediate compulsory psychiatric examination of all commanders of the military and naval forces, service personnel of the Ministry of the Interior, the border guard, the police and the FSB, starting from a captain and finishing with the Commander-in-Chief – V.V.Putin.”', '11. It also appealed:', '“Let dozens of Chechen snipers take up their positions in the hills and the city ruins and hundreds and thousands of aggressors perish from their holy bullets! No mercy! Death to the Russian invaders!”', '12. An article headlined “Accomplices to the murderers of the Chechen people” (“О соучастниках убийства чеченского народа”), authored by a third person, commented on the hostage-taking at the Dubrovka Theatre in Moscow in October 2002 and contained the following paragraph:', '“I, as a national of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeriya (CRI), who is daily suffering from the Russian State Terror, can understand the reasons which pushed Chechen patriots to this extraordinary act. It had been brought about by the continuing attacks by Russia on the Chechen State and [the Chechen] people. There are no documents condemning the mass murder of nationals of the CRI, to say nothing of Russia’s aggression against the Chechen State ... Chechen patriots, reduced to a state of despair by Russia’s Terror, were compelled to commit this guerrilla act in Moscow, the capital of Russia. In so doing they pursued their sole goal, namely to alert the international community to the total genocide of the Chechen people being cynically committed by the Russian invaders”.', '13. The same article mentioned the “national liberation struggle of the Chechen people against the colonial expansion of Russia”.', '14. In an article headlined “The Chechen resistance is alive! Maskhadov has visited Dzhokhar and Argun” expressions such as “President Maskhadov”, “President of the CRI”, “Commander-In-Chief of the CRI Maskhadov”, “the capital of the CRI, Dzhokhar” were used.', '15. In an article headlined “In memoriam, Salman Raduyev” (“Памяти Салмана Радуева”) the applicant wrote:', '“Chechen heroes are leaving ... Dudayev, Atteriyev, Khattab and today – Raduyev. As if they would be devoured by a scary black noisome abyss. And the name of this abyss is Russia.”', '16. In the same article the applicant stated:', '“... Salman Raduyev fought against Russia to his last breath, without making compromises with the murderers of his people. His life was an example of how one should fight against Russia. His death has become an example, amongst a million of such examples, of the immeasurable scoundrelism and perfidy of Russia, the pathological falsity and criminality of Russia as a State, as a civilisation, as a subject of history.', '...', 'Salman Raduyev is the brightest page [in the history] of the heroic Chechen Resistance movement. He was a hero of an entire generation, not only in Chechnya, but also in Russia. His life and death are a guarantee that damned imperial Russia will be destroyed and the Chechens and all other peoples oppressed by it will finally obtain freedom. We will avenge you, Salman!”', '17. In an article entitled “A new joke by Vova” (“Новая шутка Вовы”) the applicant stated:', '“Lawful convictions issued by the Sharia court of the CRI against national traitors are being executed rigorously.”', '18. In the same issue of the newsletter the applicant reproduced information from the website regions.ru regarding a police operation by a unit of the regional Department of the Interior aimed at setting free Uzbek nationals who had been held in slavery by Russian nationals. The applicant headlined that article with the words “Russians have slaves and dare to squawk something about Chechens” (“Русские держат рабов и еще смеют что-то вякать в адрес чеченцев”).', '19. In the same issue the applicant published an article headlined “Orthodox [believers] went completely nuts” (“Православные совсем охренели”) in which information had been given about some unidentified “Orthodox theologians” who, in a booklet called “Foundations of the Orthodox Faith” had allegedly claimed that “Jesus Christ [had been] crucified not by Jews but by Chechens”.', '20. In an article headlined “‘Chechen syndrome’ inside out” (“Чеченский синдром навыворот”), the applicant wrote:', '“... Most importantly, we realised with our hearts and skin that Freedom is, indeed, the most precious thing that a man has, the most precious treasure, the only thing worth dying for. And if [an individual is] lucky[, he or she will] take with [him or her]self to the other world at least some enemies, as selfless Chechen women do when they put on their ‘shaheed belts’. The life of a human is in any event brief and fragile and is only worth living if you are free. Otherwise it is better to die at once. As these Chechen women die.”', '21. He went on as follows:', '“... In supporting Chechnya at war, demonstrating our solidarity with Basayev, openly supporting Movsar Barayev in Moscow on the days of the ‘Nord-Ost’ [theatre siege], we crossed a line, a certain border, past which all connections to our past and the environment and people among which we had been born and grown up and lived broke down; we had trustingly considered ourselves to be part of them, until we read on a foreign, enemy website, and saw with our own eyes, all the awful details of the atrocities committed by [our] people in a tiny neighbouring mountain country. Hence, the Rubicon has been crossed, the choice has been made and there is no room to back off – we no longer have any other family than all peoples oppressed by ‘our’ Empire, than partisans fighting to be freed from its yoke, than famous warlords like Basayev and political parties which claim monetary compensation [from Russia] for their occupation and return of the territories Russia has annexed ...”', '22. In the same article the applicant stated:', '“... It is the bloody cannibalistic atrocity of this State towards a tiny and helpless mountain people that first brought this thought into our conscience: Russia must be destroyed forever, a State doing similar things to an entire nation should not exist at all!”', '23. An article headlined “Chechnya shielded the Caucasus” (“Чечня заслонила собою Кавказ”), authored by a third person, stated:', '“... Maskhadov, Basayev, Khattab and other heroes of the Chechen resistance courageously and firmly got in the way of Russia’s aggression and, in fact, saved not only the independence of Chechnya but also its very existence, as well as the existence of other States in the Caucasus ...”', '24. In an article entitled “No comments” the applicant stated:', '“... Putin’s cheap propaganda can jabber as long as it wishes that Maskhadov is a bandit and that he is responsible for the ‘Nord-Ost’ [theatre siege] and the recent explosions in Tushino. Anyone who shows at least some interest in contemporary Chechnya knows that it is Maskhadov who is the legitimate President of Chechnya. And until he is re-elected in accordance with the constitution of the CRI, and not the Russian constitution, any other ‘presidents of Chechnya’ are out of the question. Lawful elections of the president of the CRI under the constitution of the CRI of 1992 will only be possible when the CRI army, headed by Commander-in-Chief Maskhadov, defeats occupying Russia’s illegal armed groups of the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Security Service, and chucks them out of the territory of independent Ichkeriya ...”', '25. In an article headlined “Retribution-2” (“Возмездие-2”) the applicant stated:', '“... Retribution for genocide will take place sooner or later. If we live up to it, we will be its witnesses and it would be good to become its punishing sword. Until then we are only capable of organising lamentably small candlelight vigils to commemorate all those killed and tortured in Chechnya, Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland – from the White (Baltic) to the Black Seas – by our State which has become frenzied because of blood. It is impossible to live with this heavy burden in the soul, as the terrible knowledge of Russia’s history requires retribution from all those who remain conscious. It is possible that the hands which hold a commemoration candle today will hold a gun tomorrow – it is hard to believe that but Lord help us to live in the happy time when this happens. For the time being we don’t have any other weapons, except for the alarm bell of our words.', '... We remember and grieve for all those killed and tortured by ‘our’ Empire, hated by us. However, a better gift to all Chechens being exterminated will be not [to have] yet another meeting with candles to commemorate their genocide, but each blow struck – even though they are still weak, for now – against the criminal State which is killing them and depriving us of our freedom, mutilating our souls, striving to turn us into butchers and binding us with blood. ‘Less words and more action’ – this is the slogan of slogans of the day! Particularly given that there is much to be done for the radical anti-imperial opposition in the country!”', '26. The article also read:', '“... let Russia spit blood for yesterday’s and today’s genocide of the Chechen people – it serves it right, it deserved it. Let our commemoration candles at the meetings of 23 February turn into flaming torches, in whose purgatorial flames this rotten block, lying in the way of humankind, will burn!”', '27. In the same article the applicant wrote:', '“... As to the writing of inscriptions on the walls of buildings, fences and bus stops, one cannot overestimate the importance of those acts. From today on and until 14 [March 2004] we have to strike persistently at one point: slaves, become free for at least a moment, do not participate in fake ‘elections’! We need not campaign among the limited circle of revolutionaries, human-rights activists, extremists, and members of radical and marginal social groups – they already know everything. Each direct and open appeal to ... the people other than politicised consumers of ... TV cud [тележвачки] is an open and powerful blow to the regime and will hasten its end ...”', '28. In the same article the applicant also issued the following call:', '“... We have to accumulate, hate and keep record of their crimes – the endless list of all those ‘sweep operations’, ‘identity checks’, ‘counter-terrorist operations’, gagging laws, unlawful searches and politically motivated criminal prosecutions. It would also be good to make lists of all those who carried out a particular ‘sweep operation’ in a particular village, who instituted criminal proceedings, on whose information and on which date. It is known from the historical perspective that those people are most of all afraid of personal responsibility, which they would not be able to shift on to their commanders who had given illegal orders. One day executioners in uniforms and narks without uniforms in Moscow, as well as in Chechnya, will be held accountable to us for everything ...”', '29. An article headlined “Kremlin looters” (“Кремлевские мародеры”), authored by a third person, criticised the actions of the Russian Army in the Chechen Republic and, in particular, accused them of a large-scale extrajudicial executions of civilians during a “sweep” operation in a Chechen village in 1995. It also stated:', '“In Chechnya the Russian Army stopped existing as a military force of the State, having, once and for all, turned itself into a frenzied gang of looters and murderers; a herd intoxicated with drugs.”', '30. In his “editorial note” to the “Declaration of the Committee ‘2008: a free choice’” the applicant stated:', '“We, [the RKO] and Radikalnaya Politika, are united with the Committee and prepared to cooperate with them. Obviously, we are much more radical than them. We consider that we should not wait until 2008 and be worried about the Constitution but call on the people to overthrow and liquidate Putin’s regime as soon as possible. We also don’t consider it possible to preserve the contemporary Russian Federation as an integral State. However, we are for a common ground with all our allies, even those who are much more moderate.”', '31. On the front page the following statement was published on behalf of the “editorial team”:', '“Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev died a hero and he will remain [a hero] in the memory of humankind, historians and grateful future generations. He fought the bloody Rusnya as long as he could”.', '32. In an article headlined “The price to be paid for genocide” (“Расплата за геноцид”) the applicant wrote:', '“The explosion in the Moscow metro is justified, natural and lawful ... Chechens have a moral right to blow up everything they want in Russia, after what Russia and Russians have done to them; no objections regarding humanism or love for humankind can be accepted.”', '33. In the same article the applicant stated:', '“It has been ten years since the Russian Federation and its people [began] a totally destructive genocidal war against the Chechen people, who before the war numbered only one million people”.', '34. In an article headlined “Will Russia be allowed to participate in the Summer Olympics in Athens?” (“Пустят ли Россию на летнюю олимпиаду в Афинах?”) the applicant wrote:', '“Russia’s bloody attack on the CRI led to, among millions of other similar bloody consequences, Russia’s security forces’ killing of the ex-President of the CRI, Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who had helped his people to repel this attack.”', '35. In eight issues of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter, in a column entitled “The Good News” (“Благие вести”), the applicant published information which he had copied from various news agencies’ websites, such as Interfax, or websites like strana.ru and KMNews.ru. The information mostly concerned events such as deaths of federal servicemen or law-enforcement officers in the Chechen Republic; violent attacks and assaults on public officials or police officers in various regions of Russia; and so forth.', '36. On 23 February 2004 the applicant took part at an unauthorised meeting, where he displayed banners with slogans condemning the current political regime, such as: “Zakayev is not a terrorist, unlike Putin and Co.” (Закаев не террорист, в отличие от Путина и К), “Europe! Do not betray the Chechen resistance!” (Европа! Не предай Чеченское сопротивление!), “Russian invaders – get out of Chechnya” (Русские оккупанты – вон из Чечни!), “When will the Chechen people be freed and rehabilitated?” (Когда будет освобожден и реабилитирован чеченский народ?) and also a flag with the words “Radical Party”.', '37. On 10 March 2004, while participating in a meeting at Pushkin Square in Moscow, the applicant, personally and with the participation of an unidentified person, disseminated issues nos. 2 (40) and 3 (41) of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter and informed people interested in it about the forthcoming issues, how to subscribe and other ways to financially support the newsletter, of which he was the editor-in-chief.', '38. On 18 December 2003 criminal proceedings were instituted against the applicant on suspicion that the views expressed in the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter amounted to appeals to extremist activities and incitement to racial, national, social and other hatred.', '39. A psychological-linguistic expert examination of the texts published by the applicant was carried out. In a report of 13 April 2004 the expert stated, in particular, that the impugned texts contained negative emotional assessments of Russia’s servicemen; of people of Russian ethnicity; and of Orthodox believers. The report further mentioned that, by criticising Russia’s actions in the Chechen Republic, the texts gave negative assessments of Russia, as a State; of the existing political regime; of Russia’s army as a part of the machinery of the State. The report also pointed out numerous expressly negative words and expressions used by the applicants when describing Russia. It also mentioned that the impugned texts positively assessed and justified the actions and activities of a number of Chechen separatist leaders and fighters; terrorist attacks, including explosions, within the territory of Russia.', '40. On 26 April 2004 the applicant was formally charged with the above-mentioned offences and on an unspecified date the case was transferred to the Butyrskiy District Court of Moscow (“the District Court”) for trial.', '41. At the trial, the applicant pleaded not guilty. He confirmed that he had been the editor-in-chief and publisher of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter but argued that he had printed the newsletter only for himself and had not distributed it. He further argued that he had merely expressed his opinion regarding various political events in Russia, and, in particular, his civic position regarding the ongoing armed conflict in the Chechen Republic. In his words, he had never called for extremist activities or violent overthrow of the existing political regime in Russia; he had only called for a change of the leadership in the country.', '42. The District Court called and examined a number of witnesses, who submitted that they had bought the applicant’s newsletter or seen him distribute it for free in public. It also examined the expert who had drawn up the report of 13 April 2004. The expert confirmed his conclusions made in the report. A number of witnesses on the applicant’s behalf were also called and examined.', '43. The trial court further examined other pieces of evidence, including the expert report of 13 April 2004; written complaints from eight private individuals in which they had stated that the applicant’s articles had aimed at inciting hatred and had contained insulting language in respect of Russians, Orthodox believers and law-enforcement officers; reports of seizure of issues of the applicant’s newsletter; reports of a search of the applicant’s flat and seizure of his computer; a report on the applicant’s forensic psychiatric examination, which confirmed that he was fully able to understand the meaning of his actions and to control them.', '44. The District Court examined the applicant’s arguments and those raised by his defence counsel and dismissed them as untenable on the facts of the case, with reference to the witness statements and other pieces of evidence.', '45. In a judgment of 20 November 2006 the District Court found the applicant guilty of “having publicly appealed to extremist activities through the mass media” (Article 280 § 2 of the Russian Criminal Code) and of having committed “actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity as well as at humiliating the dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of ethnicity, origin, attitude towards religion and membership of a social group, through the mass media” (Article 282 § 1 of the Russian Criminal Code).', '46. The trial court 6-7 above, and referred to the texts mentioned in the expert report of 13 April 2004 (see paragraph 39 above). It considered that the impugned texts had had a clear extremist leaning and incited actions prohibited by the Suppression of Extremism Act (see paragraph 69 below). In particular, in those texts the applicant had called for extremist acts, such as a forcible overthrow of the constitutional order and the President of Russia; had called for a breach of the territorial integrity of Russia; had justified and glorified terrorist acts; had called for violence against the Russian people and abased their dignity; and had incited religious discord by arguing that the Orthodox faith had been inferior and by insulting its followers. In those texts the applicant had used insulting language in respect of Russia as a State, the political regime in the country, and servicemen of Russia’s armed and security forces.', '47. More specifically, the District Court observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had represented the conflict in the Chechen Republic as a war between two States – Chechnya and Russia; had approved of terrorist attacks carried out in Russia, and of the actions of criminals and terrorists aimed at the extermination of the Russian people as a nation. In this respect, the District Court referred to the applicant’s relevant texts in issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 16 above) and in issue no. 9 (35) (see paragraphs 21 and 23 above), stating that in those texts, while “mentioning a number of persons implicated in terrorist and extremist activities”, the applicant had used words and expressions aimed at creating positive public opinion about those persons and their criminal acts.', '48. The District Court also pointed out that “the texts of the applicant’s articles contain[ed] positive assessment of the bombings in Russia perpetrated by Chechen terrorists as well as the acts of Chechen snipers from illegal armed groups who kill[ed] Russia’s servicemen in Chechnya”. In this respect, it quoted an extract from issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 11 above) and extracts from issue no. 3 (41) (see paragraphs 31-32 above).', '49. The trial court went on to note that the applicant had qualified Russia’s actions in the Chechen Republic as aggression and had considered the Russian Army to be an occupying force. Accordingly, he “[had] negatively assessed Russia’s actions and those of Russia’s armed forces; similarly negatively [the applicant had] assessed Russia as a State, the Russian Army as a part of the machinery of the State and Russia’s servicemen as a social group”. The District Court continued to state that, on the other hand, the applicant “[had] represented the events in the Chechen Republic as a war waged by Russia against the Chechen people (the Chechen ethnic group) and as genocide against the Chechen people”. The court corroborated these findings with reference to relevant texts published in issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraphs 8 and 12 above) and in issue no. 3 (41) (see paragraphs 33 and 34 above).', '50. The District Court also observed that the applicant had justified and positively assessed the acts of Chechen rebel fighters, and that he had regarded the Chechen Republic as an independent State with its own President (A. Maskhadov), capital (Dzhokhar), constitution, armed forces and Commander-in-Chief, courts (Sharia courts) and legislation. In particular, in issue no. 1 (27), the applicant had interpreted the events in the Chechen Republic as “a national liberation struggle of the Chechen people against the colonial expansion of Russia” (see paragraph 13 above), referred to “lawful convictions of the Sharia court of the CRI” (see paragraph 17 above), and mentioned “President Maskhadov”, “President of the CRI”, “Commander-In-Chief of the CRI Maskhadov”, “the capital of the CRI, Dzhokhar” (see paragraph 14 above). Also, in issue no. 3 (41) the applicant published a “decree by President Maskhadov” and in the article “No comments” he praised “President Maskhadov” as “the legitimate President of Chechnya” (see paragraph 24 above).', '51. The District Court further referred to the texts in eight issues of the applicant’s newsletter published in the column entitled “Good news” (see paragraph 35 above). It pointed out that the applicant had represented bad events in a positive way, that is to say as actions approved by the authors and by the applicant himself and as an example to be followed. The court pointed out that another example to be followed, according to the applicant, had been actions of Chechen women putting on “shaheed belts”; in the latter respect, the court quoted a relevant extract from the article “‘Chechen syndrome’ inside out” (see paragraph 20 above).', '52. The District Court went on to observe that “in all issues of his newsletter ... [the applicant had] wilfully made use of insulting characteristics, negative emotional assessments and attitudes towards ethnic, racial, national, religious and social groups”. In particular, in respect of Russia as a State he had employed such negative emotional references as metaphors “scary noisome abyss”, “bloody cannibalistic atrocity”, “rotten block”; humiliating characteristics “immeasurable scoundrelism, perfidy, pathological falsity” and negative attitudes aimed at destruction (the metaphor “to spit blood”), which, according to the trial court, was a clear indication of an attitude aimed at inciting bloodshed. The court corroborated these findings with reference to relevant extracts from issue no. 1 (27) (see paragraph 15 above), issue no. 9 (35) (see paragraph 22 above) and issue no. 2 (40) (see paragraph 26 above).', '53. The District Court also considered that in the article headlined “Insanity of Budanov, a guarantee of victory for Basayev”, “the applicant [had] insult[ed ...] servicemen of the Russian Army and law-enforcement officers by launching an appeal to act criminally against them”. In particular, the court stated that “in that article [the applicant gave] an emotional and negative description of the servicemen of the Russian Army as a social group” (see paragraph 9 above) and “[made] an appeal for actions against [army] servicemen ..., such as requiring an immediate compulsory psychiatric examination of its commanders” (see paragraph 10 above). In support of its relevant findings, the District Court also relied on an extract published in issue 2 (40) (see paragraph 29 above).', '54. It went on to state that “by publishing and disseminating the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter [the applicant had] wilfully acted with a view to stirring up enmity and conflict, including armed conflict, on national, racial and religious grounds between citizens living in the European and Asian parts of the country and people living in the Caucasus”. In this respect, the trial court referred to the applicant’s “editorial note” published in issue no. 2 (40) (see paragraph 30 above), observing that in that publication the applicant had “demonstrated a negative attitude towards the existing political system and Russia as a State”. The trial court pointed out that “the stance taken by [the applicant] concerning the liquidation of the existing State regime (“Putin’s regime”) presuppose[ed] not only actions in conformity with the constitution but also the possibility of deviating from it (“to overthrow the regime, without really caring about the Constitution”)”.', '55. The court further noted that in the article “Retribution-2” the applicant had referred to “the following acts aimed against the State and the existing political regime in Russia: organisation of meetings concerning events in the Chechen Republic, participation in those meetings, writing inscriptions on the walls of buildings, fences and bus stops” with the contents reflected in the relevant extracts of that article (see paragraph 25 above). The court also stated that “the applicant [had] also suggested carrying out other unlawful acts against the State and the political regime in the texts of his newsletters but [had] failed to specify which”.', '56. The District Court then observed that in various issues of his newsletter the applicant had “intentionally appealed for records to be kept of such acts as ‘sweep operations’, ‘identity checks’, ‘counter-terrorist operations’, ‘unlawful searches and politically motivated criminal prosecutions’, which he [had] qualified as ‘crimes’ and the persons who [had] carried them out as ‘executioners in uniforms’ and ‘narks without uniforms’”. The court referred, in particular, to the applicant’s appeal made in the relevant extract from the article “Retribution-2” (see paragraph 28 above).', '57. The trial court went on to note that in the article “Orthodox [believers] went completely nuts” (see paragraph 19 above) the applicant had made use of a heading carrying a negative and emotional assessment of the followers of the Orthodox denomination (“went nuts”). However, in the court’s words, “the content of the article [did] not correspond to its title, because it concern[ed] an isolated case (a statement that “Jesus Christ was crucified not by Jews but by Chechens”, contained in a booklet called “Foundations of the Orthodox Faith”); this isolated case [was] generalised from and represented as a typical situation of Orthodox believers by virtue of using the impugned heading”. In the same vein, the District Court pointed out that in issue no. 1 (27) the applicant had reproduced information concerning certain Uzbek nationals held in slavery by certain Russian citizens (see paragraph 18 above). The court noted that the applicant had entitled that article “Russians have slaves and dare squawk something about Chechens” and had represented an isolated fact to the readers as typical and characteristic of all Russians, whereby he had “made a negative and emotional assessment (‘to squawk’) in respect of Russian citizens as a nation”.', '58. Moreover, in issues nos. 1 (27) and 9 (35) the applicant had argued that “Orthodox people [православный народ] had been inferior by using insulting characteristics and negative emotional assessments of believers, discriminatory expressions in respect of the Orthodox denomination as a religion and stating that this religion, practised by Russians, should be abolished, thereby abasing the national dignity of the people practising [it]”. According to the trial court, statements regarding the inferiority of the Orthodox faith had been made by the applicant in an attempt to stir up interethnic and racial conflicts in society so as to cause indignation in society and eventually to call for a change of the existing political regime. The court did not specify which particular articles in the above-mentioned issues contained those characteristics and assessments.', '59. Lastly, the court referred to the fact that “at an unauthorised meeting on 23 February 2004 the applicant [had] called on individuals to support his movement by openly displaying banners with slogans condemning the regime” (see paragraph 36 above) and during the meeting of 10 March 2004, “to continue to commit crimes aimed at incitement to hatred and enmity among the population, abasement of dignity of an individual or group of individuals on the grounds of gender, nationality, language, origin or religious beliefs and membership of a social group, the applicant, personally and with a participation of an unidetified person, had distributed issues nos. 2 (40) and 3 (41) of the Radikalnaya Politika newsletter and had informed the persons interested in it about the forthcoming issues, how to subscribe and other ways to financially support the newsletter, of which he had been the editor-in-chief”. In the trial court’s view the applicant thus had called for extremist activities to be supported by way of their financing on a charitable basis.', '60. The District Court rejected the applicant’s argument that in the relevant articles he had made no appeals to extremist activities, and, in particular, that he had not called for the overthrow of the constitutional order nor stirred up inter-ethnic discord; and that he supported the constitutional order, the Russian Constitution and the Chechen people’s right to self-determination and had merely availed himself of the right to freedom of expression. The trial court noted, with reference to the expert report of 13 April 2004, that the language used by the applicant in the impugned texts enabled the court to conclude that the applicant’s actions had constituted criminal offences and that he had clearly abused his right to freedom of expression secured by the Russian Constitution.', '61. The District Court furthermore dismissed the applicant’s argument that he had been the author of only some of the articles held against him whereas the others had been written by other individuals. The court observed in this connection that the applicant had been the editor-in-chief of the newsletter and, in this capacity, had had the power to shape its editorial direction and he had been responsible for its content.', '62. As regards the punishment to be imposed on the applicant, the District Court had regard to the state of his health and the fact that he had no criminal record, had positive references and had a dependant mother. At the same time it stressed the “high social danger” posed by the applicant’s offences and his personality and sentenced him to five years’ imprisonment. The court also prohibited the applicant from practising journalism for three years to run concurrently.', '63. The applicant appealed, referring, among other things, to Article 10 of the Convention and stating that as the editor-in-chief of the impugned newsletter he had expressed in it his personal views concerning political events in Russia and his attitude, as a citizen of that country, to the war in the Chechen Republic. He had not made any appeals for extremist activities and had not declared the superiority of any one religion over another. Nor had he called for the overthrow of the constitutional order, but he had expressed the view that the Government should be changed. The applicant further pointed out that the number of copies of the newsletter in question had been so miniscule that the statements published therein had presented no public danger. He also argued that the measure of punishment imposed on him was excessively severe, given, in particular, the fact that he had no criminal record and had positive references from the place where he lived.', '64. On 23 May 2007 the Moscow City Court upheld the applicant’s conviction on appeal. It stated, in particular, that the applicant’s newsletter had been a mass medium despite the low number of copies produced. It also considered that .', '65. The applicant was released on 21 March 2011 after he had served the prison sentence in full. In his submission, numerous requests by him for release on parole had been refused.']",['10'],['10-1'],[],[],[],[],1

THE UNITED KINGDOM,1,Revision rejected (Art. 35) Admissibility criteria,Branko Lubarda;Dmitry Dedov;Helen Keller;Helena Jäderblom;Johannes Silvis;Luis López Guerra;Paul Mahoney;Síofra O’Leary,"['The cases of T.13 and T.6.', 'General remarks', 'The applicant Government have submitted the cases of eight persons in which the use of the five techniques and sometimes also other forms of ill-treatment were alleged. The Commission has examined the illustrative cases of T.13 and T.6. The allegations in regard to T.6 concern both the five techniques and other forms of alleged ill-treatment, whereas the allegations in regard to T.13 concern the five techniques only.', 'Both cases were among the eleven cases investigated by the Compton Committee. However, neither T.13 nor T.6 had given evidence before that Committee, which based its findings on the oral evidence of the persons who supervised the operations at the centre and of the medical officer who was stationed there, as well as on various medical records, colour photographs and the feeding record (cf. Compton Report, paras. 54 and 55, at p. 14).', 'The Delegates of the Commission heard both case witnesses who gave their evidence in detail and were also cross-examined by the respondent Government. They had before them extracts from the medical officer’s journal at Crumlin Road Prison, the medical examination records on arrival and on departure from the interrogation centre and colour photographs of T.6 as well as various reports by psychiatrists who also gave oral evidence.', 'However, the Delegates were not able to hear oral evidence from members of the security forces in relation to the allegations concerning the interrogation centre. In the first place no witnesses who had been present at that centre were made available. Secondly, the respondent Government stated at the hearing of witnesses at Sola in January 1975 that all of their witnesses had now been instructed not to reply to any questions regarding the five techniques and their use on the ground that the use of these techniques had been discontinued and that there were security considerations involved. This ‘embargo’ on the evidence also related to matters connected with a ‘seminar’ held in Northern Ireland in April 1971 by the English Intelligence Centre for members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], where the use of the techniques was taught orally (cf. Parker Report, Minority Report, para. 6 at p. 12; also Witness 13G at VR 6, pp. 190 et seq.).', 'The Commission does not consider it necessary to pursue this matter any further. It is satisfied that the five methods in aid of interrogation which, as a matter of public record, were used in emergency situations at various other places before they were used in Northern Ireland in 1971 (see Parker Report, Majority Report, para. 10 at p. 3 [..]) were applied to the two case witnesses in the present case. It is further satisfied that a ‘seminar’ as described was held in April 1971 by the English Intelligence Centre.', 'Course of events', 'The evidence before the Commission bears out the allegations made by the case witnesses and confirms the findings of the Compton Committee as regards the course of the events for the persons subjected to the five techniques.', 'T.13 and T.6 were, together with others, arrested in the early morning hours of 9 August 1971 and brought to Magilligan Camp, being one of the three Regional Holding Centres set up to receive arrested persons. They were held there for two days and, having been selected for special interrogation were brought, on 11 August 1971, to the unknown interrogation centre. On arrival at the centre they were medically examined and at one stage they were taken by helicopter to another place where they were served with a detention order. They were taken back to the centre where they were interrogated in depth being subjected to the five techniques in the following way:', 'a. Wall-standing – the witnesses demonstrated how they were spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers (the stress position). They were forced to remain in this position. The exact length of time during which the witnesses were required to stand could not be established. Both witnesses said that they lost their sense of time but that it must have been many hours. The Compton Committee while describing the position as being a different one, found that T.13 had been against the wall during periods totalling 23 hours, and T.6 29 hours.', 'b. Hooding – a black or navy coloured bag was put over the witnesses’ heads. Initially it was kept there all the time, except during interrogations, but later T.13 was allowed to take it off when he was alone in the room, provided that he turned his face to the wall.', 'c. Noise – pending interrogations the witnesses were held in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise.', 'd. Sleep – pending interrogations the witnesses were deprived of sleep, but it was not possible to establish for what periods each witness had been without sleep.', 'e. Food and drink – the witnesses were subjected to a reduced diet during their stay at the centre and pending interrogations. It was not possible to establish to what extent they were deprived of nourishment and whether or not they were offered food and drink but refused to take it.', 'The witnesses were at the centre from 11 to 17 August 1971, when they were transferred to Crumlin Road Prison in accordance with the detention order.', 'In 1971 T.13 and T.6 instituted domestic proceedings to recover damages for wrongful imprisonment and for assault and their claims were settled in 1973 and 1975 respectively for £ 15,000 and £ 14,000.', 'Physical and mental effects resulting from the use of the techniques', '(i) Physical effects', 'The Commission is satisfied from the evidence given that the witnesses suffered loss of weight resulting from their detention at the unknown interrogation centre and from the use of the five techniques. It is furthermore established that, particularly the wallstanding technique, caused physical pain while it was being applied, but that the pain ceased when the person was no longer in that position.', '(ii) Mental effects', 'The witnesses themselves described feelings of anxiety and fear, as well as disorientation and isolation during the time they were subjected to the techniques and afterwards. However, the intensity of such sensations was different in respect of T.13 than in respect of T.6, as a result of differences in their personality. Consequently, T.13 had been more strongly affected by the application of the techniques than T.6.', 'On the other hand, the psychiatrists disagreed considerably on the after-effects of the treatment and on the prognosis for recovery. Professors Daly and Bastiaans considered that both witnesses would continue for a long time to have considerable disability shown by bouts of depression, insomnia and a generally neurotic condition resembling that found in victims of Nazi persecution. Drs. 5 and 1 considered that the acute psychiatric symptoms developed by the witnesses during the interrogation had been minor and that their persistence was the result of everyday life in Northern Ireland for an ex-detainee carrying out his work travelling to different localities. In no sense could the witnesses’ experiences be compared with those of the victims of Nazi persecution.', 'On the basis of this evidence the Commission is unable to establish the exact degree of the psychiatric after-effects which the use of the five techniques might have had on these witnesses or generally on persons subjected to them. It is satisfied, however, that, depending on the personality of the person concerned, the circumstances in which he finds himself, and the conditions of everyday life in Northern Ireland at the relevant time, some after-effects resulting from the application of the techniques cannot be excluded.', 'Findings of the Commission', 'The five techniques in aid of interrogation were used in August 1971 on T.13 and T.6. They were applied prior to, between and during interrogations, but not after interrogation was terminated. This means that the persons concerned were subject to the techniques during at least four, possibly five, days. The exact times could not be established. The Commission is satisfied the total periods during which the two witnesses were at the wall, [were] 23 and 29 hours respectively. A certain degree of force was used to make the detainees stand at the wall in the required posture which caused physical pain and exhaustion. The posture required was a stress position and not a normal position required to search a person, although it cannot be considered to be proved that the enforced stress position lasted all the time they were at the wall.', 'No physical injury resulted from the application of the techniques as such, but it caused mentally a number of acute psychiatric symptoms. It cannot be excluded that in certain persons some of these symptoms continue to exist for some time afterwards.', 'The damages granted to them under settlements in court are substantial sums and, although it is not possible in any settlement to say what part was paid with a view to what claim, it may be presumed that the greater part of the sum was awarded in view of the allegations of ill-treatment including the application of the five techniques, having regard to sums normally awarded by courts for claims of assault as compared with sums normally granted for claims of wrongful imprisonment.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

In 1991 the applicant asked the authorities to return to her some buildings and a plot of land owned by her father before nationalisation in 1940. In November 1995 the applicant wrote to the authorities to ask why the buildings and the land had been sold to other persons in 1992. The authorities replied in December 1995 that the applicant had given an incorrect address for the buildings when submitting her request for her property rights to be restored and the buildings in question had already been privatised.', '7. On 22 October 1996, upon their own initiative, the authorities suggested to the applicant that she submit a request to be paid monetary compensation for the buildings, if she did not have any objections to such a form of restitution. On 4 November 1996 the authorities indicated that the documents submitted by the applicant did not prove that her father had owned the buildings in question and asked her to provide additional documents or – if she did not have those documents in her possession – to ask the domestic courts to establish as a legal fact that her father had owned those buildings.', '8. On 27 April 1999 the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas District Court, asking it to establish as a legal fact that before the 1940 nationalisation her father had owned the buildings and a plot of land. On 18 August 1999 the Kaunas District Court stated that there was a dispute about the applicable law and left the applicant’s claim unexamined. The court also suggested to the applicant that she submit her claim in accordance with the rules governing contentious proceedings (as opposed to the rules applicable to the procedure for the establishment of a legal fact).', '9. On 28 May 2003 the Kaunas District Court established as a legal fact that the applicant’s father had owned the buildings before the 1940 nationalisation.', '10. On 4 July 2003 the applicant indicated that she wanted to receive compensation in the form of securities. The authorities asked the Centre of Registers (a State enterprise) to assess the value of the buildings, which was set on 14 July 2003 at 36,000 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately 10,426 euros (EUR)). On 18 September 2003 the authorities recommended that applicant’s and her sister’s property rights to their father’s property be restored by paying them compensation in securities.', '11. On 9 October 2003 the authorities adopted a decision to restore the applicant’s and her sister’s property rights by paying them LTL 36,000 (approximately EUR 10,426) in total in securities.', '12. On 10 June 2004, the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas District Court, requesting the annulment of the valuation of the buildings made by the Centre of Registers on 14 July 2003 (see paragraph 10 above) and the appointment of independent experts to assess the market value of the buildings because she considered that the value set for the buildings was too low. The applicant’s claim contained deficiencies, which she failed to eliminate within the time-limit set by the Kaunas District Court; accordingly, on 13 July 2004, the court decided to rule that the applicant’s claim had not been lodged.', '13. The applicant lodged a separate complaint, where she claimed that the authorities assessed the value of the buildings incorrectly, and complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken. On 23 August 2004 the Kaunas Regional Court held that the Kaunas District Court had made procedural mistakes and returned the case for fresh examination to the Kaunas District Court.', '14. The applicant lodged a modified claim with the Kaunas District Court, complaining that the assessment of the value of the buildings had been made three or four months before the decision to restore her property rights had been taken. On 2 February 2005 the Kaunas District Court held that although there were no provisions in the domestic law indicating how soon after the assessment of value the decision to restore property rights had to be taken, in the present case the time between the assessment and the decision had not been excessively long. The court therefore dismissed the applicant’s complaint.', '15. The applicant appealed raising the same complaints as she did before the Kaunas District Court (see paragraph 14 above), and on 13 June 2005 the Kaunas Regional Court held that the assessment of value of the buildings had been based on several methods of calculation and in accordance with the provisions of the domestic law. It therefore dismissed the applicant’s appeal.', '16. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law, and on 14 December 2005 the Supreme Court decided that the case had to be examined before the administrative rather than civil courts and referred the case for examination to the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court.', '17. On 23 March 2006, during the hearing before the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, the applicant asked for the examination of the case to be postponed that she might have time to eliminate deficiencies in her claim. She also claimed that she was not aware of the fact that she had to submit a request to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint separately, and asked the court to provide her with an opportunity to do that. Her requests were granted and the examination of the case was postponed until 9 May 2006. On 19 April 2006 the applicant lodged a modified claim in which, inter alia, she asked the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court to (i) annul the assessment of the value of the buildings made by the Centre of Registers, (ii) to annul that part of the order of the authorities for her property rights to be restored in which the value of the buildings was indicated and (iii) to renew the time-limit for lodging a complaint. On 9 May 2006, during the hearing at the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, the applicant asked for the appointment of an expert to determine the market value of the buildings. On 6 June 2006 the court suspended the proceedings, appointed an expert and asked the expert (i) what the market value of the buildings had been on 14 July 2003 and (ii) what the market value of the buildings had been today, i. e. when the expert had been appointed. In April 2007 the expert stated that on 14 July 2003 the market value of the buildings had been LTL 56,850 (approximately EUR 16,465) and that the market value of the buildings at the time that the examination of the case had started had been LTL 164,900 (approximately EUR 47,758). Subsequently the court proceedings were resumed, and on 21 September 2007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court held that the new assessment of value of the buildings was more accurate and decided to annul the assessment of value of 14 July 2003 by the Centre of Registers and that part of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights in which the value of the buildings was set at LTL 36,000 (approximately EUR 10,426) (see paragraphs 10 and 11 above). The applicant did not appeal and the decision became final on 5 October 2007.', '18. On an unspecified date, the applicant lodged a claim with the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court, asking, inter alia, for the authorities to be obliged to urgently re-issue the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 (see paragraph 11 above). On 12 December 2007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court allowed the applicant’s claim.', '19. On 18 May 2009 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court examined and then rejected a claim by the applicant seeking for the Kaunas Municipality to be obliged to pay her LTL 82,450 (approximately EUR 23,879) for the buildings and to award her LTL 96,370 (approximately EUR 27,911) in damages. The court held that the assessment of value in itself did not give rise to any legal consequences for the applicant. The court concluded that the decision of the authorities of 9 October 2003 was still in force and that the question of the amount of the compensation was a matter for the public authorities and that it was not within the court’s power to give instructions to them.', '20. The applicant appealed, but on 26 July 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court dismissed her appeal. The court held that the applicant’s request had been for the value of the buildings to be set at what their value had been at the moment when the expert valuation had been carried out in 2007 (see paragraph 17 above). The court also observed that the amendment of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s property rights had not yet been adopted and it was not clear how the applicant’s rights were being breached. The court also held that the applicant had repeatedly raised the issue of the assessment of the value of the buildings, which had already been resolved. The court upheld the conclusion of the court of first instance that public authorities’ functions did not fall within the jurisdiction of the domestic courts (see paragraph 19 above).', '21. The applicant requested that the proceedings be reopened. On 17 December 2010 the Supreme Administrative Court refused her request.', '22. In October 2007 the relevant authorities were informed that an additional assessment of the value of the buildings had to be made and then the Kaunas Municipality Administration asked the Centre of Registers to urgently assess their value. As no response was received, in February 2008 the Kaunas Municipality Administration again asked the Centre of Registers to assess the value of the buildings. The assessment was made on 17 March 2008 and the value of the buildings was set at LTL 57,000 (approximately EUR 16,508) in total, of which the applicant’s part was LTL 28,500 (approximately EUR 8,254). This valuation was officially approved by the authorities on 5 June 2009, when they amended the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 to restore the applicant’s and her sister’s property rights.', '23. On 16 August 2010 the applicant submitted a request to be compensated in securities of a State-owned enterprise. On 27 January 2011 the applicant was sent a document of acceptance in respect of 11,875 units of securities, the nominal value of each unit being LTL 1 (approximately EUR 0.29). The State Property Fund asked the applicant to sign the document of acceptance and indicated that the nominal value of one security was LTL 1 (approximately EUR 0.29) but that the real value was LTL 2.4 (approximately EUR 0.7). It meant that the real total value of the shares was LTL 28,500 (approximately EUR 8,254), which was the applicant’s part of the compensation (see paragraph 22 above). The transfer of the securities was finalised on 1 February 2011.', '24. On 12 December 2012 the applicant asked the authorities to set the value of the buildings at the value that they had as of January 2011 and to pay her additional compensation. In February 2013 the authorities replied that there were no grounds for re-examining and deciding on questions regarding the restoration of property rights to the applicant because the procedure had already been finalised.', '25. The applicant lodged a claim with the domestic courts, asking, inter alia, that the decision of the authorities of 5 June 2009 by which the annulled part of the decision of 9 October 2003 had been amended (see paragraph 22 above) be quashed. She also requested the annulment of the assessment of value of the buildings at LTL 57,000 (approximately EUR 16,508) made by the Centre of Registers on 17 March 2008. The applicant’s claim had several deficiencies and she was asked several times to eliminate them. However, the applicant failed to do so in an acceptable manner and on 25 October 2010 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court declined to examine her claim. The court stated that the applicant had asked it to oblige the authorities to provide one of the original copies of the decision of 5 June 2009; however, it observed that the applicant already had an original copy. It was suggested by the court that the applicant contest the order of 5 June 2009, because it was that document which had legal consequences for her. This, according to the information in the Court’s possession, she never did.']",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0

De Gaetano;Zdravka Kalaydjieva;Ksenija Turković,"['13. The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Garkalne (Riga district). At the time of the events which are the subject of the present application he was an investment consultant.', '14. On 4 May 1999 the applicant and F.H. Ltd., a commercial company incorporated under Cypriot law, signed an acknowledgment of debt deed before a notary. Under the terms of the deed the applicant declared that he had borrowed 100,000 United States dollars (USD) from F.H. Ltd. and undertook to repay that sum with interest by 30 June 1999. The deed also contained choice of law and jurisdiction clauses according to which it was governed “in all respects” by Cypriot law and the Cypriot courts had nonexclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising out of it. The applicant’s address was given as G. Street in Riga and was indicated as follows:', '“[FOR] GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, I, PĒTERIS AVOTIŅŠ, of [no.], G. [street], 3rd floor, Riga, Latvia, [postcode] LV-..., (‘the Borrower’) ...”', '15. In 2003 F.H. Ltd. brought proceedings against the applicant in the Limassol District Court (Επαρχιακό Δικαστήριο Λεμεσού, Cyprus), alleging that he had not repaid the above-mentioned debt and requesting that he be ordered to pay the principal debt together with interest. In the Strasbourg proceedings the applicant submitted that he had in fact already repaid the debt before the proceedings were instituted in the Cypriot court, not by paying the sum of money in question to F.H. Ltd. but by other means linked to the capital of F.H. Ltd.’s parent company. However, he acknowledged that there was no documentary evidence of this. The respondent Government contested the applicant’s submission.', '16. In an order dated 27 June 2003 the District Court authorised the “sealing and filing of the writ of summons”. On 24 July 2003 a “specially endorsed writ” was drawn up, describing the facts of the case in detail. It gave the applicant’s address as G. Street in Riga, the address indicated on the acknowledgment of debt deed.', '17. Since the applicant was not resident in Cyprus, F.H. Ltd. made an ex parte application to the same District Court on 11 September 2003 seeking a fresh order enabling a summons to be served on the applicant outside the country and requiring him to appear within thirty days from the date of issuing of the summons. The claimant company’s lawyer produced an affidavit declaring that the defendant was habitually resident at an address in G. Street in Riga and could actually receive judicial documents at that address. The applicant, for his part, contended that it would have been physically impossible for him to receive the summons at the address in question, which was simply the address at which he had signed the loan contract and the acknowledgment of debt deed in 1999 and was not his home or business premises.', '18. On 7 October 2003 the Limassol District Court ordered that notice of the proceedings be served on the applicant at the address provided by the claimant company. The applicant was summoned to appear or to come forward within thirty days of receiving the summons. If he did not do so the court would make no further attempt to contact him and would instead post all future announcements concerning the case on the court noticeboard.', '19. An affidavit produced by an employee of the firm of lawyers representing F.H. Ltd. showed that, in accordance with the court order, the summons had been sent by recorded delivery to the address in G. Street in Riga on 16 November 2003. However, the copy of the summons furnished by the Latvian Government indicated that it had been drawn up on 17 November 2003. The slip produced by the Cypriot postal service stated that the summons had been sent on 18 November 2003 to the address in G. Street, and had been delivered and signed for on 27 November 2003. However, the signature on the slip did not appear to correspond to the applicant’s name. The applicant claimed never to have received the summons.', '20. As the applicant did not appear, the Limassol District Court ruled in his absence on 24 May 2004. It ordered him to pay the claimant USD 100,000 or the equivalent in Cypriot pounds (CYP), plus interest at an annual rate of 10% of the aforementioned amount from 30 June 1999 until payment of the debt. The applicant was also ordered to pay costs and expenses in a gross amount of CYP 699.50, plus interest at an annual rate of 8%. According to the judgment, the final version of which was drawn up on 3 June 2004, the applicant had been duly informed of the hearing but had not attended. The judgment did not state whether the decision was final or indicate possible judicial remedies.', '21. On 22 February 2005 F.H. Ltd. applied to the Riga City Latgale District Court (Rīgas pilsētas Latgales priekšpilsētas tiesa, Latvia) seeking recognition and enforcement of the judgment of 24 May 2004. In its request the company also sought to have a temporary precautionary measure applied. It stated that the applicant was the owner of real property in Garkalne (Riga district) which according to the land register was already mortgaged to a bank. Accordingly, fearing that the applicant might seek to evade enforcement of the judgment, it asked the District Court to place a charge on the property in question and record the charge in the land register. Lastly, it requested that the applicant be ordered to pay the costs. In its request the company gave as the applicant’s place of residence an address in Č. Street in Riga which differed from the address previously notified to the Cypriot court.', '22. On 28 April 2005 the Latgale District Court adjourned examination of F.H. Ltd.’s request, informing the company that the request contained a number of defects which it had one month to correct. In particular, F.H. Ltd. had not explained why it had given an address in Č. Street when the applicant was supposedly resident in G. Street.', '23. On 26 May 2005 F.H. Ltd. submitted a corrigendum in which it explained, among other points, that according to the information contained in the register of residents (Iedzīvotāju reģistrs), the address in Č. Street was the applicant’s officially declared home address. As to the address in G. Street, the company’s representatives had assumed it to be the applicant’s actual residence. In that connection the Latvian Government provided the Court with a copy of a letter from the authority responsible for the register of residents according to which, prior to 19 June 2006, the applicant’s officially declared address had been in Č Street.', '24. In an order of 31 May 2005 the Latgale District Court ruled that the corrigendum submitted by F.H. Ltd. was insufficient to remedy all the defects in its request. The court therefore declined to examine the request and sent it back to the company. The latter lodged an appeal with the Riga Regional Court (Rīgas apgabaltiesa), which on 23 January 2006 set aside the order of 31 May 2005 and remitted the case to the District Court in order for the latter to examine the request for recognition and enforcement as rectified by the corrigendum of 26 May 2005.', '25. In an order of 27 February 2006 issued without the parties being present, the Latgale District Court granted F.H. Ltd.’s request in full. It ordered the recognition and enforcement of the Limassol District Court’s judgment of 24 May 2004 and the entry in the Garkalne municipal land register of a charge on the property owned by the applicant in that municipality. The applicant was also ordered to pay the costs.', '26. According to the applicant, it was not until 15 June 2006 that he learned, from the bailiff responsible for enforcement of the Cypriot judgment, of the existence of that judgment and of the Latgale District Court order for its enforcement. On the following day (16 June 2006) he went to the District Court, where he acquainted himself with the judgment and the order. The respondent Government did not dispute these facts.', '27. The applicant did not attempt to appeal against the Cypriot judgment in the Cypriot courts. However, he lodged an interlocutory appeal (blakus sūdzība) against the order of 27 February 2006 with the Riga Regional Court, while asking the Latgale District Court to extend the time allowed for lodging the appeal. Arguing that there was nothing in the case file to confirm that he had been given notice of the hearing of 27 February 2006 or of the order issued following the hearing, he submitted that the thirty-day period laid down by the Civil Procedure Law should start running on 16 June 2006, the date on which he had taken cognisance of the order in question.', '28. In an order of 13 July 2006 the Latgale District Court granted the applicant’s request and extended the time-limit for lodging an appeal. It noted, inter alia, as follows:', '“... It is clear from the order of 27 February 2006 that the issue of recognition and enforcement of the foreign judgment was determined in the absence of the parties, on the basis of the documents furnished by the claimant, [F.H. Ltd.]. The order further states that the defendant may appeal against it within thirty days from the date of receipt of the copy [of that order], in accordance with section 641(2) of the Civil Procedure Law.', 'The court considers the arguments advanced by the applicant, P. Avotiņš, to be wellfounded, to the effect that he did not receive the order ... of 27 February 2006 until 16 June 2006, this being attested to by the reference in the list of consultations [appended to the case file] and by the fact that the order, served [on the applicant] by the court, was returned on 10 April 2006 ... It is apparent from the documents appended to the appeal that the applicant has not lived at the declared address in [Č.] Street since 1 May 2004; this confirms ... the statement made by his representative at the hearing, according to which the applicant no longer lives at the above-mentioned address.', 'Accordingly, the thirty-day period should ... run from the date on which the applicant received the order in question ...', 'Further, the court does not share the view of the representative of [F.H. Ltd.] that the applicant himself is responsible for his failure to receive the correspondence because he did not declare his change of address promptly, and that the time allowed [for lodging an appeal] should not therefore be extended. The fact that the applicant did not take the necessary legal steps concerning registration of residence is not sufficient to justify a refusal by the court to allow him to exercise the fundamental rights guaranteed by the State as regards access to the courts and judicial protection, including the right to appeal against a decision, with the consequences this is likely to entail. ...”', '29. In his grounds of appeal before the Riga Regional Court the applicant contended that the recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment in Latvia breached Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (“the Brussels I Regulation”) and several provisions of the Latvian Civil Procedure Law. He submitted two arguments in that regard.', '30. Firstly, the applicant argued that in accordance with Article 34(2) of the Brussels I Regulation (corresponding in substance to section 637(2), third subparagraph, of the Latvian Civil Procedure Law), a judgment given in default in another Member State could not be recognised if the defendant had not been served with the document instituting the proceedings in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence. He maintained that he had not been duly informed of the proceedings in Cyprus, although both the Cypriot lawyers who had represented the claimant company in the Limassol District Court and the Latvian lawyers who had represented it in the Latvian courts had been perfectly aware of his business address in Riga. In support of that allegation he submitted that he had had professional dealings with the Cypriot lawyers, who had telephoned him and sent faxes to his office, and had met the Latvian lawyers in person. Hence, they must all have been aware of his business address. He added that he could also have been reached at his home address in Garkalne, as he had a residence there that was officially declared in accordance with the law and the lawyers could have consulted the municipal land register, where the property he owned was registered under his name. However, instead of serving notice of the proceedings on him at one of those addresses, which had been known and accessible, the lawyers had given the courts an address which they should have realised could not be used.', '31. Secondly, the applicant argued that, under the terms of Article 38(1) of the Brussels I Regulation and section 637(2), second subparagraph, of the Civil Procedure Law, a judgment had to be enforceable in the State of origin in order to be enforceable in the Member State addressed. In the instant case, there had been a threefold breach of those requirements. First, the claimant had only submitted the text of the Cypriot court judgment to the Latvian court and not the certificate required by Annex V to the Brussels I Regulation. In that connection the applicant acknowledged that under Article 55(1) of the Brussels I Regulation the court in which enforcement was sought could, in some circumstances, exempt the claimant from the obligation to produce a certificate. However, in the present case the Latgale District Court had not made clear whether it considered that the claimant could be exempted from that obligation and, if so, for what reason. Second, the Cypriot judgment had contained no reference to the fact that it was enforceable or to possible judicial remedies. Third, although a judgment had to be enforceable in the country of origin in order to be enforced in accordance with the Brussels I Regulation, the claimant company had not produced any documentary evidence demonstrating that the judgment of 24 May 2004 was enforceable in Cyprus. In view of all these circumstances, the applicant contended that the judgment could on no account be recognised and enforced in Latvia.', '32. In a judgment of 2 October 2006 the Regional Court allowed the applicant’s appeal on the merits, quashed the impugned order and rejected the request for recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment.', '33. F.H. Ltd. lodged an appeal against that judgment with the Senate of the Supreme Court, which examined it on 31 January 2007. At the start of the hearing F.H. Ltd. submitted copies of several documents to the Senate, including the certificate referred to in Article 54 of the Brussels I Regulation and Annex V thereto. The certificate was dated 18 January 2007 and had been signed by an acting judge of the Limassol District Court. It stated that the document instituting the proceedings had been served on the applicant on 27 November 2003. The last part of the certificate, intended for the name of the person against whom the judgment was enforceable, had been left blank. When asked to comment on these documents the applicant’s lawyer contended that they were clearly insufficient to render the judgment enforceable.', '34. In a final judgment of 31 January 2007 the Supreme Court quashed and annulled the Regional Court judgment of 2 October 2006. It granted F.H. Ltd.’s request and ordered the recognition and enforcement of the Cypriot judgment and the entry in the land register of a charge on the applicant’s property in Garkalne. The relevant extracts from the judgment read as follows:', '“ ... It is clear from the evidence in the case file that the Limassol District Court judgment became final. This is confirmed by the explanations provided by both parties at the Regional Court hearing on 2 October 2006, according to which no appeal had been lodged against the judgment, and by the certificate issued on 18 January 2007... As [the applicant] did not appeal against the judgment, his lawyer’s submissions to the effect that he was not duly notified of the examination of the case by a foreign court lack relevance [nav būtiskas nozīmes].', 'Having regard to the foregoing, the Senate finds that the judgment of the Limassol District Court (Cyprus) of 24 May 2004 must be recognised and enforced in Latvia.', 'Article 36 of the [Brussels I] Regulation provides that a foreign judgment may under no circumstances be reviewed as to its substance; in accordance with section 644(1) of the Civil Procedure Law, once such judgments have been recognised they are to be enforced in accordance with the conditions laid down by that Law. ...”', '35. On 14 February 2007 the Latgale District Court, basing its decision on the Supreme Court judgment, issued a payment order (izpildu raksts). The applicant complied immediately with the terms of the order and paid the bailiff employed by the claimant company a total of 90,244.62 Latvian lati (LVL, approximately 129,000 euros (EUR)), comprising LVL 84,366.04 for the principal debt and LVL 5,878.58 in enforcement costs. He then requested that the charge on his property in Garkalne be lifted. In two orders dated 24 January 2008 the judge with responsibility for land registers (Zemesgrāmatu nodaļas tiesnesis) refused the request. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Senate of the Supreme Court, which, in an order of 14 May 2008, lifted the charge on his property.']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-1'],[],0

The applicants were born in 1971 and 1970 respectively and live in Strumica. They were police officers.', '6. On 3 March 2005 the public prosecutor ordered, under sections 42(2)(2) and 142-b of the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 31 and 32 below), special investigative measures including secret surveillance, audio-visual recording, a simulated offer of a bribe and the use of undercover agents (the last two measures were to be applied by six police officers whose identity remained undisclosed in the order). The order was valid between 15 March and 13 May 2005. It was issued on the basis of a request from the Department for Control and Professional Standards within the Ministry of the Interior, which suspected that traffic police officers had been accepting bribes from traffic offenders.', '7. On 28 April 2005 the applicants stopped a car near Strumica, since it was being driven at more than 30 km/h over the stipulated speed limit. The driver was a certain K.N. from Skopje (“the driver”). The applicants warned the driver and registered his name and the fact that they had warned him in the official record. They did not draw up an official report (записник), nor did they press charges against him.', '8. On 8 June 2005 the Ministry of the Interior (“the Ministry”) lodged a criminal complaint with the public prosecutor, alleging that the applicants had accepted a bribe of 500 Macedonian denars (MKD) from the driver (who was in fact an undercover agent, see paragraph 6 above) in exchange for not drawing up an official report and pressing charges against him. The complaint stated that the first applicant had fully admitted to the accusations and the second applicant had partially done so.', '9. On 12 July 2005 an investigating judge of the Strumica Court of First Instance (“the trial court”) opened an investigation into the allegation that the applicants had accepted a bribe. In the proceedings before the investigating judge the applicants remained silent.', '10. According to the indictment of 19 September 2005, the applicants accepted the bribe in exchange for not drawing up a report and instituting misdemeanour proceedings against the driver. The public prosecutor requested that the trial court take oral evidence from the accused and admit the evidence obtained as a result of the order of 3 March 2005 (see paragraph 6 above): four photographs; and an audio and video recording of the discussion between the applicants and the driver of 28 April 2005 (see paragraph 7 above).', '11. On 28 November 2005 the trial court admitted the evidence produced by the prosecutor. The applicants remained silent. On 30 November 2005 the court rendered a judgment in which it convicted the applicants and sentenced them to a suspended prison term of six months. On the basis of the audio recording of the incident, the court established that the driver had exceeded the speed limit. He had offered – and the applicants had accepted – money in exchange for not pressing charges against him. In this connection, the court noted that under the law the driver was liable to a fine (between MKD 4,000 and MKD 12,000) or thirty days’ imprisonment, as well as a compulsory security measure (driving ban), for such an offence.', '12. The applicants’ legal representatives, Ms M.G. and Mr V.Š., appealed against the judgment, arguing that there was no evidence to corroborate the applicants’ guilt. The audio evidence attested that the driver had offered the applicants money, but it did not establish that they had accepted it. Indeed, no bank notes marked in advance were found in their possession. The applicants further argued that under the applicable regulation, they had been authorised to warn the driverThe first applicant challenged the credibility of the audio recording, arguing that the transcript of the audio material was incomplete. The second applicant further complained that the trial court had neither examined the driver, nor confronted them with him.', '13. On 28 June 2006 the Štip Court of Appeal accepted the applicants’ appeals and ordered a re-examination of the case. In so doing, it found that the lower court had incorrectly established the facts and had not provided sufficient reasons for its judgment. In this connection, it stated that neither the photographs nor the audio evidence had established that the applicants had accepted the bribe from the driver, who had not been examined. It therefore instructed the trial court to re-examine already admitted evidence and to question the driver in order to establish whether he had offered, and the applicants had accepted, MKD 500 in exchange for not pressing charges against him. It further stated:', '“... other evidence should be admitted if necessary (confrontation between the accused and (the driver)).”', '14. At a hearing, before the trial court, held on 15 May 2007, the applicants denied that they had accepted money from the driver. They stated that they had been authorised, under the law, to warn him. They further contested the audio recording, arguing that there were gaps and interruptions in it. Mr V.Š., the applicants’ legal representative, asked the court to hear oral evidence from the driver, as ordered by the Court of Appeal (see paragraph 13 above), and to obtain information from the Ministry as to whether the money had been marked.', '15. On 21 May 2007 the trial court asked the Ministry to provide the name and address of the driver in order to examine and confront him with the applicants, “as instructed by the higher court”. It also sought information as to whether, under the order of 3 March 2005 (see paragraph 6 above), the money allegedly given to the applicants had been marked. In the absence of a reply, on 20 June 2007 the court repeated its enquiry. On 28 June 2007 the Ministry informed the court that the money had not been marked. That would have been the case had special investigative measures (audio and video recording) not been ordered. It further stated that the undercover agent (лице со прикриен идентитет) who had been used to simulate the offer of a bribe could be examined as a protected witness under section 147(2) and (3) of the consolidated version of the Criminal Proceedings Act (“the Act”), (which corresponded to section 142-c of the Act as amended in 2004, see paragraph 33 below).', '16. In a hearing held on 5 October 2007 the applicants objected to the court’s examining the driver. In this connection, they stated that there were three persons with the same initials (K.N.) as the driver employed in the Ministry.', '17. On 7 December 2007 the trial court examined the driver. According to the depositions taken on that date, he was regarded as a protected witness (заштитен сведок) and his examination was carried out under section 293 of the Act (which corresponds to section 270-a of the Act of 1997 as amended in 2004 (see paragraph 36 below)). The relevant parts of the court record of that date read as follows:', '“The protected witness should be examined in a special room only in the presence of the judge and the public prosecutor in order to protect his identity. Since there is no such room in the court building, [the applicants] and their representatives, (as well as) the entire public, were ordered, on the basis of an advance agreement (претходен договор), to go into the waiting room.', 'The accused and the lawyers did not object.', '...', 'The witness, whose pseudonym is K.N. (protected witness) from Skopje, fifty-years of age ... having been warned about the legal consequences of false testimony, states:', '‘At 3 p.m. on 28 April 2005, in accordance with the [public prosecutor’s] order, I drove to Strumica together with two other persons ... I deliberately exceeded the speed limit assuming that there would be a road patrol ... I was stopped ... (then he described the events concerning another car which the applicants had stopped at that time, when (one of the applicants) had allegedly received MKD 500 from the driver of that car) ... the policeman who took the money from the other driver approached me and I said that it was unfair that they should punish me unlike the other (driver), who had paid ... Then the other policeman, who still had (in his hands) my (driving) documents, told me ‘Ok, we won’t punish you either’ and gave the documents back to me. I asked them whether I should also reward them for having not punished me, as the (other) driver had done, to which (one of the applicants) replied ‘It will be fine if you give something’. I asked ‘how much should I give?’, and he replied ‘There is no pricelist for that, it’s up to you’. Then, I said ‘I’ll give you as much as (the other driver), MKD 500’. I took out from my pocket MKD 500 and gave them to (one of the applicants) ... I asked them whether they would press charges against me or issue any penalty, to which (one of the applicants) replied ‘Keep your mouth shut and drive on’ ...', '18. The public prosecutor further asked the driver whether the money had been marked, to which he replied negatively.', '19. The record further stated:', '“Since there are no further questions, the court decides to remove the protected witness from the court room and to call the accused and their lawyers. A transcript of the statement of the protected witness should be given to them so that they may put questions to him through the court, to which the protected witness should reply.', 'The accused and their lawyers were called to enter the court room and at that moment, they said, in a loud voice ‘We request exclusion of the adjudicating judge, the panel, the trial court and the Štip Court of Appeal, since (the judge) is conducting the proceedings unlawfully and is not following the instructions of the Appeal Court. It is so since we were removed from the court room for 45 minutes, instead of being confronted with the witness. We suspect that no one gave a statement, all the more so since the accused have already met the protected witness”.', '20. The court ordered an adjournment. On 7 and 13 December 2007 the presidents of the trial court and the Štip Court of Appeal respectively rejected the applicants’ requests for exclusion.', '21. A hearing held on 1 April 2008 was attended by the applicants and Ms M.G., their lawyer. The driver was absent. The court stated that there was no evidence that he had been properly summoned for the hearing. The applicants were served with a copy of the court record of 7 December 2007 and the driver’s statement. The court minutes stated:', '“... (the applicants) were told that they could put questions in writing, which the court would then forward to the protected witness in order for him to reply.”', '22. On 9 May 2008 the trial court held a hearing. It was attended by the applicants and Mr V.Š., their lawyer. The driver was not present, despite the fact that he had been properly summoned. Mr V.Š. stated:', '“I decline to examine the protected witness, K.N. and I object to the court record of 7 December 2007 since it is contradictory and untrue (Се откажувам од распит на заштитениот сведок К.Н. и приговарам на записниикот од 07.12.2007 бидејќи е контрадикторен и невистинит).”', '23. On 15 May 2008 the trial court held another hearing, at which the applicants confirmed that they had received the bill of indictment and understood the charges against them. Both applicants maintained that they would be represented by Mr V.Š. They further stated:', '“I maintain the statement given at the hearing of 15 May 2007 [see paragraph 14 above] and I have nothing to add”.', '24. The court then read aloud the driver’s statement of 7 December 2007 and admitted as evidence the public prosecutor’s order, four photographs, as well as the audio and video recording of the critical event. The applicants made no reference as to the examination of the driver.', '25. In the concluding remarks, Mr V.Š. denied that there was any material evidence that the applicants had committed the crime imputed to them; in particular, the video and audio material did not establish that they had received any money from the driver, nor had any marked bank notes been found in their possession. He further stated that:', '“... we object to the use of the term ‘protected witness’ since it is not disputed that the (applicants) and (the driver) knew each other ... they saw each other and it is unreasonable to use that person as a protected witness.”', '26. Both applicants stated:', '“I fully adhere to the concluding remarks of my representative. I want to add that I’m not guilty because I have not received any money”.', '27. On 16 May 2008 the trial court rendered a judgment in which it found the applicants guilty and sentenced them to six months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years. It established that they had accepted the bribe from the driver, a police officer who had been following the public prosecutor’s order to use special investigative techniques. They received MKD 500 in exchange for not pressing charges, despite the fact that the relevant law provided for a fine or thirty days’ imprisonment, coupled with a security measure, for such an offence. The audio evidence established that the driver had exceeded the speed limit and had offered – and the applicants had accepted – the money. In this connection, the court stated:', '“Following the instructions of the higher court, the (trial) court examined the driver with the pseudonym K.N. as a protected witness. He confirmed that he had been stopped on the day in question, since he had deliberately exceeded the speed limit ... [the applicants] had agreed to accept a bribe in the amount of MKD 500 in exchange for not drawing up a report and pressing charges.', 'In this context, the statement of the protected witness and the audio material are totally consistent ... In the note [of 28 June 2006], [the Ministry of the Interior] submitted that the identity of the witness K.N. was protected, i.e. that he was a protected witness. [For this reason] the court did not confront him with [the applicants].”', '28. The applicants appealed against the judgment and maintained that there had been insufficient evidence that they had accepted the money. They argued that there had been no written warrant authorising the operation that had led to the proceedings against them; that the bank notes had not been marked; that they had not taken possession of any such bank notes; that the audio material had not established that they had accepted the bribe; and that the warning issued against the driver had been registered in the official records and had been prescribed for such offences. They further complained that their conviction had been based, to a decisive extent, on the driver’s statement and the audio material, the credibility of which they had challenged. As to the driver, they complained that it had been unreasonable to use him as a protected witness since they had already met him. They further complained that:', '“The statement (of the driver) was taken in the absence of the accused and the defence ... the accused and the defence were not allowed to put questions to that person; there was no confrontation between that person and the accused”.', '29. In a public hearing held on 18 November 2008 in the presence of the applicants and their lawyers, the Štip Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicants, finding no grounds to depart from the established facts and reasons given by the trial court. It found that the special investigating measures (audio-visual recording and the use of a protected witness) had been ordered by the public prosecutor in accordance with the Criminal Proceedings Act (see paragraphs 31 and 33 below). Accordingly, the judgment could be based on that evidence and the driver’s statement, as lawfully obtained evidence. The court further stated that:', '“Having regard to the Court of Appeal’s judgment Кж.бр.474/06 of 28 June 2006, at the re-trial, the trial court summoned, and at a hearing (главен претрес) it examined the witness K.N., who was driving the car at the relevant time ... This witness was considered a protected witness by the court. On the basis of an agreement reached with the accused and their representatives, [the witness] was examined in their absence. However, after his examination, the court provided the accused and their representatives with the opportunity to put questions through the court.', '... For the offence committed (by the driver), the accused neither drew up a report nor did they press charges against him, despite the fact that the offence was of a more serious nature ... they warned him orally, although a fine and a compulsory security measure – a driving ban – are prescribed for this offence.', 'The witness K.N. provides an objective and detailed description of the events ... Indeed, the MKD 500 bank note which the accused received from this witness had not been marked and secured as evidence, but the court undoubtedly established, on the basis of the statement of this witness, that he had offered – and (the applicants) had accepted – the money as a bribe. The statement of this witness is corroborated by the written transcript of the audio material ... so, the established facts are not put into question ...”', '30. This judgment was served on the applicants on 15 and 19 December 2008 respectively.', '31. Under section 42(2)(2) of the Act, as regards criminal offences subject to automatic prosecution by the State, the public prosecutor may order the use of a special investigative technique in pre-trial proceedings under the conditions and in the manner specified by law.', '32. Section 142-b of the Act provides that special investigative techniques may be ordered where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that certain criminal offences have been committed by an organised group. Secret surveillance, audio-visual recordings, a simulated offer of a bribe and the use of undercover agents (лица со прикриен идентитет) are among the special investigative techniques permitted (section 142-b(1) (3), (4) and (6)).', '33. Section 142-c provides that information, documents and objects obtained by means of special investigative measures may be used as evidence in criminal proceedings. The undercover agents can be examined as protected witnesses. Their identity is classified (службена тајна).', '34. Under section 142-d(3), the use of special investigative techniques at the pre-trial stage may be ordered by an investigating judge in a reasoned written decision following a reasoned written request by the public prosecutor, or by the public prosecutor in a reasoned written decision following a reasoned written request by the Ministry, but only in respect of a person whose identity is unknown.', '35. Under section 142-e(4) of the Act, evidence obtained through special investigative techniques cannot be used at trial if the techniques were applied without an order by the investigating judge or the public prosecutor or contrary to the Act.', '36. Under section 270-a of the Act, the public prosecutor, investigating judge or trial judge must take measures to ensure the effective protection of witnesses if there is a risk that they may be threatened or that their life, health or physical integrity may be endangered. Their protection must be guaranteed by means of special arrangements for the examination of the witnesses and their participation in the proceedings. Protected witnesses are examined in the presence of the public prosecutor, the investigating judge or the trial judge, in a location which guarantees the protection of their identity, unless they agree to be examined using special streaming media, for which a court order is needed. An unsigned copy of the witness’s statement is forwarded to the accused and his or her representative, who can put questions in writing through the court.', '37. In accordance with section 339(1), the court decided on the basis of facts and evidence admitted at the trial.', '38. Under section 380(3) of the Act, the trial court was bound to take all procedural actions and to discuss all disputed issues indicated in the judgment of the second-instance court.', '39. Under section 270-b of the Act, special arrangements for the examination of a protected witness may involve concealment of his or her identity and face. If the arrangements concern the witness’s personal information, he or she may produce evidence under a pseudonym (псевдоним). Otherwise, the general rules for the examination of witnesses apply. A witness who is examined under a pseudonym may also have his or her face concealed (прикривање на изгледот) with the use of special streaming media, which distort one’s voice and face. The protected witness must be placed in a special room that is physically separated from the courtroom in which the investigating or trial judge, as well as other persons attending the examination, are present.', '40. Under section 339(3) of the Act, the judgment cannot be based solely on evidence given by a protected witness and obtained by means of witness protection.']",[],[],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-d'],0

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Perm.', '6. On 21 October 2006 the applicant was arrested on suspicion of extortion, kidnapping and fraud. Two days later the Leninskiy District Court of Perm authorised his detention.', '7. On 21 December 2006 the District Court held a hearing on extension of the applicant’s detention. The applicant asked to postpone the hearings for five days because his counsel was sick and could not attend. The District Court dismissed the request, assigned lawyer N. to represent the applicant, proceeded with the hearing and extended the applicant’s detention. The applicant’s objection to the participation of N. on account of their different defence strategies and N.’s limited knowledge of the case-file was also dismissed.', '8. The applicant and his counsel appealed, complaining, in particular, about a breach of the applicant’s right to defend himself through legal assistance of his own choosing. On 18 January 2007 the Perm Regional Court upheld the detention order of 21 December 2006, having also noted that the legal aid lawyer N. had been appointed because the detention matter “had to be examined immediately”.', '9. On 19 January 2007 the District Court once again extended the applicant’s detention. On 8 February 2007 the Regional Court held the appeal hearing without informing the applicant in advance about the hearing date. The applicant’s counsel attended the appeal hearing and made oral submissions. The Regional Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the detention order of 19 January 2007.', '10. The applicant’s detention was further extended on several occasions. In particular, on 16 March 2007 the measure of restraint was prolonged until 4 April 2007.', '11.

Five days later, on 26 March 2007, the trial court scheduled a preliminary hearing for 3 April 2007 and ruled that, in the meantime, the measure of restraint in respect of the applicant should remain unchanged until the preliminary hearing. The decision was delivered in a written procedure (without the parties being present).', '12. The applicant appealed, complaining, among other matters, that that decision in the part relating to his detention was unlawful and that it had been delivered in his and his lawyer’s absence. On 14 May 2007 the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation upheld the decision, having found, in particular, that the trial judge’s decision was no more than a restatement of the detention order of 16 March 2007 extending the applicant’s detention until 4 April 2007 (see paragraph 10 above).', '13.

At the time of the expropriation of the applicants’ land, the cadastral value of real estate within the perimeter of a town or city was determined in accordance with regulation no. 94 of 12 April 1994 concerning the valuation of urban land (Noteikumi “Par pilsētu zemes vērtēšanu”), which was in force until 12 June 1998. To the extent that it is pertinent in the present case, the preamble to the text contained the following definitions:', '“... Cadastral value of a plot of land – the urban-planning and economic value of a plot of land, formulated in pecuniary terms.', '...', 'Model value of a plot of land [zemes paraugvērtība] – maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a value zone [vērtību zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim.', 'De facto model value of a plot of land [zemes faktiskā paraugvērtība] – maximum value of a square metre of urban land situated in a specific territory of a value zone [vērtību zona] for the purposes of its exploitation for a specific aim.', '...', 'Value zone – a portion of urban territory corresponding to a constant set of data characterising the value of real estate.', '...”', '7. Article 5 stipulated that the regulation was inapplicable to the determination of the market value of urban land. For the purposes of valuation, urban territory was to be divided into value zones based on the general land-use plan. The capital, Riga, was to be divided into seven or more zones (Article 7). Under Article 8, the main zoning criteria were as follows:', '“...', '1. position [of land] in relation to the city centre;', '2. level of development of public-works infrastructure and social services;', '3. attractiveness of territory;', '4. ecological conditions and consequences of negative factors;', '5. local geological conditions;', '...”', '8. Article 24 of the regulation laid down the methodology for the calculation of the model value (paraugvērtība) of a plot of land. For cities such as Riga, the model value did not have to be specially calculated because it corresponded to a scale in annex no. 2 to the regulation. In order to establish the de facto model value (faktiskā paraugvērtība), it was necessary to calculate the difference between the model value of the zone in question and the adjacent zone, multiply it by the distance from the next zone, then divide the result by the width of the zone in question, and, lastly, add the corresponding model value from the fixed scale (Article 25). The de facto model value then had to be adjusted to take account of any buildings erected on the land (Article 26).', '9. The de facto model value had to be multiplied by the surface area of the plot of land for its cadastral value to be obtained. It was then subject to adjustment within a limit of 20% to take account of certain positive or negative factors (Articles 30-34). The calculation of the cadastral value of land was the responsibility of the State Land Authority (Valsts Zemes dienests).', '10. The relevant provisions of the Civil Code (Civillikums) read as follows:', '“Where the contract provides for the payment of interest, its percentage shall be fixed, failing which it shall be presumed that the statutory rate (see Article 1765) has been tacitly agreed.”', '“The interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where the payment of statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum. Interest may be calculated only on the capital itself. However, should the interest not be paid within the allotted time in respect of one year or more, from that time onwards, at the creditor’s request, statutory interest shall be calculated on the interest then accruing”.', '“The interest rate shall be clearly established in the deed or contract. Failing that, as in cases where statutory interest is required by law, the rate shall be six per cent per annum.', 'The interest rate for late payment of a pecuniary debt provided for under a contract as consideration for the delivery or purchase of a good or service, shall be eight per cent [“seven per cent” before 26 June 2013] above the base rate (Article 1765, third paragraph) per annum; as to contractual relations to which a consumer is party, [the base rate shall be] six per cent per annum.', 'The interest base rate shall be four per cent.

The applicant, Mr Jukka Tapani Heinänen, is a Finnish national, who was born in 1962 and lives in Espoo. He was represented before the Court by Mr Jyrki Kuusivaara, a lawyer practising in Helsinki.', '2. The Finnish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr Arto Kosonen of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. The applicant owns all the shares in two limited liability companies. Apparently, in spite of their being limited liability companies, he was the only person running them.', '5. In 2004 the tax authorities carried out a tax inspection in the first company and concluded that it had failed to declare and pay a considerable amount of tax and that it had, inter alia, paid salaries off the books and undertaken other fraudulent activities. It appeared that the company had been operating entirely on the black market.', '6. The tax authorities carried out a tax inspection in the second company after the police investigation concerning the applicant’s activities had been concluded in 2007.', '7. On 2 November 2007 the tax authorities imposed additional tax and tax surcharges (veronkorotus, skatteförhöjning) on the applicant for the tax years 2004 and 2005 as they found that the applicant had withdrawn cash from the second company which the tax authorities considered as disguised dividends.', '8. On 27 January 2010 the tax authorities imposed additional taxes and tax surcharges on the applicant for the tax year 2004 as they found that the applicant had also withdrawn cash from the first company which was considered as disguised dividends.', '9. The applicant apparently did not appeal against those decisions. The period set for appeal in tax matters is five years counted from the beginning of the calendar year following the year when the initial taxation decision was made. Therefore, the taxation concerning the tax years 2004 and 2005 became final on 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 respectively.', '10. On 18 May 2005 the local tax office requested the police to investigate the applicant’s activities in relation to the first company. On 14 November 2006 the applicant was arrested. On 20 November 2006 a police investigation into the applicant’s actions in the second company was initiated.', '11. On 29 June 2007 the prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for, inter alia, aggravated accounting offence (törkeä kirjanpitorikos, grovt bokföringsbrott) and aggravated tax fraud (törkeä veropetos, grovt skattebedrägeri) concerning his activities as the owner of the two companies.', '12. On 11 April 2008 the District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) delivered its judgment. The applicant appealed against this judgment to the Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), alleging that one of the lay judges sitting in the case had been partial. On 27 June 2008 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal. However, on 6 February 2009 the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen) accepted the applicant’s appeal and quashed the lower courts’ judgments. The case was referred back to the District Court for a new examination.', '13. On 19 February 2009 the prosecutor repeated the charges. Four counts concerned the applicant’s activity in the first company from 2003 to 2005 and four counts concerned the applicant’s activity in the second company from 2004 to 2005. According to the charges, the applicant was accused of aggravated tax fraud as he had failed to submit a tax declaration for both companies and, consequently, no income tax had been paid or imposed on the companies. On another count of aggravated tax fraud the applicant was accused of not declaring the salaries paid and, consequently, the taxes and social security payments had been too low. The tax authorities joined the charges and presented a compensation claim totalling approximately the amount of avoided taxes.', '14. On 13 November 2009 the District Court convicted the applicant, inter alia, of two counts of aggravated tax fraud for having failed to submit a tax declaration for the two companies in question for the tax years 2004 and 2005. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 8 months and ordered, together with another convicted person, to pay the tax authorities 435,742.99 euros (EUR) plus interest in compensation. The court also ordered an extended forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. In addition, the applicant was banned from undertaking business activities for five years.', '15. By letter dated 12 December 2009 the applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, requesting that the District Court’s judgment be partly quashed and that a part of the charges be dismissed. He admitted some of the charges. The applicant relied also on the principle of ne bis in idem and the Court’s case-law in that respect with regard to the aggravated tax fraud and the tax surcharges imposed on him in the meantime.', '16. On 23 December 2010, after having held an oral hearing, the Court of Appeal upheld the District Court’s judgment. It considered that, as the prosecutor had pressed charges for the first time on 29 June 2007 and the tax surcharges were imposed only after that date, the ne bis in idem principle could not prevent the examination of charges.', '17. By letter dated 21 February 2011 the applicant appealed to the Supreme Court, reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal.', '18. On 20 June 2012 the Supreme Court, after having examined the question of extended forfeiture of the proceeds of crime and quashed a part of it, upheld the Court of Appeal’s judgment otherwise.', '19. Section 57, subsection 1, of the Tax Assessment Procedure Act (laki verotusmenettelystä, lagen om beskattningsförfarande, Act no. 1558/1995, as amended by Act no. 1079/2005) provides that if a person has failed to make the required tax returns or has given incomplete, misleading or false information to the tax authorities and tax has therefore been incompletely or partially levied, the taxpayer shall be ordered to pay unpaid taxes together with additional tax and a tax surcharge.', '20. According to Chapter 29, sections 1 and 2, of the Penal Code (rikoslaki, strafflagen, as amended by Acts no. 1228/1997 and no. 769/1990), a person who (1) gives a tax authority false information on a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (2) files a tax return concealing a fact that influences the assessment of tax, (3) for the purpose of avoiding tax, fails to observe a duty pertaining to taxation, influencing the assessment of tax, or (4) acts otherwise fraudulently and thereby causes or attempts to cause a tax not to be assessed, or too low a tax to be assessed or a tax to be unduly refunded, shall be sentenced for tax fraud to a fine or to imprisonment for a period of up to two years. If by the tax fraud (1) considerable financial benefit is sought or (2) the offence is committed in a particularly methodical manner and the tax fraud is aggravated when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be sentenced for aggravated tax fraud to imprisonment for a period between four months and four years.', '21. The Supreme Court has taken a stand on the ne bis in idem principle in its precedent case KKO 2010:46 which concerned tax surcharges and aggravated tax fraud. In that case it found, inter alia, that even though a final judgment in a taxation case, in which tax surcharges had been imposed, prevented criminal charges being brought about the same matter, such preventive effect could not be applied to pending cases (lis pendens) crossing from administrative proceedings to criminal proceedings or vice versa. However, in July 2013 the Supreme Court reversed its line of interpretation, finding that charges for tax fraud could no longer be brought if there was already a decision to order or not to order tax surcharges in the same matter (KKO 2013:59).', '22. The Act on Tax Surcharges and Customs Duty Surcharges Imposed by a Separate Decision (laki erillisellä päätöksellä määrättävästä veron- tai tullinkorotuksesta, lagen om skatteförhöjning och tullhöjning som påförs genom ett särskilt beslut, Act no. 781/2013) entered into force on 1 December 2013. According to the Act, the tax authorities can, when making a tax decision, assess whether to impose a tax surcharge or to report the matter to the police. The tax authorities can decide not to impose a tax surcharge. If they have not reported the matter to the police, a tax surcharge can be imposed by a separate decision by the end of the calendar year following the actual tax decision. If the tax authorities have imposed tax surcharges, they can no longer report the same matter to the police unless, after imposing the tax surcharges, they have received evidence of new or recently revealed facts. If the tax authorities have reported the matter to the police, tax surcharges can, as a rule, no longer be imposed. The purpose of the Act is thus to ensure that a tax or a customs duty matter is processed and possibly punished in only one set of proceedings. The Act does not, however, contain any transitional provisions extending its scope retroactively.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Mr Goran Marčan, is a Croatian national, who was born in 1967 and lives in Rijeka.', '2. The applicant is a lawyer practising in Rijeka.', '3. In the period between September 2002 and January 2004 the applicant acted as a privately-appointed defence lawyer for B.P., who was indicted in the Rijeka County Court (Županijski sud u Rijeci) on charges of abuse of power and authority and aiding and abetting the conclusion of onerous contracts.', '4. The applicant in particular, together with another lawyer, assumed B.P.’s defence at the hearings before an investigating judge. He also lodged several appeals concerning the decisions on B.P.’s pre-trial detention and he lodged an objection against the indictment. In this period he also had a number of meetings and consultations with his client in detention.', '5. During the trial B.P. retained the services of another lawyer, and the applicant was no longer representing him. On 18 April 2008 the Rijeka County Court acquitted B.P., and this was upheld on 16 October 2008 by the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske).', '6. When acquitting B.P. the Rijeka County Court did not rule on the entirety of the costs and expenses of the proceedings, reserving its decision in respect of further possible claims.', '7. On 26 February 2009 the applicant lodged a request with the Rijeka County Court seeking remuneration for his legal representation of B.P. during the period between September 2002 and January 2004. He relied on the 2004 Scale of Lawyers’ Fees (see paragraph 20 below) and claimed a total of 40,748 Croatian kunas (HRK; approximately EUR 5,500) as his fees in the proceedings, enumerated as follows:', '- HRK 7,600 for attending fifteen hearings before the investigating judge and four hearings before the three-judge panel (item 4 of the fee scale) between 9 September 2002 and 29 January 2004;', '- HRK 2,800 for drafting seven appeals lodged during the proceedings (item 5 of the fee scale);', '- HRK 300 for drafting an objection against the indictment (item 5 of the fee scale);', '- HRK 12,000 for 104 visits and consultations with his client in detention, amounting to some 120 hours, in the period between 9 September 2002 and 4 June 2003 (item 31 of the fee scale);', '- a special increase of 100 percent in respect of the complexity of the case for the first three amounts (item 37 of the fee scale); and', '- 22 percent VAT.', '8. On 4 March 2009 the Rijeka County Court awarded the applicant HRK 5,100 (approximately EUR 700) for attending the fifteen hearings before the investigating judge and drafting the appeals and objection against the indictment, and dismissed the remainder of his claim. The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“... [item 48 of] the 2004 fee scale ... provides that the 1993 fee scale applies to any work carried out before the former scale entered into force...', 'The fee scale applicable at the investigation stage did not provide that the lawyer was entitled to VAT, this [being] covered for the first time in the 2004 fee scale. Besides, according to the applicable 1993 fee scale ... item 3 provided that for preliminary proceedings lawyers were entitled to a single defence fee for the hearing under item 4.1, plus the hourly rate for every subsequent hour worked in the amount of 10 points, while under item 50 the value of one point was HRK 8 ...', '...', 'The hearings lasted a total of 28 hours and 55 minutes, and since the lawyer is entitled to a single defence fee of 40 points and the value of one point is HRK 8, the single defence fee amounts to HRK 320, while the hourly rate amounts to 280 points – 10 points per hour ... meaning that the lawyer is entitled to ... HRK 2,560 in total.', 'As regards the part of the lawyer’s claim [for the four hearings before the three-judge panel] it is to be noted that these were hearings before the ... first-instance court, and for such hearings the lawyer was not entitled to remuneration according to the applicable fee scale.', 'As regards ... the drafting of the seven appeals, the lawyer requests HRK 2,800 which is not entirely reasonable given that the value of one point at the relevant time was HRK 8, which means that the lawyer is entitled to HRK 2,240 and no VAT.', 'The claim of HRK 300 for drafting the objection against the indictment is reasonable, but the claim of HRK 12,000 for the meetings with his client is [not]. The lawyer is relying on item 31 of the fee scale which provides that for conferences and meetings where factual and legal matters were discussed with the client, opposing party and other participants in the client’s case, the lawyer shall be remunerated 50 points for every hour. It is clear that the lawyer did not attend any conferences where factual and legal matters were discussed ‘with the client, opposing party and other participants in the client’s case’ and the requested amount cannot be awarded to [him]. In addition, the applicable fee scale did not anticipate remuneration for every conversation [he had] with the defendant in detention ... as it is provided under the Scale of Lawyers’ Fees (Official Gazette, nos. 91/2004, 37/2005, 59/2007) and therefore he cannot be remunerated on this ground either.', 'As regards the lawyer’s claim under item 37 for a special increase in respect of the ‘complexity of the case’, such a claim is manifestly unreasonable ... as this particular case was not complex ...', 'From all the above-mentioned considerations it is to be concluded that the lawyer is entitled to HRK 5,100 but no VAT, as it was not covered in the applicable fee scale.”', '9. On 16 March 2009 the applicant lodged an appeal with a three-judge panel of the Rijeka County Court. He argued that he should have been awarded a single fee for each hearing before the investigating judge and that his claim should have been calculated on the basis of HRK 10 per point. Moreover, under item 42 of the fee scale he had been entitled to a lump sum increase of 25% on his remuneration. The applicant contended that the lengthy preparation of his client’s defence in detention which, in his view, had been crucial for a successful defence, had been unaccounted for. He also pointed out that the case file consisted of more than 10,000 pages, that the proceedings had lasted for more than seven years and that the trial court itself had released a public statement characterising the case as complex. Lastly, the applicant argued that he should be awarded VAT.', '10. On 27 January 2010 a three-judge panel of the Rijeka County Court awarded the applicant an additional amount of HRK 1,122 (approximately EUR 150) in respect of VAT, and dismissed the remainder of his complaints. In particular, the three-judge panel explained that the applicant was not entitled to any remuneration for the visits to his client in detention under item 31 of the fee scale as it had not concerned conferences involving other participants in the proceedings. He was also not entitled to a lump sum increase of 25% as it was not clear for what ancillary actions he should be granted such an increase.', '11. On 5 March 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske', '“... when a request for remuneration of costs by a defence lawyer is not recognised, the defence rights are breached. [B.P.’s] lawyer was a lawyer of his own choosing. A person of his confidence. In order for the defence to be on equal footing with the prosecution, the defence lawyer must be remunerated for his work. ... When the accused is acquitted the costs for all actions aimed at the defence of his innocence must be remunerated. Only then are the parties to the proceedings on an equal footing. Only then is there equality before the law. A refusal to remunerate the lawyer for his fees breaches Articles 14 § 2 and 29 §§ 1 and 2 of the Constitution. A trial where the lawyer is brought into a position that the costs of his work are not recognised is not and cannot be a fair trial.', 'Perhaps it would be best if the lawyer would not even be there?', 'By not recognising the lawyer’s costs according to the fee scale, Article 27 of the Constitution is breached. If the lawyer’s right to a fair remuneration is not recognised the autonomy and independence of the legal profession is disturbed. Autonomy and independence presuppose remuneration [of work]. The legal profession cannot be autonomous and independent if the court without any reasons or arguments refuses to recognise the lawyer’s right to remuneration for his work. How can the principle of autonomy and independence [of the legal profession] be secured when the court considers that such autonomy and independence should not be remunerated. And this all [occurs] in a situation where the defendant was acquitted. ...”', '12. On 27 May 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the applicant’s constitutional complaint inadmissible on the ground that the contested decisions did not concern any of his civil rights or obligations or any criminal charge against him. The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“Article 62 of [the Constitutional Court Act] reads:', '‘Anyone may lodge a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court if he or she deems that the individual act of a state body ... concerning his or her rights and obligations, or a suspicion or an accusation of a criminal offence, has violated his or her human rights or fundamental freedoms ... guaranteed by the Constitution (hereinafter “a constitutional right”).’', 'It follows that only a decision by which the competent court decided on the merits of a legal matter, that is to say on the rights and obligations, or a suspicion or an accusation of a criminal offence, is an individual act within the meaning of section 62 § 1 of the Constitutional Court Act, in respect of which the Constitutional Court is obliged, upon a constitutional complaint, to protect the human rights or fundamental freedoms of an appellant guaranteed under the Constitution.', 'In the proceedings before the Constitutional Court it was established that the impugned decisions are not individual acts within the meaning of section 62 § 1 of the Constitutional Court Act, in respect of which the Constitutional Court is obliged to provide constitutional protection.', 'It was therefore decided, under section 72 of the Constitutional Court Act, as noted in the operative part of this decision.”', '13.

The applicants were born in 1964, 1935, 1963, 1965 and 1963 respectively.', '8. The status of Churches and religious societies is governed mainly by Articles 137 to 141 (known as the “Church Articles” – Kirchenartikel) of the Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919 (Weimarer Reichsverfassung), as incorporated into the Basic Law by Article 140 of that Law. A couple of Churches and religious societies, including the Catholic Church (about 23.7 million members) and the Protestant Church of Germany (about 22.2 million members), commonly known as the two “big Churches” (Grosskirchen), have the status of publiclaw entities. Other religious denominations have legal capacity under civil law.', '9. As regards their financing, churches and religious societies with the status of public-law entities are entitled to levy a church tax, which accounts for a significant portion of their total budget. The churches decide independently whether to levy a tax and what its rate should be. The rate of church tax has been over many years either 8% or 9% of the tax on an individual’s income and, in most German Länder, is collected by the State tax authorities on behalf of churches and religious societies, which in return pay 3% to 5% of their tax revenue to the State.', '10. The church tax is guaranteed by Article 140 of the Basic Law read in conjunction with Article 137 § 6 of the Weimar Constitution (see paragraph 49 below). Only members of a particular religious denomination authorised to levy the tax are obliged to pay it. Any church member who does not want to pay church tax can leave that church by declaration towards the authorities.', '11. If spouses are members of different churches entitled to levy taxes (konfessionsverschiedene Ehe) and if they have opted for a joint income tax assessment (gemeinsame steuerliche Veranlagung), both churches levy the tax on the spouses in the form of an additional levy on the income tax of both spouses. The amount of each spouse’s church tax is calculated on the basis of half of the declared income tax.', '12. In marriages where only one spouse belongs to a church entitled to levy taxes (glaubensverschiedene Ehe), the church entitled to the tax levies it in accordance with that person’s tax assessment. Churches calculate the tax on the basis of the income tax attributable to the spouse liable to pay tax rather than on the basis of that spouse’s share of the total income. According to the Federal Constitutional Court’s settled case-law, if the spouse belonging to a church has no income in terms of the regulations of the Income Tax Code, the church tax cannot be levied (see 56 paragraph below). In that case, in some German Länder (inter alia, BadenWürttemberg, Bavaria and Thuringia), the church entitled to levy taxes charges its members a special “church fee” (besonderes Kirchgeld). Although called a fee, the levy is, however, treated legally as a tax. The church fee amounts to about one-third of the relevant church tax.', '13. Churches only levy the special church fee if spouses decide on a joint income tax assessment. The special church fee is not levied if spouses make separate tax declarations (getrennte Veranlagung). It is important to note that in case of a joint income tax assessment the spouses benefit from a special calculation method for the income tax (the so-called “incomesplitting”, “Splitting-Verfahren”) and furthermore from the progressive effect (Steuerprogression) of the German tax system, which generally leads to a lower tax burden.', '14. If spouses decide on a joint income tax assessment, they submit a tax declaration (Steuererklärung). In most of the German Länder (except of the Land of Bavaria), in their tax calculation procedure (Steuererhebungverfahren) the tax authorities set the special church fee according to the calculation regulations of each church. The basis for calculating the special church fee is the church member’s living expenses (Lebensführungsaufwand), which are calculated on the basis of the spouses’ joint income. The special church fee is only levied on the spouse who is a church member. The remaining tax liability is applied to both spouses.', '15. If a tax authority’s calculation on income tax leads to a tax reimbursement for the spouse not being a member of a church and who is liable to pay income tax, only that spouse will be credited with it. At the same time, the special church fee levied on one spouse can be offset against any tax reimbursement due to the other spouse. If the calculation of the income tax leads to a demand to pay more tax, offsetting cannot take place.', '16. Either spouse can file an objection (Einspruch) against that part of the tax bill which applies to them. If the special church fee has been offset against a tax reimbursement due to the spouse who is not a member of a church that spouse can apply for a settlement notice (Abrechnungsbescheid) in accordance with Article 218 of the Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung, see paragraph 51 below) and thus have the possibility to be repaid the offset amount.', '17. The facts of the cases, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '18. The first applicant lives in Heidelberg, in the Land of BadenWürttemberg. He is married. His wife is member of the Protestant Church, which is authorised to levy church taxes. In 2005 the first applicant left his church and was no longer obliged to pay church taxes.', '19. For the tax assessment period of 2008 the spouses opted for a joint tax assessment.', '20. Their 2008 tax bill, dated 22 April 2010, included a special church fee for the first applicant’s wife of 2,220 euros (EUR). As the spouses were jointly liable for income tax and the applicant’s wife’s income was below the minimum taxable amount, the wife’s special church fee was calculated as a proportion of her living expenses, which in turn were calculated on the basis of the spouses’ joint income (see paragraphs 12-14 above).', '21. The tax bill applied to both the first applicant and his wife. Page one showed the authority’s tax calculation (Ergebnis des Steuererhebungsverfahrens) in a table, with one column for income tax (Einkommensteuer), one for solidarity tax (Solidaritätszuschlag) and one headed “Protestant Church tax, wife” (Kirchensteuer evangelisch Ehefrau). The third column showed the amount of EUR 2,220. The table further showed that the first applicant had a tax reimbursement claim of EUR 3,423.00, which had been offset against the church fee of EUR 2,220 of his wife. It finished with a credit for the first applicant of EUR 1,203.00.', '22. Pages two to four of the tax bill contained a detailed assessment of the taxable annual income of the first applicant and his wife. The document then had explanations of the items. Line 40, out of 114 lines of explanations altogether, stated as follows:', '“Only the wife is liable for church tax.”', 'Following the explanations, the tax bill provided information on possible legal remedies. As regards the special church fee, it stated as follows:', '“An objection can be raised to the setting of the church tax and to the fixing of advance payment of church tax. ... An objection can be filed by the person on whom the church tax has been levied” (“Gegen die Kirchensteuerfestsetzung und die Festsetzung der Kirchensteuervorauszahlung ist der Einspruch gegeben. ... Zur Einlegung des Einspruches ist derjenige befugt, gegen den sich die Kirchensteuerfestsetzung richtet.”).', '23. The first applicant filed an objection against the tax bill. On 17 December 2010 the tax office dismissed the objection, referring to the Federal Constitutional Court’s decision of 28 October 2010, fully endorsing its reasoning (see paragraph 32 below).', '24. The second applicant lives in Sulzbach-Rosenberg in the German Land of Bavaria.', '25. The second applicant is a member of the Protestant Church. In 2005 he had an annual income of EUR 10,144. His wife, who was not member of a church, had income of EUR 162,522. In 2005, the second applicant and his wife were jointly liable for annual income tax.', '26. On 7 February 2007 the competent tax office charged the second applicant a special church fee of EUR 1,500. The fee was calculated on the basis of his living expenses, which in turn were calculated on the basis of his and his wife’s income (see paragraphs 12-14 above).', '27. The second applicant filed an objection to the decision. On 12 December 2007 the tax office dismissed the objection, relying on the Federal Constitutional Court’s case-law that has been settled since 1965 (see paragraphs 56-58 below).', '28. The second applicant lodged an action with the Nuremberg Tax Court, asserting a violation of his basic rights.', '29. On 18 June 2009 the Tax Court dismissed the action. It argued that the special church fee had not violated the second applicant’s right to equality or his right to freedom of religion or freedom of action and relied on the Federal Constitutional Court’s settled case-law. It refused leave to appeal.', '30. On 29 January 2010 the Federal Tax Court dismissed an appeal by the second applicant against the decision refusing him leave to appeal and endorsed the Nuremberg Tax Court’s reasoning.', '31. On 14 April 2010 the second applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. He argued that he had no income and therefore could not pay the special church fee on his own because it had been calculated on the basis of both spouses’ income. As a consequence, the freedom of religion of both spouses had been violated and spouses in their kind of marriage had been discriminated against when compared with other kinds of marriage. The second applicant argued that he could only remain a member of his religious community if his spouse was willing to pay his special church fee, otherwise he would have to sue her for maintenance.', '32. On 28 October 2010, the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the second applicant’s constitutional complaint (file no. 2 BvR 816/10) after joining it, inter alia, with those of the third, fourth and fifth applicants. It considered that the constitutional complaint had not touched on any constitutional questions which needed to be decided as the relevant questions had been settled in a judgment delivered on 14 December 1965 (file no. 1 BvR 606/60, see paragraph 57 below). That judgment was still applicable and there was no doubt that the calculation of a person’s living expenses on the basis of the spouses’ income was in conformity with constitutional law.', '33. The third and fourth applicants are a married couple who live in Gera in the German Land of Thuringia. The third applicant is a member of the Protestant Church and had the higher income of the two. The fourth applicant is not a member of a church. In 2004 the third applicant’s income amounted to EUR 53,511 while the fourth applicant’s income was EUR 11,720. In 2005 the sums were EUR 55,033 and EUR 4,928 respectively, while in 2006 they were EUR 54,996 and EUR 12,640.', '34. On 29 August 2005, 5 February 2006 and 26 June 2008 the competent tax office levied church tax on the third applicant for the years 2004 to 2006. As the applicants had opted for a joint tax assessment, the third applicant’s church tax was calculated with his income tax as a proportion of the income tax attributable to him, rather than in proportion to his share of the spouses’ total income (see paragraph 12 above).', '35. On 23 June 2008 the competent tax office dismissed an objection by the third and fourth applicants against the church tax calculation.', '36. The two applicants lodged an action with the Gera Tax Court, asserting a violation of their basic rights.', '37. On 31 March 2009 the Tax Court dismissed the action, arguing that the calculation had not violated their right to equality or freedom of religion. The court stressed that the German tax authorities had a wide margin of appreciation regarding tax regulations. The fact therefore that the third applicant’s church calculated its church tax on the base of a percentage of his income tax rather than on a percentage of income raised no doubts as to its legitimacy. The tax court refused leave to appeal.', '38. On 8 May 2009 the third and fourth applicants appealed against the decision refusing them leave to appeal, alleging, inter alia, a violation of their freedom of religion. They argued that in spite of the fourth applicant’s decision not to be member of a religious community, the tax authorities had taken her income into account when calculating her husband’s church tax.', '39. On 16 November 2009 the Federal Tax Court declared the applicants’ appeal inadmissible for lack of sufficient reasoning.', '40. On 21 January 2010 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, alleging a violation of their right to equality and freedom of religion.', '41. On 28 October 2010, the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the third and fourth applicants’ constitutional complaint after joining it, inter alia, with those of the second and fifth applicants (file no. 2 BvR 2715/09, see paragraph 32 above).', '42. The fifth applicant lives in Nuremberg, situated in the German Land of Bavaria. In 2004 and 2005 the fifth applicant, who had no income, was a member of the Protestant Church of the German Land of Bavaria. Her husband was not member of a church. The spouses opted for a joint income tax assessment for 2004 and 2005.', '43. The competent tax authority levied no church tax on the fifth applicant as she had no income, but on 2 February 2007 applied a special church fee of EUR 3,600 for 2005 and on 27 June 2007 it charged her EUR 1,860 for 2004. The amounts were calculated on the basis of the fifth applicant’s living expenses, which were calculated on the basis of her and her husband’s joint income.', '44. The fifth applicant raised an objection against those decisions and applied for a suspension of enforcement. On 23 October 2008 the tax office dismissed her objection, arguing that there had been no violation of the right to equality because there had been an objective and reasonable justification for the difference in treatment.', '45. The fifth applicant lodged an action with the Nuremberg Tax Court, again applying to have enforcement suspended and asserting a violation of her right to equality.', '46. On 15 June 2009 the Tax Court dismissed the request for suspension of enforcement, arguing that the special church fee did not violate the fifth applicant’s right to equality in view of the Federal Constitutional Court’s settled case-law.', '47. On 22 July 2009 the fifth applicant lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court, alleging, inter alia, a violation of her right to freedom of religion. She argued that she could not remain in her religious community if her husband, who was not a church member, did not agree to pay her special church fee.', '48. On 28 October 2010, the Federal Constitutional Court declined to consider the fifth applicant’s constitutional complaint after joining it, inter alia, with those of the second, third and fourth applicants (file no. 2 BvR 1689/09, see paragraph 32 above).']",[],[],[],['9'],['9-1'],[],0

The applicants, Ms Maria Tzilivaki, Mr Georgios Yianakakis and Mr Loucas Yianakakis, are Greek nationals who were born in 1969, 1939 and 1970 respectively and live in Chania, in Greece. They are represented before the Court by Mr E. Levantis, a lawyer practising in Athens.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '3. On 22 July 1974, during the Turkish invasion, a military aircraft carrying the 1st commando battalion of Chania, sent as reinforcements from Greece, was shot down by friendly fire in the area of Tymvos, in Makedonitissa. Out of the 32 commandos and crew only one survived. The victims included the first applicant’s brother, Stefanos Tzilivakis, and the son and brother of the second and third applicants respectively, Kosmas Gianakakis.', '4. According to army records, Stefanos Tzilivakis and Kosmas Gianakakis were buried in individual and marked plots in Lakatamia Cemetery on 22 July 1974. Not all the bodies of the victims of the crash had been recovered and buried separately. The crash site had been covered over and converted into a Memorial for all Greek soldiers killed in the conflict; some unidentified remains from the crash had been buried in an unnamed mass grave, due to the small size of the bones, at the Memorial itself. At the site, there was built a memorial as well as a military cemetery with a church. The site was regarded altogether as a monument for honouring and commemorating those who fell.', '5. In 1979, the army authorities exhumed and returned the bodies of 44 Greek soldiers killed in 1974 and buried in graves at Lakatamia Cemetery, including 16 victims of the crash. The remains from the grave bearing the name of Stefanos Tzilivakis were exhumed in the presence of his father and returned to the family in Greece on 3 September 1979. The grave bearing the name of Kosmas Gianakkis was exhumed in the presence of two of his brothers and returned to his relatives in Greece on 10 November 1979.', '6. Sometime later a doubt arose as to the correct identification of remains. Beginning in 1999, an organization PHR (“Physicians for Human Rights”) in agreement with the authorities conducted exhumations at Lakatamia and other cemeteries, in particular of unidentified remains. In a 2000 report, PHR stated that burials in 1974 had taken place “under confusing circumstances” and that it appeared that the identifications had not been objectively verified, resulting in many mistaken attributions of identity and that due to lack of expertise, incomplete skeletons had been removed and parts of several individuals had been mixed together.', '7. In 2001 the families of the victims, including the applicants’ families, were visited by experts involved in the exhumation of the remains of the victims and were asked to give blood with a view to proceeding to proper identifications.', '8. In June 2003 the first applicant’s family handed over to the Cypriot authorities for DNA tests the remains which they had been given in 1979. Following such tests, the first applicant and her family were informed that these remains received in 1979 had not been those of Stefanos Tzilivakis.', '9. In 2005, following testing of the remains given to the family of the second and third applicants and sent back to Cyprus, the family were informed that the remains contained parts of several other individuals.', '10. In February 2005, DNA tests disclosed that the remains buried under the name of S.Y. had included part of the remains of Stefanos Tzilivakis. The family was so informed. The applicant was informed in 2006 that further remnants of Stefanos Tzilivakis had been discovered.', '11. In 2006, it became apparent that the 22 remains returned to families represented at least 42 different individuals.', '12. The first applicant applied to the authorities in 2003 and 2004, urging that the crash site be excavated in order to find the remains of her brother that she thought must still be at that location. It is not apparent that the second or third applicants approached the authorities on this matter.', '13. By a letter dated 18 February 2004, the Director of the Diplomatic Office of the President informed the first applicant that instructions had already been given for the planning of the excavations. The letter stated as follows, in so far as relevant:', '“...', 'Before receiving your letter instructions had been given to start the planning for the excavation in Tymvos.', 'We had discussed the matter with the Greek Ambassador and following the instructions of the President of the Republic we are taking the necessary measures to excavate the site where the remains of the aircraft are and to exhume the remains which may have possibly been buried with them.', 'As I had told you orally we acknowledge the obligation to fully investigate the possibility that human remains have been buried with the aircraft remains; upon a possible finding of such remains and their forensic identification, we will give a reply to the family/families concerning the fate of their loved ones who fell while carrying out their duties for their country.', 'We also have an obligation in such a case to deliver the remains to the families so they can be buried with the befitting honour and in accordance with the religious rites and customs.', 'You appreciate that this task will take time and we therefore ask you to be patient.”', '14. By a letter dated 25 February 2004 the Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the first applicant that the authorities were doing everything possible to locate the remains of her deceased brother in order to end the agony and uncertainty of her family and of the families of the remaining victims.', '15. On 16 September 2003 the first applicant filed a complaint with the Commissioner of Administration (“Ombudsman”) against the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (complaint 1205/2003).', '16. In a letter dated 2 March 2004 the Ombudsman informed the first applicant that the Director General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had informed her that they were taking the necessary measures towards excavating the remains of the aircraft and to exhume the bodies that may have been buried there. In view of this the Ombudsman considered that there were no grounds for her continued intervention.', '17. The Government submitted that work was undertaken to identify all the available remains in order to clarify the situation before proceeding to any large-scale excavations at the Memorial site. They also stated that they were hampered in identifications by the decisions of some families not to participate in the return of remains for identification; it also appears that one family had destroyed the remains. They stated that a large part of the remains of Stefanos Tsilivakis were recuperated; as his commando badge and ID tags had been found at Lakatamia Cemetery, there were no strong grounds for assessing that his body had been left at the site and that it was more likely that his remains were with all those transferred to Lakatamia.', '18. Meanwhile several surveys and exploratory excavations were carried out at the Memorial site. This culminated in a PHR report of 22 July 2008 which stated that the unnamed remains stored at the Memorial site had been removed but their state was such that current DNA analysis methods had not been able to yield reliable results. It appears that there was a decision by the authorities not to proceed to excavate the site at this time due to', 'Unreliable evidence as to whether there were any bodies or remains buried under the Memorial site without being marked;', 'No indication from surveys and excavations that any remains were present at the site;', 'The incomplete DNA samples from families and return of remains which meant that there was no comprehensive identification of those who had been buried at Lakatamia Cemetery;', 'Concerns that the excavation would require the dismantling of the memorial erected on the site as well as disturbing existing graves at the cemetery on the site;', 'Lack of certainty as to where on the site the aircraft was located.', '19. On 2 April 2009, the PHR issued a report, stating inter alia, that some victims of the crash remained unaccounted for and that there was a possibility that remains had been buried along with the aircraft on the site and urged that an investigation be launched to put an end to the uncertainty of the relatives.', '20. On 26 February 2014 the Council of Ministers approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposal no. E268/2014 for the excavation of the air crash site. The excavation was to take place under the supervision of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will be conducted by the scientific staff of PHR in co-operation with the Cypriot archeologists, the Ministry of Defence and the National Guard. The proposal included an analysis of the costs to be incurred in the total amount of 90,000 euros.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1955 and lives in Pozuelo de Alarcón (Madrid).', '7. The applicant cohabited with another man in a homosexual relationship from 1990 until the latter’s death on 2 July 2002. During that period they lived together in an apartment belonging to the applicant’s partner. When his partner died, the sister and only heir of the applicant’s partner gave the applicant, because of the relationship he had had with her brother, an apartment that had belonged to the applicant’s late partner and in which the couple had spent their holidays together since 1990.', '8. On 19 September 2003 the applicant claimed social security allowances as a surviving spouse, under section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act, arguing that he had cohabited with his deceased partner for many years.', '9. On 22 September 2003 the National Institute of Social Security (Instituto Nacional de la Seguridad Social, hereafter referred to as “INSS”) refused to grant the applicant a survivor’s pension on the ground that since he had not been married to the deceased person, he could not legally be considered as his surviving spouse for the purposes of section 174 (1) of the General Social Security Act. That decision was formally served on 13 June 2005.', '10. On 1 July 2005 Law no. 13/2005 amending the provisions of the Civil Code with respect to the right to enter into marriage was passed. Two days later it entered into force. This law legalised same-sex marriage in Spain. In accordance with its first additional provision all legal and regulatory provisions making reference to marriage should be understood thereafter as applicable to all marriages irrespective of the sex of its members (see paragraph 35 below).', '11. On 5 July 2005 the applicant filed an administrative complaint against the decision of 22 September 2003. This complaint was dismissed by the INSS on 11 August 2005. The INSS noted that there was no provision in the legislation in force that allowed, for the purposes of social security rights, the person who had been cohabiting with the deceased to gain the status of a widower.', '12. On 26 September 2005 the applicant challenged that decision before the Madrid Social Tribunal no. 33 (“the Social Tribunal”).', '13. In a judgment of 14 November 2005 the Social Tribunal ruled for the applicant. The Social Tribunal firstly outlined that the facts of the case had to be assessed in the light of the newly enacted Law no. 13/2005, which was already in force and deemed constitutional by the tribunal. As to the merits, the Social Tribunal observed that the issue at stake was whether the applicant, as the surviving partner of a same-sex relationship that ended (following his partner’s death) before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, had the right to a survivor’s pension. The Social Tribunal then reiterated that, according to the well-established domestic case-law, surviving partners of unmarried couples were not entitled to a survivor’s pension under section 174 of the General Social Security Act, marriage being a constitutive element to access any such social-security benefit; that the applicant had been prevented from marrying his partner because same-sex marriage had not been recognised in domestic law at the time his partner died; that the social security administration had relied on the fact that the couple had not married to refuse the applicant a survivor’s pension; and that it was evident that after the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, surviving spouses of same-sex marriages were entitled to survivors’ pensions on the same footing as survivors of different-sex marriages.', '14. The Social Tribunal was of the view that the solution to the legal issue raised by the applicant’s case depended on whether it could be inferred from Law no. 13/2005 that Parliament’s intention had been that surviving partners of same-sex couples who had been prevented from marrying under the former legislation could access a survivor’s pension on a similar footing to same-sex couples who could marry after the entering into force of that Act. The Social Tribunal drew attention in this regard to the provisions and the explanatory memorandum of Law no. 13/2005 to contend that this new legislation had a very strong egalitarian purpose, and that from the date it entered into force, that is to say 3 July 2005, all legal provisions concerning marriage should be interpreted on the basis of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 as applying fully to same-sex marriage (see paragraph 35 below). The Social Tribunal held in this regard that:', '“This is a wide-ranging provision which affects all the other provisions of the legal system making reference to marriage. From now onwards all references to marriage established in the law shall be understood as applying also to marriage celebrated between two persons of the same sex. Accordingly, whoever shall be called to interpret or apply any marriage-related provision should do so in egalitarian terms without taking into consideration whether the spouses are of the same or different sex”.', '15. The Social Tribunal further recalled that additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 of 7 July 1981 amending the provisions of the Civil Code pertaining to marriage and the procedure to be followed for cases of annulment, judicial separation and divorce, recognised the right to obtain a survivor’s pension for individuals who had been prevented from marrying a person who later died by the legislation in force until then, provided that he or she had cohabited in a relationship similar to marriage with the deceased person and that the deceased had died before Law no. 30/1981 entered into force.', '16. The Social Tribunal stressed that such a provision was included in order to provide a solution for those cohabiting couples consisting of a man and a woman who could not have married under the legislation in force until that time, and thus did not qualify for a survivor’s pension, because one or even both of them had still been married to another person whom they had been prevented from divorcing, divorce having been legally impossible in Spain until the passing of Law no. 30/1981. The Social Tribunal considered that the applicant’s circumstances were “fully comparable” to those outlined in additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in so far as:', '“- the claimant could not marry his partner because the legislation then in force prevented him from doing so;', '- the claimant had shared a marital life with his partner until the latter’s death;', '- the latter’s death had taken place before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005”', '17. The Social Tribunal acknowledged, however, that whereas Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at protecting the rights of those cohabiting heterosexual couples who were prevented from marrying because divorce was prohibited at the time, Law no. 13/2005 was aimed at protecting the rights of those who could not marry on account of their sexual orientation, and that this distinction was the main impediment to the recognition of the applicant’s right to a survivor’s pension.', '18. The Social Tribunal considered nonetheless that treating these two groups differently would not be in harmony with the strong egalitarian intention expressed by Parliament with the passing of Law no. 13/2005 and that, accordingly, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was applicable to the applicant by force of additional provision no. 1 of Law no. 13/2005. The Social Tribunal stated as follows:', '“Therefore, the interpretation that in my opinion better fits the legislature’s intention is the following:', '- If the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 sets out that provisions making reference to marriage shall apply irrespective of the sex of the spouses,', '- And one of [these provisions], currently in force to provide access to a survivor’s pension, is additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981.', '- The only method to apply it in a way which is consistent with the egalitarian intention of the legislature is to do so irrespective of the sexual orientation of the members of the cohabiting couple.', '- In order to ensure that sexual orientation does not constitute discriminatory grounds in the application of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the right thereby recognised shall currently be interpreted as providing a solution to factual situations such as the one in the instant case in which the impediment to access to a survivor’s pension is no other than the sexual orientation [of the claimant].”', '19. As regards the administration’s submission that in the area of social security benefits the governing principle was that of non-retroactivity of laws and that according to the law in force at the time the applicant’s partner died the former did not qualify for a survivor’s pension because they were not married, the Social Tribunal was of the view that this general principle was not absolute and that it did not apply where there was a specific rule giving retroactive effect to laws more favourable to the citizens, as is true of the instant case. Thus, additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 should be read in the light of the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005.', '20. As to the degree of retroactivity that should be given to additional provision 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 in the applicant’s case, the Social Tribunal relied on the constitutive effects of Law no. 13/2005 which created new rights and was effective only from the date it entered into force. Accordingly, the Social Tribunal recognised the applicant’s right to be awarded a survivor’s pension with effect from 3 July 2005.', '21. The INSS and the Treasury General of Social Security appealed (recurso de suplicación) against that judgment to the Madrid High Court of Justice (Tribunal Superior de Justicia).', '22. On 18 September 2006 the Madrid High Court of Justice upheld the appeal and reversed the first-instance judgment. The court found that the legislature had not intended Law no. 13/2005 to cover same-sex partnerships which had been ended by the death of one of the partners before said law had entered into force and that the lack of protection of these unions could not be considered discriminatory in the light of Article 14 of the Spanish Constitution.', '23. For the court, it was only as from the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005 that marriage between same-sex couples was recognised and that this law affected other rights for those persons who would wish to marry thereafter. Hence, the court was of the view that Law no. 13/2005 had no retroactive effects, except as otherwise expressly provided, which was not the case at hand.', '24. The court further stated that even though Law no. 13/2005 had been inspired by the constitutional principle of equality, prior legislation preventing same-sex marriage could not be deemed unconstitutional as contrary to either any constitutional principle or to the right not to be discriminated against. The court referred to constitutional case-law dating from 1994 according to which the requisite of heterosexuality for the purposes of marriage was fully constitutional and that it was within the margin of appreciation of the public authorities to treat heterosexual marriages more favourably than homosexual partnerships. In this connection, the court maintained that despite the reference in the preamble of Law no. 13/2005 (see paragraph 35 below) to the discriminatory treatment to which homosexuals had traditionally been subjected on account of their sexual orientation, the aim of Parliament in passing that law was merely to respond to a new social reality and award homosexuals the right to marry, but not to protect same-sex partnerships which had already ended before its enactment.', '25. The court referred to constitutional case-law according to which a difference in legal treatment of individuals due to subsequent changes in the law does not necessarily entail discrimination, even if those persons could be said to be in similar circumstances. Given the complexity that a change in legislation might involve, it was for Parliament to establish the characteristics of the legal transition, either by introducing retroactivity clauses or by restricting the application of the new legislation to circumstances arising after its entry into force.', '26. The court noted in this regard that Law no. 13/2005 had not included any provision concerning same-sex partnerships which had already ended at the time of its entry into force and that it strictly concerned same-sex couples still in existence at that time and who would be willing to enter into marriage. The court considered that the difference between the situations before and after the passing of Law no. 13/2005 was essentially an expression of the principle of succession of laws without constitutional implications as regards the right not to be discriminated against.', '27. As regards the applicability to the present case of additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981, the Madrid High Court of Justice found that this provision was not applicable to the applicant’s case for two main reasons. Firstly, that provision could not be considered as among the provisions to which the first additional provision of Law no. 13/2005 referred. Additional provision no. 10 (2) was, as the Constitutional Court had established, of a provisional or transitory nature and had been envisaged for those specific cases in which one of the partners had died before the entry into force of Law no. 30/1981. It had not been intended to govern future situations. Secondly, that provision had been envisaged for a totally different situation from that of the applicant. Additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was aimed at guaranteeing a survivor’s pension to those heterosexuals who had been prevented from marrying their out-of wedlock partner because divorce had not been legal at the time of the latter’s death. The inability to remarry for those affected by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/1981 was based on the fact that divorce was not permitted at the time. The institution of marriage was open to them in their capacity as heterosexuals. On the contrary, same-sex couples were absolutely prevented from marrying before Law no. 13/2005 since the institution of marriage was until then restricted to heterosexual couples.', '28. Furthermore, the court contended that the applicant could never have fulfilled the more uxorio marital cohabitation requirement established by additional provision no. 10 (2) of Law no. 30/ 1981 of, because only those who were in principle eligible for marriage but had been prevented from marrying for whatever reason could qualify for de facto marital cohabitation. The applicant and his partner could have never cohabited “as if married” before the entry into force of Law no. 13/2005, because before then they were ineligible for marriage as they were both male.', '29. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law seeking harmonisation of the case-law (recurso de casación para la unificación de doctrina). In a decision of 27 June 2007, the Supreme Court (Social Chamber) declared the appeal inadmissible on the ground that the decision produced for purposes of comparison, specifically a judgment of the High Court of Justice of the Canary Islands of 7 November 2003, was not relevant. That decision was served on 26 July 2007.', '30. Relying on Articles 14 (principle of equality and prohibition of discrimination) and 24 § 1 (right to effective judicial protection), the applicant lodged an amparo appeal with the Constitutional Court. In a decision of 11 February 2009, served on 17 February 2009, the Constitutional Court declared the appeal inadmissible on the grounds that the applicant had failed to substantiate the special constitutional relevance of his complaints.']",[],[],[],"['14', '8']",['8-1'],[],0

The applicant was born in 1963 and lives in Tallinn.', '7. In 2006 the applicant’s son O., who was born in 1983, was diagnosed with malignant melanoma. He was operated on in 2006, and underwent regular check-ups. In April 2009 a metastasis was removed from his brain, and he received radiation therapy.', '8. In September 2009 O.’s state of health deteriorated. He was vomiting and felt weak and dizzy.', '9. On 19 September 2009 the applicant called an ambulance and O. was taken to the North Estonia Medical Centre (“the NEMC”) (Põhja-Eesti Regionaalhaigla) for examination. A computerised tomography (CT) scan was performed on him. According to the applicant, O. was told that the scan had not revealed any problems with his health. He was prescribed an anti-vomiting drug and discharged from the hospital the same evening.', '10. On 24 September 2009 the applicant again called an ambulance for O., who had been complaining of feeling generally unwell, of a numbness of one side of his face, a rash around his nose and dizziness. O. was admitted to the NEMC. A CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of O.’s brain were performed the same day and the following day, respectively. An additional CT scan of O.’s neck, lungs, abdomen and pelvic area was performed on 29 September 2009. The MRI scan and the CT scan of 29 September 2009, taken together, indicated a leptomeningeal pathological process involving the cranial nerves, a probable meningeal metastatic process and probable multiple metastases in the liver and other organs of the abdominal cavity. He was given hormonal and infusion therapy, but his health deteriorated rapidly. He developed breathing and walking problems and a speech impediment, and his eyesight worsened. On 28 September 2009 a hospital medical council decided to proceed with palliative care. It found that because of the spread of the tumour, oncological treatment would not be effective. The applicant pointed out that the medical council’s decision had not been signed by O.', '11. For one week starting from 5 October 2009, O. was physically restrained to a bed with magnetically locking restraints on both arms, apparently in order to prevent him from hurting himself, given his disturbed state of mind.', '12. On 6 October 2009 O. was transferred to an intensive care unit because he was suffering from progressive respiratory failure and a disturbed state of mind. He was also diagnosed with pneumonia and, in the light of that finding, was given additional antibacterial treatment. According to the medical record (nurse’s notes), on 6 October 2009 O. was intubated because he was having breathing difficulties. On the same day the medical council found that a surgical cure would not be possible and decided to continue with palliative treatment supporting the vital functions. The applicant again pointed out that the medical council’s decision was not signed by O.', '13. On 9 October 2009 a tracheotomy was performed on O.', '14. On 12 October 2009 O. stopped breathing and mechanical ventilation was applied. On 13 October 2009 characteristics corresponding to brain death were ascertained. According to information in a report drawn up by the Estonian Forensic Science Institute based on an analysis of O.’s medical records, an electroencephalogram performed the same day revealed serious diffuse brain damage and only minimal electrical activity. O.’s active treatment and feeding were discontinued, but the infusion therapy was continued. The applicant disagreed with this finding and rather considered that O. had fallen into a coma following an overdose of medicine. She maintained that O.’s pulse had reacted to her speech the following day, 14 October 2009, which had indicated that O. had not been brain-dead. According to the applicant, the protocol for verifying brain death was never fully and properly carried out. The administration of food and medicines was not resumed, despite the applicant’s requests. The applicant alleged that during the night of 14 October 2009, O.’s blanket had been removed and he had been left with only a sheet near an open window, which had caused his body temperature to drop to 35 degrees Celsius.', '15. On 15 October 2009 O.’s heart stopped and the mechanical ventilation was terminated.', '16. On 15 October 2009 the applicant called the police on the general emergency number, complained about O.’s treatment and asked that an expert examination be commissioned. Her phone call was registered as an information notice (infoteade) and not as the reporting of a crime. The applicant was advised to contact the Expert Committee on the Quality of Health Care Services (Tervishoiuteenuse kvaliteedi ekspertkomisjon; hereinafter “the Expert Committee”).', '17. On 16 October 2009 an autopsy was performed at the NEMC. The medical death certificate (arstlik surmateatis) indicated cerebral oedema as the immediate cause of death, and melanoma with multiple metastases as the medical condition that had brought about the immediate cause of death. According to the autopsy report (lahangu protokoll), O. died of malignant melanoma with multiple metastases in the brain, which also caused cerebral haemorrhage and oedema as complications.', '18. On 2 November 2009 the applicant complained to the Health Board (Terviseamet) of O.’s inhuman treatment and about the circumstances of his death.', '19. On 8 March 2010 the Health Board informed the applicant that the case had been transmitted to the Expert Committee. The Expert Committee examined O.’s medical records, obtained written explanations from several members of the medical staff who had treated O., and ordered two expert opinions, one to be prepared by one of its members and the other by another doctor, both professors emeriti. The Expert Committee also heard the applicant. In its decision given on 25 March 2010, it found no medical malpractice in O.’s treatment. According to the report of the Expert Committee’s meeting of 25 March 2010 at which the applicant was also present, the Expert Committee gave oral answers to the applicant’s questions regarding the possible radiation of O. during his previous treatment; the decision not to offer chemotherapy to O.; and the alleged late detection of pneumonia. In addition, the Expert Committee’s decision contained written answers to the applicant, stating that O. had not suffered from a stroke; that the deterioration in his health had not been caused by the administration of specific medication or the withdrawal thereof, but rather by the metastatic developments in his brain; and that based on the medical records, O. had not been starved, nor had his mechanical ventilation been stopped before his death. The applicant was also notified of the possibility to request an alternative medical expert opinion and was informed that tissue samples gathered while the patient was alive as well as after his death, would be maintained for thirty years at the NEMC pathology centre and were available on demand. The applicant considered that the Expert Committee had not been impartial, that it had lacked a quorum at its meeting of 25 March 2010 and that the decision it had adopted contained false statements. An action lodged by the applicant to have the Expert Committee’s report declared unlawful and claiming damages for it was dismissed by a final judgment of the Supreme Court on 2 December 2015.', '20. In the meantime, on 22 March 2010 the applicant lodged an offence report with a prosecutor’s office. Criminal proceedings under Article 123 of the Penal Code (placing or leaving another person in a situation which is life-threatening or likely to cause serious damage to the person’s health) were initiated on 1 April 2010.', '21. In the course of the criminal investigation, several individuals (doctors, nurses, the applicant, and O.’s friends who had visited him in the hospital) were interviewed. Requests for documentary evidence (the Expert Committee’s opinion, O.’s medical file as well as the autopsy report) were submitted and documents were received; a forensic medical examination was ordered from the Estonian Forensic Science Institute. The prosecutor posed ten questions to the forensic medical experts addressing, inter alia, O.’s diagnoses; the adequacy of the treatment with respect to his state of health (including the tracheotomy); the restraining of O. to the bed; the administration of medicine on 12 October 2009 and whether this could have caused O.’s breathing to stop; the decision to cease the administration of medicine and food on 13 October 2009; the assertion that O. was brain-dead; and the decision to stop mechanical ventilation.', '22. According to the forensic medical report dated 30 August 2012, O. had received treatment appropriate for his condition. The forensic medical experts also concluded that the medicine administered to O. had been appropriate and had not caused his breathing to stop. They considered that the restraining of O. to the bed could have been justified in the instant case. As the characteristics corresponding to brain death had been ascertained, the discontinuation of feeding and the continuation of infusion therapy had been medically justified. The experts also concluded that the mechanical ventilation had been turned off only after his heart had stopped and thus could not have been the cause of his death. The forensic medical assessment found that O.’s death had been caused by malignant melanoma with multiple metastases, with further complications of cerebral haemorrhage and oedema.', '23. On 25 October 2012 the criminal proceedings were terminated as the commission of an offence had not been proven based on the evidence gathered. An appeal lodged by the applicant with the Office of the Prosecutor General was dismissed on 10 December 2012. On 28 January 2013 the Tallinn Court of Appeal dismissed a further appeal lodged by the applicant.', '24. Following the termination of the criminal proceedings, the Office of the Prosecutor General dismissed complaints lodged by the applicant regarding the refusal to initiate additional criminal proceedings against the chief inspector of the Health Board’s supervisory department, against the experts of the Estonian Forensic Science Institute who had drawn up the forensic medical report during the original criminal proceedings (this refusal was later upheld by the Court of Appeal), against two prosecutors and the judge of the Court of Appeal. The Office of the Prosecutor General also dismissed an application lodged by the applicant to reopen the original criminal proceedings.']",[],[],[],['2'],['2-1'],[],0

They further requested restitutio in integrum (Wiedereinsetzung in den vorigen Stand), pointing out that they had received the community’s statutes only after the expiry of the period for filing an objection.', '7. As the community did not accept their objection, the applicants, as a precautionary measure, resigned their membership with effect from the end of October 2003. This was accepted by the community.', '8. As a public-law entity (Körperschaft öffentlichen Rechts) the Jewish community of Frankfurt/Main levies a church tax based on the individual income of their members, which is collected by the State tax authorities. For the period from November 2002 to October 2003 the Frankfurt/Main tax office levied a church tax on the applicants. They objected to paying the church tax in a separate set of proceedings which is not the subject of the application at issue.', '9. On 9 June 2005 the applicants brought an action before the Frankfurt/Main Administrative Court to obtain a declaration that they had not been members of the community between November 2002 and October 2003.', '10. On 20 September 2005 the Frankfurt/Main Administrative Court rejected the action as inadmissible, denying that such a judgment would have a legitimate interest.', '11. The applicants appealed and, on 19 May 2009, the Hesse Administrative Court of Appeal dismissed their appeal. It held that the applicants’ action was admissible, but ill-founded because their membership was based on internal regulations of the religious community which had to be recognised by State authorities, in view of the principle of autonomy of religious organisations.', '12. On 23 September 2010 the Federal Administrative Court quashed the judgment of the Administrative Court of Appeal and declared that, in the public sphere, the applicants’ membership could not have legal effect. It reasoned, in essence, that notwithstanding the autonomy of religious organisations’ religion was “Mosaic” could not be taken as a declaration of willingness to become members of the local Jewish community.', '13. After the Frankfurt/Main Jewish community had lodged a constitutional complaint (no. 2 BvR 278/11), on 17 December 2014 the Federal Constitutional Court, sitting in a chamber of three judges, quashed the Federal Administrative Court’s judgment, finding a violation of the community’s fundamental right under Article 4 §§ 1 and 2, read in conjunction with Article 140 of the Basic Law and Article 137 § 3 of the Weimar Constitution of 11 August 1919 (Weimarer Reichsverfassung). The court held that the Federal Administrative Court had not correctly evaluated the scope and the significance of the guarantee of autonomy (Selbstbestimmungsrecht) afforded to religious communities by the aforementioned Articles of the Basic Law. Regulations governing membership had to be seen as affairs that religious communities are free to determine at their own discretion. The State’s duty to acknowledge the guarantee of autonomy of religious associations for the secular legal sphere found its limits in the negative religious freedom of potential members. The inclusion of members by religious communities had to be acknowledged where this was legitimised by positive declaration, albeit possibly by an implicit declaration. There were various ways to express willingness to be a member of a religious community. This did not necessarily have to be expressed to the religious community itself. From the information submitted by the applicants to the registration office in Frankfurt/Main it could be concluded, from the objective standpoint of the onlooker (objektivierter Empfängerhorizont), that the applicants had expressed their willingness to be members of the Jewish community of Frankfurt/Main.', '14. On 21 September 2016 the Federal Administrative Court, to which the case had been remitted, dismissed the applicants’ appeal on points of law. It pointed out that, on procedural grounds, the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court was binding. It nevertheless expressed doubts as to the compatibility of the finding with Article 9 of the Convention. It noted in particular that the Federal Constitutional Court had attached no importance to the fact that the applicants had not been asked for their religious affiliation but for their religion in the registration form at issue. Notwithstanding the Jewish community of Frankfurt/Main’s conception of itself as a uniform community, everyone who lived in the community’s district and declared his or her religious belief should be free to choose another Jewish community. Due to the binding effect of the judgment of the Federal Constitutional Court, the court considered itself prevented from founding its decision on these aspects.', '15. On 23 November 2016 the applicants lodged a constitutional complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court which is still pending (no. 2 BvR 2595/16). Relying on Article 4 § 1 of the Basic Law and Article 9 of the Convention and referring to the Court’s case-law they complained in particular that their membership in the Jewish community of Frankfurt/Main was not based on their consent.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicants, Ms Seda Doshuyeva, who was born in 1978 and Mr Ismail Yusupov, who was born in 1998, are Russian nationals who live in Grozny. They were represented before the Court by lawyers of Stichting Russian Justice Initiative (in collaboration with NGO Astreya), an NGO based in the Netherlands with a representative office in Russia. The Russian Government (“the Government”) were represented by Mr G. Matyushkin, Representative of the Russian Federation to the European Court of Human Rights.', '2. The application was communicated on 8 June 2011, and on 7 February 2012 the parties exchanged their observations on the admissibility and merits of the application. On 24 September 2015 the Court requested additional factual information from the parties.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. The applicants are the wife and the son of Mr Isa Yusupov, who was born in 1969.', '5. At about 3 p.m. on 19 June 2002 Mr Isa Yusupov was driving with Mr Alisan (also known as Iriskhan) Bakayev through the Voykovo (sometimes spelled Voikovo) settlement in Grozny when their car was stopped in Leningradskaya Street by a group of about twenty military servicemen who had been taken there in two armoured personnel carriers (APCs) and two UAZ vehicles. It appeared that the servicemen were manning a mobile military checkpoint.', '6. In the presence of a number of local residents both men were blindfolded and taken away in the APCs. The applicants’ relative, Mr Isa Yusupov, has not been seen since then.', '7. In response to the Court’s request for a copy of the investigation file, the Government submitted copies of the documents from the initial criminal case file no. 50109 (in the documents submitted the number is also referred to as 55109) that was opened into the abduction of just Mr Bakayev. This file has 36 pages and chronicles the steps taken by the investigation between July 2002 and May 2010. In response to the Court’s request for additional information, the Government submitted copies of the updated criminal case file no. 50109, which contains 418 pages concerning the investigation into the abduction of both Mr Bakayev and Mr Isa Yusupov and chronicles the steps taken by the investigation between May 2010 and August 2014. The relevant information may be summarised as follows.', '8. On 2 July 2002 Ms L.D. complained to the prosecutor’s office that her husband, Mr Bakayev, together with “a man called Isa” had been abducted.', '9. On 12 July 2002 Ms L.D. was questioned. She stated that her husband Mr Bakayev had been abducted by servicemen in two APCs on the bridge in the Voykovo settlement.', '10. On 26 July 2002 the Grozny town prosecutor’s office initiated a criminal investigation into the abduction of Mr Bakayev in response to his wife’s complaint. The case file was given the number 50109. The decision in this regard stated:', '“On the evening of 19 June 2002 Mr A. Bakayev and a man named Isa were abducted on the bridge in the Voykovo settlement by unidentified men in camouflage uniforms driving two APCs. The abduction of Mr Bakayev took place in the presence of civilians and military servicemen stationed in Voykovo...”', '11. In their submission on the admissibility and merits of the case of 20 December 2011 the applicants stated that they “had been informed about it [the decision to open criminal case no. 50109]” without specifying the date or the circumstances under which they were informed thereof.', '’s abduction, whereas the relatives of Mr Bakayev had been informed thereof on 26 July 2002.', '13. On 8 August 2002 the investigators ordered the Zavodskoy district department of the interior (“Заводской районный отдел внутренних дел”) (hereinafter the Zavodskoy ROVD) in Grozny to carry out operative search measures stating, amongst other things, the following:', '“The investigation established that... Mr A. Bakayev and an unidentified person known as Isa were taken away to an unknown destination by unidentified men wearing camouflage uniforms in two APCs. The abduction took place in the presence of civilians and servicemen stationed in the settlement of Voykovo, specifically, in the presence of serviceman A.E....”', '14. In October 2002 the investigators forwarded requests for information to various authorities, asking whether any special operations had been carried out on the date of the abduction of Mr Bakayev and if so, whether anyone had been detained. These requests did not yield any pertinent information.', '15. On 26 November 2002 the investigation was suspended. The suspension decision referred only to the abduction of Mr Bakayev; it did not contain any references to the applicants’ relative Mr Isa Yusupov:', '“...the present criminal case was opened on 26 July 2002 in connection with the abduction on 19 July 2002 of A. M. Bakayev.', 'The preliminary investigation established that on the evening of 19 July 2002 unidentified persons in camouflage uniforms had detained Mr Bakayev on the bridge in the Voykovo settlement and taken him to an unknown destination. His whereabouts have remained unknown since.', 'Taking into account that the time-limit for the preliminary investigation has been reached and all of the possible steps have been taken.... It has been decided to suspend the investigation in the criminal case...”', '16. From the documents submitted by the parties it is apparent that between 2002 and 2010 the applicants neither complained of Mr Isa Yusupov’s abduction to the Zavodskoy ROVD nor did they maintain contact with the relatives of Mr Bakayev concerning the proceedings in criminal case no. 50109.', '17. On 4 May 2010 the first applicant contacted the investigators in criminal case no. 50109. She submitted a request that the investigations department of the Zavodskoy district prosecutor’s office in Grozny grant her victim status in the criminal case as follows:', '“ ...On 19 June 2002 my husband Mr Isa Yusupov, who was born in 1969, was detained by armed men in military vehicles in Leningradskaya Street in the Oktyabrskiy district of Grozny.

Several days later she had found out from her neighbours that her husband Mr Isa Yusupov and Mr Bakayev had been abducted by armed men in APCs.', '20. On the same date, 21 May 2010, the first applicant requested the investigators to grant her access to the contents of criminal case file no. 50109.

Out of fear for her life and that of her relatives, on an unspecified date in 2002 she had moved to Moscow and only returned to the Chechen Republic in 2010. The applicants did not enclose any documents substantiating this information other than the first applicant’s written statement dated 17 October 2015.', '24. According to the Government, the applicants did not lodge any official complaints concerning their relative’s alleged abduction within the framework of the criminal case.', '25.

The first applicant was born in 1972 and lives in Belfast. The second applicant was born in 1967 and lives in Lurgan. The third applicant was born in 1978 and lives in Craigavon.', '5. On 14 March 2009 the first and third applicants were arrested under section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 (“the 2000 Act”) on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a police officer on 9 March 2009. They were detained at Antrim police station on the same day. The first applicant was interviewed twice on 15 March 2009 and once on 16 March 2009; the third applicant was interviewed three times on 15 March 2009 and once on 16 March 2009.', '6. On 16 March 2009 the Director of Public Prosecutions (“DPP”) made applications to the County Court under paragraph 29 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act for warrants of further detention in respect of both applicants in order to carry out questioning and to conduct forensic examinations. The first applicant gave evidence on oath in the course of the hearing. Following the hearing, the County Court Judge granted warrants authorising a five-day extension of detention.', '7. Each of the applicants was interviewed on twelve occasions in the following five days.', '8. On 21 March 2009 the DPP made applications to the County Court under paragraph 36 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act for seven-day extensions to the periods specified in the warrants for further detention. The extensions were sought in order to facilitate further questioning of the applicants once the results of additional forensic tests were obtained. At separate hearings on 22 March 2009 a police Superintendent gave evidence on oath as to the necessity of the extensions and arguments were heard on behalf of the first and third applicants.', '9. Following the hearings Her Honour Judge Philpott QC delivered a written judgment in respect of the first applicant and an ex tempore decision in respect of the third applicant. She granted both applications, authorising the first applicant’s continued detention until 7.20 on 28 March 2009 and the third applicant’s continued detention until 5.52 on 28 March 2009. In her reasoning, Judge Philpott noted that the relevant forensic evidence was central to the investigation and that the investigation was being carried out diligently and expeditiously.', '10. In the rulings Judge Philpott considered whether the 2000 Act or Article 5 of the Convention gave the court deciding whether or not to grant an extension of detention an express or implied power to examine the lawfulness of the arrest or to grant bail. She concluded that it did not as the 2000 Act only gave the judge the power to decide whether or not an extension of detention was necessary. Consequently, she had to confine herself to the issue of whether or not it was necessary to extend detention beyond forty-eight hours for investigative purposes and any issue as to the lawfulness of the arrest would have to be determined by the High Court in either Habeas Corpus or judicial review proceedings.', '11. On 14 March 2009 the second applicant was arrested under section 41 of the 2000 Act on suspicion of involvement in the murder of two soldiers at Masserene Barracks, Antrim, on 7 March 2009. He was detained at Antrim Police Station on the same day.', '12. On 15 March 2009 the DPP made an application to the County Court under paragraph 29 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act for a warrant extending the second applicant’s detention as the results of a number of forensic tests were pending.', '13. Following a hearing on 16 March 2009 a County Court Judge granted a warrant authorising a five-day extension to his detention.', '14. The second applicant was interviewed on twelve occasions in the following five days. However, neither the interviews nor the results of the forensic tests provided any evidence linking the second applicant to the murders of the two soldiers.', '15. On 21 March 2009 the DPP made an application to the County Court under paragraph 36 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act for a seven-day extension to the period specified in the warrant for further detention. The extension was sought as the results of further forensic tests which had been sent for analysis to a laboratory in Great Britain were expected to become available within the following seven days and detention was considered necessary to ensure that further questioning could take place and, if there was sufficient evidence, charges could be brought.', '16. On 21 March 2009 Judge Philpott granted the application, authorising the second applicant’s continued detention until 7.20 on 28 March 2009.', '17. The applicants sought permission to apply for judicial review of Judge Philpott’s decisions of 21 and 22 March 2009 granting further extensions to the warrants authorising their detention. They submitted first, that Judge Philpott had been wrong to conclude that a court, in deciding whether or not to grant an extension of detention, was precluded from investigating the lawfulness of the arrest; secondly, that the judge had failed to address the question of whether the detention of the applicants was required while the results of the forensic examinations were expected; thirdly that the judge had failed to give reasons for her decision that detention was required; and finally, that Schedule 8 of the 2000 Act was incompatible with Article 5 of the Convention.', '18. Permission to apply for judicial review was granted by the High Court of Northern Ireland on 24 March 2009 and the High Court heard the applications on 25 March 2009.', '19. In respect of the applicants’ first submission, the High Court held that paragraphs 5 and 32 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act had to be read in conformity with the requirements of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention as explained in the jurisprudence of the Court. Thus, the review of the lawfulness of the detention had to embrace an examination of the basis of the arrest, otherwise a person could be detained under the 2000 Act for up to twenty-eight days without there having been any judicial review of the lawfulness of the original arrest and that could not be Convention compliant. The High Court therefore found that Judge Philpott had been wrong to disavow any review of the lawfulness of the applicants’ arrest and, as a consequence, her decision to grant extensions had to be quashed. The court accepted, however, that a review of the lawfulness of the arrest need not involve a detailed analysis of the basis for the decision to arrest and should reflect the constraints that necessarily apply in many arrests for terrorist offences.', '20. With regard to the applicants’ second and third submissions, the High Court found that although the judge had not focused directly on whether the applicants had to be detained rather than released pending the outcome of the remaining forensic examinations, she had not failed to have regard to the need for detention as the basis for the grant of the warrant. Moreover, although her reasons were pithily stated, they were sufficient to convey to the applicants the basis of her decision.', '21. Consideration of the applicants’ fourth submission, namely the compatibility of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act with Article 5 of the Convention, was adjourned. In a judgment delivered on 24 February 2011, the High Court of Northern Ireland found no basis for the submission that Schedule 8 was incompatible with Article 5 of the Convention. In particular, the court held that although there was no doubt that the “competent legal authority” referred to in Article 5 § 1(c) was the authority having competence to deal with a criminal charge (the Magistrate in the United Kingdom), in Schiesser v. Switzerland, 4 December 1979, § 29, Series A no. 34 and McKay v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 543/03, ECHR 2006X the Court had made it clear that the function of “a judge or other officer” for the purposes of Article 5 § 3 of the Convention could be carried out by an officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and did not necessarily have to be a person with power to conduct the trial of any eventual criminal charge; that, although there was no express power to order release in the 2000 Act as required by Article 5 § 3 of the Convention, such a power must be implied; that, as paragraph 32 of Schedule 8 to the 2000 Act provided that there must be reasonable grounds for believing that the further detention of a person was necessary, it therefore contained a requirement of proportionality; that, there was no provision for conditional release on bail within the statutory scheme, an issue which did not arise in the present case but would need to be addressed in any future case in which it arose; that, although paragraph 33(3) of Schedule 8 enabled a judicial authority to exclude an applicant or anyone representing him from any part of the hearing and paragraph 34 permitted information to be withheld from the applicant or anyone representing him, there were a range of tools available to the court to preserve to the necessary extent an adversarial procedure and equality of arms; and, finally, that there was no authority which supported the applicants’ contention that Article 5 required that a detained person should be charged well before the expiry of the twentyeight day period contemplated in the 2000 Act.', '22. On 4 April 2011 the High Court of Northern Ireland certified that it was satisfied that the decision given on 24 February 2011 involved the following points of law of general public importance:', '“(a) Whether paragraphs 29(3) and 36(3)(b) of Part III of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (“the Act”) permitting extended detention for more than four days are compatible with the Applicant’s rights under Article 5(1)(c), 5(2) and 5(3) of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”)', 'If compliance with Article 5(3) of the Convention can only be achieved by providing for a detainee to be brought before a judicial authority (i) other than the Magistrate’s Court and (ii) without any charges having been preferred against him;', 'If Articles 5(1)(c) and 5(3) of the Convention are required to be read together as linked provisions and understood as creating a scheme so that the “judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power” referred to in Article 5(3) and “the competent legal authority” referred to in Article 5(1)(c) are one and the same;', 'If the “judicial authority” provided for in Schedule 8 to the Act is the “judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power” within the meaning of Article 5(3) of the Convention;', 'If Articles 5(1)(c) and 5(3) of the Convention cannot be interpreted in such a way as to permit the detention of a suspect without charge for any period specified by Parliament, subject only to the requirement of periodic judicial approval of the kind specified in Article 8 to the Act.', '(b) Whether the absence of a power to allow for conditional release on bail rendered the scheme for extending detention set out in Part III of Schedule 8 incompatible with Article 5 ECHR; and', '(c) Whether the procedure for granting an extension of detention, in circumstances where the suspect and legal representative have been excluded by the judge for a part of the hearing (as per Schedule 8, para 33(3)) and by reason of same information is made available to the judge but withheld from the suspect and his legal representative, (Schedule 8, para 34(1) and (2)(f) is incompatible with the request for an adversarial hearing as required by Article 5 in light of Secretary of State for the Home Department v AF (FC) & Anor [2010] 2 AC 269.”', '23. However, the High Court refused leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.', '24. Permission to appeal was refused by the Supreme Court on 14 November 2011 on the basis that the applications did not raise an arguable point of law of general public importance.', '25. The applicants were released without charge on 25 March 2009. The first and third applicants were not subsequently charged with any offence related to the murder of the police officer.', '26. The second applicant was immediately re-arrested and interviewed over the following two days. On 27 March 2009 he was charged with the murder of the two soldiers, five attempted murders and possession of a firearm and ammunition. He was produced before a District Judge sitting at Larne Magistrates’ Court on 27 March 2009. His application for bail was refused. Following a hearing which took place on 6 and 23 November 2009, bail was refused by the High Court on the ground that there was a real risk of re-offending on account of his suspected involvement with a dissident republican organisation. The High Court again declined to grant bail on 8 October 2010.', '27. On 7 November 2011 the second applicant stood trial before a judge sitting without a jury. On 20 January 2012 he was acquitted on all counts on the indictment.']",[],[],[],['5'],['5-3'],[],0

She was represented before the Court by Mr J. Dinis, a lawyer practising in Porto.', '1. The applicant is the owner of a restaurant in Porto. At the relevant time the restaurant was operating with a health and safety licence (alvará sanitário).', '2. On 22 November 1993 three inspectors from the General-Directorate for Primary Healthcare (Direção-Geral de Cuidados de Saúde Primários) conducted an inspection of the applicant’s restaurant during the lunch hour, when the restaurant was crowded.', '3. During the inspection, one of the inspectors publicly addressed the applicant’s husband and claimed that the restaurant did not meet statutory health and safety standards and should therefore be closed down.', '4. According to the applicant, on account of that criticism the restaurant lost clients.', '5. On an unspecified date in 1995 the applicant brought a tort action against the State before the Porto Administrative Court (Tribunal Administrativo do Porto) seeking damages for the conduct of the health inspectors. The State was represented by the Attorney General’s Office (Ministério Público) during the course of the proceedings.', '6. In order to bring the proceedings before the Porto Administrative Court, the applicant applied for legal aid. Pursuant to section 28 of LawDecree no. 387-B/87 of 29 December, the Attorney General’s Office was called upon to issue an opinion on the applicant’s request. On 27 September 1996 the latter considered that the request should be refused on grounds of the applicant’s average daily income, stating as follows:', '“The plaintiff admits that she has an average daily income of 30,000.00 Portuguese escudos (PTE), which had previously been PTE 60,000.00. Her monthly salary exceeds, therefore, the amounts considered to constitute a presumption of economic need, according to the legislator. I am therefore of the opinion that the plaintiff’s legal aid request should be refused.”', '7. In its judgment of 23 August 1998 the Porto Administrative Court held that the conduct of the three inspectors from the Directorate-General for Primary Healthcare during the impugned inspection had been illegal and had caused damage to the applicant. Furthermore, it awarded the applicant PTE 350,000.00 (1,745.79 euros (EUR)) in respect of non-pecuniary damage and an amount in respect of pecuniary damage that remained to be determined during the proceedings for the enforcement of the judgment.', '8. On an unknown date the Attorney General’s Office lodged an appeal against the judgment with the Supreme Administrative Court (Supremo Tribunal Administrativo). On 9 April 2002 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.', '9. On an unknown date the applicant instituted proceedings before the Porto Administrative Court for the enforcement of the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment and the calculation of the amount to be awarded in respect of pecuniary damage. She claimed damages of EUR 603,004.40, corresponding to the pecuniary losses allegedly suffered as a result of the inspectors’ conduct from the day of the inspection until such time as the action had been brought.', '10. On 26 February 2004 the Attorney General’s Office contested the amount claimed by the applicant as excessive. It argued that any pecuniary damages should be limited to the loss sustained as a consequence of the reduction in the applicant’s daily income, in accordance with the facts that had been established by the first-instance court and pursuant to the Supreme Administrative Court’s judgment of 9 April 2002.', '11. On 19 October 2009 the Porto Administrative Court adopted a decision in which it awarded the applicant EUR 9,010.50 in respect of pecuniary damage. The domestic court’s decision was based on the evidence provided by the parties, namely the applicant, and on an expert assessment that had been requested by the court to estimate the damage suffered.', '12. The applicant appealed against the decision before the Supreme Administrative Court, contesting the amount awarded. She argued that the witnesses’ statements and the evidence provided had been wrongly assessed. She also disputed the legality of the first-instance court’s refusal to grant a request she had lodged for the clarification of the expert assessment during the course of the proceedings before the first-instance court. The applicant further complained that the Attorney General’s Office had been allowed to have two contradictory legal positions in the proceedings without suffering any sanction, by making reference to its opinion on her legal aid request during the tort proceedings and the fact that it had disputed the amount she had claimed for pecuniary damage.', '13. The Supreme Court judgment was adopted on 23 September and notified to the applicant on 30 September 2010.', '14. In its judgment the Supreme Court held that the expert’s opinion had been inconclusive and considered that the amount awarded on that account had not been sufficiently justified. It further noted that the expert’s opinion had been requested under a legal provision which was not applicable to the case at hand. The Supreme Court, therefore, dismissed the expert’s assessment and made a new assessment of the evidence in order to evaluate the extent of the damage suffered by the applicant. With reference to the witnesses’ statements heard and the evidence provided, namely by the applicant, the higher court considered that it could not establish a loss in the amount claimed by the applicant. Thus, the Supreme Court decided that the pecuniary damages should be calculated on the basis of equity (juízo de equidade), taking into account the facts that had been established in the course of the proceedings. Accordingly, it awarded the applicant EUR 9,000 in respect of pecuniary damage, to be paid by the State.', '15. At the material time, legal aid was regulated by Law-Decree no. 387-B/87 of 29 December 1987. Requests for legal aid were decided by the judicial authority in charge of the proceedings for which they had been submitted. Pursuant to section 28 the Attorney General’s Office was called upon to submit an opinion on that regard.', '16. In judgment no. 287/99.0TABJA-B.E1-A.S1 of 16 December 2010, the Supreme Court considered the possibility of reconciling a discrepancy between two discordant positions of the Attorney General’s Office, when acting in the capacity of a public prosecutor in criminal proceedings. The Supreme Court’s judgment seeking to harmonise the judicial approach to that question (acórdão de fixação de jurisprudência) contains the following passages:', '“The Attorney General’s Office, which assumes, at any stage of the proceedings, a legal position as to the innocence or guilt of the accused, cannot subsequently modify its position, claiming a better judgment, to the possible detriment of the defendant’s position.', '...', 'Consequently it follows, inexorably, that conflicting and contradictory procedural interventions which are not a demand for truth and justice, but derive solely from the need to express subjective opinions, are inadmissible.', '...', 'In view of the combined provisions of Articles 48 to 53 and 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Attorney General’s Office has no interest in appealing against decisions that are consistent with its previously held position in the proceedings.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicants, Ms Elena Haută, Ms Veronica Dima and Ms Aurelia Florea, are all Romanian nationals, born in 1930, 1924 and 1935 respectively and live in Huşi, Şişcani and Vuţcani, respectively.', 'The applicants were initially represented before the Court by Mr J. Crudu, a lawyer practising in Vaslui. The first and the third applicants are currently represented by Ms Diana-Elena Dragomir, a lawyer practising in Bucharest.', '2. The Romanian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ms C. Brumar, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 11 March 1999 the applicants’ mother, Z.D., lodged with the administrative authorities a request under Law no. 9/1998, seeking to be compensated for a plot of land, a house and a yard she and her husband G.D., now deceased, had owned together before 1940 in Bazarghean, Durostor District. In her appended statement, given before a public notary on 19 July 1999, Z.D. confirmed that she had never received any compensation for the respective property.', '5. On 27 January 2000 the Vaslui County Commission for Implementing Law 9/1998 allowed the request and granted the claimant 529 million lei (ROL) (approximately 29,000 euros (EUR) at the time) in compensation.', '6. On 7 June 2002 this decision was overturned by the Central Commission, the national authority in charge of the implementation of Law no. 9/1998, which held that the calculation of the total amount needed to be done again, given that the disputed plot of land was actually located on the outskirts and not in the central area, while the disputed house had been built with adobe and not with bricks. The decision stipulated that:', '“In view of the advanced age of the person entitled [to compensation] the decision must urgently be redrafted and the three children of the deceased father, G.D., should be included therein.”', '7. Z.D. contested this decision, claiming that the calculation made by the County Commission was correct; however, in the judgment of 13 January 2003, the Vaslui Court of First Instance upheld the decision given by the Central Commission.', 'Z.D. appealed. Her appeal was dismissed as out of time by the Iaşi Court of Appeal on 31 March 2003. A further appeal lodged with the same court was dismissed as inadmissible on 20 October 2003.', '8. On the same day Z.D. died.', '9. The applicants, Z.D.’s heirs, have lodged several requests with various state authorities (including the President, the Ombudsman, and the Prefect of Vaslui), asking for a decision to be taken in their case.', '10. An expert report issued on 19 October 2005 at the request of the Vaslui County Commission proposed that an amount of 23,891.62 RON be given for the impugned land. The report mentioned that according to a certificate issued by the Huşi Mayor Office, Z.D. had never requested or received compensation in accordance with the Romanian legislation on land restitution. A similar expert report issued on 15 October 2005 evaluated the impugned house and appurtenant land to 145,533.01 RON.', '11. Consequently, on 1 November 2005 the Vaslui County Commission issued another decision on Z.D.’s name, granting her compensation in the amount of 169,424 Romanian lei (RON) (approximately EUR 47,000 at the time).', '12. On 14 July 2006 the National Authority for Property Restitution (hereinafter “the National Authority”), the authority which had replaced and taken over the responsibilities of the Central Commission, replied to one of the applicants’ letters. The National Authority informed them that their file was pending before it, and that generally every file was assessed on the basis of on documents such as civil status certificates, other certificates attesting whether any compensation had already been granted, expert reports, and so on.', '13. On 15 November 2006 the Prime Minister’s Head of Chancellery issued an order which invalidated the decision of 1 November 2004, given that the claimant needed to submit further documents concerning the civil status of G.D.’s heirs and attesting to whether any other compensation had been received by any of the heirs, in accordance with the Romanian legislation on land restitution. The Chancellery sent the file back to the Prefect of Vaslui County for further examination, while holding that:', '“compensation should be granted to the claimant for 10 ha of land, house and yard of 4000 sq. m.; for the rest of the yard [the claimant] should be granted equivalent agricultural land”.', '14. On 15 January 2007 the Prefect of Vaslui addressed a letter to Z.D., informing her that she needed to submit the documents referred to in the decision of 15 November 2006.', '15. No other decision has yet been taken on the claims lodged by Z.D. under Law no. 9/1998.', '16. Law no. 9/1998 came into force on 14 March 1998 and was amended in 2004 and 2007; it established a compensatory mechanism for Romanian citizens whose immovable properties were confiscated without due compensation under the Treaty of Craiova, signed by Romania and Bulgaria on 7 September 1940 (see paragraph 35 below).', '17. The mechanism referred essentially to pecuniary compensation or to the right to shares in State-run companies. The deadline for filing such claims was set in Article 4 § 1 at eighteen months from the entry into force of the law. This deadline was subsequently extended by Law no. 97/2005, for a period of twelve more months starting with the entry into force of the law on 21 April 2005 and then by Law no. 348/2006, for a period of eighteen more months, starting from the entry into force of the law on 28 July 2006.', '18. The bodies in charge of implementing the said Law were the County Commissions established within each county (including Bucharest) under the authority of the Prefect, and the Central Commission for Implementing Law no. 9/1998.', '19. Under Article 7 § 1, the County Commissions had responsibility for assessing and dealing with requests for compensation within a maximum of six months following the date of registration. The decisions of the County Commissions were communicated to the claimants and the Central Commission, and they could be challenged by the claimants before the Central Commission within fifteen days. The latter then had to ratify or reject such decisions within sixty days.', 'In their turn, the decisions adopted by the Central Commission could be challenged before the domestic courts.', '20. From 18 October 2004, when Government Decision no. 1643/2004 came into force, the responsibilities of the Central Commission were taken over by the Department for the Application of Law no. 9/1998, functioning within the Prime Minister’s Chancellery. The Department forwarded the ratification decisions adopted by the County Commissions for the approval of the Prime Minister’s Head of Chancellery. The Department was further entitled to make a proposal for adjustment of the compensation at the time of the ratification decision, in accordance with Law no. 9/1998.', '21. These responsibilities were taken over by the National Authority with effect from the entry into force of Government Decision no. 361/2005, namely on 29 April 2005; this act was modified by Government Decision no. 240/2006 on 27 February 2006.', '23. Adopted on 14 March 2014, EGO no. 10/2014 suspended for a period of six months the issue by the competent authorities of any decision on claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003. The ordinance further suspended for the same period the voluntary payment of compensation already granted under Law no. 9/1998, Law no. 290/2003, and Law no. 393/2006.', '24. Law no. 164/2014 concerning measures for the acceleration and finalisation of the process of resolving compensation claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003 entered into force on 18 December 2014.', '25. Article 2 states that the only compensatory measure possible was pecuniary compensation.', '26. Article 3 defines the applicability of the law to all claims lodged in due time with the County Commissions and in respect of which no decision has been issued, or in respect of which a decision granting compensation has been issued but no payment has been made, as well as to those claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 or Law no. 290/2003 that are currently pending before the domestic courts.', '27. The law authorises the transfer of all powers of the Central Commission to the National Authority, who shall thus ratify or otherwise any decision taken by the County Commissions on claims lodged under Law no. 9/1998 and Law no. 290/2003. The National Authority is entitled to request further information and documents, from public institutions as well as from claimants, when such documents are missing or are not corroborated.', '28. Decisions taken by the National Authority are subject to appeal before the administrative courts.', '29. Article 10 of the law sets out the deadlines by which all payments should be made, providing also for the manner in which the compensation should be adjusted for inflation, on the basis of the consumer price index, from the moment the decision was issued until the entry into force of the law.', '30. Article 12 sets out a 120-day deadline within which the claimants are to supplement their files with further documents, following a written request in that respect sent by the authority. This deadline may be extended once, for sixty more days, at the request of the claimant, if evidence shows that he/she has taken the necessary steps to obtain the necessary information.', '31. Article 13 provides that the County Commissions are bound to issue a decision on the applicants’ claims within:', '“a) nine months, if there are less than 500 files pending before them;', 'b) eighteen months, if the files pending before them are in the range of 501-1000;', 'c) thirty-six months if they have more than 1000 files pending before them.”', 'This deadline started running on 1 January 2015.', '32. Article 14 stipulates that decisions issued by the County Commissions before the entry into force of the present law and already registered with the National Agency should be ratified or otherwise within eighteen months of the entry into force of the law. Decisions issued after the entry into force of the law should be ratified or otherwise by the National Authority within eighteen months of their registration with that authority.', 'The registration number and the number of files pending with the National Authority shall be published on its web page.', '33. Article 15 gives claimants the opportunity to apply to the courts in the event that the above-mentioned deadlines are not complied with.', '34. Article 17 of the law sets out several measures meant to increase the efficiency of the compensation procedures, providing, inter alia, for a temporary increase of the number of posts available at the National Authority.', '35. The Treaty of Craiova was signed on 7 September 1940 by Romania and Bulgaria. Under the terms of this treaty, the signatory parties agreed on the border line that was to be established between the two countries, with particular reference to the territory between the Black Sea and the Danube River (the Cadrilater). Section III of the Treaty provided for a mandatory resettlement of Romanian citizens of Bulgarian ethnicity living in Tulcea and Constanţa Districts to Bulgaria, and the resettlement of ethnic Romanians living in Durostor and Caliacra Districts to Romania. Section V of Annex C of the Treaty stipulated that the Romanian State was in charge of compensating those Romanian citizens who, following the mandatory resettlement had to abandon their possessions in the rural areas which were transferred to Bulgaria.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

NORWAY,3,No violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for family life),Angelika Nußberger;Erik Møse;Mārtiņš Mits;Yonko Grozev;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"['5. In 2006 the applicant moved to Norway after marrying C, an Iraqi national who had come to Norway in 1999. The couple’s first daughter, A, was born in February 2008. Their second daughter, B, was born in June 2010.', '6. On 7 April 2009 the emergency unit at the child welfare authorities in F. municipality received a request to assist the police with an incident in which the applicant and C were having a heated argument in the presence of their child. A few days later, on 10 April, the police were called again. The applicant then said that C had hit her and tried to strangle her and A on the same day. C was arrested and placed in custody. The applicant and A were taken to a crisis centre.', '7. The next day, on 11 April, the applicant was admitted to hospital with pain and bleeding. She then consented to A being placed in an emergency foster home while she was in hospital. The applicant asked the hospital for protection during her stay, because she was afraid that C’s family would come to the hospital to kill her.', '8. The applicant was discharged from hospital on 12 April 2009. She withdrew her consent to the emergency placement of A and they moved into a crisis centre. The child welfare authorities made a decision on assistance measures on 14 April 2009 and informed the applicant that they would be concerned about A’s welfare if the applicant were to move back in with C. The applicant then stated that she did not wish to move back in with him. She wanted to have a domestic abuse alarm device if she moved back.', '9. On 16 April 2009 the applicant moved back home with A. She did not want to give evidence in the criminal proceedings against C, A’s father, and refused to release her doctor from the duty of confidentiality. On 24 April 2009 C was released from custody and moved back home. A restraining order that had been imposed on him in relation to the applicant was lifted at her request.', '10. Taking into account that C had tried to strangle the applicant and A with an electrical cord (see paragraph 6 above), the child welfare authorities gave the applicant a choice between moving into a crisis centre with A or having her forcibly taken into care. On 29 April 2009 the applicant moved back into the crisis centre in F. with A.', '11. While at the crisis centre the applicant had a lot of contact with C by telephone. She expressed a wish to move back in with him with A, but also stated that he should not be at home at the same time as them. After she let C into the crisis centre on 6 May 2009, the centre no more wanted her to stay there. As the applicant expressed a wish to move back home to C, the child welfare authorities decided on 7 May 2009 to place A in an emergency foster home for the second time because they were of the opinion that the mother was unable to protect A from violence from her father.', '12. In a consultation at the emergency clinic that day, the mother denied that C represented a risk to her or the child and that he had previously hurt them.', '13. On 18 May 2009 the applicant moved into a crisis centre in O. This crisis centre was of the opinion that A should be returned to her. The child welfare authorities disagreed, and cooperation between the crisis centre and the authorities became difficult. In the end, A was returned to the applicant on 24 June 2009 and they then stayed together at the crisis centre.', '14. On 17 July 2009 the applicant and A moved back in with C. The child welfare authorities closed the case, but reopened it after the applicant’s lawyer raised concerns (“bekymringsmelding”) and stated that mother and child still had great need of the authorities’ help. On 29 July 2009 the authorities initiated assistance measures, including parenting guidance, couple therapy, a Norwegian language course for the applicant, and aggression management therapy for C. An application was also submitted for a kindergarten place for A. After a while the kindergarten raised concerns owing to A’s high absence rate and the fact that many verbal expressions of anger were being directed at the staff by C.', '15. On 15 October 2009 the police raised additional concerns with the child welfare authorities after they had been called out to the hospital in F. The mother had been admitted the day before with a suspected ectopic pregnancy. C had taken A to the hospital and the police had regarded his behaviour as so aggressive and threatening towards the hospital staff that they had thought it appropriate to notify the child welfare authorities. C had influenced the applicant to discharge herself from hospital against medical advice. However, she had suffered heavy bleeding and had been readmitted. C had been banned from visiting her at the hospital. He was at home with A, about whom the police were concerned, as the father was aggressive and threatening towards the applicant and their daughter.', '16. On the following day, 16 October 2009, the child welfare emergency unit visited the family. C was very upset and angry, as he claimed that he had not consented to such a visit.', '17. In May 2010 the applicant attended an appointment at a crisis centre in O. According to the child welfare authorities’ records, C had been “aggressive and out of control” because of this meeting.', '18. In June 2010 the couple’s second daughter, B, was born.', '19. On 2 September 2010 the City Court (tingrett) gave a judgment in which C was acquitted of violating Article 219 of the Penal Code on the maltreatment of family members, but convicted of some other offences. The counts in the indictment under Article 219 concerned the incidents in April 2009 (see paragraph 6 above). In the course of the criminal case, the applicant had withdrawn her previous statements concerning violence by C.', '20. On 17 November 2010 the child welfare authorities received a call from a crisis centre in S. informing them that the applicant and her two children had arrived there after C had been violent towards them and had threatened to kill the applicant. C had been arrested, but had then been released. The applicant had withdrawn her statement about his acts of violence and was preparing to go home. Based on this and previous incidents, the authorities decided to issue an emergency care order that day to place the children in an emergency foster home at a secret address. This was A’s third emergency placement (see paragraphs 7 and 11 above). The order was approved by the County Social Welfare Board (fylkesnemnda for barnevern og sosiale saker – hereinafter also “the Board”) the following day.', '21. On the same day, 18 November 2010, the applicant went to the crisis centre in O. At a meeting held there on 23 November 2010 she stated that she never wanted to return to C. The child welfare authorities emphasised that she could not have any contact with him once the children were returned to her. Initially, the authorities’ intention was to return the children to the applicant at the crisis centre in S., where they would all stay. The specialist team in S. expressed concern about this solution, and the authorities decided that the children could not be returned until the applicant was settled in her own flat. They thought it would be unfortunate to return the children only to put them through another emergency placement if the mother moved back to C.', '22. On 25 November 2010 a restraining order was imposed on C in relation to the applicant.', '23. The parents appealed against the emergency care order of 17 November 2010 to the Board, which granted the appeal in part in a decision of 15 December 2010. The decision regarding the emergency placement was upheld, but the amount of contact with the children was increased and the decision not to inform the parents of the children’s whereabouts was set aside.', '24. On 21 December 2010 the applicant moved from the crisis centre in O. to the crisis centre in S. She subsequently stayed at a crisis centre in G. from 5 January to 29 May 2011.', '25. An application for the children to be taken into care was first submitted to the Board by F. municipality on 23 December 2010. The municipality wanted consideration of the case to be postponed so that an expert assessment could be prepared, but the parents were opposed to this. The Board considered the case at a meeting from 8 to 10 March 2011. On 18 March 2011 the Board nevertheless decided to adjourn the case in order to appoint experts to carry out an assessment of it. The appointed experts were a specialist in educational and psychological counselling, L.M., and a specialist in clinical psychology, B.S. The experts’ joint statement was submitted on 31 May 2011.', '26. The child welfare authorities wanted the contact sessions to be supervised and engaged trained personnel from a company to do so. The supervisers started their work on 8 April 2011 and submitted a report on 3 June 2011.', '27. C was dissatisfied with the work of the appointed experts (see paragraph 25 above), and therefore hired G.H., a specialist in child and adolescent psychology, as a private expert to observe contact sessions between the applicant and the children. G.H. submitted his report on 11 June 2011.', '28. The care order case was considered by the Board on 14 and 15 June 2011.', '29. The applicant stayed at the crisis centre in G. again from 14 to 30 June 2011, after which time she moved into her own flat in G.', '30. Before the Board reached a decision, the two children were abducted from a contact session with the applicant. The incident took place on 21 June 2011 at G. Volunteer Centre (“frivillighetssentral”) in B. Two people wearing balaclavas and sunglasses forced their way in during the contact session, used an electroshock weapon on the applicant and abducted the children. The contact session was being supervised by a member of the company’s staff (see paragraph 26 above). The staff member managed to escape through the veranda door and summon help. The applicant was injured and unconscious and was taken away to hospital by air ambulance. The children were found in a flat in H. the next day. C later admitted that he had been behind the abduction and that he had been in the vicinity when it had happened.', '31. The Board found out about the abduction before it made its decision, and it was therefore decided that there should be no contact between the children and the parents. The operative part of the Board’s decision of 24 June 2011 read as follows:', '“1. F. municipality, represented by the child welfare authorities, shall take A, born ... February 2008, into care.', '2. F. municipality, represented by the child welfare authorities, shall take B, born ... June 2010, into care.', '3. A and B shall be placed in separate foster homes at secret addresses. A shall be placed in enhanced foster care [where foster parents have extensive support from the child welfare authorities].', '4. No minimum level of contact between the mother and the girls is set out. If contact sessions are to take place, the child welfare authorities are authorised to supervise them.', '5. No minimum level of contact between the father and the girls is set out. If contact sessions are to take place, the child welfare authorities are authorised to supervise them.”', '32. The decision was brought before the City Court (tingrett). When the hearing started, on 9 November 2011, the applicant was not present. Her counsel was there and argued that the case should be postponed. After the City Court had decided not to do so, the applicant’s counsel left as he was of the opinion that he could not attend to the interests of his client. However, C informed the court that he was in touch with the applicant. She arrived later the same day at the court and stated that she had spoken to her counsel. She also argued that the case should be adjourned. When told that it had already been decided to continue the hearing, the applicant left the court.', '33. On 21 November 2011 the City Court upheld the Board’s decision. As to the applicant and her counsel leaving the hearing, the court noted that it found it difficult to view this as anything but an attempt to force the court into postponing the case, although it did not find it clear why they wanted the case to be postponed. Based on the evidence presented to it, the City Court found it highly likely that C would attempt to abduct the children. Moreover, it was found to be the case that C was in control of the applicant and that she followed his orders. Among other things, the City Court referred to the fact that the applicant under the hearing had made herself unavailable to her counsel, but not to C. The City Court stated that the abduction risk might possibly be regarded differently when the criminal case against C had been heard by the court. At present, however, it took account of how C had declared that the abduction had been in the children’s best interests and concluded that there should be no visiting rights.', '34. Instructed by the applicant’s lawyer on 5 December 2011, a specialist psychologist, J.W., submitted an expert report in the case on 16 December 2011.', '35. The parents appealed to the High Court (lagmannsrett) against the City Court’s judgment.', '36. On 8 March 2012 the applicant submitted an official complaint to the police against C in relation to rape, deprivation of liberty, and threats made in her flat. The applicant went to the crisis centre in G., but moved back to her own flat a few days later. C also contacted the applicant in G. later in March. A restraining order was imposed on him, and the applicant was moved to a secret address.', '37. The High Court appointed the clinical psychologist B.S. as expert (see paragraph 25 above). He submitted his report on 12 August 2012. The High Court then heard the case from 25 to 27 September 2012. The parents were present together with their counsel and gave evidence. Eight witnesses were heard, including two expert witnesses. B.S., the court-appointed expert, gave testimony.', '38. On 22 October 2012 the High Court rejected the appeal. It noted that a care order presupposed serious deficits in the applicant’s caring abilities and though the applicant, if viewed in isolation, would have sufficient capacity to take care of the children with assistance of the child welfare authorities, the question was whether the children would be sufficiently protected from C. The applicant did not want further dealings with him. C’s behaviour showed, however, that he was unwilling to respect her wish. As to contact rights, the High Court did not take a stance on whether a secure regime for visits could be established. At that time, there was in any event an obvious risk that C would again try to kidnap the children.', '39. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court (Høyesterett) was denied by the Supreme Court’s Committee on Leave to Appeal (Høyesteretts ankeutvalg) on 19 December 2012.', '40. During the summer of 2013, the applicant was subject to threats from her half-brother, on paid assignment from C, in order to make her move back to Iraq. On 12 August 2013 she was granted divorce. The hearing of the criminal charges against C took place in September 2013.', '41. On 1 October 2013 the child welfare authorities applied to the Board for an order that the applicant and C have their parental responsibility in respect of A and B removed; parental responsibility would then be transferred to the authorities. The authorities also applied for the Board’s authorisation of the foster parents’ adoption of the children. The applicant applied to the Board for an order that A and B’s placement in care be discontinued.', '42. On 3 October 2013 the District Court convicted C of abducting the children (see paragraph 30 above) and sentenced him to one year and seven months’ imprisonment, of which six months were suspended. C appealed against the judgment.', '43. On 29 November 2013 the Board appointed B.S., the psychologist, as its expert. He submitted a report on 31 January 2014 (see paragraph 53 below).', '44. The case was heard on 10 and 11 February 2014. The Board sat with a chairperson who was qualified to act as a professional judge, a psychologist and a layperson, in accordance with the first paragraphs of sections 7-2 and 7-5 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 114 below). The applicant was present with her legal aid counsel and gave evidence. C was in Iraq, but testified by telephone as a party to the case and was represented by his counsel. The appointed expert attended the proceedings and testified. One other witness was heard.', '45. In its decision of 25 February 2014, the Board noted that the previous care order case had been considered as directed against the applicant, as C had accepted that she had day-to-day care and control of the children. This situation had not changed, and C now supported the applicant’s claim for revocation of the care order.', '46. The Board first reiterated the following from the High Court’s judgment of 22 October 2012 concerning the children’s placement in care (see paragraph 38 above):', '“In the High Court’s opinion, seen in isolation, the mother will be capable of providing adequate care for the children, provided that adequate assistance measures are offered. The High Court understands that this opinion is shared – although to a varying extent – by all the experts who have appeared before [it].”', '47. There was limited updated information about the applicant’s situation at the time of the Board’s decision, but it was clear that she had been granted a divorce from C. She had also passed a Norwegian language course and established a small social network in G. Seen in isolation, her ability to provide care thus appeared to have improved somewhat since the High Court hearing.', '48. On the other hand, the High Court had concluded that there were serious deficiencies in the applicant’s ability to provide care because of the threat that C represented to her and the children. The Board made reference to the following passages from High Court’s judgment:', '“... the question at issue in this case is whether the children will be sufficiently protected against violence from their father if they are returned. It is very important to the father that the children grow up in accordance with their Kurdish background, and he is clearly willing to go to great lengths to achieve this, possibly also by using violent methods. He has stated that the purpose of the abduction was to take them to Iraq. ...', 'After the presentation of the evidence, the High Court is in no doubt that the father is violent and represents a threat to the mother. ...', 'Based on the facts described above, the High Court finds that there is a strong preponderance of likelihood of the father having committed violent acts against the mother, and that it is probable that he, or someone acting on his behalf, will be violent to the mother again. Among other things, [the court] points out that the expert witness J.W., who has assessed the violence described in the case in a cultural context, believes that the mother’s ‘life probably was [or] is in serious danger’.', 'The mother and father are divorced, and the mother wants no further contact with the father. His behaviour as recently as in March this year in G. shows that he is not willing to respect the mother’s wish to break off contact [with him]. In the High Court’s opinion, there can be little doubt that the father’s further contact with the mother will be harmful to the children and constitute a significant deficiency in relation to the children’s safety if the care order is revoked.”', '49. However, the High Court had stated in its judgment that the question of contact for the applicant could be seen in a different light if C were expelled from the country. This was because the security concerns described in the judgment would then not apply to the same extent.', '50. The expert appointed by the Board, B.S., had not carried out a new assessment of the applicant’s ability to provide care in his report of 31 January 2014 (see paragraph 43 above). In a statement dated 11 February 2014 from the Child Welfare Expert’s Commission (barnesakkyndig kommisjon), one of the two commission members had remarked that it would have been preferable for the mother to have been given an opportunity to comment on such a serious matter. It was also stated that it was expected that this would form part of the Board’s consideration of the case.', '51. In his testimony before the Board, psychologist B.S. upheld his assessment given in the report of 31 January 2014 that, seen in isolation, the applicant’s ability to provide care was sufficient for her to have care and control of the children with assistance measures in place. The Board agreed, and also made reference to the High Court’s assessment of this issue (see paragraphs 38 and 46 above). Nothing in the case indicated that the applicant’s ability to provide care had deteriorated since the High Court’s hearing in 2012. If anything, it had to be deemed to have slightly improved. The applicant had testified before the Board and the Board considered that the issue had been adequately clarified.', '52. The children’s father had been in Iraq for months, and had stated in his testimony as a party to the case that he was building a house and was engaged to be married to a new woman. He had no plans to return to Norway, and he planned to settle permanently in Iraq. The father had last been in Norway during the criminal proceedings against him in September 2013. His counsel stated that the conviction had not been formally served on C, but he had nonetheless appealed against it, and he added that he expected C to sign the letter accompanying the appeal soon, so that the High Court could consider it.', '53. In his expert report of 31 January 2014 to the Board, B.S. had given the following assessment of the situation:', '“According to information received, the father is currently in Iraq. If he returns to [Norway], he must expect to be arrested to serve the prison term he was sentenced to for the abduction. [I do] not know if he would then be expelled from the country. The present situation resembles the situation that the High Court deemed to be associated with less risk for the children [(see paragraph 49 above)].', '[I do] not necessarily agree with the High Court’s assessment. This is a complex issue, and to the extent that the question of risk can be clarified with a sufficient degree of certainty, that would require extensive investigation which would also involve the parents’ relatives and other networks in countries other than Norway. That is far beyond the remit of the expert examination. Nevertheless, it is possible to make some general reflections based partly on knowledge about what is common in the parents’ culture, and partly on information provided by the parents themselves.', 'The children belong to the father’s family. Not just to the father, but to his family. The mother has main responsibility for bringing up the children as long as they are regarded as children. It is therefore unproblematic for the father to accept that the children be returned to the mother to grow up with her. Once they are grown up, however, they will still belong to their father’s family. They will be considered ‘adult’ long before the Norwegian age of majority; age of sexual maturity is a more relevant criterion than chronological age.', 'For a family that is concerned with the honour code, the actions of an adult daughter have a bearing on the whole family’s honour. If she leads a life in conflict with the family’s norms, particularly as regards her sexual life, this affects the whole family, which will lose all prestige in the eyes of the surrounding world. In extreme cases, the family may feel forced to track down the woman and kill her to restore the family’s honour and prestige. This does not necessarily diminish with time and distance. Nor does this only apply in conservative religious families; it is more a question of culture than of religion. There are several examples of relatives tracking down women living in Western countries and committing so-called honour killings despite the family having lived in the West for many years and appearing to be modern and well-integrated.', 'If such mechanisms are at play in the father’s family, the father’s whereabouts are less important in relation to the risk. Nor will the risk diminish with time. The opposite may even be true. A and B are young children, and children are not in a position to disgrace their family. As they become older, keeping them under control may become much more important for the family than it is today. Preferably, they should be ‘saved’ before they have the opportunity to do anything wrong. The family could achieve this by organising another abduction and taking them to Iraq. If the children were nevertheless to bring dishonour on the family, or if the family assumed that to be the case because they lived outside the family’s control, there is a possibility that A and B would risk being hunted for years and maybe even killed if their family found them.', 'On the basis of the above, [I am] of the opinion that the risk associated with disclosing A and B’s whereabouts has not decreased, even though the father is abroad. This means that returning them to their mother would still entail a serious threat to their care situation, even if the mother, seen in isolation, may be able to provide proper care. Based on what is known about the mother from before, [I am] highly uncertain whether the mother would keep her and her children’s identities secret from the father’s family in the event that she was given a new identity and a secret address. In order for such an arrangement to be safe, the mother would probably have to break off all contact with her own family as well. It is neither realistic nor ethically justifiable to make this a condition.”', '54. In the Child Welfare Expert’s Commission’s statement of 11 February 2014 (see paragraph 50 above), one of the two commission members had pointed out that the expert’s conclusions as quoted above were not based on concrete knowledge about the situation in this family. The member had also stated that, when so much time was devoted to considerations on the family and situation in Iraq, this could easily give a wrong impression, even if doubts were also included in the report. This could easily lead to incorrect or false premises being established for the assessment of the risk associated with the mother’s contact with the children in a situation where their biological father was not in the country. The other commission member had had no comments on the expert’s report.', '55. The Board agreed that assessing the risk with a sufficient degree of certainty would require extensive investigation. This had not been done in this case, and the Board had no option but to base its assessment on the known facts. Based on the presentation of evidence, the Board agreed with the expert that his concerns regarding the risk had not been assuaged during the hearing before the Board.', '56. Firstly, the police still considered the children to be at high risk of being kidnapped. The police had not testified about this before the Board, but the Board had no reason to doubt the police’s assessment. The Board had been informed that the foster families had to clear all visits outside the municipality with the police. At a time when the police’s use of resources was under continuous evaluation, the Board saw no reason to believe that the level of protection was seen as excessive.', '57. Secondly, C had tracked down and raped the applicant in March 2012, and had also approached her later that month. In the summer of 2013 the applicant had received death threats from her half-brother, among other things, and she herself had stated that the threats had been made because C had paid her half-brother to do this. The applicant had informed the Board that she had been kept under surveillance for a prolonged period by her half-brother, who had come to Norway under an alias. She had reported this to the police, and the police had allegedly told her that her brother might possibly be expelled from Norway. However, she did not know his whereabouts. Since C had on two occasions and until quite recently used accomplices to put the applicant and/or the children in great danger, the Board considered C’s actual location of less importance. There was also good reason to question whether he would stay away from Norway, given that he had appealed against the District Court’s judgment in the criminal case (see paragraph 42 above). An appeal on the question of his guilt would be dismissed if he did not appear.', '58. Thirdly, C’s mother in Iraq had stated that she would come to Norway if the children were not returned to the applicant. She had also said that her husband, A and B’s paternal grandfather, was very ill and had been hospitalised as a result of the stress of the children being taken away from the family. These statements showed that the stress on the family as a result of the case did not seem to have diminished, but in fact still seemed to have a strong presence. The paternal grandmother’s statement gave the impression that the children’s fate was the family’s responsibility, and not a matter that just concerned C.', '59. Fourthly, the Board considered it unlikely (“lite sannsynlig”) that the applicant would be able to protect the children from their father if they were returned to her. When the children were younger, the applicant had repeatedly demonstrated that she was unable to protect herself and the children from C. She had moved back to C several times, despite having reported him to the police for violence against both herself and the children. He could not be prosecuted for these offences because the applicant either withdrew her previous statements or refused to make statements to the police. Since the abduction in 2011, C had contacted the applicant several times, and he had also been violent again. Despite knowing that C was behind the death threats and surveillance of her in the summer of 2013, she now believed that he did not represent a risk. It was difficult to say whether this was what the applicant actually believed or whether it had to do with her wish for the children to be returned to her. In any case, the applicant’s statement indicated that she failed to realise how serious the situation was.', '60. The expert’s assessment was that if the applicant were to have care and control of the children then she would probably have to break off all contact with her own family. The Board concurred with the expert’s view. The applicant and C had reportedly grown up in the same neighbourhood, and the families knew each other. At least one member of the applicant’s family had demonstrated that he was willing to carry out unlawful acts on behalf of C. The applicant’s contact with her own family would therefore entail a significant risk of her and the children’s whereabouts becoming known to C. The applicant had stated that she would be willing to break off all contact with her family if the children were returned to her. However, when at the same time she said that C was no longer a threat, it was difficult for the Board to envisage that she would be sufficiently motivated to make such a sacrifice. In the Board’s assessment, C represented such a significant threat that the children would probably be at risk, even if the applicant managed to break off contact with her family. The Board referred to how C had over a period of several years demonstrated that he had both the means and the will to carry out his wishes. His rape of the applicant in March 2012, and the surveillance and death threats against her via an accomplice in the summer of 2013 showed that he had learnt nothing from the abduction in 2011. On the basis of the factors set out above, the Board assumed that, for the foreseeable future, C appeared to be prepared to use unlawful means to gain control over the applicant and the children.', '61. It had been argued before the Board, particularly by C’s counsel, that the risk to the children would be lesser if they were with their applicant rather than placed in a foster family. The reasons given for this were that C and his family wanted the children to be returned to the applicant, and they would then be satisfied with the situation. The Board did not rule out the possibility that C and his family would be satisfied for a while and thus not represent any immediate threat if the children were returned. However, this had to be regarded as highly uncertain, and it would in any case depend entirely on how the applicant chose to live her life with the children. If she were to deviate from what was expected of her regarding how the children were raised, the children would again be at risk. Reference was made to the comment in the expert report that the children in a Kurdish family belonged to the father’s family, and that, for example, the actions of an adult or sexually mature daughter would have a bearing on the whole family’s honour.', '62. Overall, the Board found that it had been substantiated that the risk of the children and/or the applicant being subjected to criminal offences by C had remained virtually unchanged since the High Court had considered this issue in October 2012 (see paragraph 38 above). This meant that the risk associated with disclosing A and B’s whereabouts had not decreased, even if C was currently in Iraq. The parents had argued that no attempts to abduct the children had been made since 2011, and this showed that the risk was significantly reduced. The Board did not share this view. According to the Board’s assessment, this was because the children’s whereabouts had not been disclosed and there had been a comprehensive security regime in place since July 2011.', '63. On the basis of the above, the Board concluded that the applicant had to be deemed permanently unable to provide the children with proper care, and falling within the scope of section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 114 below). This assessment also meant that her application for revocation of the care order pursuant to section 4-21 could not be granted.', '64. Since the Board concluded that the applicant was unable to provide proper care, it was not necessary to discuss whether the attachment criterion in section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 114 below) was also satisfied. Considering how serious the case was and its profound importance to the parties involved, the Board nevertheless found grounds to discuss this issue, and started its assessment by seeking to clarify the children’s functioning and care needs.', '65. The Board noted that A, the oldest daughter, had shown a lot of anger and had acted out during her initial period in foster care. She had been insecure, had not wanted her foster parents to leave her, and had slept next to her foster mother at night. She had wanted constant reassurance that she was to live in the foster home forever. This had improved considerably from approximately March 2013. Most of the anxiety had now gone, and the foster home interpreted this to mean that A now felt certain that she would not have to leave the foster home. A disliked events involving big crowds, such as end-of-term events. She had taken part in a leisure activity, but had stopped because she preferred to stay at home. The appointed psychologist, B.S., had stated before the Board that A had spontaneously told him during his visits that thieves had tried to steal her. The foster parents had told him later that A had not talked about this for a long time, and that they never talked about the abduction with A. The expert’s interpretation was that A still appeared to have memories of her abduction. He also assumed that she had memories of her parents’ turbulent marriage, since she was nearly three years old at the time of her emergency placement.', '66. Furthermore, the Board took into account that A had had several temporary placements, and psychologist B.S. had found her to be highly vulnerable with regard to new broken relationships. In his opinion, losing her foster parents would be a traumatic experience for A.', '67. The other daughter, B, had been six months old when placed in emergency care. She had arrived in the foster home when she was about a year old. The foster parents described her as a timid girl who only wanted to sit on her foster mother’s lap. She would not let anyone get close to her except her foster mother, who could never leave a room without B following her. Gradually, the foster father had been allowed to get closer to her, first by sitting next to them while B sat on her foster mother’s lap. Even at the time of the Board’s decision, B had an extreme fear of losing her foster parents. In the autumn of 2013 the foster parents had gone away for the weekend. B had been to stay with an aunt who had children of the same age and whom B knew well and was fond of. The foster parents had prepared her thoroughly, telling her that they were going away for a few days, but that they would come back. When they had come to collect her, B had reacted with hysterical laughter that had turned into sobbing and crying. She had clung to her foster mother and repeated over and over again that they must never leave her again. Even now, four months later, B was still back at the stage where both the foster parents could not leave the room at once. She woke up two or three times during the night and said “mummy”, quietly at first. If she did not get a response immediately, she would stand up and shout “mummy” in a frightened voice.', '68. In his report, B.S. had concluded that A and B basically had normal abilities and were resourceful children who had developed well cognitively, socially and in terms of their motor skills. However, the children’s previous experiences of their violent father, their dramatic abduction and broken relationships had made them particularly vulnerable with regard to new broken relationships.', '69. The expert had described to the Board a strong, secure and good attachment between the children and their foster parents. B had been living in the foster home since she was one year old, and she saw the foster parents as her mother and father. The same applied to A, even though she was three years old when placed in the foster home. She knew that she had another mother who loved her, but her strong attachment was to her foster home. The Board concurred with the expert’s assessment, and found that the children had become strongly attached to the people with whom they were living and the environment in which they were living. In the Board’s view, removing the children from their foster homes would constitute a serious trauma with the potential to do great harm. Both alternative conditions in the third paragraph of section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act (see paragraph 114 below) were thus deemed to be fulfilled.', '70. As to adoption, the Board initially observed that the central question in the case was whether adoption would be in the children’s best interests. Adoption was a highly invasive measure and, pursuant to case-law, particularly compelling reasons were required for consent to adoption to be granted against the biological parents’ wishes. The decision had to be based on a concrete assessment, but also on general experience, as set out by the Supreme Court in a judgment reported in Norsk Retstidende (Rt.) 2007 page 561 (later brought before the Court, see Aune v. Norway, no. 52502/07, 28 October 2010 and paragraph 117 below):', '“In my opinion, a clear distinction cannot be drawn between general experience and individual considerations; general experience can be expressed with varying degrees of nuance, for example, based on the child’s age when it was placed in the foster home and how long the placement has lasted and will last. The expert witness in this case has stated that, in his general experience, a foster home relationship is not the preferable option for the long-term placement of children who go to the foster home before forming an attachment to a biological parent; in such cases, adoption is in the child’s best interests. In my opinion, considerable importance must be attached to such general, but nuanced experience. However, individual circumstances – which could weigh for or against adoption – must also be assessed in relation to general experience.”', '71. The Board found the strict conditions set out by the Supreme Court fulfilled in this case.', '72. Research showed that adoption would generally give a stronger sense of security and belonging in a family situation than a foster placement. An adoption removed all doubts about where a child would grow up, and normally strengthened the attachment between the child and the adoptive parents. It was the Board’s assessment that this general experience also applied in the present case.', '73. It was normally beneficial for children to have contact with their parents, even in cases where children had to live outside the home for various reasons. In principle, an adoption broke all legal ties between a child and his or her parents, and any continued contact with the biological family would normally be dependent on the adoptive parents’ ability and wish to maintain such contact.', '74. Since the abduction, and following the Board’s decision of 24 June 2011 (see paragraph 31 above), there had been no contact sessions between A and B and their parents for nearly three years at the time of the Board’s decision of 25 February 2014. The Board therefore found that it had to be deemed that there was little attachment between the applicant and the children. This was particularly so in B’s case, who was only six months old at the time of her placement in care on an emergency basis. After the emergency placement, B had had contact sessions with the applicant for about six months, but they had ended following the abduction. Therefore, no attachment could be said to exist between the applicant and B in a psychological sense. A, who had lived with the applicant for nearly three years, would probably have an attachment to her. However, this attachment also had to be deemed considerably weakened as a result of the prolonged interruption of contact. In addition, the attachment between the applicant and A probably had to be deemed tinged by a certain amount of insecurity as a result of the family situation with the violent father.', '75. In addition to the significantly weakened attachment, authorities that had previously considered the case had concluded that the high risk involved meant that contact between the children and their parents was not an option. The Board concurred with this assessment and found that it still applied. Stopping contact would therefore not have any major immediate consequences for the children, and such consequences, seen in isolation, did not constitute a strong argument against adoption. The security situation meant that the children’s cultural background could not be maintained without a risk of their identities being exposed, and therefore cultural considerations could not be a strong argument against adoption either.', '76. The Board also found that the general arguments in favour of adoption applied to both A and B. In the Board’s opinion, the extraordinary circumstances of their placement and the security situation gave added weight to these arguments. Adoption had clear advantages with regard to security. The children would be able to use their new names, which would mean that the risk of their identities being exposed would be significantly reduced. The foster families currently lived under a fairly strict security regime under which, for example, they could not leave the municipality without informing the police. The police’s assessment was that the risk of another kidnapping remained high, and it was unavoidable that this would have a big impact on A and B’s lives. Although adoption would not remove the risk entirely, the reduced risk of the children’s identities being exposed would be highly beneficial.', '77. Based on the above factors, the Board found that adoption would be in A and B’s best interests and that consent for adoption should be granted.', '78. The foster parents’ identities were not known to the Board, and owing to security concerns they had not testified before it. This was largely why the Board had appointed expert B.S. to assess the foster parents’ suitability.', '79. The foster parents had had daily care and control of A and B for nearly three years, which had to be considered a sufficient period in terms of assessing their suitability.', '80. B.S., the psychologist, had spoken very highly of the way the foster parents cared for A and B. He had described both foster homes of the two daughters as characterised by warmth, generosity and sensitivity to the children’s needs. A’s foster parents’ counsellor had told B.S. that she considered the foster parents well suited as adoptive parents. Both children had developed a strong and secure attachment to their foster parents. They received the daily care, personal contact and security that they needed. The foster parents’ suitability for the task had not been contested either – either by the applicant or by C. The Board saw no reason to doubt that the foster parents would also continue to take good care of A and B in the future, and that they were fit to bring up the children as their own. Owing to the children’s age and development, obtaining their opinion was not an option.', '81. Based on the above, the Board found that the conditions set out in the Child Welfare Act were satisfied.', '82. In order to grant consent to the children’s adoption, the Board also had to make a formal decision to remove the parents’ parental responsibility. The Board endorsed the municipal child welfare authorities’ proposal on this point, since removal of parental responsibility was necessary and in the children’s best interests. On this basis, the Board consented to adoption in the parents’ stead.', '83. The Board observed that the child welfare authorities had not proposed that there be an order on contact visits following the children’s adoption, because of the security situation, and the applicant had argued that failing to ask the foster parents whether they would consent to her having contact constituted a procedural error.', '84. However, the Board found that even if the foster parents had given their consent for contact visits, that would be irrelevant, because such contact would entail too great a security risk. It had been clearly substantiated that there was a risk that C would try to find the children if there was provision for contact visits. Even if the applicant was prepared not to disclose information, the children could easily disclose information that would reveal their whereabouts and new names during contact with the mother. In the Board’s opinion, the applicant would be at great risk of violence and threats from the father, in order for her to disclose such information. Contact visits could therefore not be considered in the children’s best interests.', '85. Both parents requested that the case be reviewed by the City Court.', '86. The City Court reappointed B.S. as an expert. He delivered an updated report on 14 August 2014. Composed of one professional judge, one psychologist and one layperson, in accordance with section 36-4 of the Dispute Act (see paragraph 121 below), the City Court heard the case on 26 and 27 August 2014. The applicant attended with her legal aid counsel and testified. C’s counsel attended, whilst C gave evidence by telephone from Iraq. The court-appointed expert was present on the second day of the hearing, and gave evidence.', '87. In its judgment of 9 September 2014, the City Court stated that removal of parental responsibility and adoption against the parents’ wishes under section 4-20 of the Child Welfare Act were very serious and invasive measures that required compelling reasons. The best interests of the children were the most important aspect, and the decision had to take account of this.', '88. The City Court agreed with the Board that removal of parental responsibility and adoption was nevertheless necessary in this case, and referred to the thorough grounds given by the Board for its decision.', '89. In addition, the City Court noted that the applicant’s situation had improved since the Board’s hearing. She had shown steady positive development and established an independent life for herself after the final breakdown of her relationship with C. The applicant was taking Norwegian language classes and undergoing training in order to improve her employment prospects. There was general agreement that, with assistance measures, she had the ability to care for children, but not two children with so traumatic a background as A and B.', '90. The girls had had many traumatic experiences. There was no doubt that C had committed serious violence against the applicant in the presence of the girls on a number of occasions. They had had to flee to different crisis centres together with the applicant. They had also moved back to a violent father with her. This had clearly been frightening for them and they were both marked by the experience, even today.', '91. The girls had been abducted by masked men during a contact session with the applicant. The men had injured the applicant, who had been hospitalised. The abduction had been planned by C, and the girls had been found with him in a flat in H. The plan had been to take the girls to Iraq. The abduction that their own father had put them through must have been a very frightening experience for them, one whose after-effects they were still struggling with.', '92. The abduction had resulted in broken relationships with their emergency foster parents when the girls had been placed in new emergency foster homes. That had necessarily been followed by another rupture when they had been placed in foster homes. As a result of their background, both girls had suffered from separation anxiety but had now become strongly attached to their foster parents. They clung to them and were afraid of losing their foster parents.', '93. The City Court reiterated the following from B.S.’s report of 14 August 2014:', '“The ability to provide care must always be assessed in relation to the children’s care needs. A and B have a history and display behaviour that means that they can no longer be assumed to just have the same ordinary care needs as other children their age. If the mother were to have care and control of the children, she would have to deal with the extensive additional challenges that returning them [to her] would entail. The mother’s ability to reflect on the children’s history and special needs seems to be limited. The expert has strong doubts as to whether the mother’s ability to provide care is sufficient to meet A and B’s needs in the short and long term. Returning them [to her] is therefore not assumed to be a realistic alternative if consideration for the children’s best interests is to be the deciding factor.”', '94. Before the City Court, expert B.S. upheld the recommendations he had made to the Board in his report of 31 January 2014 (see paragraphs 43 and 53 above).', '95. After visiting the children in their foster homes in January 2014, he had made the following statement in that respect about the children’s attachment to their foster parents:', '“When [I] last visited the foster homes, the children had started to form an attachment to their foster parents. This process has now progressed much further. [My] observations, the foster parents’ statements and the foster home counsellor’s assessments all point in the same direction: A and B have established strong attachments to their foster parents and perceive them as their psychological parents [(“sine psykologiske foreldre”)].', 'The interaction between A and her foster parents was characterised by a calm, warm and intimate atmosphere. [She] related to the foster parents in the way you would expect of a child with a secure attachment to her parents. The foster parents were attentive and responded to her input, but were also clear about their expectations of her.', 'B primarily related to the foster mother as her secure base for exploration. She was verbally active and spoke well, using varied language. She gave clear signals of what she wanted. The atmosphere in B’s home and the interaction between her and her foster parents were the same as for A: calm, pleasant and characterised by warmth and closeness.', 'The children basically have normal abilities and are resourceful children who have developed well cognitively, linguistically, socially and with regard to their motor skills. At the same time, they have had experiences of an unusually frightening nature. They have experienced violence committed by the father against the mother, which is today considered to be as harmful to children as their being victims of violence themselves. The children may also have suffered violence at the hands of their father. Then came the broken relationship when they were taken into care, the dramatic abduction, the emergency foster home placement, and finally the foster home placement. Although the children do not have memories of these events that enable them to tell a coherent story, many observations show that they both have fragmentary memories. A’s story about thieves who wanted to steal her in the other country and B’s fear of a bad man can be assumed to be rooted in such memories.', 'These experiences have left the children particularly vulnerable to new broken relationships. They both display intense separation anxiety and cling to their foster parents. A has begun to relax more and seems to have achieved a sense of security that “mummy” and “daddy” will always be there. B is in a new clingy period, triggered by the foster parents being away from her for a few nights some months ago.', 'In [my] opinion, there is no doubt that the children have a strong attachment to the people with whom they are living and the environment in which they are living. Being removed from them would constitute a serious trauma with the potential to do great harm, not least because of the vulnerability they have developed as a result of their experiences before the placement.”', '96. The City Court deemed it out of the question to expose the children to the risk that returning them to the applicant would entail, and found that the conditions for this were not satisfied. They had not had any contact with their mother since the abduction on 21 June 2011. At the time of the court’s examination, they had no attachment to her. The City Court had no doubt that the children had such an attachment to their foster parents that it would be harmful to them to be removed.', '97. Agreeing with the court-appointed expert, the City Court found it completely improbable (“helt usannsynlig”) that the parents would at any point in the future be in a position to make use of or exercise their parental responsibility. The situation was permanent, and it was in the children’s best interests that the foster parents be given parental responsibility for them.', '98. It was sufficient for the removal of parental responsibility that the alternative requirement regarding attachment (as referred to in section 4-21 of the Child Welfare Act, see paragraph 114 below) was satisfied. The City Court nevertheless commented that there was still a risk with respect to C and his family. C had stated that the children meant everything to him, and the City Court did not rule out the possibility that he might make another attempt to take them to the Kurdistan-area if he found out about their whereabouts. The risk of this would increase significantly if the applicant were granted contact with her daughters again.', '99. The police had carried out a new threat assessment before the main hearing in August 2014. The following was stated in their report:', '“There is little doubt that the mother in particular, but possibly also the father, will continue to fight for parental responsibility in respect of their children. However, the police consider it improbable that they will find out where the children are under the current circumstances. The children are young and cannot make contact with the mother or father themselves.', 'However, one should not underestimate the will the father has demonstrated to get his children back. The abduction on 21 June 2011 probably required a lot of planning, and he put considerable resources into executing the plan. In addition, the abduction showed a willingness to use violent means to achieve his goals.', 'The father himself stated to the police that he hired people to carry out the abduction. It is unclear what role the mother played in this, but given that she brought a large sum of money and a lot of clothes and other equipment to the meeting on 21 June 2011, it is not inconceivable that she might have known more than she told the police.”', '100. The police had concluded that the threat level was moderate at that time because the parents did not know the children’s whereabouts, but that this could change. The following had been stated in the conclusion:', '“When applications are lodged for contact with the children, the threat situation could change significantly. The children have now reached an age where they could easily reveal the names of their foster parents and where they live. This applies regardless of where and how contact sessions are held. In addition, it is highly probable that the father, if he finds out that the mother has been granted contact with the children, may become active again. It is known that, in certain cultures, the father has a ‘right’ to the children when a marriage breaks down or similar situations arise. It was also an issue that he wanted to send the children back to his home country.”', '101. The City Court found that it had been proved that a threat still existed which made it imperative to protect the children. It did not trust the applicant to be able to protect them against C if he were to become aware that she had contact with them. Nor did it trust C to accept that the children should remain in their foster homes. He had previously used accomplices and could do so again. Members of his own family could help him to take the children to the Kurdistan-area. In return for payment from C, the applicant’s half-brother had also tried to threaten her into returning to their home country.', '102. The children could not be subjected to the risk of being abducted and taken to Iraq by people who were strangers to them. The City Court therefore also agreed to their identities remaining secret. This meant that there could be no contact with the applicant for fear that someone could reveal where they were living. If contact sessions were to take place, it would not be difficult to follow them home, regardless of what security measures were put in place.', '103. The City Court also agreed with the child welfare authorities that adoption offered many advantages compared with placement in a permanent foster home (see paragraph 76 above). Adoption provided a higher degree of stability (“trygghet”), both for the foster parents and for the children. This was true in general, but it was particularly important to A and B, considering their history (“bakgrunn”). In this connection, it also had to be taken into consideration that the strict security measures that had been put in place to prevent another abduction had to be maintained. The children had changed their names and lived at secret addresses.', '104. The foster parents had a strong wish to adopt the girls. According to the court-appointed psychologist, B.S., both girls had been particularly lucky with their foster home placements.', '105. Both parents appealed to the High Court against the City Court’s judgment. The applicant’s appeal was not directed against the decision not to discontinue public care. In her declaration of appeal, she stated that she accepted that it had been a long time since her two children had been placed in their foster homes and that, having regard to their attachment at the time, she would not maintain the claim that they be returned to her. She appealed against the decision to remove her parental authority and authorise the children’s adoption, and requested that the High Court grant her visiting rights.', '106. In a decision of 8 December 2014, the High Court unanimously refused to give the parents leave to appeal.', '107. The High Court noted that the reasons given for the City Court’s judgment were relatively brief, but this was because that court had concurred with the reasons given by the Board. When looking at the Board’s decision and the City Court’s judgment jointly, there was no doubt (“utvilsomt”) that the children’s best interests had been considered in a satisfactory and adequate manner.', '108. was not flawed because the significance of the children’s cultural background and identity had not been considered separately in the decision regarding what would be in their best interests. The same went for the question of sibling identity. The High Court found it clear that deciding to remove the parents’ parental responsibility and granting consent to the children’s adoption in this case was not in breach of Article 8 of the Convention or Articles 3 and 9 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.', '109. As regards the assessment of the children’s future situation with regard to security, the outcome was not central to the question of removal of parental responsibility and consent to adoption. As stated by the City Court, it was sufficient for the alternative requirement regarding attachment to be satisfied (see paragraph 98 above). This was not considered to be in dispute. Reference was made to the fact that before the High Court the applicant was no longer applying for the care order to be revoked, in view of the children’s attachment to their foster homes.', '110. In any event, the High Court was of the view that there were no serious flaws in the City Court’s assessment of the security situation. It did not constitute a procedural error that this question had not been examined further and that no expert witnesses with particular expertise in the foreign culture aspects of the case had been appointed.', '111. the fact that the children had been violently abducted in 2011 and the applicant had been subjected to serious threats initiated by C as recently as 2013, there was, in the High Court’s opinion, nothing to indicate that a further examination of the children’s security situation would have led to a different conclusion. The City Court had based its assessment on the police’s assessment that the level of threat against the children was currently moderate, since the parents did not know their whereabouts, but that the situation could change. The City Court had then carried out a concrete assessment of whether contact with the applicant could entail a risk of C initiating an abduction. In the High Court’s view, this assessment had not been flawed, either in terms of the assessment of the evidence or the application of the law.', '112. The applicant appealed against the High Court’s refusal to grant her leave to appeal to the Supreme Court.', '113. On 5 February 2015 the Supreme Court’s Committee on Leave to Appeal, composed of three Supreme Court Justices, rejected the appeal, unanimously finding that it had no prospects of success.']",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0

The applicants are Turkish nationals. The applicant in the first case, Mr Ahmet Bezek, was born in 1980 and is represented before the Court by Mr U. Sommer, a lawyer practising in Cologne. The applicant in the second case, Mr Sinan Bezek, was born in 1976 and is represented before the Court by Mr G. Bogatz, a lawyer practising in Bendestorf. Both applicants are currently serving a prison sentence in Bremen.', '2.', '3. In the night of 5/6 January 2006 a shooting took place in front of a nightclub in the Bremen entertainment district which left several persons seriously injured.', '4. On 11 December 2007 a Chamber of the Bremen Regional Court, consisting of the presiding judge S., the judge P., one further professional judge and two lay judges, convicted G.L. of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced him to ten years and six months imprisonment.', '5. Based on G.L.’s confession, which was supported by witness evidence, the Chamber considered that G.L. had started the shooting into a group of people standing in front of the night club, thereby accepting that he might inflict lethal injuries. The Chamber did not attach credibility to G. L.’s submissions that the applicants had not been involved in the shooting incident, but considered that G.L. had committed the offences jointly with the two applicants. Based on witness evidence and an expert examination of bullets found on the site, the Chamber considered that the first applicant had fired at least three shots and the second applicant at least one shot. The Chamber considered that G.L. and the applicants had acted upon a joint plan, resulting in each perpetrator being liable for the acts committed by his accomplices under Article 25 § 2 of the Criminal Code as joint principals (Mittäterschaft, see relevant domestic law, below).', '6. The judgment, which was 151 pages long, inter alia contained the following references to the applicants:', '“All three of them [G.L. and the two applicants] had been equipped with firearms. It was clear to them – even without an express agreement, that they would make use of the weapons they carried if the situation should arise....At that time at the latest witness Ahmed Bezek [the first applicant] carried a silver revolver with a 9 mm calibre and Sinan Bezek [the second applicant] a pistol, calibre 7.65 mm, which had been assembled from various weapon parts (p. 34 of the judgment)...Immediately after the accused had fired the first shot, Ahmet and Sinan Bezek drew their weapons and fired in the direction of the B.club (p. 36)...many persons...found themselves within the shooting range of the applicant and of Ahmed and Sinan Bezek (p. 37)...their [the witnesses’] statement is supported by the fact that the accused and the Bezek brothers [the applicants] actually carried weapons (p. 78). The establishment of the facts relating to the other shooters is based on the credible witness statements given by...[The witness] M. has stated that the accused and witnesses Ahmed and Sinan Bezek each carried a weapon in their hand (p. 100)...These statements were confirmed by the testimony given by witness K. He [reported] that he had seen that Sinan Bezek as well as Ahmet Bezek had carried a weapon. Both had shot very rapidly and had then disappeared (p. 100). ... Witness K. has stated that he had heard two shots before arriving at the scene. Shortly afterwards it had really started. He had seen how Sinan Bezek, Ahmet Bezek and the accused had shot (p. 100). Finally, witness D. had stated that he had seen weapons not only in the hands of the accused, but also in the hands of Ahmet and Sinan Bezek, but could not tell for sure whether these two had shot. The accused’s weapon as well as Sinan Bezek’s weapon was black and did not have a drum (p. 100/101). On the basis of the traces and other evidence it has been established...that the projectile with the casing numbered trace no. 28 has been shot from the weapon that had been fired by Sinan Bezek (pp. 105/106). The establishment of the fact that Sinan Bezek was one of the shooters is compatible with the witness testimony (p. 104)....These two pistols had been used by the accused and Sinan Bezek (p. 106)...Sinan Bezek’s pistol was jammed after the first shot (p. 106). The accused is guilty under Articles....of the Criminal Code of attempted manslaughter, causing serious bodily harm and unlawful carrying of a semi-automatic gun, jointly committed with the brothers Ahmet and Sinan Bezek (p. 130)....According to the established facts, the applicant and the witnesses Ahmet and Sinan Bezek had reached at least a tacit understanding to return to the entry of the “T.” [nightclub] and to use the weapons they carried in the expected confrontation with the M.group (p. 131)...The context of the proceedings demonstrates that each of the three shooters was aware of the fact that the respective other ones were armed (p. 131)...The accused’s firing of the first shot had prompted Sinan and Ahmet Bezek to use their own weapons without delay and without any apparent reason (p. 132).”', '7. When giving an oral summary of the reasons of the judgment, the presiding judge S. also referred to the alleged involvement of the two applicants in the incident.', '8. Both applicants were arrested on 6 January 2006 and remained in detention on remand until 21 April 2006. The second applicant was further detained on remand from 17 January 2008 to 28 January 2009 and as from 17 April 2009 until the termination of the criminal proceedings against him.', '9. On 29 February 2008 the Bremen Public Prosecutor issued an indictment against the applicants for attempted manslaughter and violation of the Weapons Act. The Chamber adjudicating the applicants’ case comprised the presiding judge S. and the judge P. – who had both been sitting on the bench in the trial against G.L. – one further professional judge and two lay judges.', '10. Since March 2006, the second applicant had been represented by Ms P., a defence counsel who maintained her lawyer’s offices in Frankfurt/Main. The second applicant requested the Regional Court to appoint Mr Bogatz, who also represents him before the Court, as his second counsel.', '11. On 25/26 March 2008 the presiding judge of the Regional Court requested the applicants’ counsels to inform him about their availability from 28 April to 31 December 2008.', '12. On 31 March 2008 Ms P. informed the Regional Court that she would be available as from May 2008 at the earliest. She further suggested scheduling hearings on two days per week, on Mondays and Fridays. She further stated that the second applicant’s defence would be assured in case Mr Bogatz was appointed as second defence counsel. She pointed out that a second defence counsel had been also appointed in the proceedings against G.L.', '13. On 2 April 2008 the presiding judge of the Regional Court informed the applicants’ counsels about the dates of the intended hearings, generally scheduled for three days per week, and asked them to confirm their respective availability. In view of the fact that each of the applicants would only be represented by one court-appointed counsel, it was of imminent importance that the respective counsels arrived in time for the hearings. He further informed the applicants’ counsels about his intention to withdraw the appointment of Ms P. as the second applicant’s court-appointed defence counsel, in view of the distance between her lawyer’s offices situated in Frankfurt/Main and the Bremen Regional Court where the hearings would take place.', '14. On 18 April a preliminary talk took place between the presiding judge, judge P., public prosecution and the applicants’ defence counsels. According to a note to the case-file prepared by the presiding judge following this discussion, Ms P. had not been able to submit a binding declaration that she would be available on all hearing days.', '15. On 23 April 2008 the presiding judge of the Bremen Regional Court withdrew the appointment of Ms P. as the second applicant’s counsel, rejected his request to appoint Mr Bogatz and appointed another counsel, residing in Bremen, as the second applicant’s defence counsel. The Presiding Judge observed that neither of the counsels had confirmed their availability for all the scheduled hearing days. He further observed that the special relation of confidence existing between Ms P. and the second applicant made it desirable that she could continue her assignment. The lawyer of confidence should regularly be assigned unless serious reasons militated against this. However, in the instant case, the remoteness of Ms P.’s offices made it necessary to withdraw her appointment. Under the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, precedence was to be given to lawyers residing in the respective court district. The proximity of the defence counsel was an important aspect of an appropriate defence and of an orderly course of the proceedings. This factor was enhanced by the fact that the accused was in detention on remand and that the proceedings would be lengthy. In spite of the requirement of special expediency in case of detention on remand, Ms P. had failed to submit a binding declaration that she would be available on all (or at least almost all) pre-scheduled hearing dates. The presiding judge finally observed that the further assignment of Ms P. would cause considerable additional expenses caused by times of absence, travel and accommodation costs.', '16. On 9 June 2008 the Hanseatic Court of Appeal dismissed the second applicant’s complaint about this decision. The Court of Appeal considered that the presiding judge of the Bremen Regional Court, when withdrawing Ms P.’s appointment, had stayed within his margin of appreciation. That court noted that the presiding judge had given several objective reasons for his decision. The distance between the defence counsel’s offices and the court seat was an important aspect in assuring adequate defence. While it was true that Ms P. had entertained her offices in Frankfurt already at the time when she was first appointed defence counsel in July 2006, this did not rule out the withdrawal of appointment, in particular if further reasons emerged during the course of proceedings. In this respect, the Court of Appeal observed that the second applicant had been arrested in January 2008 and that his case had to be processed with the special diligence required in case of detention on remand. In spite of the presiding judge’s repeated requests, Ms P.’s had failed to submit a binding and unequivocal statement that she would be able to attend all – or almost all – of the scheduled hearings. The Hanseatic Court of Appeal finally observed that the second applicant had failed to establish a specific relation of confidence to Ms P. which would exceptionally justify the exorbitant costs which would be incurred by her appointment as the applicant’s defence counsel.', '17. Ms P. continued to represent the second applicant as his chosen defence counsel until 3 February 2009, when her mandate was discontinued for lack of funds.', '18. On 18 and 25 June 2008 the applicants lodged motions for bias against the two judges S. and P. on the grounds that they had both been sitting on the bench which had delivered judgment against the alleged coperpetrator G.L. They considered the Chamber adjudicating the case of G.L. had taken a definite position on the applicants’ guilt. The findings contained in the judgment against G.L. which related to the applicants’ alleged involvement had not been necessary, as G.L. had made a confession in which he had assumed the full responsibility for the shooting incident. The second applicant further referred to the withdrawal of Ms P. as his defence counsel.', '19. On 27 June 2008 another Chamber of the Regional Court rejected the motions for bias as unfounded. The Regional Court reiterated that a mere prior involvement concerning the same matter did not as such raise doubts as to the judges’ impartiality. There were no specific circumstances which allowed drawing a different conclusion in the instant case. The references made to the applicants’ involvement in the shooting incident had been indispensable for establishing G.L.’s criminal liability within the framework of a joint criminal act. In order to establish the guilt of the accused, the trial chamber had been obliged to assign the different contributions to the different persons involved in the incident. The same applied to the oral summary of the reasoning given by the presiding judge on pronouncement of the judgment against G.L.', '20. The Bremen Regional Court heard the applicants’ case on 119 days as from 25 June 2008.', '21. On 4 March 2010 the Bremen Regional Court convicted the applicants, who had denied any involvement in the shooting incident, of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced the first applicant to eight years’ and the second applicant to seven years’ imprisonment. Based on witness evidence, which was corroborated by circumstantial and expert evidence, the Regional Court found it established that the two applicants had taken part in the shooting of 6 January 2006 and that the second applicant had fired one shot and the first applicant at least three shots before their weapons were jammed. The Regional Court furthermore found it established that the applicants had worked as contact persons for the Bremen police, but did not consider that this fact had an influence on their criminal liability.', '22. The judgment, which ran over 354 pages, contained a summary of the previous proceedings. With regard to the judgment given against G.L., the judgment read as follows:', '“The Jury Court I convicted him [G.L.] of attempted manslaughter, grievous bodily harm and unlawfully carrying a firearm and sentenced him to 10 years and 6 months’ imprisonment. At that time, the Jury Court I had gained the conviction that G.L., jointly with Ahmet and Sinan Bezek, who are accused here, fired a multitude of shots into a group of people standing in front of the “B.club”. The judgment against G.L. is now final. G.L. was summoned twice to give testimony as a witness in the instant proceedings. Even though he had no right to refuse to give evidence, he refused in the instant proceedings to give testimony...”', '23. Both applicants lodged appeals on points of law against the judgment of 4 March 2010, in which they inter alia complained about the lack of impartiality of the Jury Court adjudicating their case. The second applicant further complained about the withdrawal of appointment of Ms P. as his defence counsel. On 21 June 2011 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicants’ appeal on points of law.', '24. On 3 August 2011 the Federal Constitutional Court refused to entertain the applicants’ constitutional complaints.', '25. Article 142 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as in force at the relevant time provided:', '“(1) The presiding judge of the [trial] court choses the defence counsel to be appointed preferably among the lawyers residing in the court district. The accused shall be given the opportunity to name defence counsel of his choice within a time limit to be specified. The presiding judge appoints the defence counsel designated by the accused unless there is an important reason for not doing so.”', '26. Pursuant to Article 155 § 1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, criminal investigations and related decisions concern only the accused and the charges brought against him or her. Article 264 § 1 stipulates that a judgment rendered in criminal proceedings shall deal with the offence set out in the bill of indictment as determined in more detail in the light of the outcome of the trial.', '27.

The applicant was born in 1970 and lives in Râmnicu-Vâlcea.', '5. In 1993 the applicant married N.E.C. and their daughter M.A. was born in 2001. Following the couple’s divorce on 28 February 2007, the mother was granted physical custody of the child. As the parents had reached an agreement regulating the applicant’s contact with the child, the visiting rights were not discussed in the divorce proceedings.', '6. Until December 2009, the applicant had unhindered opportunity to talk to his daughter on the phone and to take her to his home whenever he wished. After that date, N.E.C. stopped answering the phone and the only possibility for the applicant to see his daughter was outside her school.', '7. Consequently, on 7 July 2011 the applicant instituted contact proceedings before the Râmnicu-Vâlcea District Court, as a result of which on 16 December 2011 a visiting schedule was established in favour of the applicant.', '8. N.E.C. appealed, arguing that the applicant had never been prevented from visiting the child but that since the divorce he had not visited her more than once every three months and had not contributed in any way to the continuous medical treatment she required. During the proceedings the parties reached an agreement about the visiting schedule. On 17 May 2012 the County Court questioned M.A. and noted:', '“The parents divorced about 5-6 years ago and after that she often used to visit her father up until about 6 months ago, when her mother stopped allowing her to answer the phone, because the father only wanted to make [N.E.C.] angry. Since then, she can no longer answer the phone and her father has not seen her.', 'From her mother’s accounts, she understood that her father was a bad person who caused trouble to [N.E.C.] as they both had businesses selling the same products, and her father had taken away her mother’s employees by promising them higher salaries.', 'She does not wish to visit her father because that would make her mother upset and she does not want that because she cares a lot about her mother. Her mother does not wish her to visit her father, who has a new family and a small child. (...).”', '9. In a decision of 15 June 2012 (hereinafter “the contact order”) the County Court took note of the parents’ agreement as to the visiting schedule and considered that it was beneficial for the child to maintain contact with her father.', '10. N.E.C. lodged an appeal on points of law, unhappy that the child would have to go to the applicant’s home. In a final decision of 19 November 2012 the Piteşti Court of Appeal upheld the County Court’s decision. It noted that the child was used to going to her father’s home and continuing this habit would help consolidate their relationship. It found:', '“The consolidation of the relationship between the applicant and the minor by means of complying with the County Court’s decision is even more necessary since, from the report of the interview with the minor, it appears that the minor had been visiting her father after the parents’ separation until about six months before the hearing, [when the mother] stopped allowing her to talk on the phone with the applicant; from the same report it appears that the minor does not wish to see her father in order not to upset her mother.', 'In these circumstances, the [County Court] has correctly decided that the visits should take place in the applicant’s home, in order to allow the normal parental ties to develop and to avoid the possibility of inculcating feelings of hatred towards the father, which would run counter to the child’s harmonious psychological development.”', '11. As N.E.C. continued to oppose any contact with the child, on 13 March 2013 the applicant contacted a court bailiff and started enforcement proceedings. On 23 March 2013 the application was allowed by the Brezoi District Court, which ordered enforcement of the contact order.', '12. The bailiff invited N.E.C. to bring the child to his office on 5 April 2013, which she failed to do. On 3 May and 7 June 2013 and on 7 March 2014 he went to her home together with the applicant, the police and representatives of the Vâlcea Directorate General on Social Welfare and Child Protection (“the child protection authority”). On each occasion they found no one there, despite prior notification.', '13. On 11 April 2013, at the applicant’s request, the bailiff lodged with the Brezoi District Court an application for penalties against N.E.C., under the provisions of Article 905 of the Code of Civil Procedure (“the CCP”, see paragraph 27 below). N.E.C. reiterated that, as M.A. was refusing to see her father, she would not agree that the child be taken against her will to the applicant’s home. On 20 June 2013 the court ordered N.E.C. to pay a fine of 500 Romanian Lei (RON – approximately 115 euros (EUR) at the relevant time) for each day of non-enforcement of the contact order, starting from the date on which the District Court decision was notified to her. The District Court reiterated the findings of the report of 17 May 2012 concerning the interview with M.A. (see paragraph 8 above) and found that the mother was responsible for the failure to enforce the visiting schedule. It found:', '“From the same report it appears that, although the minor likes to visit her father, she does not wish to do so any more because she does not want to upset her mother.', 'The court concludes that the non-enforcement of the obligation set down in the contact order is caused exclusively by the debtor and there is no evidence to show that the minor herself would refuse in absolute terms contact with the creditor or that she would manifest aversion towards him.”', '14. On 21 August 2013, acting on an application lodged by the bailiff under Article 188 § 2 of the CCP (see paragraph 27 below), the Brezoi District Court fined N.E.C. RON 100 (approximately EUR 22 at the relevant time) for obstructing the enforcement proceedings.', '15. Meanwhile, on 18 August 2014 the bailiff noted that N.E.C. was continuing to reject the visiting schedule and concluded that the enforcement had become objectively impossible. Consequently he terminated the enforcement proceedings and lodged a criminal complaint against N.E.C. (see paragraph 20 below) under the provisions of Article 911 § 2 of the CCP (see paragraph 28 below).', '16. The applicant objected to the stay of execution and asked the Brezoi District Court to compel the bailiff to continue the enforcement proceedings. He also argued that the provisions of the CCP allowing the bailiff to stay the execution while a criminal complaint was ongoing were unconstitutional in so far as it allowed the debtor − in bad faith − to stay or obliterate the enforcement efforts and to manipulate the child’s behaviour to the point of rejecting the non-custodial parent. He did not otherwise contest the findings of the bailiff’s report. On 22 May 2015 the Brezoi District Court dismissed his objection on the grounds that it had become objectively impossible to enforce the court order and that the bailiff had correctly stayed the enforcement once the prosecutor’s office had taken over the case. On 22 March 2016 the appeal lodged by the applicant was also dismissed as unfounded by the Vâlcea County Court. The latter found that the bailiff had complied with all the obligations arising from Articles 909-913 of the CCP (see paragraph 28 below). Later on, in its decision no. 299 of 12 May 2016, the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaint raised by the applicant (see paragraph 30 below).', '17. On 4 March 2014 the applicant asked the District Court to quantify the amount of damages to which he was entitled under Article 905 § 4 of the CCP (see paragraph 27 below). N.E.C. maintained that it had been the applicant who had distanced himself from the child and that due to the break-up of the father-daughter relationship it was impossible to comply with the contact order at that time. On 25 September 2014 the District Court ordered N.E.C. to pay the applicant RON 9,200 (approximately EUR 2,100 at the relevant time). The latter could not obtain this payment as N.E.C. had sold all her possessions and had not declared any fixed income.', '18. On 6 January 2015 the applicant asked the child protection authority to seek a court order for three months of psychological counselling for his daughter, reiterating that N.E.C. was alienating M.A. from her father. On 9 January 2015 the child protection authority refused to intervene since the bailiff had not recorded in his report that the child had opposed the enforcement “in absolute terms”, as required by Article 912 of the CCP (see paragraph 28 below).', '19. On 14 January 2015 the applicant reiterated his request for psychological counselling. In addition, he asked that the relationship between the parties involved be monitored for a period of six months and that N.E.C. be fined for the delays in executing the contact order. The child protection authority’s inspectors met N.E.C. on four occasions: on 29 January, 11 March, 23 April, and 17 July 2015. Subsequently, in a letter of 22 July 2015 the authority informed the applicant that N.E.C. had not allowed them to talk with the child about her relationship with her father. The child protection authority advised as follows:', '“In view of the fact that for the past four years your relationship with your daughter has only consisted of a few isolated encounters, we consider that reinitiating the fatherdaughter relationship must be done gradually, bearing in mind the child’s wishes, her school programme and her extra-curricular activities. (...)', 'For the time being, [N.E.C.] considers that it is not in the child’s best interest to reinitiate the father-daughter relationship and refuses to lend her support to this end.', 'In the light of the above, we consider that it is important for the child that both you and your former spouse try to improve your communication and that you change your current attitude (complaints before courts and other institutions, enforcement proceedings (...)), in order to overcome the conflicts and to offer your daughter the support and reassurance that she requires at this age.”', '20. Acting upon the criminal complaint lodged by the bailiff on 18 August 2014 (see paragraph 15 above), the prosecutor’s office attached to the Vâlcea County Court started an investigation into the commission of the offence of a breach of a court judgment (nerespectare a hotărârii judecătoreşti).', '21. On 4 March 2015 the prosecutor changed the legal classification of the alleged facts into the offence of a breach of custody measures (nerespectarea măsurilor privind încredinţarea minorului).', '22. On 4 January 2016 the prosecutor interviewed M.A. in the presence of N.E.C.’s lawyer and a psychologist from the child protection authority. M.A. refused to re-establish contact with her father and expressed her belief that her father was only trying to hurt her mother through his actions because of their work-related conflicts, of which she had been partially informed by her mother. She said:', '“I believe that by his actions my father wants, in reality, to hurt my mother. Yesterday I discussed this subject with my mother, as I had done once before, and she told me that she did not wish to trouble me, as those were work-related problems created by my father. It might be that through his actions my father wants to hurt my mother. I know some aspects, but not too much about the conflict between my parents concerning my mother’s work.', 'It is possible that my father started these actions because he loves me and wishes to know me.', 'I no longer want to know him or to have personal relations with him. (...)', 'I think it would be best if my father left me alone. (...)', 'It is true that my mother has never said bad things about my father, but she has never encouraged me to have personal ties with him either.”', '23. On 22 April 2016, acting at the prosecutor’s request, the psychologists from the child protection authority assessed M.A. They noted in their report that M.A. refused to see her father because she had been disappointed by the manner in which he had tried to get in touch with her, namely via the authorities, thereby causing upset to her mother. The expert did not consider that counselling for M.A. would be beneficial for re-establishing the relationship between the applicant and his daughter. He recommended psychological support for the parents.', '24. On 24 February 2017 the prosecutor decided to terminate the investigation on the grounds that it had not been established beyond any doubt that N.E.C. had acted in such a manner as to repeatedly prevent the applicant from seeing his daughter and that the lack of communication was caused by M.A.’s unequivocal wish and will.', '25. On 18 April 2017, in response to a complaint lodged by the applicant, the prosecutor in chief of the prosecutor’s office upheld the above decision. However, in a decision of 3 October 2017 the Râmnicu Vâlcea District Court allowed a complaint lodged by the applicant, quashed the prosecutor’s decision and sent the case back to the prosecutor’s office for further examination. The court considered that, because of the mother’s influence over her, the child might suffer from parent alienation syndrome which constituted a form of psychological abuse; in order to clarify this aspect, further psychological investigation was needed.', '26. In 2016, the applicant resumed contact with his former spouse, through the offices of a new bailiff. He tried to visit her home in order to see the child on 6 May, 3 June, 1 July, and 5 August 2016. On 6 April 2017 he asked N.E.C.’s opinion as to what would be the appropriate method for him to re-establish contact with his daughter.']",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0

The applicants, Mr Ivica Brkić, Ms Davorka Tkalić and Ms Željka Vidić, live in Zadar. The first and the second applicants were born in 1972 and the third applicant in 1968. They were represented by Mr Z. Zrilić, a lawyer practising in Zadar.', '2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On an unspecified date the applicants brought a civil action in the Zadar Municipal Court for damages against the State caused by the killing of their mother, K.-J.B., born in 1935. They alleged that their mother had been killed by firearms in front of her house in Z.G. village on 11 March 1992 when that village had been occupied by Serb paramilitary forces. She had been killed solely because of her Croat ethnicity. Therefore, her death had been motivated by ethnic hatred and had had no connection to any military or belligerent activity, which was also evident from the fact that she had not had arms on her person nor could she have put up any resistance. On the same day four other persons of Croat ethnicity had been killed in the same village. Such an act had amounted to an act of terrorism under the Liability Act (see below).', '5. On 5 January 2007 the claim was dismissed. The Municipal Court held that about a third of the territory of the State had been occupied and that the civilians killed on that territory had been mostly of Croat ethnicity, as had the applicants’ mother. It further held that the applicants’ mother had been killed by one S.M., a member of the Serb paramilitary forces during the armed conflict between these forces and the Croatian Army. Therefore, the killing of the applicants’ mother was war damage within the meaning of the Assessment of War Damage Act, for which the Republic of Croatia was not liable. As to that conclusion, the relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:', '“It is not disputed between the parties that on 11 March 1992, the day of the killing of K.-J.B., the village of Z.G. was part of the occupied [territory of the State] ... The decision on investigation in respect of the accused S.M. ... shows that K.-J.B. was one of the victims of the same perpetrator, killed on 11 March 1992 in Z.G. during an exchange of fire between Serb paramilitary forces and the Yugoslav Army on the one side and the armed forces of the Republic of Croatia on the other side ...', '...', 'This court holds that section 2(2) of the Assessment of War Damage Act is applicable in the case at issue ... The killing of K.-J.B., a civilian of Croat ethnicity, in Z.G., which was at the time a part of the occupied [territory of the State], by a member of a paramilitary group – the so-called territorial defence force of the so-called Republic of Serb Krajina whose paramilitary force operated within the so-called Yugoslav Army – is direct life-threatening damage under section 2(2) of the Assessment of War Damage Act, and from the claimant’s position it concerns non-pecuniary damage on account of the death of a parent. Therefore, the damage in the specific case was indisputably caused by the enemy, illegal groups or allies of such groups[, and that] damage was caused in the period [provided in] section 1 of that Act, as K.-J.B. was killed on 11 March 1992.”', 'After concluding that the killing of the applicants’ mother was war damage, the Municipal Court also held that it had been a terrorist act for which the Croatian State was not liable as it had had no control over the occupied territory of the State. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:', '“The crucial aspect which is missing and is a condition for the liability of the Republic of Croatia as a State for the damage in this case is its sovereignty. The defendant had no sovereignty over Z.G., which was a part of the broader, temporarily occupied territory of Croatia at that time, during the Homeland War. It did not have control over the territory and inhabitants of that territory, the basic elements of State sovereignty. Thus, as said above, the act of damage ... amounts to an act of terror, that is to say an act of violence committed for political motives with the aim of causing fear, terror and the feeling of personal insecurity in citizens. However, the terrorist act of the killing of the applicants’ mother by a member of the occupying enemy Serb paramilitary forces was done in occupied Croatian territory, that is to say in the territory where the Republic of Croatia had no sovereignty before the act of damage occurred, on the day when it occurred, or for years afterwards. Given the time (during a state of war), the territory (occupied Croatian territory), and all the circumstances in which the damage occurred, this court concludes that [the act of damage] in the case at issue amounts to a terrorist act which in these circumstances could not have been prevented by the State or its bodies. The defendant did not contribute to such acts of terror or violence in any manner, but instead it attempted to prevent them by all legitimate means, including the defensive Homeland War, one of the aims of which was the liberation of the occupied Croatian territory in which, in the end, it succeeded.”', '6. The applicants then lodged an appeal in which they argued that the Municipal Court had held contradictory views, stating that the killing of their mother was war damage for which the State was not liable and at the same time that it had been a terrorist act for which the State was not liable because it had had no control over the territory where the damage had occurred. The applicants asserted that the killing of their mother had been a terrorist act and that the State’s liability could not be excluded only because it had occurred in occupied territory. They argued that the legislation governing the State’s liability for terrorist acts provided that this liability was based on the principles of solidarity, equal distribution of the public burden and fair and prompt compensation, and that State liability existed irrespective of whether a perpetrator had been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty. In the applicants’ view, this implied that the State was liable for damage not because it had responsibility for it but as an act of social solidarity with victims of terrorist acts.', '7. The first-instance judgment was upheld by the Zadar County Court on 10 September 2009, which endorsed the reasoning of the Zadar Municipal Court.', '8. The applicants then lodged an appeal on points of law in which they reiterated their arguments from the appeal and pointed out that the appeal court had not addressed these arguments. On 12 April 2011 the Supreme Court upheld the lower courts’ judgments. The relevant part of the Supreme Court’s judgment reads:', '“... even though the damage was caused by violence with terror as one of its essential elements, it does not amount to a terrorist act within the meaning of section 1 of the Liability Act, but was caused by belligerent activity of the enemy military or paramilitary forces with the aim of provoking fear in and displacement of the civilian population and has the characteristics of war damage for which the Republic of Croatia is not liable”', '9. The applicants’ subsequent constitutional complaint was dismissed on 19 January 2012. The decision was served on the applicants on 21 February 2012.', '10. The relevant part of the Act on Liability for Damage Resulting from Terrorist Acts and Public Demonstrations of 23 July 2003 (Zakon o odgovornosti za štetu nastalu uslijed terorističkih akata i javnih demonstracija, Official Gazette of the Republic of Croatia no. 117/2003 – “the 2003 Liability Act”), which entered into force on 31 July 2003, provides as follows:', '“(1) This Act regulates liability for damage caused by acts of terrorism or other acts of violence committed with the aim of seriously disturbing public order by provoking fear or stirring up feelings of insecurity in citizens ...', '(2) A terrorist act within the meaning of this Act is especially an act of violence committed for political reasons [motives] with a view to stirring up fear, terror or feelings of personal insecurity in citizens.”', '“The Republic of Croatia shall be liable for the damage referred to in section 1 of this Act on [the basis of] the principles of social solidarity, equal distribution of the public burden and fair and prompt compensation.”', '“The obligation to compensate damage under this Act exists irrespective of whether the perpetrator has been identified, criminally prosecuted or found guilty.”', '“The victim shall have the right to compensation [in the form of damages] for damage resulting from death, bodily injury or impairment of health.”', '11. The Liability Act (Croatian Army and Police) (Zakon o odgovornosti Republike Hrvatske za štetu uzrokovanu od pripadnika hrvatskih oružanih i redarstvenih snaga tijekom Domovinskog rata, Official Gazette no. 117/2003 of 23 July 2003) outlines the conditions under which the State is liable to pay compensation for damage caused by members of the army and the police during the Homeland War. The relevant provisions read as follows:', '“The present Act governs the liability of the Republic of Croatia for damage caused by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and the police force in military or police service or in connection with such service during the Homeland War in the period between 17 August 1990 and 30 June 1996.”', '“The Republic of Croatia is liable under general rules governing liability for damage only in respect of damage defined in section 1 hereof which does not have the character of war-related damage.”', '“(1) War-related damage within the meaning of this Act is, in particular:', '– damage caused at the time when and in territory where military actions were carried out with any means of war ... (bombardment, shelling, machine-gun fire, explosions, mining, movement of troops and the like);', '– damage resulting in direct and concrete military gains if, given the time and place where it occurred, it directly served military operations, and in particular:', '(a) damage which was a direct consequence of any protective or planning measure which the competent military authorities carried out with the aim of removing or preventing an enemy attack;', '(b) damage which was a direct consequence of protective or planning measures which the competent military authorities carried out in anticipation of an enemy action (work in fields, confiscation of movable property, occupation of real estate and the like);', '(c) damage which was a direct consequence of measures taken with the aim of preventing the consequences of the damage described in subsection 1 of this section from spreading or of alleviating such consequences;', '– damage which, having regard to its results and the specific time and place where it occurred, was directly caused by the state of war and is directly connected with military operations (direct consequences of war events in connection with unrest, turmoil, panic, evacuations and similar events [occurring] immediately after the military operations have been carried out).', '(2) It is to be presumed that the damage caused by members of the Croatian Armed Forces and the police force in military or police service or in connection with such service during the Homeland War in the period between 17 August 1990 and 30 June 1996 is war-related damage, if it occurred at the time when and in territory where military combat actions took place, but the injured party may prove the opposite.”', '12. The relevant part of that Act (Zakon o utvrđivanju ratne štete, Official Gazette nos. 61/1991 and 70/1991) reads:', '“[This Act provides for] the setting up and the activities of the State, municipal and special commissions for the listing and assessment of war damage caused [in the territory] of the Republic of Croatia to its natural and legal persons, and in connection with enemy activities and military operations carried out against [the Republic of Croatia] in the period from 15 August 1990 until the termination [of the said activities].”', '“War damage within the meaning of this Act, is pecuniary and non-pecuniary damage, direct and indirect damage, and in particular:', '1. damage caused to bodily integrity, life and health of persons, freedom or dignity;', '...', 'War damage, within the meaning of this Act, is damage caused by enemy, illegal forces, legal bodies of the Republic of Croatia, as well as allies of the said forces and bodies, when it was indirectly or directly caused in the period mentioned in section 1 of this Act.”', '13. The Supreme Court has held that the Republic of Croatia was not liable for war-related damage caused by enemy forces on the occupied territories (for example in its judgments nos. Rev-90/09-2 of 9 June 2010; Rev-1199/08-2 of 2 June 2010; Rev-1264/08-2 of 17 March 2011; and Rev-848/10-2 of 19 June 2012). In the latter the Supreme Court endorsed findings of the lower courts that the killing of persons at the occupied territories amounted to war-related damage and added, in so far as relevant, the following:', '“Even though the act giving rise to the plaintiffs’ claim for damages presents certain similarities with a terrorist act since [both] imply [an act of] violence, the act of damage [in the present case] differs significantly from terrorist acts in its features since it contains additional elements and amounts to war-related damage for which the defendant is not liable. This is because the damage did not occur in the territory under the de facto sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia but in the then occupied territory, where there was no possibility for lawful action by the bodies of the Republic of Croatia; this circumstance excludes the otherwise objective liability of the defendant. Furthermore, the act of damage in the present case was not carried out with the sole aim of seriously disturbing public order (this being the aim characteristic of an act of terror) but also involved the use of force, killing and expulsion of the civilian population on that territory with the aim of destroying the internal security and stability of the Republic of Croatia and preventing its lawful bodies from functioning.', '...”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

He is currently living in the Netherlands. He was initially represented before the Court by Ms M. de Boer, a lawyer practising in Utrecht. She was succeeded by Mr W. Boelens, who is also a lawyer practising in Utrecht.', '2. The Netherlands Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mr R.A.A. Böcker, and Deputy Agent, Ms L. Egmond, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 3 August 2001 the applicant entered the Netherlands and applied for asylum, fearing persecution within the meaning of the 1951 Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (“the 1951 Refugee Convention”). On 14 August 2001, the immigration authorities held a first interview (eerste gehoor) with the applicant concerning his identity, nationality and travel itinerary. A written record of this interview was prepared and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, was given the opportunity to submit corrections and additions, which he did on 15 August 2001. On 16 August 2001 a second interview (nader gehoor) was held with the applicant about his reasons for seeking asylum. A written report was drawn up and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, submitted corrections and additions on 17 August 2001.', '5. On 16 August 2001 the Deputy Minister of Justice (Staatssecretaris van Justitie) issued a notice of her intention (voornemen) to reject the applicant’s asylum application. On 17 August 2001, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments (zienswijze) on the notice of intent.', '6. On 20 September 2001, on the basis of his written comments of 17 August 2001, the immigration authorities held a supplementary interview (aanvullend gehoor) with the applicant. A written report of this interview was drawn up and the applicant, assisted by a lawyer, submitted corrections and additions on 22 October 2001.', '7. During these three interviews, the applicant gave the following statement. He was a national of the DRC. His parents had died. He was married but his wife had remained in the DRC together with their six children, who were born between 1988 and 1999. He also had two brothers and one sister, all of whom were living in the DRC. He gave the address of his home (N. street no. ... in the N’djili borough of Kinshasa) and described the surroundings of the house where he had lived for the previous two years. He stated that it was near to a nameless football field located at M. or K. street, and that there was a protestant school on the opposite side of the street. Behind this school there was a street without a name and he had lived in a side street of this nameless street. For identification purposes, he provided the Netherlands authorities with a formal declaration of loss of identity documents (attestation de perte des pièces d’identité) bearing the number 6436/POP/2000, which had been issued on 31 August 2000 by the mayor of one of the Kinshasa boroughs and contained the applicant’s particulars − including his personal address − but no specification of the nature of the identity documents lost. For the same purpose, he submitted a work pass issued by the “Service de l’Aéronautique Civile du Zaire” on 19 February 1998 and valid until 15 February 2001 and attesting that the applicant was working as a loadmaster in the employment of Nigeria Airways. Although the street name of the applicant’s personal address in this work pass was the same as that on the declaration of loss of documents, the house number was not the same.', '8. The applicant also stated that, since 2000, he had been a sympathiser of the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (Mouvement de Libération du Congo; hereafter “MLC”). He often read MLC information material but never participated in public events such as demonstrations or party meetings. Between 1988 and 1996 he had worked as a ticket agent for Air Zaire. From 1996 until leaving the Congo, he had worked as a ground handling manager/loadmaster for Nigeria Airways, which entailed checking in and boarding passengers, carrying out ground-crew tasks and drawing up flight manifests.', '9. In October or November 1998 the applicant and his Nigerian superior had been arrested by three officers of the DRC national police on a charge of allowing passengers with false papers onto a departing aircraft. After being held for three days in the civilian prison in the Gombe borough of Kinshasa, near to the Mamayeno Hospital, and following intervention by his employer, he had been released unconditionally. He had been beaten whilst in detention.', '10. On 18 February 2001 the applicant had been arrested for a second time by two men who showed him passes identifying them as officers of the DRC military intelligence service (Détection militaire des activités anti-patrie; hereafter “DEMIAP”). He was accused of helping two passengers ‒ who were believed to have been involved in an attack on President Laurent Kabila ‒ to flee the country rather than reporting them to the immigration service. The applicant had denied the accusation; it had not been his task to guide passengers to or through immigration checks. He had been detained in a military subterranean prison which, he believed, was located in the Gombe borough of Kinshasa. On the third day of his detention, the applicant’s home had been searched, during which two MLC pamphlets had been found. His passport had also been found and seized during this search. As a result of the severe maltreatment he had suffered during his detention, in mid-March 2001 the applicant had been admitted to the Gombe military hospital for treatment. His wife had been allowed to visit him in hospital once at the end of March 2001. On that occasion she had given him a Bible in which some money and his identity papers had been concealed. With the help of a friend of his brother-in-law’s, the applicant had managed to escape at the end of June 2001. Three soldiers had taken him from the hospital to a house in a place near Kinshasa. On 2 August 2001 he had been taken to Kinshasa airport and on the same day had managed to flee the DRC by plane.', '11. On 15 November 2001 the Deputy Minister of Justice issued a fresh notice of her intention to reject the applicant’s asylum application. On 11 December 2001, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments on the new notice of intent.', '12. In a decision of 17 January 2002, the Deputy Minister rejected the applicant’s asylum application. On 11 February 2002, the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Regional Court of The Hague.', '13. On 3 October 2003 the applicant submitted, as additional grounds of appeal, a copy of a summons which he had received only on that date, although it had been issued on 2 November 2001 by the DRC judicial police (police judiciaire des parquets) of the Prosecution Service of the DRC State Security Court (Parquet général près la Cour de sûreté de l’Etat). It ordered the applicant to present himself on 3 November 2001 before a named inspector of the judicial police in order to be questioned about “facts of which he would be informed”.', '14. The applicant also submitted on 3 October 2003 a report commissioned by “Docu Congo”, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the Netherlands, which had been compiled by another NGO, namely the International Society for Human Rights (hereafter the “ISHR”). The author of the ISHR report was the president of the Congo Section of the ISHR, Reverend Placide Tshisumpa Tshiakatumba. For the purposes of this report the researcher(s) had visited the applicant’s address in Kinshasa − as given in the record of his first interview and on the declaration of loss of identity documents (see paragraphs 4 and 7 above) − and N’djili (Kinshasa) International Airport. They had interviewed a former secretary at Nigeria Airways, amongst others, and had sought information from two people working for the Prosecution Service of the State Security Court. The report confirmed, in its relevant part, that the applicant had worked for Nigeria Airways at Kinshasa airport, that he had been arrested by the DEMIAP on the grounds stated, and that he had lived at the address he had provided. The report also stated that Nigeria Airways had had to cease its activities at Kinshasa airport for various reasons including the failure to respect airport rules and procedures, fraudulently embarking passengers, and “above all for that manifesto matter” (“surtout pour cette affaire de manifeste”). It also states that the applicant’s wife had left for an unknown destination. Through their sources at the State Security Court, the researcher(s) confirmed that the applicant was wanted for endangering state security (“Monsieur [C.M.M.] est recherché par les services de sécurité pour des motifs grâves d’attente [sic] à la sécurité de l’état”), that the person who signed the summons was indeed an inspector for the State Security Court and that the applicant would be immediately arrested and detained if found.', '15. On 14 October 2003, the applicant was informed that the impugned decision of 17 January 2002 had been withdrawn and a fresh decision would be taken.', '16. On 14 January 2004 the applicant was informed that the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs was initiating an investigation in the DRC in response to the material the applicant had submitted in support of his asylum request.', '17. On 22 December 2004 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a person-specific official report (individueel ambtsbericht) based on an investigation carried out in the DRC. It had been found, inter alia, that – contrary to the ISHR report – the street name given by the applicant as his home address during his first interview as also on his declaration of loss of identity documents did not exist in the Kinshasa borough where he had allegedly been living during his last two years in the DRC and that, for this reason, it had not been possible to verify whether the applicant’s spouse and/or other relatives were still living there. It had also become apparent that the declaration of loss of identity documents no. 6436/POP/2000 and the summons submitted by the applicant (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above) were forgeries, and it had not been possible to verify the authenticity of the work pass submitted by the applicant (see paragraph 7 above). Moreover, in so far as known, there was no subterranean prison attached to the DEMIAP office in the Gombe borough in Kinshasa and no military hospital existed in Gombe.', '18. On 25 February 2005 the Minister for Immigration and Integration (Minister voor Vreemdelingenzaken en Integratie; hereafter “the Minister”) issued a fresh notice of intent rejecting the applicant’s asylum request. Observing that the applicant had not submitted any evidential material (such as a boarding pass, a luggage label, an in-flight magazine or other in-flight item bearing the name of the airline) attesting to his journey, that he had not submitted any documents in support of his asylum application and that he had provided only very cursory information about his periods of detention and hospitalisation, and having noted the content of the personspecific official report of 22 December 2004, the Minister concluded that there were sufficiently persuasive arguments for attaching no credence to the applicant’s asylum statement.', '19. On 2 March 2005, under the provisions of the Government Information (Public Access) Act (Wet Openbaarheid van Bestuur), the applicant requested that the documents underlying the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004 be disclosed. This request was transmitted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs on 14 March 2005.', '20. On 25 March 2005, assisted by a lawyer, the applicant submitted written comments on the fresh notice of intent of 25 February 2005. He contested the findings set out in the person-specific official report, whilst pointing out that the non-disclosure of the documents underlying that report and of the working methods employed by the person(s) involved in the inquiry meant that he could do so to only a limited extent. The applicant also requested a reasonable extension to the four-week period allowed for the submission of additional written comments, as he had requested Docu Congo to commission a new expert report to counter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ person-specific official report. He therefore asked the Minister to stay her decision pending submission of this counter-report.', '21. On 31 March 2005 the Minister of Foreign Affairs provided the applicant with the documents on which the person-specific official report had been based, at the same time restricting his access to certain parts of the documents containing information about the identity of agents or informants who had assisted in the investigation, information about investigation methods and techniques used, and information about their level of knowledge (so as to avoid facilitating an improvement in the quality of forgeries).', '22. In her decision of 16 December 2005 the Minister rejected the applicant’s asylum application. She noted that on 25 March 2005 the applicant had requested an extension in order to allow Docu Congo to produce a report to counter the person-specific official report and that this request had been granted on 1 April 2005. She also noted that, by letters dated 20 June, 18 July, 16 August, 28 October and 25 November 2005, the applicant had been asked to indicate when submission of the counter-report could be expected and that neither the applicant nor his lawyer had been able to answer this question. Finding that the applicant had had ample time to submit his comments on the person-specific official report, the Minister decided to proceed with her decision. The Minister took into account the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ inquiry had been based on the applicant’s submissions, including the ISHR report (see paragraph 14 above), and that – following the so-called “REK check” (see D.T. v. the Netherlands and Georgia (dec.), no. 28199/12, §§ 25-26, 15 September 2015) – it had been found that the person-specific official report had been drawn up with due care, both substantively and procedurally, and was comprehensible. The Minister also found that the applicant had submitted no evidence capable of casting doubt on the finding that the declaration of loss of identity documents no. 6436/POP/2000 and the summons submitted by the applicant (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above) were forgeries and once again concluded that no credence could be attached to the applicant’s asylum statement.', '23. On 11 January 2006, the applicant filed an appeal against this decision with the Regional Court of The Hague and, on 10 March 2006, submitted a report commissioned by Docu Congo which had been published on 27 January 2006 by the NGO Comité pour la Democratie et les Droits de l’Homme (hereafter the “CDDH”). The author of the CDDH report was its Secretary-General, Mr René Kabala Mushiya. For the purposes of compiling the report, he had managed to contact the applicant’s spouse as well as some people working at N’djili Airport who had known the applicant when he was an employee of Nigeria Airways.', '24. The applicant’s spouse had explained that the street address given by the applicant was in fact a path across a cemetery. According to information provided by the N’djili Borough Population Service (Service de la Population de la Commune de N’djili), illegal dwellings had been built around the cemetery and that was where the applicant and his spouse had lived. When visiting the cemetery in November 2005, the applicant’s spouse had been unable to orientate herself as a result of major rebuilding work carried out in the neighbourhood after 2003, when the local authorities had decided to transform the cemetery into a residential area. This transformation was confirmed in an appended written statement by the local neighbourhood leader (chef de quartier). The applicant’s spouse had also stated that, together with some Nigeria Airways employees, she had visited the applicant in the Gombe medical centre at about 8 p.m. one evening in mid-March 2001. For his part, the applicant submitted written statements by three individuals working in the airline industry, who all declared that they had personally known the applicant, confirmed that he had worked for Nigeria Airways and described the nature of his work for the airline. The report drawn up by the CDDH does not contain any information about the declaration of loss of identity documents or the summons of 2 November 2001 (see paragraphs 7 and 13 above).', '25. The Regional Court of The Hague sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch found on 11 April 2006 that the restrictions applied to the applicant’s access to the underlying documents (see paragraph 21 above) were justified under section 8:29 of the General Administrative Law Act (Algemene Wet Bestuursrecht). This decision was communicated to the applicant on the same day, with a request to indicate whether or not he had given his consent for the Regional Court to take into account these underlying documents in determining his appeal on 11 January 2006 without their being disclosed to the parties.', '26. In its judgment of 7 December 2006, the Regional Court of The Hague sitting in ‘s-Hertogenbosch rejected the applicant’s appeal of 11 January 2006. It noted that the parties had given their consent under the terms of section 8:29 § 5 of the General Administrative Law Act to take into account the documents underlying the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004. It held, inter alia, that the Minister could reasonably find that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that the absence of documents supporting his asylum statement was not a shortcoming for which he was to blame, and that the Minister could reasonably held against the applicant the fact that he had not provided a detailed and verifiable statement about his purported travel itinerary and that this detracted from the reliability and credibility of the applicant’s asylum statement. As regards the two reports commissioned by Docu Congo, and relied upon by the applicant, and the person-specific official report of 22 December 2004, the Regional Court held:', '“18. It appears from the investigation carried out by the CDDH that the neighbourhood where the appellant claims to have lived changed in 2003 into a residential area after improvised (illegal) buildings were erected around an old cemetery. The appellant has argued that, since it has been demonstrated that the investigation of the address [by the Minister of Foreign Affairs] was incomplete, the reason for believing that the ‘attestation de perte des pièces d’identité’ he submitted is forged has become groundless.', '19. The court does not agree with this conclusion by the appellant. The findings of the CDDH do not alter the conclusion that the ‘attestation de perte des pièces d’identité’ is a forgery. The court reaches this conclusion after having studying the documents underlying the person-specific official report, in particular the additional statement of 28 October 2004 [containing a detailed explanation as to why it was clear that this document was a forgery]. It appears therefrom that the document concerned – irrespective of the correctness of the street name indicated – contains deletions as a result of which it can no longer be regarded as authentic. It follows that the appellant, by relying on the findings in the CDDH report, has not adduced concrete evidence calling into doubt the correctness of the conclusions in the person-specific official report.', '20. Unlike the appellant, the court does not find that the investigation lacked due care. ...', '21. In so far as the appellant has expressed doubts as regards the objectivity and reliability of the confidential contact person [who carried out the investigation in the DRC], the court points out that the appellant has not submitted any concrete evidence to suggest that this confidential contact person might have been untrustworthy and acted carelessly. The claim that the confidential contact person acted out of resentment has likewise not been substantiated by the appellant. Moreover, contrary to the appellant’s submissions, it is not apparent from the underlying documents that the ISHR report was found to be inaccurate. ...', '22. In assessing whether the Minister acted in a reasonable manner, the court finds that, in referring to the person-specific official report, [the Minister] adduced sufficient arguments to support the finding that the appellant’s asylum statement is not credible.', '23. In the appeal proceedings the appellant also submitted that, if returned to the DRC, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention. ...', '26. Since the court has held, in the light of the above, that [the Minister] had good reasons for finding that the asylum statement was not credible, it cannot be concluded therefrom that the applicant would be exposed to a real and foreseeable risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3 if he were removed to the DRC. ...”', '27. The applicant’s further appeal was rejected on the basis of a summary reasoning issued on 30 May 2007 by the Administrative Jurisdiction Division (Afdeling Bestuursrechtspraak) of the Council of State (Raad van State). It found that the further appeal did not provide grounds for quashing the impugned rulings. Pursuant to section 91 § 2 of the Aliens Act 2000 (Vreemdelingenwet 2000), no further reasoning was required as the arguments submitted did not raise any questions requiring a determination in the interests of legal unity, legal development or legal protection in the general sense. No further appeal lay against that ruling.', '28. To date, the applicant has not been removed from the Netherlands nor has he filed a fresh asylum application in the Netherlands.', '29. The relevant domestic law and practice as regards asylum proceedings and the enforcement of removals are set out in K. v. the Netherlands ((dec.), no. 33403/11, §§ 16-19 and §§ 25-32, 25 September 2012).', '30. Details concerning the preparation of person-specific official reports (individuele ambtsberichten) and their use in asylum-related proceedings have been set out in D.T. v. the Netherlands and Georgia (cited above, §§ 24-27).', '31. On 27 September 2007 the Netherlands National Ombudsman (Nationale Ombudsman) – an independent institute charged with protecting individuals against improper government conduct by conducting investigations of its own motion or on the basis of an individual’s complaint, and making non-binding recommendations to government agencies – released report no. 2007/200 on the manner in which personspecific official reports are compiled and used in asylum proceedings. The report was entitled “The credibility of official reports. How asylum statements are confirmed or confuted.” (“De geloofwaardigheid van ambtsberichten. Hoe asielverhalen worden bevestigd of ontkracht.”). In this report, the Ombudsman formulated a number of recommendations addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice seeking to reinforce the position of asylum seekers in asylum proceedings and thus the compliance of such proceedings with the common standards of propriety.', '32. In a letter of 19 September 2008 to the President of the Lower House of Parliament (Tweede Kamer) about the follow-up generated as a result of this report, the Ombudsman stated that, although it had led to a number of laudable improvements, the Ministers had not accepted two important recommendations concerning the degree of disclosure of documents underlying person-specific official reports to the decisionmaking civil servant and the asylum seeker concerned.', '33. In March 2009, the Ombudsman filed comments on the consolidated seventeenth to eighteenth periodic reports on compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which had been submitted by the Netherlands Government to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. The Ombudsman’s comments contain the following observations in respect of general country assessment and person-specific official reports as used by the Netherlands immigration authorities in their decision-making process:', '“Feedback from interest groups indicated a great deal of dissatisfaction with the quality of these official country reports. They allegedly contained information that was insufficiently relevant, insufficiently current, and incomplete, or sometimes even incorrect. One of the key problems was the fact that official country reports do not provide an overview of the available facts but rather a conclusion concerning certain facts. The underlying facts are often not available to the asylum seekers and their representatives, which makes it essentially impossible to enter into a discussion concerning the substance of the conclusions drawn. The IND [Immigration and Naturalisation Department] employee who makes the decision is thus not able, in preparing the decision, to consult this file to assess whether the contents of the individual official country report are supported by the underlying documents. Only a more highly-qualified IND employee is allowed to do so. This more highly-qualified IND employee will subsequently pass on his findings to the employee who makes the decision. Neither the asylum seeker nor his representative is able to inspect this file [Footnote 41: Subject to application of Article 8:29 General Administrative Law Act]. The Ombudsman found that this working method fails to recognise the responsibility of the state to present sufficient valid facts during the asylum procedure and to facilitate a fair hearing on the basis thereof [Footnote 42: National Ombudsman, The credibility of person-specific official reports, report 2007/200]. The Ombudsman made several recommendations to improve the position of foreign national/asylum seekers during the asylum procedure, but not all of these were implemented.”', '34. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination considered the consolidated seventeenth to eighteenth reports of the Netherlands at its 1986th and 1987th meetings, held on 23 and 24 February 2010. At its 2003rd meeting, held on 5 March 2010, it adopted its concluding observations on these reports, which did not address the quality of general country assessment reports and/or person-specific official reports.', '35. Section 8:29 of the General Administrative Law Act reads as follows:', '“1. Parties who are obliged to provide information or submit documents may, if there are substantial reasons (gewichtige redenen) to do so, refuse to provide such information or submit such documents, or may inform the administrative tribunal that it alone shall be allowed to inspect the information or the documents.', '2. In the case of an administrative body, there can exist no such substantial reasons since there is an obligation, pursuant to the Government Information (Public Access) Act, to accede to any request for information contained in the documents to be submitted.', '3. The administrative tribunal shall decide whether the refusal or restriction of inspection referred to in the first paragraph is justified.', '4. If the administrative tribunal has decided that the refusal is justified, the obligation shall no longer exist.', '5. If the administrative tribunal has decided that the restriction of inspection is justified, it may give judgment based on that information or those documents only with the permission of the other parties. If such permission is refused, the case shall be remitted to another chamber.”', '36. According to the most recent official country assessment report on the DRC, published in December 2014 by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the general situation in the eastern provinces of North-Kivu, South-Kivu, Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele has continued to be unsettled and unpredictable and the general security situation in the province of Katanga has deteriorated due to actions by armed factions. In the other provinces of the DRC the general security situation has remained stable, apart from some isolated incidents. As to the general situation in Kinshasa, the report states:', '“On 30 December 2013 in Kinshasa, three separate groups simultaneously attacked the headquarters of the Congolese army, the National Radio and N’Djili international airport. Since then no major security incidents have taken place. In instances where the police and the Agence Nationale de Renseignements (ANR) used violence, this was not directed against specific (population) groups. The rate of street crime in Kinshasa remains high. Armed gangs, kuluna, commit burglaries, extortion, threats and kidnappings. On 7 December 2013 the police in Kinshasa arrested ten such gangs as part of an operation called “Likofi” (the word for “punch” in Lingala). On 14 December 2013 operation Likofi II started, focussing on kuluna in uniform. The latter allegedly killed ten people within one month in shootings in the neighbourhoods of Ma Campagne and Binza Ozone in Ngaliema borough. On 25 February 2014 the Minister of the Interior announced that operation Likofi would be expanded to tackle armed bandits at national level. In the operations Likofi I − against the Kuluna in Kinshasa − and Likofi II − against undisciplined soldiers and police in Kinshasa − a total of 925 individuals have been apprehended and 593 brought before an investigating judge. Two police officers have been sentenced to death, three military and two civilian accused have been sentenced to 15 years’ imprisonment, one policeman to 20 years’ and one civilian to 10 years’ imprisonment for illegal possession of weapons.', 'New police force', 'On 6 April 2014, during a parade in the Kintambo cycle stadium in Kinshasa, General Célestin Kanyama – the chief police commissioner of Kinshasa in charge of the Likofi operation – presented the “new” police force, comprising law-abiding, disciplined officers who are immune to corruption. The police asked for a salary increase and better working conditions. On 1 October 2014 Prime Minister Matata Ponyo opened the national criminal investigation centre of the police, which has been built with funding from the British development aid and the EU. As from that date, the general population could use the toll-free emergency number 112.”', '37. The official report of December 2014 does not deal specifically with people who have been involved with the MLC, mentioning only that an Amnesty Law approved by the DRC legislature on 3 February 2014 and signed by President Kabila on 11 February 2014 granted amnesty for acts of insurgency, acts of war and political offences committed between 18 February 2006 and 20 December 2013 by, amongst others, military personnel who had participated in the armed MLC uprising.', '38. The Democratic Republic of Congo assessment of April 2001, compiled by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (Country Information and Policy Unit) of the United Kingdom (UK) Home Office, observed:', '“2.7 Most sectors of the economy are in a serious state of decline. Production and incomes continue to fall. The infrastructure of the country is also in a serious state of decline. Financial institutions have collapsed and the public health and education system have seriously deteriorated. The economy is characterised by subsistence activities, a large informal sector and widespread bartering. The public sector cannot provide basic public services and public sector employees are not paid on a regular basis. ...', '3.14 ... In November 1998, a new rebel group emerged called the Mouvement pour la Liberation du Congo led by Jean-Pierre Bemba. The MLC based itself in the Equateur Province and has large numbers of former Zairean soldiers in its ranks. The MLC developed close ties with the Ugandan Government. In January 2001, the RCD-ML rebel group merged with Jean-Pierre Bemba’s MLC rebel group to form the Congo Liberation Front (CLF). Bemba is the leader of this newly formed group. The area under the control of the CLF corresponds with the areas that were under the control of the MLC and RCD-ML.', '3.15 Intensive diplomatic efforts to promote a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement which meets the security concerns of neighbouring countries resulted in a ceasefire agreement by all belligerent countries on 10 July [1999]. The rebel groups - MLC and RCD - signed up to the ceasefire agreement in August 1999. The ceasefire agreement, called the Lusaka Peace Accord, sets out arrangements for an end to the fighting and the start of a national dialogue.', '3.16 Despite the ceasefire agreement, numerous violations of the ceasefire have been reported in different parts of the country with each of the warring factions blaming one another for them. ... The civilian population have been adversely affected by the ongoing fighting. The Health Minister, Dr Mashako Mamba, has recently reported that there has been an upsurge in cases of war-related stress among the country’s civilian population. ...', '3.20 On 16 January 2001, President Laurent Kabila was assassinated in the Presidential Palace in Kinshasa, reportedly by one of his soldiers. A government public announcement was made on 18 January confirming that Laurent Kabila had been assassinated. The country’s airports and borders were temporarily closed for security reasons but were soon re-opened. There were no reports of widespread civil unrest. Laurent Kabila’s funeral took place a few days later and his son, Joseph Kabila, was sworn in as President of the DRC on 26 January 2001. ...', '5.17 The law allows for freedom of movement but the Government restricts freedom of movement in practice. ...', '5.19 In Kinshasa, police and soldiers commonly erected roadblocks in order to extract bribes from taxibus drivers and passengers. On 18 January 2000, in the Gombe district of Kinshasa, there were unconfirmed reports that security forces forced passengers who allegedly were riding in excess of the capacity of a taxibus to pay bribes. There has reportedly been no investigation into this case. Also in January 2000, FAC (government) soldiers and police erected roadblocks in various districts of Kinshasa in order to extort money from each minibus passenger who crossed the roadblocks.', '5.20 The Government requires exit visas for all foreign travel. Security forces occasionally hinder foreign travel by citizens, including journalists. There have been cases where political leaders have been denied exit visas. ...”', '39. The report “Country Information and Guidance, Democratic Republic of Congo: treatment on return” published by the UK Home Office in September 2015 includes the following observations:', '“2.1 Is a FAS [failed asylum seeker] and/or FNO [foreign national offender] who is to return to the DRC (voluntarily or by force) at risk of mistreatment or harm by virtue of having claimed asylum in the UK and/or having been convicted of an offence in the UK ?', '2.1.1 In the country guidance case of BM and Others (returnees – criminal and non-criminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC) heard in March and April 2015 and promulgated on 2 June 2015, the Upper Tribunal (UT) of the Immigration and Asylum Chamber found, based on the evidence put before it which included statistics indicating that there have been approximately 700 documented returns of asylum and non-asylum cases from European states plus the USA, Canada and New Zealand between 2012 and 2014 (paragraph 80), that ‘... there is no substantiated allegation of arbitrary arrest or ill treatment of any DRC national who is a failed asylum seeker or a foreign national offender returning to his or her country of origin.’ (paragraph 76)', '2.1.2 The Tribunal went on to find that:', '‘i) Those who have been convicted of offences in the United Kingdom are not at real risk of being persecuted for a Refugee Convention reason or serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR.', '‘ii) Those who have unsuccessfully claimed asylum in the United Kingdom are not at real risk of persecution for a Refugee Convention reason or serious harm or treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR.’ (paragraph 88)', '2.1.3 However, the UT did find those persons who are wanted / suspected by the DRC authorities for criminal activity in the DRC are likely to be at risk of harm:', '‘The DRC authorities have an interest in certain types of convicted or suspected offenders, namely those who have unexecuted prison sentences in DRC or in respect of whom there are unexecuted arrest warrants or who supposedly committed an offence, such as document fraud, when departing DRC. Such persons are at risk of imprisonment for lengthy periods and, hence, treatment proscribed by Article 3 ECHR.’ (paragraph 88)', '2.1.4 The Upper Tribunal clarified its findings made in paragraph 119(iv) of BM and Others with regard to the risk of using a false passport (or other document) in the case of BM (false passport) [2015] UKUT 467 (IAC) (12 August 2015). The Upper Tribunal found that:', '‘The mere fact that an asylum claimant utilised a false passport or kindred document in departing the DRC will not without more engage the risk category specified in [119(iv)] of BM and Others (Returnees: Criminal and Non-Criminal) DRC CG [2015] 293 (IAC). The application of this guidance will be dependent upon the fact sensitive context of the individual case. The Tribunal will consider, inter alia, the likely state of knowledge of the DRC authorities pertaining to the person in question. A person claiming to belong to any of the risk categories will not be at risk of persecution unless likely to come to the attention of the DRC authorities. Thus in every case there will be an intense focus on matters such as publicity, individual prominence, possession of a passport, the standard emergency travel document arrangements (where these apply) and how these matters impact on the individual claimant.', '2.1.5 Decision makers will therefore need to determine whether a person is of interest to the authorities for criminal activity in the DRC.

It agreed with the outcome of the case but held that the first-instance court had failed to take into account all the facts from the proceedings that had supported the dismissal of the claim. The relevant part of the judgment reads as follows:', '“... this appellate court finds that although the first-instance court failed to take into account all the facts emerging from the first-instance proceedings which meant [the plaintiff’s] claim had to be dismissed, the decision on dismissing the claim as unfounded is in any event correct, therefore the first-instance judgment is upheld by application of section 373a of the Civil Procedure Act.', '...', 'This appellate court therefore holds that the plaintiff’s claim was certainly to be dismissed, but for the reasons set out in this appellate decision; that is, that the reasons the first-instance court stated in the reasoning of its decision would not suffice for the claim to be dismissed.', 'Therefore the first-instance decision is upheld on the basis of section 373a of the Civil Procedure Act ...”', '14.

The applicant, Mr Samuil Robertov Hadzholov, is a Bulgarian national, who was born in 1954 and lives in Zlatograd. He was represented before the Court by Mr M. Ekimdzhiev and Ms K. Boncheva, lawyers practising in Plovdiv.', '3. Until 1987 the applicant worked as a coal miner for Gorubso – Second Mining Department Zlatograd (a State enterprise, transformed into a State-owned company in the early 1990s and later, apparently in 2002, privatised following the opening of winding-up proceedings; currently a joint-stock company Gorubso Zlatograd AD). In 1988 the applicant brought proceedings against the mining company seeking payment of compensation for the occupational disease he had developed as a result of exposure to hazardous conditions in the mine. On 26 November 1988 the Regional Court granted the claim. The company was ordered to pay a sum of 3,566 old Bulgarian levs (BGL) (the equivalent of around USD 1,800) as compensation, as well as monthly payments for a period of 26 years, from October 1988 to March 2014, the amounts varying between BGL 197 and BGL 80, depending on the period.', '4. In 1989 the applicant requested that the enforcement judge institute enforcement proceedings against the debtor. It appears that in May 1989 the enforcement judge attached the company’s bank accounts. There is no information in the case file about the development of the enforcement proceedings between May 1989 and February 2003. In particular, there is no evidence about requests made by the applicant for enforcement measures, claims lodged in the winding-up proceedings relating to the mining company’s assets, or information sought by the applicant on the payment of the debt.', '5. On 17 February 2003 the enforcement judge discontinued the enforcement proceedings on the basis of Article 330 § 1 (д) of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952, as the applicant had not requested enforcement actions for more than two years.', '6. On 19 October 2005 the applicant and his lawyer consulted the file of the enforcement proceedings. The applicant submits that only then did he find out that the proceedings had been discontinued in 2003, and that he was shown a document – the enforcement judge’s register of 1989 for the incoming and outgoing amounts – which indicated that in 1989 the mining company had paid the applicant an amount of BGL 5,234 by means of bank transfer. The applicant sent a letter of 21 October 2005 to the enforcement judge, in which he maintained that he had never received the aforementioned amount and that he was unable to obtain a copy of the payment order as the case file had been destroyed.', '7. By a letter of 27 October 2005, the enforcement judge informed the applicant that, as was clear from the information in the file, on 13 April 1989 the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of BGL 5,234 (representing the initial compensation of BGL 3,566 plus several monthly payments). In a letter of 3 November 2005, the bank which had effected the payment on 13 April 1989 informed the applicant that the documents concerning the money transfer had already been destroyed as the ten-year time-limit for keeping them had expired.', '8. In November 2005 the applicant submitted a complaint to the prosecution authorities requesting an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the payment of 13 April 1989. In a letter of 11 November 2005, the enforcement judge informed the investigation authorities that, as could be seen from the enforcement judge’s register of 1989, on 13 April 1989 the applicant had received payment from the mining company in the amount of BGL 5,234. As to the payment orders of that date, the enforcement judge noted that they had been destroyed as the ten-year time-limit for keeping payment documents under the Accounting Act had expired.', '9. On 24 November 2005 the public prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings, noting that a long period of time had elapsed since the alleged offence had been committed, and that the time-limits for keeping the relevant documents at the respective institutions had already expired. The applicant appealed against that decision on 2 December 2005. On 7 December 2005 the hierarchically superior prosecutor upheld those conclusions.', '10. In December 2006 the applicant requested that the Zlatograd District Court issue a document certifying that the case file of the enforcement proceedings had been destroyed. In a letter of 13 December 2006 the President of the District Court informed him that the file had not been destroyed and that he and his lawyer had consulted it.', '11. In the period between 1990 and 1999 inflation in Bulgaria was running high and the national currency was depreciating. As of the entry into force of a law on 5 July 1999, BGL 1,000 became 1 new Bulgarian lev (BGN). The applicant submitted that due to the enforcement judge’s inactivity over the years and the inflation and the devaluation of the national currency, the total amount of monthly payments he was entitled to receive for the period from May 1989 to 5 July 1999 had devalued to BGN 21.71 (approximately 11 euros (EUR)). He claimed that the amount he was entitled to receive from 5 July 1999 to March 2014 had devalued to BGN 18.17 (approximately EUR 9).', '12. In accordance with Article 400 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure 1952 (“the 1952 Code”), in force at the material time, enforcement proceedings against State enterprises were to be directed firstly towards their bank accounts in State banks. When payment upon a writ of execution against the State enterprise could not be received because of lack of such bank accounts or of available funds in them, enforcement was to be carried out by an enforcement judge. Certain articles of property belonging to the State enterprises could not be subject to enforcement, other than in winding-up proceedings. These provisions were repealed in December 1997.', '13. Article 323 of the 1952 Code provided that enforcement proceedings against private parties were to be instituted upon the request of the creditor. The creditors were under the obligation to state against which debtor’s possessions (bank accounts, immovable property, and so forth) they would like the enforcement to be directed (Article 323 § 3). Throughout the proceedings the creditors could request the enforcement actions to be directed against different possessions of the debtor. If the creditors did not request enforcement actions to be undertaken for a period of two years, the enforcement proceedings had to be terminated (Article 330 § 1 (д)). The new Code of Civil Procedure 2007 (“the 2007 Code”), which came into force on 1 March 2008, contained similar provisions.', '14. Section 45 of the Accounting Act 1991 stipulated that the accounting registers and reports were to be kept for ten years. This provision was superseded in January 2002 by section 42 of the Accounting Act 2002.', '15. By virtue of Section 91 of the Organisation of the Judiciary Act 1976, the enforcement judges were part of the district courts system. Under the Regulations on the Organisation and Work of the District, Regional and Military Courts 1977, the general statutory time-limit for keeping the case files of archived cases in the district courts was five years. The Judiciary Act 1994, which superseded the Organisation of the Judiciary Act 1976 and which was in force until August 2007, as well as the regulations adopted on its implementation contained similar provisions.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant is a Croatian national, who was born in 1974. The President granted the applicant’s request for his identity not to be disclosed to the public (Rule 47 § 4). He was represented before the Court by Ms M. Sršić, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.', '2. The Croatian Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms Š. Stažnik.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. The applicant works as a police inspector in the S. Police Department (Policijska uprava s.)', '5. On 15 January 2007, at around 6.00 p.m., the applicant’s wife requested the assistance of the police alleging that she had been beaten by the applicant in their flat in Z.', '6. Two police officers from one of the local police stations of the Z. Police Department (Policijska uprava z.) A.H. and M.M., intervened at the scene where they found the applicant and his wife, who had a visible nose injury. She was immediately taken to the hospital where she was diagnosed with a dislocation of septum and superficial nose hematoma.', '7. The applicant was requested to undergo an alcohol intoxication test which he refused. The police officers also found in his flat several pieces of hunting firearms which were, together with the applicant’s police handgun, seized from him. The applicant refused to sign the seizure records.', '8. At around 6.45 p.m. the applicant was arrested and taken to the police station.', '9. According to the applicant, inside the police station he was knocked to the ground and beaten by several police officers for refusing to sign the seizure records. He was in particular ill-treated by the police officers A.H., M.M. and M.D.', '10. According to a report of the police officer M.D. of 15 January 2007, at around 7.35 p.m., while he was held in the police station, the applicant started shouting and disobeying the orders to calm down. M.D. therefore approached him and twisted his arm behind his back after which he was handcuffed.', '11. On the same day, at around 8.40 p.m., the applicant was examined by a doctor at the police station. The medical examination indicated signs of alcohol intoxication but did not disclose any injuries.', '12. On 16 January 2007, at 2.20 p.m., the applicant was again examined by a doctor who found no injuries but indicated that the applicant had low blood sugar.', '13. Following the applicant’s release from detention (see paragraph 31 below), on 22 January 2007 he underwent another medical examination in a hospital in S. The examination indicated spinal and abdominal contusions which could, as alleged, relate to a beating dating back one week before.', '14. On 15 January 2007 the police officer M.D. reported on the use of force against the applicant to his superiors (see paragraph 10 above).', '15. On the same day the Chief of the police station accepted the report finding no irregularities in the use of force. These findings were forwarded to the Chief of the Z. Police Department.', '16. On 18 January 2007 the Chief of the Z. Police Department found that the use of force against the applicant had been lawful and justified.', '17. This finding was confirmed by the Internal Control Unit of the Ministry of the Interior (Odjel za unutarnju kontrolu Ministarstva unutarnjih poslova) on 8 March 2007.', '18. On 18 May 2007 the First-instance Disciplinary Court of the Ministry of the Interior (Odsjek prvostupanjskog disciplinskog suda Z.; hereinafter: the “First-instance Disciplinary Court”) found the applicant guilty on disciplinary charges of inappropriate behaviour and sentenced him to dismissal from service suspended for three months and a twenty percent reduction of salary in the period of two months. This decision was upheld by the Second-instance Disciplinary Court of the Ministry of the Interior (Odsjek drugostupanjskog disciplinskog sudovanja; hereinafter: the “Second-instance Disciplinary Court”) on 13 July 2007.', '19. On 18 April 2007 the applicant lodged a criminal complaint with the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office (Općinsko državno odvjetništvo u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M. and M.D. alleging that they had ill-treated him during his arrest on 15 January 2007. In particular, he submitted that he had been knocked to the ground and then beaten. The applicant also alleged that M.Mi., an on-duty police officer in the police station at the time of the events, had attempted to cover up the ill-treatment by unlawfully instituting minor offences proceedings against him on charges of domestic violence (see paragraph 29 below).', '20. On 25 May 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office requested the Z. Police Department to conduct an investigation into the applicant’s allegations.', '21. The Z. Police Department submitted a report on 6 July 2007 indicating that they had interviewed the suspects and two witnesses and obtained the relevant documentation concerning the use of force against the applicant. The suspects denied any ill-treatment and one of the witnesses, also a police officer, stated that she had seen the applicant handcuffed and kneeled on the ground.', '22. On 12 July 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office rejected the applicant’s criminal complaint on the grounds that there was no evidence that he had been ill-treated as alleged in his criminal complaint. The applicant was instructed that he could take over the criminal prosecution as a subsidiary prosecutor by lodging an indictment before the competent criminal court.', '23. Meanwhile, the applicant submitted another criminal complaint before the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office against the police officers M.M., A.H., S.G., P.S., M.Mi. and M.P. alleging unlawful search of his flat and their unlawful conduct in the processing of his case related to the alleged domestic violence.', '24. On 31 October 2007 the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office rejected this criminal complaint as unfounded on the grounds that there was nothing disclosing any unlawfulness in the conduct of the police officers.', '25. On 11 December 2007 the applicant lodged an indictment in the Z. Municipal Criminal Court (Općinski kazneni sud u Z.) against the police officers A.H., M.M., M.D. and M.Mi. in connection with his alleged ill-treatment (see paragraph 22 above).', '26. On 28 November 2008 the applicant sent a letter to the Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office expressing his dissatisfaction with the manner in which the circumstances of his criminal complaint had been assessed and with the decision of 12 July 2007 (see paragraph 22 above).', '27. The Z. Municipal State Attorney’s Office replied on 5 March 2009 indicating that all the applicant’s objections should be addressed in the criminal proceedings which he had instituted as a subsidiary prosecutor.', '28. On 6 April 2010 the Z. Municipal Criminal Court declared the applicant’s indictment inadmissible as he had failed to inform that court of the change of his whereabouts for which reason he could not be summoned to amend the indictment in accordance with the formal requirements of the relevant domestic law. This decision was placed on the Z. Municipal Criminal Court’s public notice board from which it was taken on 26 April 2010. It was thereby considered to be served on the applicant (see paragraph 59 below).', '29. On 15 January 2007 the police instituted minor offences proceedings against the applicant in the Z. Minor Offences Court (Prekršajni sud u Z.) on charges of domestic violence, abusive conduct towards the police officers, improper storage of firearms and failure to report the change of his whereabouts.', '30. On 16 January 2007 the Z. Minor Offences Court ordered the applicant’s detention.', '31. On 22 January 2007 the Z. Minor Offences Court found the applicant guilty on charges of abusive conduct towards the police officers, improper storage of firearms and failure to report the change of his whereabouts. The applicant was fined in total with 5,754 Croatian kunas (HRK) and the seized firearms were confiscated. The proceedings were discontinued in respect of the charges of domestic violence on the grounds of lack of evidence. The applicant was released from detention.', '32. On 5 October 2007 the Higher Minor Offences Court (Visoki prekršajni sud Republike Hrvatske), acting as the court of appeal, quashed the part of the first-instance decision by which the proceedings in respect of the charges of domestic violence were discontinued and ordered a retrial, while it upheld the remainder of the first-instance decision.', '33. On 16 January 2009 the resumed minor offences proceedings concerning the charges of domestic violence were discontinued on the grounds that they had become time-barred.', '34. According to the applicant, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., while celebrating his wedding anniversary with friends, he was attacked and injured by A.H., the same police officer who had been involved in his alleged ill-treatment on 15 January 2007 (see paragraphs 9, 19 and 25 above). He sustained injuries to his head and arms. Thereafter he was arrested and placed in a psychiatric hospital from which he was released on 27 May 2008.', '35. According to the documents submitted by the Government, on 25 May 2008, at around 2.30 p.m., the police received an anonymous call informing them that a person was lying on the ground in front of a residential building in Z. The police officers I.Z. and A.H. immediately drove to the address.', '36. A report signed by the police officers I.Z. and A.H., dated 25 May 2008, indicates that upon their intervention at the scene they established that the person lying on the ground was the applicant, who was severely intoxicated. He also had visible injuries on his head and arms. Soon afterwards an emergency team joined them and they decided that the applicant should be taken to a hospital for further treatment. During the transfer to the hospital the applicant became aggressive and the police officer A.H. and one of the members of the medical team tried to calm him down. At the hospital, the applicant continued his aggressive behaviour and threatened to kill them all once released. The police officers thus used physical force and the measures of restraint to calm him down. It was decided that he should be taken to another hospital.', '37. A medical report of the emergency service of 25 May 2008 indicates contusion of the applicant’s head and superficial injuries on both arms.', '38. A medical report prepared on the applicant’s release from the hospital on 27 May 2008 indicates that the applicant sustained his injuries during a fall caused by his intoxication.', '39. Following his release the applicant contacted another doctor on 28 May 2008. His report of the same date indicates that the applicant had contusions to the head, and hematomas on the right upper arm and left forearm which could have been caused by blows three days before, as alleged by the applicant.', '40. On 25 May 2008 the police officers I.Z. and A.H. reported on the use of force against the applicant to their superiors. They explained that the applicant had been aggressive during his medical treatment in the hospital and that therefore I.Z. grabbed him by the left arm and twisted it behind his back while A.H. did the same thing with his right arm. He was then handcuffed.', '41. On the same day the Chief of the police station accepted the report finding no irregularities in the use of force. These findings were forwarded to the Chief of the Z. Police Department.', '42. On 28 May 2008 the Chief of the Z. Police Department found that the use of force against the applicant had been lawful and justified.', '43. On 25 May 2008 the applicant was indicted in the Z. Minor Offences Court on charges of breach of public peace and order and violent behaviour during his medical examination.', '44. The applicant was questioned on the same day and he denied having breached the public peace and order. He stressed that he had only refused to undergo the medical examination to which the police officer A.H. had been forcing him.', '45. At a hearing on 7 April 2009 doctor N.L., who received the applicant in the hospital on 25 May 2008 (see paragraph 36 above), stated that the applicant had arrived at the hospital with a head injury and under the influence of alcohol. He also explained that he had not seen any violent behaviour on the part of the applicant.', '46. At a hearing on 23 September 2010 the Z. Minor Offences Court questioned the police officer I.Z. who could not remember any details of the event at issue.', '47. On the same day the Z. Minor Offences Court acquitted the applicant on the grounds of lack of evidence of his alleged violent behaviour and breach of public peace and order.', '48. On 10 June 2008 the S. Police Department instituted disciplinary proceedings against the applicant in the First-instance Disciplinary Court on charges of inappropriate behaviour related to the events of 25 May 2008.', '49. At a hearing on 13 November 2008 the applicant submitted that on the critical day he had been with his friends Ž.K., I.B. and M.V., drinking and celebrating his wedding anniversary. When they approached the building where he lived, they came across two police officers one of whom was A.H., who approached him and asked him whether they had settled their dispute. The applicant answered that the competent court would decide about that and at that point A.H. pulled him by the hand as a result of which he fell to the ground and then he lost his conscience.', '50. On 22 December 2008 the First-instance Disciplinary Court questioned the applicant’s friends Ž.K., I.B. and M.V. and the police officers I.Z. and A.H.', '51. Ž.K. stated that he had seen the applicant in front of the building talking with two police officers and that at one moment one of the police officers, without any particular reason, pulled the applicant by the hand after which he fell to the ground and hurt his head. I.B. and M.V. confirmed this version of the events.', '52. In their statements the police officers I.Z. and A.H. denied any ill-treatment reiterating that they had only used force as a result of the applicant’s aggressive behaviour during his medical treatment.', '53. On 3 March 2009 the First-instance Disciplinary Court found the applicant guilty on charges of inappropriate behaviour and sentenced him to dismissal from service suspended for twelve months. It considered that the statements of Ž.K., I.B. and M.V. were inconsistent in particular given that an analysis of I.B.’s mobile phone at about the time of the events showed that he had been in another city. It therefore rejected the applicant’s allegations that he had been ill-treated by the police officers I.Z. and A.H.', '54. On 23 April 2009 the Second-instance Disciplinary Court upheld the first-instance decision.', '55. The applicant then challenged the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings before the Administrative Court (Upravni sud Republike Hrvatske) and on 19 May 2010 the Administrative Court dismissed his complaints as ill-founded endorsing the reasoning of the disciplinary bodies.', '56. The applicant further challenged the findings of the disciplinary bodies and the Administrative Court before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske). On 13 September 2012 the Constitutional Court upheld the decisions of the lower bodies dismissing the applicant’s complaints as ill-founded.', '57. The relevant provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia (Ustav Republike Hrvatske, Official Gazette nos. 56/1990, 135/1997, 8/1998, 113/2000, 124/2000, 28/2001, 41/2001, 55/2001, 76/2010 and 85/2010) read as follows:', 'Article 23', '“No one shall be subjected to any form of ill-treatment ...”', '58.

With regard to the service of the court decisions, the relevant part of the Code of Criminal Procedure provided:', '“...', '(6) If a party has not reported a change of address to a court or if the party cannot be reached at the address that was previously given to the court or it is evident that he is evading receipt of a decision that is subject to appellate review other than a judgment imposing a sentence of imprisonment, the court shall put the decision on the court’s public notice board. After the lapse of the term of appeal the decision shall become final.”', '“ ...', '(2) If ... a decision cannot be served on [a subsidiary prosecutor] to his or her current address, the court shall put ... the decision on the public notice board and, after the laps of eight days from the moment when it was put [on the public notice board] it shall be considered as duly served.”', '60. Relevant procedures concerning the submission of and decisions on criminal complaints were provided in Articles 171 to 174, the relevant parts of which read:', '“(1) All state bodies and legal entities are obliged to report any criminal offence subject to automatic prosecution about which they have been informed or about which they have otherwise learned.', '...”', '“(1) Criminal complaints shall be submitted to the competent State Attorney in writing or orally.', '...', '(3) If a criminal complaint was submitted before a court, the police or a State Attorney who was not competent in the matter, they shall forward the criminal complaint to the competent State Attorney.”', '“(1) The State Attorney shall reject a criminal complaint by a reasoned decision if the offence in question is not an offence subject to automatic prosecution, if the prosecution is time-barred or an amnesty or pardon have been granted, or other circumstances excluding criminal liability or prosecution exist, or there is no reasonable suspicion that the suspect has committed the offence.

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,Inadmissible,George Nicolaou;Ineta Ziemele;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Päivi Hirvelä;Paul Mahoney,"['The applicant, A.S., is a British national, who was born in 1957 and resides in the United Kingdom.', 'In May 2005 the applicant, a police officer, was arrested and charged with what he describes as serious sexual offences. His trial took place in January 2006 and he was acquitted. He was permitted to return to police work in April of that year, although subject to certain unspecified restrictions. Moreover, the applicant states that because of his relatively uncommon name it is easy to find news reports on the Internet about the charges brought against him, his trial and his acquittal.', 'In light of the seriousness of the charges, information about them will be retained by the police until the date of his 100th birthday in accordance with current policy, and may be disclosed in certain circumstances as explained below. The applicant did not take any domestic legal proceedings in relation to his complaint.', 'The law and practice in relation to the retention and disclosure by police of personal information (arrests, charges, convictions, acquittals and so forth) which were current at the time of the applicant’s trial are referred to the Court’s judgment in M.M. v. the United Kingdom, no. 24029/07, 13 November 2012 (see §§ 33-45 regarding retention and §§ 48-60 regarding disclosure).', 'In summary, and as the applicant has indicated, under the ACPO Retention Guidelines, information relating to the charges brought against him as well as the fact of his acquittal will be retained on the Police National Computer until the date of his 100th birthday. The Guidelines make detailed provision for the “stepping-down” of information held by the police. Information that has been “stepped down” is accessible only to the police. None of the other bodies with which police forces share information may gain access to it. Where a person has been acquitted, the information is stepped down immediately. It would only be disclosed as part of an enhanced criminal record check if the police decided that it was relevant to the purpose of such a request and not disproportionate to do so.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Ms Natalija Sproģe, is a Latvian national, who was born in 1980 and lives in Riga. She is represented before the Court by Mr W. Bowring, a lawyer practising in London.', '2. The Latvian Government (“the Government”) are represented by their Agent, Ms K. Līce.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. In the 1940s, following a nationalisation process (for more detailed historical background see Liepājnieks v. Latvia (dec.), no. 37586/06, 2 October 2010) , the applicant’s predecessors settled in an apartment in Čaka street, Riga, which was later rented by the applicant’s father. The applicant and her family lived in the apartment until 2002.', '5. In February 1992 the dwelling house was denationalised and taken over by a private person. The new owner requested the applicant’s family to leave the apartment, alleging that it was unfit for occupation and required urgent repair. The dispute over the right to rent the apartment resulted in several sets of court proceedings between the applicant’s family and the landlord.', '6. In 2000 the landlord brought a claim for eviction of the applicant’s family, without providing alternative accommodation.', '7. On 29 January 2001 Judge T. of the Riga Centre District Court upheld the claim. On the basis of the parties’ statements and case materials, the court found that: (1) even in the absence of a written rental agreement between the parties, the applicant had been renting the contested apartment; (2) the apartment needed renovation and the plaintiff had proved his intention to carry out the necessary work, and therefore the condition for terminating the rental agreement had been met; (3) the plaintiff had warned the tenants about the termination of the rental agreement in accordance with a procedure provided by law.', '8. On 14 March 2002 an appeal by the applicant was dismissed by the Riga Regional Court, which on 27 March 2002 issued an execution order.', '9. The decision became final in August 2002 when the Senate of the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal on points of law by the applicant.', '10. While the above proceedings were pending, in 2001 the landlord brought a claim against the applicant and her family asking the court to order the tenants to give him access to the apartment. He argued that certain parts of the apartment were in a critical condition and required urgent repair owing to the fact that the wooden construction between the floors was decayed and risked collapsing.', '11. On 21 August 2001 Judge T. of the Riga Centre District Court, in the absence of the applicant and her family, upheld the claim. The applicant and her family were duly informed of the proceedings.', '12. The judgment was subject to appeal. Owing to its urgent nature, the lower court ordered the immediate execution of the judgment.', '13. The applicant and the other defendants appealed and refused to implement the judgment. Following the bailiff’s report that execution of the judgment was impossible, Judge T. on 10 September and 16 October 2001 imposed a fine of 50 lati (LVL) (70 euros (EUR)) and LVL 500 (EUR 700) on each of the three defendants, including the applicant. Upon appeal by the applicant, the Riga Regional Court quashed the decisions in a final ruling on 29 January 2002.', '14. Meanwhile, the Administrative Commission of the Riga Municipality Centre District had on various occasions imposed fines on the applicant and her family for failing to allow the landlord to enter the apartment, in breach of the Administrative Offences Code in force at the time. On at least one occasion in January 2002 Judge T. had made a decision relating to an administrative fine imposed on one of the applicant’s family members; in the decision she had identified shortcomings in the administrative offence proceedings and discontinued them. The decision was final.', '15. It appears that on 16 October 2002 a bailiff attempted to carry out the eviction in accordance with the order issued on 27 March 2002. The applicant and her family allegedly refused to leave the apartment, arguing that the eviction was unlawful. The landlord therefore proceeded to have the doors of the apartment opened by force, but it was discovered that the entrance was blocked with furniture and it was impossible to enter. An incident arose between the workers assigned by the bailiff and the people who were at the apartment during the eviction.', '16. On 27 January 2003 the landlord brought a civil claim for damages against the applicant and her family for the broken apartment door and for damage to belongings of other people involved in the incident.', '17. On 30 June 2003 the lower court, in the absence of the defendants, upheld the claim and ordered the defendants to pay LVL 1,979 (around EUR 2,830) in damages.', '18. The applicant appealed, arguing that opening the doors by force had not been necessary, and that the court had failed to establish a causal link between the actions of each of the defendants and the alleged damage.', '19. On 25 April 2005 the Riga Regional Court, sitting as a panel of three judges, examined the applicant’s appeal, with Judge T. as one of the judges. At the beginning of the hearing the applicant challenged Judge T.’s impartiality, arguing that she had evicted her family from the apartment and that therefore she might have an interest in the case.', '20. The court dismissed the objection and since there were no other requests received by the parties, continued to examine the appeal on the merits. In a judgment of 9 May 2005 the court partly upheld the claim. It observed that the applicant’s family had been evicted from the apartment in accordance with a valid court judgment and that witness statements had established that on 16 October 2002 the defendants had objected to the request by the court bailiff. In the court’s opinion there was no doubt that the plaintiff had sustained damage and that the lower court had correctly found that the damage had been caused by the applicant and her family because the eviction concerned all of them.', '21. In an appeal on points of law the applicant noted that she had raised objections against Judge T., listing all the decisions the judge had previously made.', '22. On 8 August 2005 a Senate preparatory meeting refused leave to appeal on points of law and the cassation proceedings were discontinued. The decision did not address the allegations of a lack of impartiality.', '23. Section 14 of the Law on Judicial Power provides that a judge does not have the right to participate in the adjudication of a case if he or she, personally, directly or indirectly, has an interest in the outcome of the case, or if there are other circumstances creating well-founded reasons to question the judge’s impartiality. In such cases a judge must withdraw from the case. If a judge or a lay judge has not withdrawn from the case, anyone participating in the proceedings may request such a withdrawal according to a procedure prescribed by law.', '24. Sections 17 and 19 of the Civil Procedure Law contain similar provisions to those stated above. It also provides that any such requests must be accompanied by sufficient reasons.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

De Gaetano,"['5. The applicant was born in 1980 and lives in Helsinki.', '6. The applicant is a photographer and journalist for the weekly magazine Suomen Kuvalehti. On 9 September 2006 he was sent by his employer to take photographs of the demonstration which was being held in protest against the on-going Asia-Europe meeting (ASEM) in Helsinki. The demonstration was an exceptionally large one in the Finnish context and all media followed it closely.', '7. Before the demonstration took place, on 30 August 2006, the Helsinki Police Department was alerted by the Finnish Security Intelligence that the upcoming “Smash ASEM” demonstration would be a hostile one and would not aim to highlight any clear political message. The Police Department did not manage to establish contact with the organisers of the demonstration.', '8. The demonstration was to start at 6 p.m. on 9 September 2006. A separate area was reserved for the representatives of the media so that they could freely and safely observe the situation and take photographs on the demonstration place.', '9. At the start of the demonstration, bottles, stones and jars filled with paint were thrown at public and policemen. Some demonstrators kicked and hit police officers. The police announced several times over loudspeakers that a peaceful demonstration was allowed on the spot but that the crowd was not allowed to demonstrate by marching. The crowd tried to break through the police defence line. Relying on all the information in their possession, the police decided to interrupt the demonstration which had now turned violent. The police announced over loudspeakers that the demonstration was stopped and that the crowd should leave the scene. This announcement was repeated several times. Hundreds of people then left voluntarily.', '10. After the escalation of violence, the police considered that the event had turned into a riot and decided to seal off the demonstration area. First only a few people were allowed to leave the area. Then the police established several exit routes and people were allowed to leave. When leaving, they were asked to show ID and their belongings were checked.', '11. However, the core group of around 20 people remained in one of the demonstration spots, including the applicant and a former Member of Parliament, all of whom had been asked to leave the scene, failing which they would be arrested. According to the applicant, he thought that this request only applied to the demonstrators. He claims that sometime later he indicated to the police that he was a representative of the media. He further claims that he was wearing his press badge and that a police officer accepted this. After having called his colleague, the applicant decided to stay until the situation was over. A short time later the police arrested the demonstrators. When leaving the scene the applicant was also arrested. The police arrested altogether 121 persons in the context of the demonstration.', '12. The applicant was detained from 9 September at 9.26 p.m. until 10 September at 3.05 p.m., that is, 17.5 hours.', '13. On 23 May 2007 the public prosecutor brought charges against the applicant for disobeying the police (niskoittelu poliisia vastaan, tredska mot polis) under Chapter 16, section 4, subsection 1, of the Penal Code.', '14. On 17 December 2007 the Helsinki District Court (käräjäoikeus, tingsrätten) found the applicant guilty of disobeying the police but did not impose any penalty on him. The court found it established that the applicant had been aware of the orders of the police to leave the scene but had decided to ignore them. It appeared from the witness statements given before the court that the applicant had not told or indicated the arresting police officer that he was a journalist. According to the arresting officer, this fact only became known to him when the relevant magazine appeared. It appeared also from the witness statements that two other photographers, who had been in the sealed-off area, had been able to leave the scene without consequences just before the applicant was arrested. The court found it further established that the police orders had been clear and that they had clearly concerned everybody. The court balanced the Article 10 right against other interests, finding that the police had had the right to ask the applicant, among others, including the former Member of Parliament, to leave the scene. The interference with the applicant’s right to exercise his freedom of expression had thus been based on law, and it had fulfilled the legitimate aim of preventing disorder. The interference had been necessary in a democratic society in order to put an end to a violent situation. However, relying on Chapter 6, section 12, of the Penal Code, no penalty was imposed as the offence was excusable. The court found that the applicant who, as a journalist, was confronted with contradictory expectations, stemming from obligations imposed on the one hand by the police and on the other by his employer.', '15. By letter dated 23 January 2008 the applicant appealed to the Helsinki Court of Appeal (hovioikeus, hovrätten), claiming that the District Court should have dismissed the charges against him. He argued that his arrest and the fact that he was found guilty were against the Constitution and Article 10 of the Convention. The applicant was a journalist and that he had not participated in the demonstration or caused any disorder. The District Court had not reasoned why his arrest and conviction were “necessary in a democratic society” and had thereby failed to justify the interference.', '16. On 30 April 2009 the Court of Appeal rejected the applicant’s appeal without giving any further reasons.', '17. By letter dated 24 June 2009 the applicant further appealed to the Supreme Court (korkein oikeus, högsta domstolen), reiterating the grounds of appeal already presented before the Court of Appeal.', '18. On 1 September 2009 the Supreme Court refused the applicant leave to appeal.']",[],[],[],['10'],['10-1'],[],0

The applicant was born in 1976 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Croatia.', '7. In 1997 an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant on suspicion of murder. He was remanded in custody during the investigation from 5 February to 21 May 1997.', '8. Following his release from custody, the applicant became unavailable to the Croatian authorities, and on 18 December 1998 the Osijek County Court (Županijski sud u Osijeku), as the competent trial court, ordered his trial in absentia.', '9. On 8 February 1999 the Osijek County Court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him in absentia to nine years’ imprisonment. The judgment became final on 22 February 1999.', '10. On 27 September 2005 a judge responsible for the execution of sentences at the Osijek County Court ordered that the applicant should start to serve his prison sentence. Given that at the time the applicant was still at large, the judge ordered that a warrant be issued for his arrest.', '11. On the basis of the arrest warrant, the applicant was arrested in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on 21 July 2011 he was extradited to Croatia, where he immediately started to serve his prison sentence.', '12. The day following his extradition, the applicant requested the Osijek County Court to reopen the proceedings conducted in his absence (see paragraph 30 below). He relied on the Code of Criminal Procedure, which provided for the automatic reopening of proceedings conducted in absentia at the request of the convicted person.', '13. A three-judge panel of the Osijek County Court granted the applicant’s request for reopening of the proceedings on 26 August 2011. The decision became final on 6 September 2011.', '14. On 4 October 2011 the Osijek County Court discontinued the applicant’s prison sentence on the ground that the reopening of the proceedings had been granted and that therefore the execution of the sentence had to be stayed, as required under Article 507 § 5 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 31 below).', '15. In the meantime, on 27 September 2011 the Osijek County State Attorney’s Office (Županijsko državno odvjetništvo u Osijeku) had requested the Osijek County Court to order that the applicant be remanded in custody under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of absconding) pending the retrial.', '16. In connection with that request, on 5 October 2011 a three-judge panel of the Osijek County Court heard the applicant and his lawyer. They argued, in particular, that the applicant had not sought to avoid trial and that his detention should be replaced by the application of a less restrictive measure, such as bail, which could be effected by the seizure of his mother’s house and of documents.', '17. On the same day the Osijek County Court accepted the request of the State Attorney’s Office and ordered the applicant’s pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of absconding). The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“Having considered the [available] evidence, this panel has found that the accused Nenad Kovačević received an indictment [from the competent prosecutor] on 24 June 1997 ..., that the Osijek-baranja Police Department informed the Osijek County Court that the accused Nenad Kovačević was absent from his place of residence [in Croatia] as he had gone away in March 1998 and was [at the time] allegedly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as stated by his mother. Furthermore, it was established that the accused Nenad Kovačević had been found guilty by the above-mentioned final judgment of the Osijek County Court of the offence of murder ... for which he had been sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment. It was also established that the accused Nenad Kovačević ... had been arrested [in Bosnia and Herzegovina] because a sentence-execution judge of this court ordered that he should start to serve his prison sentence, and therefore the objection that the general conditions for ordering detention under Article 123 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have not been met is unfounded. The final judgment adopted in the criminal proceedings conducted in the absence of the accused, by which he was found guilty on charges of murder and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment, represents a reasonable suspicion that the accused Nenad Kovačević committed the offence of murder ... The fact that he fled, given that the order for his pre-trial detention and the arrest warrant remained futile and there was no possibility for the police to bring him [before the court] for a hearing, and that he was arrested only on the basis of [an arrest warrant] for the execution of the prison term to which he had been sentenced, suggests the existence of grounds for ordering pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure; that is to say, special grounds justifying a risk that, if at large, the accused might abscond and thus hinder the proper conduct of these criminal proceedings.', '...', 'As already stated above, the accused Nenad Kovačević received the mentioned indictment by which he is charged with murder ... It follows [from the case file] that he was also detained. This suggests that the accused knew that the criminal proceedings at issue had been pending against him and that he had been charged with a serious criminal offence. He [nevertheless] left his residence and the territory of Croatia and was arrested on the territory of a country where he did not have residence, namely Bosnia and Herzegovina, while he himself stated that he had residence in Serbia. All these circumstances as well suggest that there is a risk that the accused might again abscond and thereby hinder the termination of the reopened proceedings at issue.', 'In addition, as the panel of this court has found that the conditions for ordering detention in respect of the accused Nenad Kovačević under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure have been met, [it considers that] the measure of detention is necessary in order to avert the risk of absconding, which could not be achieved by bail or the alternative measures suggested by the accused and his defence lawyer. This is particularly true given the circumstances and severity of the offence at issue, and the fact that [the accused] is also a national of Serbia and that he himself stated that he had no residence in Croatia, which means that he could very easily leave the territory of Croatia.”', '18. The applicant appealed to the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), arguing that the indictment had not been served on him but on his brother, who had been a minor at the time, and that he had left Croatia for personal reasons. He offered his Croatian and Serbian passports and his mother’s house in Croatia as bail to guarantee that he would not abscond. The applicant also contended that the decision of the Osijek County Court lacked the relevant reasoning concerning the possibility of his conditional release.', '19. The Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded on 4 November 2011. The relevant part of the decision reads:', '“Contrary to the appeal arguments, the Supreme Court as the second-instance court finds that the first-instance court correctly established that the defendant should be remanded in custody under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', 'Reasonable suspicion that the defendant committed the offence [of murder] follows from the final judgment by which he was found guilty and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment, which had been adopted after a trial in absentia and in respect of which a retrial was granted. The general requirement for detention has therefore been met.', 'Furthermore, it should be noted that the defendant, although aware that criminal proceedings were pending against him (he was questioned by an investigating judge, he was detained from 5 February to 21 May 1997, and he received the indictment), left the territory of Croatia and thereby became unavailable during the proceedings conducted before the Osijek County Court. He was arrested only after a sentence-execution judge issued an order for his arrest for the execution of the prison sentence, and [the arrest] was effected on the basis of an international arrest warrant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, although he stated that his residence was in Serbia.', 'All these circumstances, in the view of the Supreme Court as the second-instance court, suggest that there is a fear that the defendant, who is also a national of Serbia, if at large, could abscond and thereby hinder the course of the criminal proceedings. This in particular follows from his previous behaviour, the fact that he was unavailable to the judicial authorities for fourteen years and that he is again being tried for a serious criminal offence for which he had been found guilty in absentia and sentenced to nine years’ imprisonment ...', 'The appeal arguments of the defendant that he did not know that the criminal proceedings at issue were pending as he had not received the indictment are unfounded because the material from the case file suggests the opposite. The case file contains signed delivery notices which demonstrate that he duly received the indictment. He was also questioned before an investigating judge concerning the offence of which he was later found guilty, and for which he had also spent some time in pre-trial detention. There is therefore no doubt that he knew about the criminal proceedings pending against him.', 'Moreover, the appellant is wrong in contending that a fundamental procedural omission occurred in that the impugned decision is not sufficiently reasoned in respect of the possibility of applying bail or some other alternative measure. The first-instance court provided sufficient and clear reasons for considering it necessary to order pre-trial detention under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure and why the same purpose could not be achieved by bail or any other alternative measure; and this second-instance court fully endorses those reasons.”', '20. On 9 December 2011 the applicant again requested that his pre-trial detention be replaced by bail or an alternative less restrictive measure. At the hearing held on 16 January 2012 he reiterated his request.', '21. The Osijek County Court dismissed the applicant’s request on 16 January 2012 and extended his detention under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of absconding), reiterating its previous reasoning.', '22. On 2 February 2012, following a retrial, the Osijek County Court upheld the applicant’s conviction in absentia, finding him guilty of the offence of murder and sentencing him to nine years’ imprisonment. It was also decided on the same day that the applicant should remain in detention pending a final judgment.', '23. The applicant appealed against that judgment to the Supreme Court. On 23 October 2012 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment and remitted the case to the Osijek County Court for re-examination on the grounds of the existence of procedural flaws.', '24. At the same time, the Supreme Court extended the applicant’s detention under Article 123 § 1(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (risk of absconding), reiterating its previous reasons.', '25. On 7 December 2012 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), challenging the decision on his pre-trial detention. He argued in particular , his detention was disproportionate and should be replaced by bail or an alternative less restrictive preventive measure.', '26. On 13 December 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint as ill-founded, endorsing the reasoning of the lower courts. That decision was served on the applicant’s representative on 17 December 2012.', '27. On 18 December 2012, having reheard the case, the Osijek County Court upheld the applicant’s conviction in absentia, finding him guilty of the offence of murder and sentencing him to nine years’ imprisonment. The applicant was remanded in custody pending a final judgment.', '28. That judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court on 18 June 2013 and it thereby became final. On 18 October 2013 the applicant challenged it before the Constitutional Court and the proceedings before that court are still pending.']",[],[],[],['5'],['5-3'],[],0

Camilleri, a lawyer practising in Valletta.', 'The Government were represented by their Agent, Dr P. Grech, Attorney General.', 'The facts of the case may be summarised as follows.', 'On 10 February 2004 the first applicant (who was nineteen years old at the time) was arrested and interrogated on suspicion of trafficking ecstasy (a drug which is regulated by the Medical and Kindred Professions Ordinance, Chapter 31 of the Laws of Malta). During the interrogation, at which no lawyer was present, he gave a statement admitting to selling about two hundred ecstasy pills and to using ecstasy and cannabis.', 'On 12 February 2004 he gave another statement on oath before a magistrate, whereby he confirmed the contents of his previous statement and implicated some other individuals. The latter statement was given at the police headquarters shortly after he had been released, but it is unclear whether he was re-arrested and taken to the headquarters for further investigation, or whether he was asked to attend the police headquarters for further questioning by the inquiring magistrate.', 'On 10 February 2004 the second applicant (who was eighteen years old at the time) was arrested and interrogated on suspicion of trafficking and possession of ecstasy. During the interrogation, at which no lawyer was present, she gave a statement admitting to her involvement in the crime. She declared that she had been using ecstasy for nearly a year, that she smoked cannabis, and that she had helped Mr Fenech to sell about ten ecstasy pills for 5 Maltese liri (MTL) each.', 'On 12 February 2004 she gave another statement on oath before a magistrate, whereby she confirmed the contents of her previous statement. From the documents provided it is not possible to determine the time of this interrogation or whether the applicant was under arrest.', 'Subsequently the applicants were arraigned in the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature) and their above-mentioned statements were exhibited as evidence against them.', 'On 1 December 2009 during the criminal proceedings, the applicants requested the court to make a referral to the constitutional jurisdictions regarding complaints they had concerning the lack of legal assistance afforded to them during investigation and interrogation. By a decision of 11 June 2009, the court granted the request and referred the case. The applicants alleged a breach of their right to a fair trial (Article 6 of the Convention) on account of the lack of legal assistance. They requested that their statements - both those made to the police and those made to the magistrate - be excluded from the prosecution’s evidence.', 'By a judgment of 23 January 2012, the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence found a violation of the first applicant’s right to a fair trial, in so far as he had not had access to a lawyer before and during the police interrogation which led to his statement of 10 February 2004. The same applied in respect of his statement under oath before the magistrate, if made while under arrest. It considered that a person had just as much a right to legal assistance before making a statement to a judicial authority as he or she did before making a statement to the police.', 'It ordered that any statements made by the applicant while under arrest should not be used in the criminal proceedings against him. It was for the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature), before which the case was pending, to make an order as to what was to be done with those statements in accordance with this decision. Since it was not clear whether the applicant was under arrest on 12 February 2004, it was therefore for that court to decide that matter.', 'On appeal, by a judgment of 22 February 2013, the Constitutional Court reversed in part the first-instance judgment.', 'Accepting that the case was not premature, and in the light of the criminal courts’ referral, it found that the first applicant’s right to a fair trial had been breached only in relation to the statement given to the police, but not the statement given before the magistrate, which could thus be admitted as evidence in the criminal proceedings against him.', 'It considered that the right to legal assistance was not a formality which the accused could use as a further means of defence if not respected. The right served to ensure that statements are made freely, with the knowledge of the right to remain silent, without threats and promises, violence or abuse. A breach of the right to legal assistance during interrogation would occur when a statement was obtained by abuse and not solely because there was no lawyer present. There existed no right for accused persons to be found not guilty. The role of the lawyer was to ensure that the statement was taken legitimately and not to give advice as to how to hide the truth or make a limited or selective declaration. The law aimed to establish the truth and to ensure that no false statements are obtained by abuse. Fundamental rights were meant to promote the dignity of the individual, a matter which surely would not be protected by giving rights which distort or hide the truth at the expense of the proper administration of justice. The right to legal assistance was intended to protect persons in particular situations of vulnerability, weakness or fear who as a result of which made statements which led to a finding of guilt despite their innocence. Legal assistance in such cases prevented any such abuse and counteracted the vulnerability of the individual concerned.', 'In the present case the applicant was only nineteen years of age at the time and may well have been vulnerable; however, someone other than a lawyer could have provided for such a guarantee, such as a magistrate (independent from the police), before whom the applicant made his second statement in accordance with domestic law.', 'For these reasons the Constitutional Court upheld the Article 6 violation only in respect of the statement the applicant made to the police, which could not therefore be used in the criminal proceedings against him, but not in respect of the statement made before the inquiring magistrate, which could be used in the proceedings.', 'By a judgment of 23 January 2012, the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence found a violation of the second applicant’s right to a fair trial, in so far as she had not had access to a lawyer before and during the interrogation which led to her incriminating statement being used by the prosecution as a crucial piece of evidence. The same applied in respect of a further statement she made under oath before a magistrate, if made while under arrest (that is, while in police custody), since Strasbourg case-law did not make such a distinction. It ordered that any statements made by the applicant while under arrest should not be used in the criminal proceedings against her. It was for the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature), before which the case was pending, to make an order as to what was to be done with those statements in accordance with this decision. In particular, it was not clear whether the applicant was under arrest or had already been released on 12 February 2004; it was therefore for that court to decide that matter.', 'On appeal, by a judgment of 22 February 2013, the Constitutional Court reversed in part the first-instance judgment. Accepting that the case was not premature, also in the light of the criminal courts’ referral, it found that the second applicant’s right to a fair trial had been breached only in relation to the statement given to the police, but not in respect of the statement given before a magistrate, which could thus be admitted as evidence in the criminal proceedings against her. It reiterated the considerations it had made in the above mentioned judgment in respect of the first applicant, Mr Fenech.', 'The criminal proceedings against the applicants are still pending before the Court of Magistrates (as a court of criminal judicature), which has suspended the case pending the outcome of the proceedings before this Court.', 'The relevant domestic law concerning the case is to be found in Dimech v.

The applicant was born in 1954 and lives in Zagreb.', '6. In the former Yugoslav socialist regime all employees contributed to housing funds. The funds thus obtained were used, inter alia, to build blocks of flats. The flats were distributed to employees, who acquired protected tenancies in respect of them and other already existing socially owned flats. Each publicly owned company drew up a list of persons to be granted specially protected tenancies. When a person on such a list was granted a specially protected tenancy, his or her housing needs were considered to have been met and his or her name would be removed from the list.', '7. The applicant was employed by a socially owned company, S. All employees of S. paid contributions to a housing fund in the amount of 3% of their monthly salaries.', '8. On 31 October 1988 company S. granted the applicant a specially protected tenancy of a flat measuring 65.08 square metres in the Zagreb suburbs, with the right to occupy it together with her husband and two daughters. However, since that decision was not yet final, company S. entered into an agreement with the applicant on 7 December 1988 giving her the right to move into the flat with her family and to care for that flat. The applicant moved into the flat and has been living there ever since.', '9. The decision to grant the applicant a specially protected tenancy was challenged by three other employees and quashed by the Zagreb Basic Court of Associated Labour (Osnovni sud udruženog rada u Zagrebu).', '10. On 27 March 1990 the housing committee of company S. drew up a priority list for the distribution of flats. The applicant was the first on the list. On 23 April 1990 the company’s workers’ council approved the priority list. On the basis of that list she was entitled to have a decision allocating a flat to her issued. On 27 April 1992 the flats of the company S. were transferred for management to the Zagreb Municipality.', '11. On 9 and 15 May 1990, respectively, two other employees of company S. brought an action before the competent court, seeking to have the priority list declared null and void. Competence in the matter was subsequently transferred to the Zagreb Municipal Court, which on 3 February 1999 dismissed the claims on the merits since there was no possibility under the relevant law to bring such an action at all. A civil action could be brought to challenge the decision on allocation of a flat but not to challenge a priority list.', '12. On 23 June 2004 the Zagreb County Court amended the judgment of 3 February 1999 so as to declare the actions inadmissible on the same grounds, namely that the priority list could not be challenged before a court of law.', '13. Meanwhile, on 3 June 1991 Parliament had enacted the Protected Tenancies (Sale to Occupier) Act (Zakon o prodaji stanova na kojima postoji stanarsko pravo), which abolished the specially protected tenancies and regulated the sale of socially owned flats previously let under a specially protected tenancy.', '14. On 29 November 1995 the applicant asked the Zagreb Municipality as the owner of the flat to conclude a contract for the sale of the flat with herself as the buyer. The Zagreb Municipality did not take any decision within the prescribed time-limit of sixty days.', '15. On an unspecified date in 2005 the applicant re-submitted to the Zagreb Municipality her request to purchase the flat she occupied. The request was refused on 6 July 2005 because she had not been granted a specially protected tenancy in respect of that flat.', '16. On 26 September 2005 the applicant brought a civil action against the City of Zagreb, which in the meantime had become the owner of the flat she occupied, seeking a judgment in lieu of the contract of sale of the flat in question.', '17. The claim was dismissed by the Zagreb Municipal Court on 18 June 2007 on the grounds that the applicant had not acquired a protected tenancy of the flat in question, since the priority list did not constitute a decision on the granting of protected tenancies within the meaning of the Housing Act.', '18. The judgment was upheld by the Zagreb County Court on 8 April 2008. The court held that the applicant did not have a final decision on allocation of the flat to her.', '19. In a subsequent constitutional complaint lodged by the applicant, she complained that her right to equality before the law, her right to an appeal as well as her right to a fair trial had been violated. She argued that she had been the first on a priority list drawn up by company S. for the distribution of flats. The only reasons she had not been formally granted a specially protected tenancy of the flat she had been occupying were the challenge of the priority list by her co-workers and the delay in the civil proceedings before the Zagreb Municipal Court. However, once those proceedings had ended, all of the conditions for recognition of her specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been met. The one-year validity of the priority list was to be counted from the date of its being confirmed, which in the applicant’s case had occurred when the national courts had dismissed all the objections concerning that list. By not recognising her right to a specially protected tenancy, the national authorities had deprived her of the possibility to purchase the flat she occupied under favourable conditions. She also relied on some other decisions of the Constitutional Court whereby it had granted protection to persons in situations comparable to her own.', '20. On 11 May 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the applicant’s constitutional complaint on the grounds that the findings of the lower courts that she had not acquired a specially protected tenancy of the flat at issue had been correct. It further held that the decisions the applicant had relied on concerned persons who had had specially protected tenancies which they had subsequently lost.']",[],[],[],['P1'],['P1-1'],['P1-1-1'],0

On the same day the Šakiai district prosecutor (hereinafter “the prosecutor”) opened a pre-trial investigation.', '4. On the same day the applicant was served with an official notice informing him that he was suspected of having injured A.A. while acting together with another unidentified individual and while being under the influence of alcohol.

At some point they had decided to go to the applicant’s house to buy more alcohol because they had heard that he was selling it. However, nobody had let them into the house, so they had left. Soon afterwards they had noticed two men following them – one of them had been the applicant and the other had been unknown to them at that time. It was the latter who had assaulted A.A. with a knife; subsequently, in an identification parade, A.A. identified his attacker as S.B.', '6. On 17 March 2011 the prosecutor discontinued the pre-trial investigation in respect of the applicant. The prosecutor’s decision stated that during the investigation it had been established that the applicant had not injured A.A. – this had been confirmed by A.A. himself and by other witnesses (see paragraph 5 above). The investigation in respect of the applicant was therefore discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence under Article 138 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The decision stated that a copy of it had been sent to the applicant, who had the right to appeal against it within fourteen days. He did not lodge an appeal. The applicant later submitted to the domestic courts that he had never received a copy of that decision (see paragraph 18 below).', '7. On 18 March 2011 S.B. became a suspect in the investigation. In the course of the investigation against S.B., the applicant was questioned as a witness once and participated in four confrontations with S.B., A.A. and two other witnesses. On each of those occasions the applicant signed to confirm that he had been informed about his rights and obligations as a witness, and had been warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article 235 of the Criminal Code (see the contents of the protocol for witness testimonies in paragraph 26 below). The applicant stated that on the night of the incident he, his friend K.B. and the suspect, S.B., had gone to the applicant’s house to get alcohol and cigarettes. At some point S.B. had walked away from the house towards a nearby road and soon thereafter the applicant had heard screams coming from that direction. He had gone there with his car, had seen a group of young men beating up S.B. and had gone back to his house because he had not wanted to get involved. He had not seen S.B. assault anyone, nor had he known whether S.B. had had a knife.', 'The applicant repeated a similar account of events, with some changes, in confrontations with S.B. and K.B., and the latter stated that they agreed with the applicant’s version.', '8. On an unspecified date S.B. was charged with causing A.A. a severe health impairment, as defined in Article 135 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 below).', '9. On 6 September 2011 the applicant was questioned as a witness at a court hearing. He was warned that if he gave false testimony he would incur criminal liability under Article 235 of the Criminal Code and signed an oath. He was asked whether on the night of the incident S.B. had had a knife, whether the victim and his friends had been armed, and who had attacked whom during the incident. The applicant provided essentially the same account of the events as before (see paragraph 7 above).', '10. On 16 December 2011 the Šakiai District Court found S.B. guilty of causing A.A. a severe health impairment, as defined in Article 135 § 1 of the Criminal Code, and sentenced him to six years of imprisonment. The court considered that the victim, A.A., and the witnesses who had been with him on the night of the incident had given consistent statements which it had no reason to doubt (see paragraph 5 above). Furthermore, their account had been corroborated by police officers and was consistent with the items seized at the scene of the incident. The court also held that the applicant, K.B. and S.B. had given conflicting statements and had changed certain details in their statements when questioned on different occasions. Accordingly, the court viewed their testimonies as an attempt to help S.B. avoid criminal responsibility and dismissed them as unreliable.', '11. On the same day the Šakiai District Court also instructed the prosecutor to consider whether a pre-trial investigation should be opened in respect of the applicant and K.B. for giving false testimony under Article 235 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '12. On 11 October 2012 the applicant and K.B. were served with official notices informing them that they were suspected of having given false testimony in the proceedings against S.B., as set out in Article 235 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '13. When questioned on the same day, K.B. admitted his guilt. He stated that he had been afraid to testify against S.B. because the latter was a former prisoner who had been carrying a knife and boasting about assaulting people. Therefore, K.B. had been afraid that S.B. might seek revenge against him for unfavourable testimony. The following day the prosecutor discontinued the investigation against K.B. on the grounds that he had not intended to interfere with the criminal proceedings but that he had been afraid to testify against S.B., which was “understandable” in the light of the serious charges against S.B.', '14. The applicant was also questioned on 11 October 2012. He explicitly refused a lawyer, denied his guilt and refused to answer questions. On 15 October 2012 the applicant was informed that the investigation had been completed and that he had the right to acquaint himself with the case file, but he refused to do so. On 17 October 2012 the applicant was charged with giving false testimony under Article 235 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The indictment stated that, when questioned as a witness in the criminal proceedings against S.B. (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above), the applicant had lied about not being present at the scene when S.B. had assaulted A.A. and about not knowing whether S.B. had had a knife, whereas it had been established in those proceedings that he had been present and had witnessed the assault.', '15. When questioned at the trial, the applicant insisted that the testimony he had given in the criminal proceedings against S.B. had not been false. In addition, he submitted that he should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony in those proceedings because he had been questioned not only about S.B.’s actions but also about his own role in the assault. The applicant submitted that he had been suspected of having taken part in the assault (see paragraph 4 above), and that even though the investigation against him had been discontinued, the domestic law allowed its reopening if new circumstances emerged (see paragraph 25 below). He further submitted that by giving truthful testimony he might have also revealed information about his possible drunk driving on the night of the incident or the possible unlawful sale of alcohol. The applicant therefore argued that convicting him of giving false testimony would be contrary to his right not to incriminate himself.', '16. The prosecutor contested the applicant’s arguments and submitted that at the time when the applicant had been called as a witness, it had been established that he had not assaulted A.A., so he had not been questioned about his own actions. The applicant’s testimony had only been relevant for establishing S.B.’s actions on the night of the assault, in order to help the authorities determine all the circumstances of the criminal offence, and there had been no intention to reopen the proceedings against the applicant.', '17. On 17 January 2013 the Šakiai District Court found the applicant guilty of giving false testimony. The court held that the material collected in the proceedings against S.B. demonstrated that the applicant had knowingly given false testimony in order to help S.B. avoid criminal liability – the inaccuracy of his testimony had been established by the court in those proceedings (see paragraph 10 above). The court dismissed the applicant’s arguments concerning his right not to incriminate himself. It held that at the time when the applicant had been questioned as a witness, the investigation against him had been discontinued on the grounds that his actions had not constituted a criminal offence (see paragraph 6 above), and that the applicant had been questioned only about S.B.’s actions and not his own. The court also stated that the applicant had not been suspected of any other criminal activity, such as drunk driving or the unlawful sale of alcohol, so his arguments in that respect were also dismissed. The applicant was given a fine of 1,950 Lithuanian litai (LTL, approximately 570 euros (EUR)).', '18. The applicant appealed against that judgment. He submitted that he had not been served with a copy of the prosecutor’s decision to discontinue the investigation against him (see paragraph 6 above), so he had continued to regard himself as a suspected accomplice to S.B. The applicant therefore argued that he had had an obvious interest in the outcome of the proceedings and should not have been obliged to give truthful testimony.', '19. On 17 May 2013 the Kaunas Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal. It endorsed the lower court’s arguments that the false nature of the applicant’s testimony in the proceedings against S.B. had been established (see paragraph 17 above). It further stated that it was clear from the case file that before each questioning as a witness, the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties, as required by domestic law, and warned that he would be held criminally liable if he gave false testimony (see paragraphs 7 and 9 above and paragraph 26 below), so he had had no grounds to consider himself a suspect. The court also reiterated that the applicant had been called to testify only about S.B.’s actions which he had seen and not about his own role in the assault. However, the Kaunas Regional Court found that the lower court had erred when determining the sentence because it had applied an old version of Article 235 of the Criminal Code. It therefore changed the applicant’s sentence in line with the version of that provision which had been in force at the time when the applicant had given his last testimony in the criminal proceedings against S.B. (see paragraph 9 above), and fined him LTL 15,600 (approximately EUR 4,520).', '20. The applicant submitted an appeal on points of law, again arguing that his right not to incriminate himself had been breached. However, on 23 December 2013 the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal. It reiterated that the applicant had been informed about his rights and duties as a witness and warned about criminal liability for giving false testimony, and that he had been questioned about the actions of S.B. and not about his own actions, so it must have been clear to him that his testimony could not have incriminated him.', '21. The relevant part of Article 31 of the Constitution provides:', '“It shall be prohibited to compel anyone to give evidence against himself, or his family members or close relatives.”', '22. The relevant provisions of the Criminal Code, valid at the material time and currently, read:', '“1. Anyone who has injured another person or caused him or her to be ill, if as a result the victim has lost his or her eyesight, hearing, ability to speak, fertility or pregnancy, or sustained another serious mutilation, or contracted a terminal or longlasting illness posing a real threat to his or her life or seriously affecting his or her mental health, or lost a considerable part of his or her professional or general capacity to work, or sustained permanent disfigurement, shall be punished by imprisonment for a term of up to ten years.', '...”', '“1. Anyone who has injured another person or caused him or her to be ill, if as a result the victim has lost a small part of his or her professional or general capacity to work or was ill for a long time but did not suffer the consequences set out in Article 135 § 1 of this Code, shall be punished by restriction of liberty or by detention or by imprisonment for a term of up to three years.', '...”', '“1. Anyone who, during a pre-trial investigation or trial or before the International Criminal Court or another international judicial institution, has submitted a false complaint, application or report of a criminal activity, or given false testimony when questioned as a witness or a victim, or has given false conclusions or explanations when acting as an expert or specialist, or provided a false or knowingly inaccurate translation when acting as an interpreter, shall be sentenced to a term of community service or a fine or restriction of liberty or detention or imprisonment for a term of up to two years.', '...”', '23', '24. Article 80 § 1 of the CCP provides that persons who are to give testimony about their own possibly criminal activity cannot be questioned as witnesses unless they agree to be thus questioned. Article 82 § 3 of the CCP provides that when such persons are questioned, they have the right to legal representation and to apply for status as a suspect, and they are exempted from liability for refusing to testify or giving false testimony.', '25. Article 217 § 2 of the CCP allows the reopening of a previously discontinued pre-trial investigation following the discovery of essential circumstances which are relevant for the proper examination of the case and which had not been established at the time the decision to discontinue the investigation had been adopted.', '26. The protocol for witness testimonies, adopted by the Prosecutor General on 11 April 2003 and valid, with some amendments, until 29 December 2014, provided that a witness must be informed about his or her right, in line with Article 31 § 3 of the Constitution, not to give evidence against himself or herself, or his or her family members or close relatives (see paragraph 21 above), about his or her rights and obligations as set forth in the CCP (see paragraphs 23 and 24 above), and about criminal liability for giving false testimony (see paragraph 22 above). That protocol had to be signed by the witness to confirm that he or she had been so informed.', '27. In its ruling of 31 January 2017 in criminal case no. 2K55699/2017, the Supreme Court, relying on its previous case-law (ruling of 23 June 2009 in criminal case no. 2K-255/2009 and ruling of 16 June 2015 in criminal case no. 2K-348-303/2015), held:', '“Article 80 § 1 of the CCP provides that persons who are to give testimony about their own possibly criminal activity cannot be questioned as witnesses unless they agree to be thus questioned, in line with the conditions provided for in Article 82 § 3 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ...

THE UNITED KINGDOM,4,No violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1 - Lawful arrest or detention;Article 5-1-a - After conviction),Nona Tsotsoria;Paul Mahoney,"['5. The applicant was born in 1986 and is currently in detention at HMP Risley.', '6. On 17 April 2007, after pleading guilty to counts of rape, indecent assault and robbery, the applicant was sentenced to an indeterminate sentence for the public protection (“IPP”). The minimum term that the applicant had to serve before being eligible for release (the “tariff”) was set at 4 years 273 days. His tariff was due to expire on 16 January 2012.', '7. On 16 October 2007 the applicant completed alcohol in cell work and on 31 October 2007 he completed an alcohol awareness course.', '8. In March 2008 the applicant was transferred to HMP Wayland. From 30 May 2008 to 2 July 2008 he participated in the Enhanced Thinking Skills (“ETS”) course.', '9. In November 2008 the applicant completed the Living with Loss course.', '10. On 16 July 2009 the applicant completed the Core Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (“SOTP”). In a post-programme progress review dated 30 November 2009, further work to reduce his risk of reoffending was identified, namely full engagement in the Structured Assessment of Risk and Need (“SARN”) process and full engagement in further assessments for sexual offending programmes.', '11. A SARN Report dated 8 April 2010 prepared by a forensic psychologist in training noted that the applicant was assessed at a high statistic and high dynamic risk of sexual reoffending. It recommended personality and psychiatric assessments followed by completion of the extended Sex Offenders Treatment Programme (“ESOTP”) in order to reduce his risk. It concluded that the risk presented by the applicant was not low enough for him to be transferred to open conditions. The applicant was placed on a waiting list for the ESOTP.', '12. On 20 May 2010 the applicant was informed by the Parole Board that it had not directed his release on licence or transfer to open conditions as some risk factors were outstanding. It noted that the Secretary of State had identified the need for sex offending and alcohol awareness work to reduce the level of risk. The applicant’s next parole process was to commence in May 2011, with an oral hearing in November 2011.', '13. On 13 September 2010 the applicant made a formal application to HMP Bure, where he was then detained, to ask whether it intended to run the ESOTP. He was advised in reply that the prison planned to run the ESOTP in around April 2011. The applicant was not selected to participate in the course.', '14. On 13 July 2011 the applicant completed a further alcohol awareness course.', '15. On 26 September 2011 the Parole Board decided, on the papers, not to direct the applicant’s release. It noted that the applicant had completed an accredited alcohol course, the ETS course and the SOTP and that he hoped to complete the Thinking Skills Programme (“TSP”) and ESOTP in the near future. It concluded:', '“You have been consistently well motivated to engage with all work identified as necessary for you. This is to your credit, as is your calm and personable approach. You have made some progress in that you now talk more openly and in more depth about your sexual offences. This has enabled you to work constructively with programme facilitators, and has provided a foundation on which to build in the ESOTP. You are motivated to complete that programme, and it is only available in the closed estate – any move to open conditions would therefore be premature. Release is, at present, out of the question. There is some lack of clarity around some of the risk factors in your case, and you yourself recognise that there is more to be done in terms of addressing risk ...”', '16. In November 2011 the applicant completed the TSP.', '17. By letter dated 1 December 2011, the applicant was informed that the Secretary of State had considered the Parole Board recommendation and agreed that the applicant was not suitable for release or transfer to open prison conditions. The next review period was set at twenty months, allowing eight months for completion of TSP, six months for completion of ESOTP and six months for production of a further SARN report. The review would therefore commence in October 2012 with a view to completion by July 2013.', '18. In a Sentence Planning and Review Report dated 5 December 2011, it was recognised that ESOTP was a course that the applicant should concentrate on as part of his sentence plan. The report observed that the applicant’s need to improve his use of alternative styles of thinking had been addressed through his attendance at the TSP. The report further noted:', '“Alcohol was an area that was problematic before his incarceration ... He has completed an accredited alcohol course (TADS) and continues to work with CARATS to address this issue. Mr Alexander has completed TSP and reports following completion were positive ... His sentence plan also recommends that he is assessed for the Extended SOTP. I understand from the programmes department that due to lack of resources this remains an objective. However, I am confident that subject to local prioritization strategy this should be completed in 2013.”', '19. The applicant’s tariff expired on 16 January 2012.', '20. On 27 April 2012 the Prison Service notified the applicant’s solicitors that the applicant was listed on their database “as a priority for assessment” prior to the next ESOTP scheduled to commence in August 2012. The applicant was not selected to participate in the course.', '21. On 24 May 2012 the applicant completed a “Change is Possible” group work session. On an unknown date, he attended a brick-laying course.', '22. On 12 October 2012 the applicant made a formal application to HMP Bure to ask for an assurance that he would have a place on the next ESOTP. He was advised in reply that no such assurance could be given but that he was a “high priority”.', '23. On 28 November 2012 the Prison Service advised the applicant’s solicitors that he would continue to be considered for the next group to participate in the ESOTP, in line with the prioritisation strategy.', '24. On 18 December 2012 the applicant’s Parole Assessment Report commented on the work done to date and noted:', '“Unfortunately, Mr Alexander has yet to get a place on the [ESOTP] and it is hoped that he will in March 2013.”', '25. In its recommendation, the report stated:', '“It is hoped that [the applicant] will be able to participate in the ESOTP (6 months in duration) that is scheduled for March 2013. Until that programme is completed and a further SARN written to identify whether further intervention is required to manage risk, there can be no change to his current assessments and there is no support for a move to less secure conditions at this time ...”', '26. On 12 February 2013 the Parole Board decided on the papers not to direct the applicant’s release, deeming him still a risk to the public until he completed the ESOTP. Its report stated:', '“Through no fault of your own, you have been unable to complete ESOTP but it is anticipated that you will have the opportunity to do so in 2013.”', '27. On 13 February 2013 the applicant was informed by HMP Bure programmes team that his placement onto the ESOTP expected to run in June 2013 would depend on the assessment process, which was ongoing, and on his level of priority.', '28. On 11 March 2013 the applicant’s solicitors advised him that HMP Bure had informed them that the applicant would be assessed for a place on the ESOTP to commence in May 2013.', '29. On 13 March 2013 the applicant was informed that the Parole Board decision of February 2013 was final and that the next review would commence in October 2013, with a view to a hearing in May 2014.', '30. On 2 April 2013 the applicant was assessed as being suitable for the ESOTP.', '31. On 10 April 2013 the applicant’s solicitors advised him that they had been informed by HMP Bure that he was a “relatively high priority” to complete the next ESOTP running at HMP Bure in May/June 2013.', '32. In June 2013 the applicant was transferred to HMP Whatton. In February 2014 he underwent further assessments for the ESOTP in order for prison staff to decide whether he could access the ESOTP at another prison or whether he should undertake the course at HMP Whatton.', '33.

The first applicant was born out of wedlock. His mother always considered T.S. to be his father and from an early age he has been in touch with T.S.’s family, who have always treated him as a relative.', '7. On 26 March 2012 the first applicant instituted an action for recognition of paternity before the Vale de Cambra Court. T.S. objected and argued that the applicant’s claim was time-barred under Article 1817 § 1 of the Civil Code. Mr Silva responded that this provision was unconstitutional because it violated Articles 18 §§ 2 and 3 and 26 § 1 of the Constitution.', '8. On 26 June 2012 the judge gave directions (despacho saneador) setting out those matters that had already been established and those that remained outstanding. In addition, the judge dismissed T.S.’s objection that the applicant’s claim was time-barred, holding that the time-limit set by Article 1817 § 1 was unconstitutional insofar as the limitation thus imposed on the possibility of investigating an individual’s paternity at all times constituted an unjustified and disproportionate restriction of the right of a son to know who his father was. It also found that the exercise of a person’s right to know his parentage could not be subject to temporal barriers and could only be restricted in cases where such exercise of the right would constitute an abuse. The fact that the plaintiff had only instituted the proceedings more than fifty years later could not, in itself, be considered to constitute an abuse.', '9. On an unknown date T.S. challenged the judge’s decision of 26 June 2012 ‒ in the part in which it considered Article 1817 § 1 to be incompatible with constitutional provisions ‒ before the Porto Court of Appeal. On an unknown date the applicant submitted his observations in reply (contraalegações), arguing that the decision should be upheld and the proceedings should not be deemed time-barred.', '10. Meanwhile, on an unknown date, at the request of the first applicant, the Vale de Cambra Court ordered DNA tests which established that T.S. was the applicant’s father. In the light of that result the Vale de Cambra Court asked the parties about the usefulness of continuing the proceedings. T.S. did not acknowledge paternity and requested the Vale de Cambra Court to continue the proceedings.', '11. On 9 April 2013 the Porto Court of Appeal dismissed T.S.’s challenge. It held that Article 1817 § 1 was unconstitutional and that the right to seek judicial recognition of paternity should not be subject to a time-limit.', '12. T.S. appealed to the Supreme Court of Justice.', '13. On 14 January 2014 the Supreme Court dismissed T.S.’s appeal and upheld the decision of the Porto Court of Appeal in its entirety.', '14. On an unknown date T.S. appealed to the Constitutional Court, to which he submitted the question of the constitutionality of Article 1817 § 1 of the Civil Code, pursuant to Article 70 § 1 (a) of the Law of the Constitutional Court.', '15. On 10 March 2014 the Constitutional Court held, with reference to its previous ruling no. 401/2011, that Article 1817 § 1 complied with the relevant provisions of the Constitution.', '16.

In addition, it noted that the second applicant had not argued that there were any factors justifying the addition of a further three years pursuant to Article 1817 §§ 2 and 3 of the Civil Code.', '21. On 5 September 2013 the second applicant appealed to the Porto Court of Appeal, challenging the judgment of the Vila Real Court. He argued that the time-limit established under Article 1817 § 1 of the Civil Code for the institution of paternity proceedings was not compatible with the Constitution and that the right to one’s identity should prevail over the rights of the alleged parent.', '22. On 10 December 2013 the Porto Court of Appeal upheld the firstinstance judgment, finding that Article 1817 § 1 of the Civil Code was not incompatible with constitutional provisions, pursuant to Ruling no. 401/2011 of the Constitutional Court. One of the judges dissented, expressing the view that the protection afforded by the Constitution to the fundamental right to personal identity required that the possibility of investigating one’s biological identity should not be subject to a timelimit.', '23.

The record of his arrest contained a written statement from him confirming that he did not need a lawyer.', '8. On 6, 7 and 13 October 2004 the police questioned the applicant as a suspect. The interview records contained his signatures confirming that he had been informed of his right to instruct a lawyer to attend his interview, and that he did not need one.', 'During his first interview the applicant denied any involvement in the fight or the murder.', 'During his second interview he stated that on 5 October 2004, having consumed alcohol, he had been riding a bicycle when O. had suddenly run into him from an alley. They had started arguing and O. had hit the applicant, who had responded with several punches. Afterwards, two other young men had joined in the fight, and the applicant had been kicked to the ground. At some point the applicant had noticed that a woman was restraining O. and not letting him approach the applicant. Another unknown young man, who had not taken part in the fight, had restrained the applicant. The applicant had thought that the young man was going to attack him, and had therefore picked up his knife from the ground and stabbed him.', '9. On 4 November 2004 the applicant was formally accused of murder under section 116 of the Criminal Law (Krimināllikums) for having stabbed the victim with the intent to kill him “because of a personal conflict”.', '10. On 5 November 2004 the applicant was provided with a State-appointed lawyer, S., to assist him during the preliminary investigation. On the same day he was questioned as an accused person in the presence of S. He partially admitted his guilt. In essence, he reiterated the statements made in his earlier interviews. He stated that he had used the knife against the victim because he had known that the victim wanted to hit him, although he could not say whether the victim had already hit him at that point or, if not, when the victim was going to attack him.', '11. On 30 November 2004 the judge extended the applicant’s detention until 5 February 2005. The judge noted that S. had submitted that keeping the applicant in detention was not justified, as he did not present any danger and had no reason to evade justice, since he had a job and a permanent place of residence.', '12. On 22 December 2004 the public prosecutor charged the applicant with murder under section 116 of the Criminal Law. S. was present. On the same day the applicant was questioned in the presence of S. and confirmed his earlier testimony of 5 November 2004 (see paragraph 10 above).', '13. On 24 December 2004, between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m., the applicant familiarised himself with the case file in the presence of S. He wrote in the relevant record that he had no remarks or requests, and also asked to be provided with a lawyer for his trial.', '14. On 3 January 2005 the public prosecutor transferred the case to the Daugavpils Court (Daugavpils tiesa) for trial.', '15. On 10 and 13 January 2005 the applicant complained to the Daugavpils Court that he had not been assisted by a lawyer when he had familiarised himself with the case file.', '16. On 18 February 2005 S. was assigned to the applicant’s case to assist him in the proceedings before the Daugavpils Court. On the same day S. familiarised himself with the case file.', '17. On 23 March 2005 the applicant complained to the Daugavpils Court that S. had convinced him to partially admit his guilt, although he had not wished to do so. Furthermore, S. had not been present when he had familiarised himself with the case file. He did not wish to be assisted by S.', '18. On 7 April 2005 a first-instance hearing was held. The court examined the applicant’s complaint regarding S., who stated that his client’s own interests and those relating to his defence diverged. S. invited the court to uphold the applicant’s application for him to be released from his duties. After the court decided to release S. from his duties, the applicant stated that he needed to be assisted by a lawyer. The proceedings were adjourned.', '19. On 27 May 2005 a senior lawyer of the Daugavpils Bar refused the court’s request to provide the applicant with another State-appointed lawyer, stating that S. had carried out his duties diligently, and Article 98 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Kriminālprocesa kodekss) did not give an accused the right to freely choose a lawyer. The applicant had the right to appoint a lawyer of his own choice (and pay for his or her services), and the right to waive his right to legal assistance.', '20. On 6 June 2005 the applicant asked the Daugavpils Court to provide him with a State-appointed lawyer.', '21. On 9 June 2005 the Latvian Bar Association informed the applicant that, in the event that an accused raised an unjustified challenge in respect of his or her lawyer, he or she had a right to request another lawyer, at his own expense.', '22. On 16 June 2005 the applicant was provided with a State-appointed lawyer, D., to assist him in the proceedings before the Daugavpils Court. On the same day D. familiarised himself with the case file.', '23. On 17 June 2005 a hearing was held before the Daugavpils Court. The applicant asked the court to ensure the attendance of several witnesses. D. maintained that application. The next hearing was fixed for 1 September 2005.', '24. On 20 June 2005 the applicant wrote a letter to D. and asked why he had agreed to represent him, given their “unpleasant” first meeting during which D. had indicated his intention to refuse to act as the applicant’s counsel. The applicant also asked D. to guarantee that he would persuade the trial court to order three new measures in order to obtain evidence. According to the applicant, the following measures would prove his innocence in relation to the murder charge: searches of other unspecified witnesses, polygraph testing, and another psychiatric examination. The applicant stated that if D. did not wish to defend him, then he had the opportunity to withdraw from the case, which would provide a satisfying solution for them both. However, if D. acted in the same way as his previous defence lawyer, the applicant would ask the trial court to discharge D. from his duties.', '25. On 1 September 2005 the applicant submitted several written applications to the Daugavpils Court. He asked for the criminal case to be remitted to the prosecutor’s office in order to rectify the bill of indictment by changing his motive for the alleged offence. The court dismissed the application, as it had not yet started its adjudication or assessment of the evidence. The court further dismissed the applicant’s second application to end his pre-trial detention. As regards a third application to examine evidence concerning the scene of the crime and search other unspecified witnesses, the court decided to postpone examination of those requests until the end of its adjudication. In that regard, it noted that all defence witnesses had been summoned to the hearing. The court then dismissed the applicant’s application for another forensic medical examination on the grounds that one had already been carried out in November 2004. All the applications were dealt with at a hearing and the applicant was present when the relevant decisions were announced.', '26. During the hearing, D. reserved his comments as regards the applicant’s application to call other unspecified witnesses and have a new indictment, on the grounds that those were matters to be examined at the end of court’s adjudication. He supported the applicant’s application for additional psychiatric examination and the attendance of all the defence and prosecution witnesses summoned to the trial. With regard to the applicant’s other application, D. stated that it was at the court’s discretion.', '27. In his subsequent written application (“a refusal” (отвод)), the applicant relied on Article 99 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and asked the court to release D. from his duties. In that application, the applicant referred to his letter to D. dated 20 June 2005 (see paragraph 24 above), to which the applicant had expected a favourable response, but to which D. had not responded. The written application stated that the applicant was refusing the services of D. on the grounds that all applications made to the court on 1 September 2005 had been drafted by the applicant, and D. had not shown any interest in asking the court to order the examination of witness statements about the scene of the crime, new psychiatric expert evidence, or the correction of the motive in the bill of indictment. D. had merely supported the above applications.', 'At the end of the written application the applicant asked the Daugavpils Court to provide him with another State-appointed lawyer who would carry out his function in compliance with Article 97 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '28. In reply to the applicant’s application, D. presented the applicant’s letter of 20 June 2005 to the court and invited it to establish whether the applicant needed a lawyer at all. In reply to a question put by the court, the applicant could not name a lawyer to be provided for him.', '29. On the same day the Daugavpils Court decided to uphold the applicant’s application to release D. from his duties and rejected his application for appointment of another legal aid lawyer. It noted that the applicant had declined the services of D. because the latter could not guarantee that he would be acquitted, and the applicant had been of the opinion that D. had not adequately defended him. Daugavpils Court dismissed the applicant’s application on the grounds that he had twice been provided with a lawyer and had twice refused their services. Under Article 96 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a lawyer was appointed by a court and not chosen by an accused himself. In accordance with Article 99, an accused had the right to waive his or her right to legal assistance, but no right to request replacement of a lawyer. According to the Daugavpils Court, the applicant’s refusal of D.’s services had been unjustified, and meant that he did not wish to have a legal aid lawyer at all. The court stated that the applicant was seeking to delay the proceedings.', '30. From 1 September 2005 onwards the applicant did not have legal assistance in the first-instance proceedings.', '31. During the hearing of 1 September 2005, when invited by the court to put questions to witnesses, he refused to do so, stating each time that he would either ask questions when represented by a lawyer or not ask questions at all. At the applicant’s request, the Daugavpils Court adjourned the hearing to summon other absent witnesses.', '32. During the hearing of 24 October 2005 the applicant, referring to section 71 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Kriminālprocesa likums) (see paragraph 53 below), asked the court to ensure that his defence rights were respected. His earlier applications to replace the two State-appointed lawyers could not be construed as a waiver of his right to legal assistance; he had refused the assistance because of a “disagreement” and a “failure to provide legal assistance”. The applicant asked the court to provide him with a list of lawyers and a means of communicating with them, or, in the alternative, to ensure that he was assisted by one of the two lawyers he named. The court explained that the applicant’s application for a lawyer had been decided on 1 September 2005. It adjourned the hearing in order to summon absent witnesses.', '33. During the next hearing on 17 November 2005 the applicant alleged that at least thirty people had been present when the alleged crime had taken place, but only eight of them had been called as witnesses. He therefore asked the court to identify the other witnesses. In reply to a question put by the court, the applicant confessed that he had stabbed the victim, but stated that he had not intended to kill him. At the applicant’s request, the Daugavpils Court adjourned the hearing, giving him time to give evidence and to submit a list of defence witnesses.', '34. On 21 November 2005 Judge Z. of the Daugavpils Court sent the applicant a list of lawyers practising in Daugavpils whom the applicant could contact in order to obtain a legal consultation. He noted that the case file contained no evidence pertaining to the applicant’s status as a person of low income, and that the applicant would be provided with a State-appointed lawyer at appeal stage if the case were to reach it.', '35. At a hearing on 12 January 2006 the Daugavpils Court examined several applications lodged by the applicant. As regards another application for appointment of a lawyer, the court held that the matter had previously been decided and could not be re-examined. During the same hearing the Daugavpils Court verified that the applicant had duly received the document setting out the charges against him. The court upheld the applicant’s application for an adjournment, and adjourned the hearing to give him time to prepare for the arguments in court.', '36. On 31 January 2006 the prosecutor amended the charges against the applicant by changing the motive of the crime to, “acting with no reason, being guided by hooligan tendencies”.', '37. On 6 February 2006 the Daugavpils Court found the applicant guilty of murder. The court noted that the applicant had partly admitted his guilt during the preliminary investigation in saying that he had stabbed the victim, but claiming that he had not intended to murder him. The court went on to refer to the evidence of seven witnesses who had been in the immediate vicinity of the incident. The court did not have any doubts as regards the applicant’s intent. He had stabbed the victim in the chest and had himself testified that he had aimed to stab the victim in the left part of his chest. All the witnesses, except one, had confirmed that the applicant had stabbed the victim after the fight had ended. The applicant had had no need to defend himself, because the victim had been unarmed and had not posed any threat to him. On the contrary, the victim had not taken part in the fight at all, but had wanted to stop it. The court dismissed as unreliable the evidence of an eyewitness who had been transported to a hearing and detained with the applicant.', '38. In addition, the court relied on documentary evidence, such as the conclusions of the forensic psychiatric examination. The applicant was sentenced to twelve years’ imprisonment.', '39. As regards the applicant’s right to legal aid assistance, the court observed that he had twice refused the services of State-appointed lawyers. The Code of Criminal Procedure, as in force on 1 September 2005, did not provide for the right of an accused to decline the services of a lawyer. The court further dismissed the applicant’s allegation that the State-appointed lawyers had not provided him with adequate legal assistance. At that point, the court had not yet started to hear the evidence. In addition, the applicant had wanted the lawyers to guarantee that he would be acquitted, and had referred to their performance in cases where they had assisted other individuals. The court also noted that witnesses had twice been called to testify, once following an application by the applicant, who had then refused to put any questions to them, arguing that he had not been granted a lawyer.', '40. On 26 February 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal, which he supplemented on 26 March 2006. He submitted that his defence rights had been violated and asked the Latgale Regional Court (Latgales apgabaltiesa) to call all the witnesses, without providing any reason for that application. He stated that he needed a lawyer at an appeal hearing, and asked for an opportunity to meet him or her prior to the appeal hearing to agree on a defence strategy.', '41. On 11 May 2006 the applicant was provided with a State-appointed lawyer, M.', '42. At a hearing on 17 May 2006 the applicant was assisted by M. He and M. asked the court to adjourn the hearing, stating that more time was needed in order to prepare a defence. The hearing was adjourned until 8 November 2006.', '43. On 8 November 2006 the applicant was represented by a State-appointed lawyer, V. At a hearing held on the same day the court read out witness statements and the applicant did not raise any objections to the statements in substance. When invited to ask questions, the applicant asked the court to call all the witnesses who had testified before the first-instance court again, in addition to some other witnesses. His application was on the grounds that he had twice refused legal assistance as a result of the different opinions of his lawyers about the conduct of his defence. The court dismissed that application, because the applicant had not made it in his appeal.', '44. On 8 November 2006 the Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal and upheld the first-instance judgment. The appellate court noted that there were no discrepancies in the witness testimonies and they were concordant with the applicant’s testimonies. It also noted that it was the applicant who had started the fight and demonstrated a readiness to use a knife against an unarmed victim, therefore no question of self-defence arose.', '45. As to the fairness of the proceedings, the Regional Court found that the first-instance court had afforded the applicant an opportunity to choose a lawyer and exercise his defence rights. Referring to the reasoning of the first-instance court, the Regional Court agreed that his refusal to accept the services of the two lawyers had been unjustified. Having examined the content of the applicant’s submissions, applications and complaints in the criminal proceedings, it did not find that any of the conditions of section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Law had been fulfilled. The appellate court concluded that the applicant had been able to defend himself. The first-instance court had called the witnesses twice, however the applicant had refused to put any questions to them, citing unfounded excuses.', '46. On 13 December 2006 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the aforementioned decision with the Criminal Cases Division of the Senate of the Supreme Court (Augstākās tiesas Senāta Krimināllietu departaments). He made a complaint regarding the quality of the legal services provided by the State-appointed lawyers and the decision of the first-instance court to deprive him of legal assistance.', '47. In addition, the applicant alleged that his guilt could have been “mitigated” if he had been given a psychiatric assessment and polygraph testing, and if additional defence witnesses had been questioned. He also complained in a general manner that neither of the lower courts had granted him permission to put questions to the witnesses.', '48. On 16 January 2007 the Senate of the Supreme Court refused to consider the applicant’s appeal.']",[],[],[],['6'],"['6-1', '6-3']",['6-3-c'],0

The applicant, Mr Seyit Rüfai Deniz, is a Turkish national who was born in 1964 and lives in Ankara. He was represented before the Court by Mr M.N. Eldem, a lawyer practising in Ankara.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '3. At the time of the events giving rise to the application, the applicant worked as a teacher at a state school in Ankara.', '4. On 20 November 2008 a disciplinary investigation was started against the applicant following allegations that he did not have the book of guidelines for teachers to hand during a class inspection, that he did not prepare lesson plans and that he had addressed his hierarchical superior using the secondperson singular instead of the second-person plural, which is deemed more acceptable for the purposes of politeness in the Turkish language.', '5. On 4 December 2008, the applicant was requested to submit his defence statements against those allegations. On 15 December 2008, the applicant submitted, inter alia, that he should not be held responsible for not having the book of guidelines for teachers since it had been the school administration’s responsibility to supply the teachers with the necessary materials and the administration had failed to do so. Concerning lesson plans, he stated that there had not been an obligation on his part to prepare them. He also submitted that he had not addressed the principal in the second person singular.', '6. On 29 December 2008, the applicant received a disciplinary sanction in the form of a reprimand in respect of those allegations pursuant to section 125(B) of the Civil Servants Act.', '7. On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an objection with the Directorate of the Ministry of Education, asking for the reprimand to be revoked. This was dismissed on 13 January 2009, in a decision which was not amenable to judicial review.', '8. On 24 September 2014, at the applicant’s request, the reprimand was removed from the applicant’s service records pursuant to section 133 of the Civil Servants Act.', '9. A full description of the relevant domestic law at the material time can be found in Karaçay v. Turkey (no. 6615/03, §§ 14-16, 27 March 2007) and İsmail Sezer v. Turkey (no. 36807/07, §§ 14-19, 24 March 2015).', '10. Section 125 of the Civil Servants Act catalogues certain acts and misconduct according to the disciplinary sanction to which they give rise. Accordingly, section 125(B) defines blameworthy behaviour in carrying out tasks or orders in an incomplete or late fashion, or not carrying out the necessary procedure or failing to maintain, properly use or care for official equipment as misconduct requiring a reprimand, whereas section 125(C) defines the same behaviour, when it is deliberate, as misconduct that requires the sanction of salary reduction. Section 125(B) defines being disrespectful to a superior while on duty as an act that requires a reprimand, whereas section 125(C) defines speaking disrespectfully to a superior as an act that requires the sanction of salary reduction. Likewise section 125(D) punishes any display of humiliating behaviour towards a superior with deferral of promotion to a higher rank for a minimum of one year and a maximum of three years. Furthermore, a civil servant will receive a heavier sanction if he repeats misconduct for which he has previously received a disciplinary sanction during the period for which the sanction remains on his service record. Finally, the list of acts and misconduct in section 125 is not exhaustive in so far as it is provided that acts comparable to those listed under this section will be punished with a disciplinary sanction appropriate to the gravity of the offence.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

POLAND,4,Inadmissible,András Sajó;Egidijus Kūris;Iulia Motoc;Krzysztof Wojtyczek;Nona Tsotsoria;Paulo Pinto De Albuquerque;Gabriele Kucsko-Stadlmayer,"['1. A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix.', '2', '3. The applicants are the owners, co-owners or perpetual lessees of estates on which various types of utility grids, substations or equipment were installed between the 1950s and 1980s. In respect of at least twenty-two of the thirty-three applications, the utilities were set up prior to the acquisition of the land by the applicants.', '4. Until 1989, the installations in question belonged to the State Treasury (various State utility enterprises). They are currently owned by different utility companies which are the legal successors of the State enterprises. In thirty-one cases, the current owners are commercial joint-stock companies controlled by the State Treasury as the largest shareholder. In the two remaining applications, the utility equipment belongs to State companies (see Annex 1; applications nos. 8585/13 and 28531/14).', '5. Since the date of their installation, the utility grids, substations and equipment have been accessed, maintained and used by the utility companies without any interruption or disputes with legal consequences. The applicants either live on the estates in question or use them for agriculture or manufacturing purposes. Their use of the parts of the land where the utility grids or equipment have been placed is to a greater or lesser extent restricted. Under the applicable law, access to areas directly under, over or around utility stations, pipes, poles or other equipment cannot be hindered; in particular, it cannot be blocked by vegetation or buildings.', '6. On various dates the applicants became parties to various civil proceedings aimed at regulating the legal status of the utility installations on their estates.', '7. Twenty-one applicants (application nos. 36350/13; 49800/13; 50041/13; 63957/13; 14891/14; 14934/14; 31089/14; 46099/14; 47538/14; 54240/14; 56980/14; 70263/14; 78040/14; 18939/15; 20670/15; 21667/15; 24271/15; 41154/15; 45573/15; 45619/15 and 48023/15), sought compensation for the resulting restriction of their property rights. They brought actions either for compensation for the establishment of a transmission easement (o ustalenie służebności przesyłu) (for the applicable domestic law, see paragraphs 28-31 below) or compensation for non-contractual use of land (o bezumowne korzystanie z nieruchomości) (for the applicable domestic law, see paragraphs 32-35 below). Some of those actions were accompanied by a claim to remove the utility equipment considered cumbersome.', '8. Two applicants (application nos. 52591/13 and 55666/13) did not seek payment and instead brought actions exclusively for restitution of the owner’s lawful position and for the removal of the utility equipment in question (for the applicable domestic law, see paragraph 36 below).', '9. The remaining ten applicants (application nos. 8585/13; 13512/13; 42258/13; 44773/13; 52143/13; 22059/14; 28482/14; 28531/14; 36799/14 and 20818/15) did not bring any actions and were respondents in proceedings resulting from actions for easements by prescription (o zasiedzenie służebności) lodged by relevant utility companies (for the applicable domestic law, see paragraphs 37-40 below).', '10. In respect of thirty applicants (application nos.: 8585/13; 13512/13; 42258/13; 44773/13; 49800/13; 50041/13; 52143/13 52591/13; 55666/13; 63957/13; 14891/14; 14934/14; 22059/14; 28482/14; 28531/14; 36799/14; 47538/14; 54240/14; 56980/14; 70263/14; 78040/14; 18939/15; 20670/15; 20818/15; 21667/15; 24271/15; 41154/15; 45573/15; 45619/15 and 48023/15), the domestic courts delivered judgments concluding that the companies which ran the utility installations on the applicants’ estates had acquired the easements in question by prescription. Accordingly, it was held that the applicants concerned were either not entitled to claim compensation for past or future use of the utility grids or to seek the removal of the electrical equipment from their land.', '11. In most of these cases, the courts of first instance initially ruled in favour of the applicants. Those decisions were later reversed by the higher courts.', '12. The proceedings involving each of these applicants are described in more detail in Annex 1, and the applicable domestic law and practice are set out at paragraphs 37-58 below.', '13. In respect of three applicants (applications nos. 36350/13, 31089/14 and 46099/14), the domestic courts held that their property rights had been lawfully restricted by historical administrative decisions which had been issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act (see paragraphs 20 and 21 below).', '14. Further details about those proceedings and the applicable domestic law and practice are set out in Annex 2 and at paragraphs 48-56 below.', '15. In the case of Mr Jędrzejczyk (no. 45573/15; see Annex 1), the applicant co-owns with his wife, among others, five adjacent plots of agricultural land in Potok and Kolonia Grudzień (lot nos. 802 and 804PT1O/00007612/7 and PT1O/00024160/8 and lot nos. 278, 147/3 and 319 – 9PT1O/00023818/9). Title to the land in question was acquired in 1992, 1994, 1997 and 1985 respectively. In 1962 an overhead electrical grid with a number of electrical poles was installed across it.', '16. In 2010 the applicant rejected a friendly settlement proposal made by PGE, the owner of the electrical grid. In March 2012 he sued the company for compensation for non-contractual use of his land, claiming PLN 200,000 (approximately EUR 50,000).', '17. On 20 May 2014 the Piotrków Trybunalski Regional Court gave the first-instance judgment in the case. On 9 March 2015 the Łódź Court of Appeal partially allowed the applicant’s action. The court, granting an objection raised by the respondent, held that the utility company had acquired the easement for the electrical grids on the applicant’s lot nos. 804, 319 and 147/3 by prescription in 1985. That date was determined in view of the entry into force of the 1965 Civil Code and the statutory requirement of twenty years’ possession if it was, as in the case at hand, in bad faith. Consequently, the applicant could not claim remuneration for the use of the land since the date of prescription of the easement. In respect of the remaining two lots, the court held that the prescription period had not elapsed because, until 1997 and 1979 respectively, the State had been the landowner not possessor. In view of those considerations, the applicant was awarded PLN 41 (approximately EUR 10) on account of the utility company’s non-contractual use of lot nos. 802 and 278 between April 2002 and July 2009. This amount was in line with the calculation put forward by a court-appointed expert.', '18. The process of rural electrification in Poland was regulated by the Public Electrification of Villages and Settlements Act of 28 June 1950 (Ustawa o powszechnej elektryfikacji wsi i osiedli), in force from 6 July 1950 until 5 December 1997. Similar processes concerning other utilities were regulated primarily by the Water Act (Prawo Wodne) of 30 May 1963, 24 October 1974 and 18 July 2001.', '19. Currently, most of these matters are regulated by the Energy Act (Prawo Energetyczne) of 10 April 1997, which entered into force on 5 December 1997, the Water Act (Prawo Wodne) of 16 December 2016, which entered into force on 31 December 2015, and by European Union law.', '20. The entitlement of State enterprises to access private estates in order to install and run various overhead or underground drainage, sewage, water or gas pipelines and electricity grids, substations or other similar equipment was originally regulated by the Expropriation Rules and Procedure Act of 12 March 1958 (Ustawa o zasadach i trybie wywłaszczania nieruchomości – “the 1958 Act”), in force until 1985.', '21. Section 35 required State energy enterprises to obtain authorisation from the local administrative authority to gain access to private estates for the purpose of laying pipelines or installing electric poles and substations.', '22. Under Section 36 of the 1958 Act, a landowner was entitled to claim compensation for damage resulting from the installation or maintenance of equipment or lines. Examples of such damage were loss of harvest or a decrease in the value of the property due to the installation of the utility grid or equipment. Entitlement to compensation did not arise, however, from restrictions on the use of the land if no damage occurred.', '23. From 1 August 1985 until 31 December 1997 these matters were regulated in a similar way by section 70 (et seq.) of the Land Administration and Expropriation Act of 29 April 1985 (Ustawa o gospodarce gruntami i wywłaszczeniu nieruchomości) Since 1 January 1998 they have been regulated by section 124 (et seq.) of the Land Administration Act of 21 August 1997 (Ustawa o gospodarce nieruchomościami). Under the provisions currently in force, a landowner is entitled to compensation not only for damage caused by the installation or maintenance of the grid, but also for granting access to the land and any related depreciation in value (sections 124 and 128).', '24. Applications for such compensation must be lodged with the relevant administrative authorities and are not examined by the civil courts (Article 2 § 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure and the Supreme Court’s (Sąd Najwyższy) decision of 15 March 1983 (IV CZ 15/83) and judgment of 9 March 2007 (II CSK 457/06)). Civil courts, however, retain jurisdiction in respect of actions for compensation if the alleged damage has been caused by activities beyond the scope of a relevant administrative decision and for non-contractual use of the land (the Supreme Court’s judgments of 24 June 2010 (IV CSK 554/09) and 9 March 2007, cited above).', '25. Prior to 2008, the legal status of the parts of private land burdened by utility installations was regulated under the civil law only by analogy, originally to easements by necessity (służebność drogi koniecznej) under Article 145 of the Civil Code, which entered into force in 1965, and ultimately to land easements (służebność gruntowa) under Articles 285-295 of the Civil Code.', '26. The former approach is illustrated by the Supreme Court’s resolutions of 3 June 1965 (no. III CO 34/65) and 30 August 1991 (no. III CZP 73/91), adopted by a bench of three judges.', '27. The latter practice was triggered by the Supreme Court’s resolution of 17 January 2003 (no. III CZP 79/02), adopted by a bench of three judges, authorising the establishment of a land easement by means of a contract for the benefit of an energy company which owned a utility grid on a property. This practice was further developed by the Supreme Court’s decision of 8 September 2006 (II CSK 112/06), authorising the energy company which owned a utility grid to acquire a land easement by prescription. In that decision, the Supreme Court applied the existing provisions beyond the traditional relationship between the two owners of estates, dominant and servient. It was reasoned that in general, a utility company owned estates which could be considered as benefiting from the easement. In this broad sense, a utility company could be viewed as the owner of a dominant estate within the meaning of the applicable provisions on land easements. It was therefore not required to identify a specific estate as dominant.', '28. Transmissions easements (służebność przesyłu) are limited property rights introduced in Poland by the Civil Code and Other Acts Amendment Act of 30 May 2008, which entered into force on 3 August 2008 (Ustawa o zmianie ustawy - Kodeks cywilny oraz niektórych innych ustaw – “the 2008 Amendment Act”). Under Article 3051 of the Civil Code, a utility company (which owns a utility grid or equipment and is responsible for the supply and distribution of electric energy or other utilities to a given area) is entitled to enter onto and use property owned by a third party in a specific manner to run a sewage or gas pipeline or a utility grid situated on the land. The landowner, in turn, is restricted in his right to use the servient part of the estate.', '29. Under Article 3052 of the Civil Code, the landowner and the utility company shall establish a transmission easement either by means of a contract or a court action. Just compensation (wynagrodzenie) is payable for the easement from the moment of its establishment for the future.', '30. Lodging a court action for a transmission easement interrupts the running of the prescription period (Article 123 of the Civil Code and the Supreme Court’s resolution of 21 January 2011 (III CZP 124/10) and decision of 13 October 2011 (V CSK 502/10)).', '31. Article 3054 of the Civil Code provides that transmission easements are further regulated, in so far as applicable, by the provisions on land easements.', '32. The owner or perpetual lessee of land with a utility installation is also entitled to seek compensation from a utility company if the latter has possession in bad faith, in the form of an action for compensation for non-contractual use of land (o bezumowne korzystanie z nieruchomości) under Article 225 in conjunction with Article 224 of the Civil Code (in force without amendment since 1 January 1965). Such compensation can only be claimed for use of the land from the date on which the possessor was informed of the owner’s claim for compensation until the date of the court’s ruling and as long as an easement has not been established (the Supreme Court’s judgment of 7 August 2014 (II CSK 573/13)). The limitation period for such claims is ten years (Article 118 of the Civil Code).', '33. The landowner or perpetual lessee has a claim even if he or she acquired the land in full knowledge that it was encumbered by a utility installation (the Supreme Court’s judgment of 4 July 2012 (ICSK 641/11)).', '34. Prior to the 2008 amendments, introducing the paid transmission easement, the lodging of such a court action against a utility company interrupted the running of the prescription period. Since then, an action under Article 225 of the Civil Code ceased to have the same effect (the Supreme Court’s resolution of 26 November 2014, adopted by seven judges (III ZP 45/14)).', '35. The criteria for the calculation of the compensation awarded under Article 225 of the Civil Code was laid down by the Supreme Court in its resolutions of 17 June 2005 (III CZP 29/05) and 10 July 1984 (III CZP 20/84), adopted by a bench of three and seven judges respectively. The compensation must be commensurate with the degree of interference with the plaintiff’s property rights and must not, in the long run, flagrantly exceed the value of the part of the land encumbered by the utility installation. The Supreme Court accepted that consequently, the amount of annual compensation awarded was likely to be insignificant.', '36. Pursuant to Article 222 § 2 of the Civil Code (in force without amendment since 1 January 1965), a property owner has the right to claim restitution of his or her lawful position and discontinuation of infringements against anyone who infringes his ownership other than by depriving him or her of actual control of the property. There is no limitation period for such claims if they relate to immovable property (Article 223 of the Civil Code). Such actions can, but do not have to, be accompanied by a claim for compensation (o zapłatę) for past use of the property without legal title (see the Supreme Court’s resolution of 17 June 2005, cited above).', 'The lodging of such a court action interrupts the running of the prescription period (Article 123 of the Civil Code).', 'Such an action will not be allowed if the defendant has legal title to the property in question or has acquired it through prescription or adverse possession. Moreover, a landowner who acquired property which had in the past been lawfully encumbered by a utility installation is not entitled to seek its removal (the Supreme Court’s judgments of 13 January 2011 (III CSK 85/10) and 29 January 2008 (IV CSK 410/07).', '37. The general rules concerning easements by prescription (zasiedzenie służebności) are contained in Article 292 of the Civil Code and in the provisions on adverse possession of property (zasiedzenie własności nieruchomości) contained in Articles 172-176 of the Civil Code (amended in 1990).', '38. Under these provisions, an easement by prescription arises through the uninterrupted use of permanent and visible equipment by an autonomous possessor (owner-like possessor) without the permission of the landowner. In the event of possession in good faith (where use of the equipment has been open and notorious), the statutory prescription period was ten years prior to the 1990 amendment and is currently twenty years. In the event of possession in bad faith (where use of the equipment has been concealed or secretive), the applicable statutory period was twenty years prior to the 1990 amendment and is currently thirty years (Article 172 of the Civil Code).', '39. Under Article 176 of the Civil Code, if during the running of the prescription period possession has been transferred from one autonomous possessor to another, the new possessor must include the period of possession by his predecessor.', '40. A domestic court can rule on prescription in the event of an action for establishment of prescription (Article 609 of the Code of Civil Procedure) or in the course of other proceedings, if such an objection has been made by a party. A domestic court cannot rule on prescription of its own motion.', '41. Since the 2008 amendments, the following approach has been developed by the domestic courts in cases concerning easements for utility grids and equipment.', 'If possession of the part of the land with a utility grid reached the necessary prescription period after 2008, when the legal concept of a transmission easement was created, the domestic courts established prescription of the transmission easement. If, however, the end of the statutory prescription period fell on a date prior to the entry into force of the 2008 amendments, the domestic courts came up with the legal concept of a “land easement corresponding in its content to a transmission easement” (służebność gruntowa odpowiadająca w swojej treści służebności przesyłu) and accordingly, ruled on the prescription of such an easement.', '42. In practice, most of the civil actions concerning transmission easements lodged under Article 3051 of the Civil Code sought to regulate the status of historical utility grids and equipment. They therefore resulted in the establishment by prescription of land easements corresponding to transmission easements and, resulting from it, refusal to grant any payment to the owner of the servient estate.', '43. In its resolution of 7 October 2008 (no. III CZP 89/08), adopted by a bench of three judges, the Supreme Court held that prior to the enactment of provisions on transmission easements (Articles 3051-3054 of the Civil Code; see paragraphs 28–31 above) it had been possible to acquire by prescription a land easement corresponding in its content to a transmission easement. It was reasoned that the content of the land easement was essentially the right to use servient property in connection with the activities of the company which benefited from the easement. In the resolution the Supreme Court cited its earlier case-law on the possession of utility grids and on land easements. In particular, it referred to its 2003 resolution and 2006 decision (described in paragraph 27 above).', '44. This approach was further confirmed by the Supreme Court in its resolutions of 9 August 2011 (III CZP 10/11) and 22 May 2013 (III CZP 18/13), adopted by a bench of seven and three judges respectively; and in its judgment of 12 December 2008 (II CSK 389/08) and decisions of 26 July 2012 (II CSK 752/11), 18 April 2012 ( V CSK 190/11), 6 July 2011 (CSK 157/11) and 5 June 2009 (I CSK 392/08).', '45. Moreover, in its judgment of 12 January 2012 (II CSK 258/11), the Supreme Court held that in the event of prescription of an easement for a utility grid or equipment, the owner of servient land could not claim compensation for the easement.', '46. Apart from the above-mentioned approach, the domestic case-law concerning transmission easements has not been uniform. Early on, the lower and higher courts diverged, among other things, on the issue of the possession of utility easements by State enterprises prior to 1989. Over time, this area has become harmonised by the Supreme Court.', '47. It was therefore accepted that, if during the running of the prescription period possession of an easement had been transferred from a State enterprise to a utility company, the new possessor was entitled to include the period of possession by its predecessor prior to 1989 in the calculation of the statutory prescription period for the company’s easement. It was reasoned that prior to 1989, when the principle of uniform State ownership (zasada jednolitej własności państwowej) was abolished, the State Treasury had installed and run utility grids as part of its economic activities under its mandate as a State legal entity and the owner of State property and not as a superior governor in the exercise of its imperial powers. Moreover, the State Treasury at that time only had factual control (władztwo faktyczne) and operational management (zarząd operatywny) of utility grids and equipment. That corresponded to the activities of a limited-right possessor and not an owner-like possessor. Consequently, control over a utility grid of the predecessor of the claimant utility company could result in the prescription of a land easement for the benefit of the current possessor.', 'This view has been expressed in the following case-law of the Supreme Court: its judgments of 31 May 2006 (IV CSK 149/05) and 15 January 2009, adopted by a bench of seven judges (I CSK 333/07); its judgment of 10 May 2013 (I CSK 495/12); and decisions of 17 December 2008 (I CSK 171/08), 13 October 2011 (V CSK 502/10), 12 January 2012 (IV CSK 183/11), 13 June 2013 (IV CSK 627/12), 20 September 2013 (II CSK 10/13) and 18 June 2014 (V CSK 405/13). The opposite opinion was held by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 9 December 2009, adopted by a bench of three judges (IV CSK 291/09).', '48. Another discrepancy occurred in so far as the domestic courts, including the Supreme Court, initially drew different conclusions from the existence of historical administrative decisions which had been issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act in order to authorise the installation of utility grids and equipment on particular private estates (see paragraph 21 above).', '49. In cases in which an administrative decision under Section 35 of the 1958 Act had not been issued or in cases in which that element was left undetermined, the domestic courts generally ruled consistently. They held that a claimant utility company who had for a sufficiently long period exercised autonomous possession of an easement for a utility installation had acquired it by prescription. In all such cases, the domestic courts also refused to grant any compensation to the owner of the servient estate.', '50. This line of case-law is illustrated by the Supreme Court’s case-law described in paragraphs 41-45 above and, further, by the domestic court decisions delivered in the proceedings giving rise to the following twenty applications lodged with the Court: no. 8585/13; 13512/13; 42258/13; 49800/13; 50041/13; 52143/13; 52591/13; 55666/13; 63957/13; 14934/14; 56980/14; 70263/14; 18939/15; 20670/15; 20818/15; 21667/15; 24271/15; 45573/15; 45619/15 and 48023/15 (see Annex 1).', '51. In cases in which it was revealed that the installation of a utility grid or equipment had been authorised by an administrative decision issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act, some domestic courts still granted easements by prescription; others refused to do so. Either way, the domestic civil courts also decided not to allow claims for compensation to the servient land’s owner for the restriction of his property rights.', '52. The former approach was taken by the Supreme Court in its decision of 17 December 2008 (I CSK 171/08). It held that the restriction of property rights by means of a binding administrative decision issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act (in that particular case, in 1977), was to be considered a “public easement” or a “transmission easement”. Consequently, in the Supreme Court’s view, prescription of a transmission easement was possible; the period of use of the electrical grid by the legal predecessor of its current owner could be calculated towards the statutory prescription period and the administrative decision in question made the use of the grid lawful, hence in good faith. This view was further upheld by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 9 December 2009 (IV CSK 291/09) and decision of 21 February 2013 (I CSK 354/12).', '53. The domestic court decisions delivered in the course of the proceedings in the following ten applications lodged with the Court illustrate the above-mentioned line of case-law: no. 44773/13; 14891/14; 22059/14; 28482/14; 28531/14; 36799/14; 47538/14; 54240/14; 78040/14; and no. 41154/15 (see Annex 1).', '54. The latter, opposite approach was expressed for the first time in the Supreme Court’s resolution of 8 April 2014 (III CZP 87/13), adopted by a bench of seven judges. It held that the enforcement of rights bestowed by a decision issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act did not lead to prescription of a land easement corresponding in its content to a transmission easement. The Supreme Court observed that the decision of a relevant local administrative authority issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act to authorise construction and maintenance of a utility grid on private land had the character of an expropriation decision. Consequently, it did not create an easement but permanent legal title which determined the content or particular restriction of a property right. Unlike the right to an easement, such a restriction had a public-law character as it was derived from the act of law and from a related administrative decision.', 'The Supreme Court also expressly stated that the claims of utility companies which could not prove title for taking over and using private land were beyond the subject matter of that resolution.', '55. This line of case-law was relied on by the domestic courts in the proceedings which gave rise to the following three applications lodged with the Court: no. 36350/13; 31089/14 and 46099/14 (see Annex 2).', '56. Irrespective of the issue of prescription of easement, the Supreme Court consistently ruled that a decision issued under Section 35 of the 1958 Act constituted legal title for a utility company to permanently use the estate identified in such a decision. In consequence, no claims for compensation for the authorised use of the land by such a utility company could be made under the civil law because it was lawful. Compensation could only be sought under the administrative law (the Supreme Court’s resolution of 20 January 2010 (III CZP 116/09), adopted by a bench of three judges and judgments of 9 January 2008 (II CSK 432/07) and 9 March 2007, cited above).', '57. The divergent practice as described above gave rise to a question of law (pytanie prawne) as to whether Article 292 taken in conjunction with Articles 172 and 285 of the Civil Code, in so far as it provided a legal basis for the establishment by prescription of a land easement corresponding in its content to a transmission easement for the benefit of a utility company, was in compliance with the Constitution and with Article 1 of the Protocol No. 1 to the Convention.', '58. On 17 July 2014 the Constitutional Court (Trybunał Konstytucyjny) held that it was beyond its mandate to pronounce on a question of law which in fact concerned the interpretation given to the law by the courts of general jurisdiction (P 28/13). It was observed that the Constitutional Court was entitled to rule on the constitutionality of a provision which gained particular judicial interpretation but only if that interpretation was obviously settled through uniform and authoritative practice of the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court. In the Constitutional Court’s view, the uniform practice of granting prescription of land easement corresponding in its content to a transmission easement (as described in paragraphs 41-45 above), was disrupted by the 2014 resolution of the Supreme Court (III CZP 87/13) (see paragraph 54 above). Consequently, it was held that in the current situation, the applicable law was not implemented in an uncontestably uniform manner.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1958 and lives in Leipzig.', '7. On 30 October 2009 the Munich II Public Prosecution Office charged the applicant with coercion to engage in sexual activity in at least 300 cases and with sexual coercion in another eighteen cases.', '8. On 20 July 2012 the Munich II Regional Court, after taking evidence at seventeen days of hearing, issued a decision limiting the prosecution to charges concerning four incidents which had taken place between 19 and 25 August 2007. The court provisionally discontinued the proceedings in respect of all the other offences the applicant had been charged with (see paragraph 7 above), in accordance with Article 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 17 below), in view of the penalty the applicant could expect for the four remaining incidents. The applicant was further informed that if he was convicted the court could take into account findings made in respect of the other incidents when setting his sentence.', '9. In a judgment delivered on the same day, the Regional Court convicted the applicant of four counts of coercion to engage in sexual activity, committed between 19 and 25 August 2007, and sentenced him to six years’ imprisonment.', '10. In its findings of fact, the Regional Court stated that between January 2001 and October 2007 the applicant had forced P., aged between 29 and 35 at the relevant time and suffering from a moderate mental disorder and an autistic and speech disorder, to satisfy him manually or orally on at least fifty further occasions (out of the at least 300 offences the applicant had initially been charged with, see paragraph 7 above). The court had regard to P.’s extensive description of different incidents, which happened either in the house the applicant and P. were both living in or in the applicant’s car. P. had notably explained how the applicant had regularly, when his wife and son were absent, brought her into his apartment or in the basement boiler room, had undressed himself and had instructed her how to satisfy him, partly while playing pornographic films. The applicant had systematically threatened P. that she would have to return to a home for the disabled if she did not comply with his requests. From 19 to 25 August 2007, when the applicant’s wife and son were on holiday, the applicant had forced P. to satisfy him orally at least twice and to satisfy him manually on two further occasions in their house or in the basement boiler room. The veracity of P.´s consistent statements was confirmed by further witnesses and three psychological expert opinions on P.´s credibility and ability to testify.', '11. The Regional Court explained that it had restricted the conviction to the four events that had taken place between 19 and 25 August 2007. It had discontinued the proceedings in respect of the at least 300 further charges under Article 154 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure but was convinced that in at least fifty cases there had been incidents comparable to the four of which the applicant was formally convicted. It had simply been impossible to determine their exact time and place due to the victim’s speech disorder.', '12. In the impugned passages of the judgment, the Regional Court found as follows:', '“The chamber is convinced on the basis of the credible statement by the injured party that in addition to the four cases between January 2001 and October 2007 on which judgment was passed, at least 50 other comparable cases occurred. The injured party herself said that the applicant had coerced her to perform sexual acts from as early as 2001. From 2003, the frequency of these incidents had increased and the applicant had demanded sexual gratification from her approximately every 1½ weeks. Even if one were to disregard the years 2001 and 2002 and August and October 2007 in favour of the applicant and also to presume that from 2003 onwards, such incidents occurred only once a month there are 56 cases. Following the deduction of a further safety margin the chamber assumes that there were at least 50 more, comparable cases during the total period from January 2001 to October 2007.', '...', 'On the other hand, the chamber considers as an aggravating element that it is convinced that, in addition to the four incidents in August 2007 which the accused has been convicted of, there have been at least 50 comparable incidents since January 2001. A conviction for those events was only made impossible by the victim’s incapacity to substantiate them in terms of the time and the place where they happened in a manner making it possible to define them as procedural offences (offences in the procedural sense). As it could no longer be determined with certainty in which cases the accused, by his threats, made the victim satisfy him orally or manually, the chamber will proceed on the basis that there were 50 further cases of manual satisfaction.”', '(“Die Kammer ist aufgrund der glaubhaften Aussage der Geschädigten davon überzeugt, dass es neben den vier abgeurteilten Taten im Zeitraum Januar 2001 bis Oktober 2007 zu mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren Fällen kam. Die Geschädigte selbst gab an, der Angeklagte habe sie bereits ab dem Jahr 2001 zu sexuellen Handlungen genötigt. Ab dem Jahr 2003 sei die Frequenz dieser Vorfälle gestiegen und der Angeklagte habe ungefähr alle 1 ½ Wochen sexuelle Befriedigung von ihr verlangt. Selbst wenn man zugunsten des Angeklagten die Jahr 2001 und 2002 sowie den August und Oktober 2007 unberücksichtigt lässt und zudem davon ausgeht, dass es ab dem Jahr 2003 lediglich einmal im Monat zu derartigen Vorfällen kam, so ergeben sich 56 Fälle. Nach Abzug eines weiteren Sicherheitsabschlags geht die Kammer von mindestens 50 weiteren, vergleichbaren Fällen im gesamten Zeitraum von Januar 2001 bis Oktober 2007 aus.', '...', 'Andererseits wertet die Kammer zu Lasten des Angeklagten den Umstand, dass es nach Überzeugung der Kammer neben den verurteilten vier Vorfällen im August 2007 bereits ab Januar 2001 zu mindestens 50 vergleichbaren Vorfällen gekommen war. Eine Verurteilung dieser Vorfälle scheiterte lediglich an der mangelnden Fähigkeit der Geschädigten, die Vorfälle zeitlich und örtlich so zu konkretisieren, dass diese als prozessuale Taten abgrenzbar waren. Da sich nicht mehr mit Sicherheit aufklären ließ, in welchen Fällen der Angeklagte die Geschädigte durch seine Drohung zu einer oralen und in welchen zu einer manuellen Befriedigung brachte, geht die Kammer insoweit von 50 weiteren Fällen der manuellen Befriedigung aus.”)', '13. In an appeal on points of law to the Federal Court of Justice, the applicant complained that the Regional Court had breached the presumption of innocence guaranteed by Article 6 § 2 of the Convention by taking fifty unproven incidents into account as an aggravating factor meriting a more severe sentence, despite the fact that the proceedings in relation to them had been discontinued under Article 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.', '14. The Federal Public Prosecutor General argued that the Regional Court had been entitled to take account of the sexual offences committed previously by the applicant as an aggravating element as part of his previous history (Vorleben) and thus as one of the elements in setting his sentence under Article 46 § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 18 below). In accordance with the Federal Court of Justice’s case-law, the Regional Court had made sufficient findings of fact establishing a minimum level of guilt in respect to those offences.', '15. On 6 February 2013 the Federal Court of Justice dismissed the applicant’s appeal as ill-founded, without giving specific reasons.', '16. In a decision of 16 May 2013, which was served on the applicant’s lawyer on 28 May 2013, the Federal Constitutional Court, without giving reasons, declined to consider a constitutional complaint by the applicant, in which he had again complained of a breach of the presumption of innocence (file no. 2 BvR 575/13).']",[],[],[],['6'],['6-2'],[],0

The applicants, Mr Michael Borg, Mrs Olympia Borg, Mr Andrew Vella are Maltese nationals and Mrs Lorena Vella is a Canadian national. They all live in Gozo and they were born respectively in 1975, 1976, 1974, and 1973. They were represented by Dr T. Abela, a lawyer practising in Attard.', '2. The Maltese Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Dr P. Grech, Attorney General.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. Following a project launched by the Government in 1984 asking the public to identify features of the Maltese cultural and natural heritage which deserved to be included in the Conservation and Preservation Plan for the protection of the environment, a villager suggested protecting the picturesque view, across open sloping fields leading down to the sea, which was visible from north of Nadur, Gozo, in the area at issue in the present case.', '5. Some time later – the Government having accepted the proposal –procedures for the execution of the project commenced. In June 1991 the Commissioner of Land (CoL) expropriated a plot of land in the above-mentioned area – it is not clear whether this land belonged exclusively to the applicants or in part also to Nadur Parish Church – in order to widen an existing road and develop an open panoramic view, known locally as a “belvedere”. In the development phase of the belvedere, the Government demolished a rubble wall on the boundary between expropriated land and the applicants’ property and installed iron railings to permit an unobstructed view. In due course the area became a designated belvedere, with an unobstructed view overlooking the fields sloping down to the sea. No dispute arose in relation to this (first) expropriation. The applicants’ property abuts immediately onto and is slightly below the site of the belvedere and is, in effect, part of the view from the said belvedere and part of the sloping fields.', '6. On an unspecified date the applicants sought planning permission to develop the remaining part of the land owned by them, but the Malta Environment and Planning Authority refused the application on the grounds that the site, although within a development zone, was a protected green area.', '7. Subsequently, on 1 April 2004, the applicants brought an action against the CoL, asking the court to declare that they had the right to erect a wall on the boundary between their land and the expropriated plot (see Relevant domestic law). The CoL did not submit any pleas countering the claim, although he was served with the claim on 23 April 2004.', '8. Since the applicants did not own all the land expropriated in conjunction with the belvedere, the wall in question would not have been built along the entire length of the belvedere. It would only have been built on the two plots owned by the applicants, these being 12.8 metres and 7 metres wide respectively. Although not specified, from the photos and plans provided it would appear that the entire belvedere is approximately 50 metres long.', '9. The case was set down for hearing for 25 June 2004. On that same day the Court of Magistrates (Gozo) in its superior jurisdiction gave judgment in default, upholding the applicants’ claim, finding that they had the right to build such a “boundary” wall and authorising them to build such a wall “up to the height required by law” under the supervision of a court-appointed architect.', '10. Since no appeal was lodged, the judgment became final.', '11. In the ensuing four years, numerous applications were made to the court by both parties to the suit in respect of technical issues connected with the execution of the above-mentioned judgment, that is, the erection of the proposed wall (these included the removal of items installed on the belvedere so that the wall could be constructed, the question of distances, given the sloping terrain, and the manner in which the boundary wall should be built – over which the CoL disagreed with the interpretation of the architect). A decision in the form of a decree of 21 August 2006, given pursuant to one of the applications, held that the wall had to be built along the boundaries of the land expropriated for the purposes of the belvedere (where a retaining wall already existed) and that it had to be one and half metres high measured “from the belvedere”. A request by the CoL to have the height of the wall measured from the boundaries (the level where the properties met) and not from the surface level of the belvedere was rejected on 22 September 2006. The court therefore rejected the CoL’s interpretation as to how the wall had to be built.', '12. The execution of the judgment of 25 June 2004 was to take place on 5 April 2008.', '13. On 2 April 2008 the President of Malta declared that as from 3 April 2008 the Minister for Gozo was to assume the additional duties of Prime Minister during the Prime Minister’s absence from Malta. By virtue of a declaration made by the acting President of Malta on 3 April 2008, a piece of land (112 square metres) owned by the applicants – which included part of the strip of land on which they were to build the boundary wall – was expropriated by the CoL for the price of 23,300 euros (EUR).', '14. On 4 April 2008 the CoL asked the court to suspend execution of the judgment in the applicants’ favour in view of the above-mentioned expropriation, which included part of the applicants’ land adjacent to the existing retaining wall. According to the CoL there was a public interest in the expropriation for the purposes of safeguarding the environment and particularly the belvedere (and the view therefrom), built at the expense of the taxpayer, from the actions proposed by the applicants.', '15. On 23 April 2008 the court rejected the request as it could not suspend the execution of a judgment which had become final and in respect of which there had been no appeal or retrial.', '16. On 25 April 2008 the CoL lodged a further application asking the court to prohibit the applicants from undertaking any works on the aforementioned plot by reason of the expropriation of 3 April 2008. Given the circumstances, the applicants agreed not to proceed with the building of the wall until the competent court had decided on the validity of the second expropriation. That being so, the court did not consider it necessary to issue the relevant prohibitory injunction.', '17. On 26 April 2008 the applicants lodged a judicial protest noting that they were not accepting the compensation offered and declaring their intention to institute constitutional redress proceedings in relation to the expropriation.', '18. On 7 May 2008 the CoL instituted fresh ordinary civil proceedings, asking the court to declare that the land where the wall was to be built was Government land, to declare the decision of 23 April 2008 null and void – given that the land on which the wall was to be built had now been expropriated for a public purpose – and to revoke any other court decision issued after the 25 June 2004 intended to establish the boundaries between the property of the Government and that of the applicants.', '19. The hearing of the case was suspended in view of the constitutional redress proceedings lodged by the applicants (see below). It does not transpire that they have been resumed.', '20. On 23 July 2008 the applicants instituted constitutional redress proceedings claiming a violation of Article 6 of the Convention – in so far as they had been denied execution of a judgment in their favour – and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention in that the expropriation of 3 April 2008 had not been in the public interest. They further invoked Article 14 of the Convention.', '21. By a judgment of 23 April 2010 the Civil Court (First Hall) in its constitutional competence rejected the applicants’ claims. It considered that under domestic law an owner had no right to be exempted from an expropriation of property which was carried out in the public interest and in exchange for adequate compensation. That being so, no fair-trial rights arose in relation to the expropriation itself, the right of the individual being limited to contesting the public interest and the compensation at issue in any given expropriation. It held that in the present case the expropriation in 2008 had been made in the public interest to ensure the effectiveness of the 1991 expropriation, the public interest of which (the creation of a belvedere) was not disputed. The fact that certain third parties (people living in the area of Nadur) had more to gain than others did not deprive the expropriation of its public interest, given that the entire Maltese and Gozitan population would benefit from the view. There was nothing wrong in the State ensuring that a plan it had embarked on years before was not frustrated. The court considered that, while the Government’s negligence in the proceedings before the Court of Magistrates in Gozo was grave, they had been entitled to take action to correct their mistakes. It further considered that there had not been any discriminatory treatment. The project in 1984 had been started by a socialist Government and then continued by a nationalist Government, and neither the initiation nor the continuation thereof appeared to have been politically motivated. Both administrations were taking action solely for the preservation of the environment. Moreover, while it was true that the 2008 expropriation had been made at a time when the Minister for Gozo was acting Prime Minister and that such an action probably brought most benefit to the residents of Nadur – who were, in the main, of the same political persuasion as the Minister for Gozo – it did not appear that the expropriation (which had been decided on 14 March 2008, that is to say prior to the Minister’s being assigned the duties of acting Prime Minister) was a result of any intervention on her part. Neither had it been proved that the applicants were treated differently from others in their position or that the expropriation had been politically motivated.', '22. By a judgment of 30 September 2011 the Constitutional Court rejected an appeal lodged by the applicants. It confirmed in full the first-instance judgment in respect of the claim under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, as the expropriation was indeed necessary to protect the view which was in the general interest and which would have been frustrated by the building of a wall. It further considered that the applicants had not been denied access to a court as they could still contest the merits of the expropriation in relation to the public interest and the amount of compensation. The fact that the applicants had a judicially recognised right over that land (in the instant case, the right to build a dividing wall when two properties belong to different owners) did not mean that that land could not be expropriated in accordance with the existing legal procedures, subject always to the judicial review of the administrative act of expropriation. Lastly, in relation to the complaint under Article 14 it considered that – even if the Minister had been involved in the expropriation – it had already been found that the expropriation was legitimate, and it was self-evident that a minister had to act, even if it happened that the beneficiaries shared the same political opinion. In the court’s view, the argument that – unlike the applicants – the neighbours had direct access to the Minister, enabling them to influence decision-making, did not mean that there had been discriminatory treatment. Similarly, the fact that other people’s property had not been expropriated did not mean that the expropriation was discriminatory, as not everyone’s property was relevant for the purpose sought to be achieved by the expropriation. Moreover, the applicants were entitled to compensation for the taking of their property.', '23. Pending the proceedings before this Court and after the parties had submitted their observations, by means of a publication in the Government Gazette of 21 August 2014, the President of Malta revoked the President’s Declaration of 3 April 2008 which had expropriated the applicants’ land.', '24. According to information submitted by the parties, the applicants became aware of the revocation on an unspecified day, weeks after it happened. Subsequently, the applicants informed the Government Agent, who according to the applicants was unaware that the measure had been lifted. The parties met and agreed that the Government agent would inform the Court about the matter.', '25. The Court was eventually informed of the matter on 4 November 2014, both parties having claimed that the delay in informing the Court was due to an oversight and a lack of co-ordination, for which they apologised to the Court.', '26. Article 434 of the Civil Code, Chapter 16 of the Laws of Malta reads:', '“Every person may construct any wall or building on the boundary-line of his tenement, saving the right of the neighbour to acquire co-ownership of the wall (...)”', 'Article 408 of the Civil Code, in so far as relevant reads:', '“A party-wall between two courtyards, gardens or fields, may be built of loose stones, but must be -', '(c) one and one-half metres high, if it is between two fields.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant was born in 1979 and lives in Šibenik.', '6. On an unspecified date an investigation was opened in respect of the applicant and four other persons, A.B., D.D., G.A. and E.R., in connection with the killing in Split of S.I.T.J, a British national. During the investigation A.B. gave oral evidence twice.', '7. On 28 May 1997 the applicant was indicted before the Split County Court on charges of murder, while A.B., D.D., G.A. and E.R. were charged under the same indictment with participating in a fight which resulted in the death of one person. During the proceedings before the trial court A.B. did not testify and the oral evidence he had given during the investigation was read out. The applicant denied the veracity of his evidence.', '8. On 19 July 2000 the Split County Court, composed of a panel of two professional judges and three lay judges, acquitted the applicant and found the other accused guilty as charged. Upon an appeal by the Split County State Attorney’s Office, on 5 December 2002 the Supreme Court quashed the judgment in respect of the applicant and dismissed the charges against the other accused on account of the statutory prescription period. The Supreme Court also ordered that fresh proceedings against the applicant be conducted by a trial panel composed of different judges.', '9. In the fresh proceedings a panel of two different professional judges and three different lay judges of the Split County Court heard evidence from A.B. in the presence of the applicant and his defence lawyer on 18 February 2004. However, since one of the lay judges changed during the proceedings, the trial had to start afresh. At a hearing held on 10 July 2007 the applicant agreed that A.B.’s statement could be read out and on the same day the Split County Court again acquitted the applicant. That judgment was also quashed by the Supreme Court, on 22 January 2008, which again ordered a fresh trial with different judges.', '10. A third round of proceedings was held before a panel of two different professional judges (I.R. and Ar.B.) and three different lay judges (B.S., G.M. and S.B.) of the Split County Court. At a hearing held on 23 February 2010 A.B. gave oral evidence in the presence of the applicant and his defence counsel. On 24 March 2010 Judge Ar.B. was replaced by Judge M.Š. and the lay judge B.S. was replaced by another lay judge, J.B. At a hearing held on 8 July 2010 that panel heard evidence from A.B., in the presence of the applicant and his defence counsel. On 17 February 2011 Judge M.Š. was replaced by Judge M.M. and the trial had to start afresh. During the renewed proceedings the trial panel heard evidence from various witnesses, save for the witness A.B. whose prior statement was read out at a hearing held on 7 June 2011 because he was in a psychiatric institution. A.B. was the only witness who said that he had seen the applicant attacking the victim. A request by the applicant for the trial panel to hear the witness in person was denied on the grounds that the witness was undergoing treatment for alcoholism in a psychiatric institution and that any absence from the institution would have a negative effect on his treatment.', '11. On 16 June 2011 the Split County Court found the applicant guilty of murder and sentenced him to eleven months’ imprisonment, suspended for five years.', '12. In an appeal of 5 August 2011, the applicant, inter alia, challenged the veracity of the evidence given by A.B. and objected to the trial court’s decision not to hear evidence from that witness in person. The applicant countered the reason given by the trial court for not requesting A.B. to come to the hearing by submitting that the witness’s psychiatric treatment was scheduled to be completed in about two months and that such a delay would not affect the applicant’s trial.', '13. On 27 March 2012 the Supreme Court upheld the judgment of 16 June 2011. The relevant part of the Supreme Court’s judgment reads:', '“The accused is not right in [alleging] that the first-instance court committed a serious breach of the rules of criminal procedure when it, without the [defence’s] consent, read out the statements of witnesses A.B. and G.A. The [first-instance] court was correct in deciding to read out the statement of witness A.B. (page 967 of the case file), who was questioned several times in these criminal proceedings, because a letter from the Rab Psychiatric Hospital shows that he was undergoing medical treatment, namely that ‘... the medical treatment is ongoing and possible absence would not contribute to the overall therapeutic procedure ...’ (page 965 of the case file).”', '14.

The applicant, Mr Veit Aurnhammer, is a German national who was born in 1984 and is currently detained in Straubing, Germany. When lodging his application he was represented before the Court by Mr G. Althammer, a lawyer practising in Cham, Germany. The latter informed the Court on 1 August 2014 that he no longer represented the applicant.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.', '3. On 19 August 2004 the applicant was convicted by the Regensburg Juvenile District Court of causing bodily harm and damage to property because he had hit two ticket collectors in the face when they tried to prevent him from evading ticket controls and had damaged their clothes and glasses. He was further convicted of defamation and attempted coercion as he had insulted a prosecutor during one of his previous trials and had tried to intimidate her. Moreover, he was convicted of dangerous bodily injury because he had attacked with a knife the neck of a sleeping cellmate of whom he had previously felt humiliated and slightly injured him. Besides, the applicant was convicted of various offences of theft, minor fraud, and trespassing. Adding on another prison sentence imposed on the applicant in a previous judgment of 15 February 2000 for various offences of defamation, resisting bailiffs, bodily injury and theft, the court sentenced the applicant to an overall prison term of two years and six months in a juvenile prison.', '4. Besides, the Court ordered the applicant’s indefinite placement in a psychiatric hospital in accordance with Article 63 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 17 and 18 below).', '5. At the time the applicant committed the relevant criminal offences he was between nineteen and twenty years old. The court decided to apply the juvenile criminal law instead of the criminal law rules applicable to adults because it found, in line with the report of the psychiatric expert Dr S., deputy medical director (Oberarzt) of the forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy department of Regensburg Psychiatric Clinic and with the additional psychological expert opinion of psychotherapist H., that the applicant’s development as an adult was delayed, that he was still immature and had therefore to be treated as a juvenile and not as an adult. The court further found, in line with the psychiatric experts’ opinions, that the applicant had committed the criminal offences of causing bodily harm and damage to property, dangerous bodily injury, defamation and attempted coercion while in a state of diminished criminal responsibility (Article 21 of the Criminal Code, see paragraph 19 below), as he suffered mainly from a “borderline personality disorder of an impulsive type with dissocial components” and also from “adult hyperactivity syndrome”, which limited his ability to control his impulses. With regard to the other criminal offences he was convicted of, the court, in line with the psychiatric experts’ opinion, regarded the applicant as fully liable.', '6. On 2 November 2005, 27 September 2006 and 27 September 2007 the criminal courts reviewed the applicant’s compulsory confinement in the psychiatric clinic in accordance with Articles 67d and 67e of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see §§ 20/21 below) and found on all three occasions that the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric clinic could not yet be suspended on probation. For the purposes of these review decisions, the inhouse psychiatric doctors at Straubing Psychiatric Hospital issued medical opinions on 9 August 2005, 14 August 2006 and 2 July 2007.', '7. On 9 October 2008 the District Court again decided that the applicant still suffered from the psychological disorder which had led to the criminal offences of which he had been convicted in 2004 and that he could be expected to commit further offences of a certain gravity if released. The decision was delivered after having heard the applicant on 26 September 2007 and again on 21 May 2008. It was based on the above-mentioned expert opinion of 2 July 2007 by the in-house psychiatric team at Straubing Psychiatric Hospital and on a newly commissioned external expert opinion of the psychiatric expert Prof. Dr O., head of the forensic psychiatry and psychotherapy department of the University of Regensburg at Regensburg Psychiatric Clinic, who had delivered his expert opinion on 19 February 2008, had supplemented it on 28 July 2008 and had personally been heard by the court on 21 May 2008.', '8. In the medical report of 2 July 2007 the team of in-house psychiatric experts at Straubing Psychiatric Hospital had expressed the view that the applicant could be expected to commit further crimes if released because he showed no insight into his psychological disorder. The expert opinion had further expressed the suspicion that the applicant might in fact be schizophrenic.', '9. In his expert opinion Prof. Dr O. had diagnosed the applicant with an “emotionally unstable personality disorder of the impulsive type” and possibly also with “adult hyperactivity syndrome”. O. had further stated that, despite the fact that the personality of the applicant had matured considerably during his confinement, he could not at this stage be expected to abstain from committing any significant crimes if released. Although the applicant had obviously benefited from his placement in a psychiatric hospital and had not committed any criminal offences within the hospital, he was still not psychologically stable enough to be released. The biggest obstacle to his release was that the applicant still had very little insight into the fact that medical treatment was necessary now and in the future after a possible release. His compliance with his treatment had hence not yet been achieved. Furthermore, the applicant would need clearly structured sheltered accommodation if released. The preparations for such accommodation were not yet in place. The expert had further stated that, if the applicant could be further stabilised by psychotherapy, if his compliance with his treatment could be achieved in the future and if a place in adequately structured sheltered accommodation was prepared, the applicant could be released but would need to be prepared over a period of six to twelve months for such release on probation.', '10. Following an appeal by the applicant, the Regional Court upheld the decision of the District Court on 16 January 2009.', '11. On 8 October 2009 the District Court decided in accordance with Article 67d § 2 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 19 below) that the applicant could not yet be released because, owing to his ongoing psychiatric illness, he could still be expected to commit crimes of a certain gravity if released. The Court based its decision on a newly commissioned expert opinion of the internal psychiatric team of Straubing Psychiatric Hospital of 7 July 2009 and the oral hearing of the deputy medical director treating the applicant of 30 September 2009.', '12. The respective medical experts were still of the view that the applicant could be expected to commit further crimes if released, because he still lacked sufficient insight into his psychological disorder. There was still a suspicion that he might in fact be suffering from schizophrenia rather than from a borderline personality syndrome. But as he refused to cooperate fully with the doctors, a clear diagnosis that would allow a more specific treatment was difficult. The idea that the applicant was suffering from schizophrenia was therefore only a presumption which could not be confirmed or refuted. More rapid results from the applicant’s treatment could only be achieved if he complied fully with the medical and psychotherapeutic treatment. As he still had a negative attitude towards the medication and the psychotherapists, sufficient progress to justify his release could not be achieved.', '13. On 23 December 2009 the Regional Court upheld the decision. It based its decision on the above-mentioned external medical opinion of Prof. Dr O. of 19 February and 21 May 2008 respectively and on the internal expert opinion of the psychiatric team of Straubing Psychiatric Hospital of 7 July 2009. The court held that there was still a clear diagnosis of “emotionally unstable personality disorder of the impulsive type” and possibly also of “adult hyperactivity syndrome”. This diagnosis did not contradict the diagnosis of “borderline personality disorder of an impulsive type with dissocial components” established by S. at the time of the applicant’s initial compulsory confinement. According to the Regional Court, Prof. Dr O. had made it clear before the court that that diagnosis just gave a more precise description of the mental disturbance from which the applicant had already been suffering when he committed the offences of which he had been convicted and when he had been compulsorily admitted, but did not describe a new mental illness.', '14. The court further held that the idea that the applicant in fact suffered from schizophrenia was only an unverified presumption. His situation had not changed since the external expert O. had given his opinion on 19 February and 21 May 2008. According to the statement of the in-house psychiatric doctor, the applicant had still not developed any insight into his psychological illness that would result in full cooperation with regard to his medication. At the same time no structured sheltered accommodation had yet been prepared into which he could be placed after his release. He was therefore still to be expected to commit further crimes of a certain gravity if released. Considering the criminal offences he had committed in the past and the risk that he might again commit similar offences such as causing bodily harm and aggravated bodily injury, his continued detention for more than five years by that time was not yet disproportionate.', '15. A further appeal lodged by the applicant with the Court of Appeal was rejected on the ground that domestic law did not provide for such an appeal.', '16. A constitutional complaint and a request for restoration of the previous situation lodged by the applicant were of no avail. On 10 June 2010 the Federal Constitutional Court declined to admit the constitutional complaint for examination, without giving any reasons, and did not rule on the request for restoration of the previous situation (no. 2 BvR 1001/10).', '17. In accordance with Article 63 of the Criminal Code placement in a psychiatric hospital may be ordered in the case of offenders who have acted without criminal responsibility or in the case of offenders who have acted with diminished criminal responsibility in addition to their punishment. The measure must, however, be proportionate to the gravity of the offences committed by, or to be expected from, the defendants concerned, as well as to their dangerousness (Article 62 of the Criminal Code).', '18. Article 63 of the Criminal Code provides that if someone commits an unlawful act without criminal responsibility or with diminished criminal responsibility, the court must order his placement in a psychiatric hospital without specifying a maximum duration, if a comprehensive evaluation of the defendant and his acts reveals that, as a result of his condition, he can be expected to commit serious unlawful acts and that he is therefore dangerous to the general public.', '19. Criminal incapacity and diminished criminal responsibility are regulated by Articles 20 and 21 of the Criminal Code, which read as follows:', 'Article 20 Criminal incapacity on account of psychological disturbance', '“Any person who at the time of the commission of the offence is incapable of understanding the unlawfulness of his or her actions or of acting in accordance with any such understanding on account of a pathological mental disorder, a profound consciousness disorder, mental deficiency or any other serious mental abnormality, shall be deemed to have acted without guilt.”', 'Article 21 Diminished criminal responsibility', '“If the capacity of the offender to understand the unlawfulness of his or her actions or to act in accordance with any such understanding is substantially diminished at the time of the commission of the offence for one of the reasons indicated in Article 20, the sentence may be mitigated in accordance with Article 49(1).”', '20. Article 67d of the Criminal Code governs the duration of detention. In the version in force at the relevant time, it provided:', 'Article 67d Duration of detention', '“(1) ...', '(2) If no maximum period has been provided or the period has not yet expired, the court shall suspend the measure for a probationary period if it can be expected that the person subject to the measure will not commit any more unlawful acts if released. The order for suspension shall automatically lead to the person being subjected to supervision.', '...', '(6) If, after the enforcement of a hospital order has begun, the court finds that the conditions for the measure no longer exist or that the continued enforcement of the measure would be disproportionate, the court shall declare it terminated. Following release the person concerned shall automatically be placed under supervision. ...”', '21. Article 67e of the Criminal Code provides for the review of a person’s detention, including in a psychiatric hospital. The court may review at any time whether the continued execution of the detention order should be suspended and the person concerned placed on probation. It is obliged to do so within fixed time-limits (Article 67e, first paragraph). For persons detained in a psychiatric hospital, this time-limit is one year (Article 67e, second paragraph).']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On 4 January 2011, after his daughter had committed suicide in December 2010, the applicant notified the Suceava Child Protection Agency (“the Agency”) and complained that the child’s paternal grandparents had prevented him from contacting his five year-old granddaughter who had not been informed about her mother’s death and therefore had been potentially exposed to a severe emotional trauma.', '5. On 13 January 2011 the Agency informed the applicant that they had initiated an investigation in respect of his claims.', '6. On the same date the Agency summoned the paternal grandparents together with the applicant’s granddaughter to its office for an interview aimed at clarifying their family’s situation.', '7. On 17 January 2011 the Agency asked the Arbore Mayor’s Office to produce a social investigation report on the paternal grandparents’ home.', '8. On 20 January 2011 the Agency summoned the applicant to its office for an interview aimed at clarifying his family’s situation.', '9. On the same date the applicant’s son-in-law, who had been accompanied by his granddaughter, was interviewed at the Agency’s office. According to the conversation report produced on that occasion the applicant’s son-in-law had informed the Agency that his wife had suffered from depression because he had left to work abroad. He had returned to Romania two days prior to the meeting at the Agency and had not told his daughter about her mother’s death. He had acknowledged that his daughter had to be informed about her mother’s death and had agreed to inform her with the help of a psychologist. He had also stated that the applicant had used to have a normal relationship with his granddaughter, before he had started pressuring them and picking fights in front of their home. The applicant had not agreed to the marriage between him and his wife and had used to interfere in their marriage.', '10. According to that report the applicant’s son-in-law had also been counselled on how to speak to his daughter about her mother and had been advised to shield her from family fights.', '11. On the same date the Agency provided the applicant’s granddaughter with psychological counselling in order to prepare her for the news that her mother had died.', '12. On 24 January 2011 the Arbore Mayor’s Office produced the social investigation report requested by the Agency on 17 January 2011. The report concluded that the child had a close connection to her father and her paternal grandparents who had cared for her in her father’s absence. The father’s family had provided the child with normal conditions for her physical, moral and intellectual development and her health had not been endangered.', '13. On 28 January 2011 the applicant was interviewed at the Agency’s office. According to the conversation report produced on that occasion the applicant had informed the Agency that his relationship with his son-in-law had been very bad and that his son-in-law had refused to allow him into his home.', '14. According to the same report the Agency’s representatives had explained to the applicant that he had made a mistake in informing his granddaughter about her mother’s death directly and without any preliminary coaching. He had been advised that it would be in the best interest of the child to avoid and to solve family conflicts. He had also been informed that it would be advisable for him to avoid speaking ill of his sonin-law in front of his granddaughter.', '15. On 29 September 2011 the Agency informed the applicant following his enquiry that they could have ordered his granddaughter’s psychological evaluation only if it had been ordered by a court or had been requested by her father. Moreover, they stated that they had not been competent to punish an individual for failure to comply with a final court judgment. Furthermore, they noted that the applicant’s granddaughter had received psychological counselling in respect of her mother’s death and in order to help her process the trauma.', '16. On an unspecified date the applicant asked the Agency to inform him whether he had a right to have contact with his granddaughter and whether she could have been counselled in the absence of her father in order to improve his relationship with her.', '17. On 23 July 2013 the Agency informed the applicant that they did not have the competence to contradict the final court judgment (see paragraph 29 below) granting him visiting rights. Moreover, they stated that the child could not have undergone psychological counselling without her father’s consent on account of her young age and the fact that the Agency’s intervention had not been needed for reasons imputable to the applicant’s son-in-law.', '18. On 15 and 23 July 2014 the Agency informed the Romanian Government that in 2011 they had supported the applicant in his attempts to rekindle his relationship with his granddaughter. They stated that, following his daughter’s death, the applicant had asked the Agency to intervene and to help him preserve his relationship with his granddaughter. Following the applicant’s notification, the Agency’s representatives had spoken to the applicant’s son-in-law. Because his son-in-law had not informed his granddaughter about her mother’s death, the applicant’s son-in-law and the child had been included in psychological counselling program which had led to the applicant’s granddaughter finding out the truth about her mother. Neither the Agency’s, nor the Arbore Social Protection Service’s investigations carried out at the child home had disclosed any danger for the child. In this context, the Suceava Child Protection Agency had mediated a meeting between the applicant, his son-in-law and his granddaughter in order to observe their interaction and to help resolve the conflict between the two parties so that the child would not be traumatised even further. During that meeting, the interaction between the applicant and the applicant’s son-in-law had been very tense. The applicant had accused his son-in-law of killing his daughter and had called him a murderer in front of the child. Because the applicant’s son-in-law had also been verbally aggressive towards the applicant, both parties had been advised on the negative consequences of their behaviour in respect of the child. Whilst the applicant’s son-in-law had changed his behaviour and had mastered his anger, the applicant had failed to do the same even though he had been warned that his behaviour might affect his granddaughter’s emotional wellbeing and that it had caused her to reject contact with him. The applicant’s granddaughter had refused any physical contact with the applicant both before and after she had been counselled by a psychologist.', '19. On the same dates the Suceava Child Protection Agency also informed the Romanian Government that every time the applicant’s granddaughter had been brought to the Agency, her psychological evaluation had been carried out in two stages: her interaction with the adults had been observed and afterwards she had received psychological counselling in the absence of her father. Also, given the child’s young age, the fact that her father had been her legal representative and that he had not been a danger to the child, there had been no legal basis for the Agency to accept the applicant’s request to organise psychological counselling sessions between him and his granddaughter without the father’s consent and in his absence. Moreover, after Law no. 272/2004 on protection of the rights of children had been amended on 30 September 2013 a person facing conflicts caused by enforcement of visiting rights could have notified the social protection service from the child’s domicile. However, after the aforementioned date the applicant had no longer contacted the Suceava Child Protection Agency, and the latter had not been informed by the Arbore Social Protection Service either that the applicant had faced problems with the enforcement of his visiting rights.', '20. On 11 January 2011 the applicant opened proceedings against his son-in-law seeking custody of his granddaughter.', '21. On 16 February 2011 the applicant amended his application and asked the domestic courts to grant him visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter if his request for custody rights was dismissed. He asked to see his granddaughter every Sunday at her home and to be granted the right to take her at his house for a month during the summer holiday.', '22. On the same date the Rădăuți District Court allowed in part the applicant’s action and granted him visiting rights every Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at his granddaughter’s and son-in-law’s home. It held that the applicant was entitled to have a normal relationship with his granddaughter, a fact that had also been acknowledged by the applicant’s son-in-law who had objected only to the visiting schedule requested by the applicant. A normal relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter was in the child’s best interest. Given the child’s young age, she needed a stable living environment which could have been affected if she had to travel to the applicant’s home for a month during the summer holiday. The applicant could also have asked for an extension of his visiting rights once his relationship with his granddaughter had improved and the child had grown older.', '23. The applicant appealed against the judgment before the Suceava County Court. He asked to be granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter at his house or in a neutral location on account of his poor relationship with his son-in-law. He further argued that a denial of his request by the court would prevent him from actually reconnecting with the child.', '24. On an unspecified date the Suceava County Court ordered the Agency to produce a psychological evaluation report in respect of the applicant’s granddaughter.', '25. On 4 October 2011, following the second-instance court’s order for a psychological evaluation report, the Agency organised a meeting between the applicant, his granddaughter and his son-in-law in order to assess their interaction. According to the meeting report produced on the same date, at the beginning of the meeting the applicant’s daughter had sat only in her father’s lap and had not approached the applicant. Afterwards, she had been examined by a psychologist. The applicant’s son-in-law had stated that when the applicant had come to see his granddaughter according to the court’s schedule he had told the child that her father would murder her just as he had done with her mother. At the same time the applicant had claimed that his son-in-law had been controlling his granddaughter and had turned her against him. The parties had been advised that mediation services could have been provided for them in order to help them resolve their conflict. The applicant’s son-in-law had refused, however, to leave the child alone with her grandfather because he could not have trusted his behaviour towards her. The applicant had accused his son-in-law of murdering his daughter in front of the child. At the end of the meeting the child had refused interact with her grandparent.', '26. On the same date the Agency produced the psychological evaluation report ordered by the second-instance court. It concluded that the applicant, his son-in-law and his granddaughter had needed psychological counselling in order to enable them to resolve their conflict and to rekindle their relationship.', '27. On 13 December 2011 the Suceava County Court allowed the applicant’s appeal, quashed in part the judgment of the first-instance court and granted him visiting rights on the second Sunday of each month from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. at his home. It held, amongst other things, that according to the available evidence the applicant and his granddaughter had enjoyed an affectionate relationship both prior and after the child’s mother’s death. The relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter had changed abruptly and the child had refused to see her grandfather any more, her refusal being fuelled by a feeling of fear towards her grandfather. The conclusions of the psychological evaluation report produced in respect of the child had recommended psychological counselling for both the applicant and the child’s father in order to resolve the conflict between them and to allow them to have a balanced relationship with the child. Consequently, the conflict between the applicant and his son-in-law had influenced the applicant’s relationship with his granddaughter, given that the child’s attitude towards her grandfather had changed. In the absence of any evidence that the applicant would have endangered the child’s physical or moral development, he had been entitled to have a personal relationship with his granddaughter. Given the excessively tense situation between the applicant and his son-in-law, the age and the interests of the child, the relationship between the applicant and his granddaughter could have been rekindled only if he had been allowed to take her to his home during the allowed visiting hours.', '28. The applicant appealed on points of law (recurs) against the judgment. He asked to be granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter either every Sunday or alternatively every second Sunday at his house on account of his busy work programme. He further argued that a denial of his request by the court would prevent him from rekindling the relationship with his granddaughter.', '29. By a final judgment of 27 March 2012 the Suceava Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law. It held, amongst other things, that it was in the best interest of the child to have contact with her grandfather given that the applicant had not endangered his granddaughter’s physical and moral development and that prior and after the child’s mother’s death they had had an affectionate relationship with one another which had been affected by the death of the child’s mother and the conflict between the applicant and his son-in-law. In spite of the child’s fear towards the applicant, according to the social investigation report the best interest of the child had been to establish a functional relationship with the applicant, reason for which the parties psychological counselling had been recommended. However, the visiting schedule requested by the applicant would have been tiring for the child, given their family situation and the child’s young age and would have also limited the applicant’s son-in-law’s time spent with his child. The visiting programme could have been changed once the factual circumstances had changed and if it had been in the best interest of the child. Consequently, it was more appropriate for the applicant to have contact with his granddaughter only one Sunday per month.', '30. On 17 July 2012 the applicant brought criminal proceedings against his son-in-law on the basis of Article 307 of the Romanian Criminal Code for repeatedly obstructing him to see his granddaughter. He argued that although on 8 April, 7 and 13 May 2012 he had contacted his son-in-law and had asked him to allow him to have contact with his granddaughter, his son-in-law had refused to allow him to see her.', '31. On 22 January 2013 the Rădăuți Prosecutor’s Office dismissed the criminal proceedings opened by the applicant against his son-in-law. It held that even though the applicant had been granted visiting rights in respect of his granddaughter by a final court judgment, every time he had asked her to go with him to his home she had obstinately refused. Moreover, the child had been heard in the presence of a representative of the Suceava Child Protection Agency and she had refused to go to the applicant’s house because she had feared him after he had repeatedly visited her at school and had scared her with his repeated requests to follow him home. Furthermore, the psychological report produced by the Suceava Child Protection Agency showed that the child had feared the applicant and had recommended that the child underwent psychological counselling in order to rekindle her relationship with the applicant. Lastly, the applicant’s son-in-law had only observed his child’s wishes and there was no evidence that he had influenced the child. The applicant appealed against the prosecutor’s office’s decision before the domestic courts.', '32. By a final judgment of 12 April 2013 the Rădăuți District Court dismissed the appeal lodged by the applicant. It held that the applicant was not a parent and therefore the elements required for the offence provided by Article 307 of the Romanian Criminal Code to exist had not been met. Moreover, the police officers had heard the child in the presence of the representative of the Suceava Child Protection Agency and she had refused to go to the applicant’s home because she had feared him. The child had also stated that her father had never told her not to go to the applicant’s home.', '33. In his initial letters the applicant informed the Court that in his hometown there had been only three bailiffs and all of them had refused to help him enforce the final judgment of 27 March 2012.', '34. On 11 November 2013 the applicant employed a bailiff located in Suceava to enforce the final judgment of 27 March 2012.', '35. On 12 November 2013 the bailiff employed by the applicant motioned the Suceava District Court to approve the enforcement of the final judgment of 27 March 2012.', '36. On 14 November 2013 the Suceava District Court approved the bailiff’s request.', '37. On 26 November 2013 the bailiff informed the applicant’s soninlaw that enforcement proceedings had been initiated against him following the applicant’s request. She invited the applicant’s son-in-law to her office on 3 December 2013 in order for him to pay the required enforcement fees and to provide the required information concerning his assets. She also informed him that failure to comply or to provide the required information was punishable by fines.', '38. On the same date the bailiff notified the applicant’s son-in-law that he needed to comply with the domestic courts’ judgment and that the first meeting between the applicant and his granddaughter would take place on 8 December 2013. She also notified him that she would proceed with the enforcement of the judgment as provided, among other things, by Articles 910 and 911 of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code if he refused to comply.', '39. On 3 December 2013 the applicant’s son-in-law agreed before the bailiff to obey the final judgment of 27 March 2012.', '40. On 8 December 2013 the bailiff accompanied the applicant to his granddaughter’s home in order to enforce the judgment. The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the applicant’s soninlaw had agreed to allow the applicant to see his granddaughter and had not obstructed the enforcement proceedings. The applicant’s granddaughter had a strong emotional connection with her father and had been hostile towards the applicant. She had obstinately refused to accompany her grandfather anywhere without her father being present because she had feared her grandfather. Consequently, the applicant and his son-in-law had agreed, with the child’s consent, to take the child in a public location and to spend the day together accompanied by the bailiff. The applicant had been able to give his granddaughter a gift and had interacted with her calmly and openly. The applicant’s son in law had agreed to allow his daughter to visit her grandfather any time she wished and even on other days than the ones that had been mentioned by the court. The applicant’s granddaughter had agreed to have future contact with her grandfather but only in her father’s presence.', '41. On 7 January 2014 the bailiff notified the applicant’s son-in-law for a second time that he needed to comply with the domestic courts’ judgment and that the second meeting between the applicant and his granddaughter would take place on 12 January 2014. She also reiterated that she would proceed with the enforcement of the judgment as provided, among other things, by Articles 910 and 911 of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code if he refused to comply.', '42. On 12 January 2014 the bailiff accompanied the applicant to his granddaughter’s home. The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the parties had agreed for the meeting to take place in a public location after they had consulted the applicant’s granddaughter’s wishes. The applicant’s son-in-law had reiterated his willingness to allow the applicant to visit his granddaughter, but had informed the bailiff that she had refused to see her grandfather in his absence or in a different location than the one she had chosen. At the same time, the applicant had expressed his dissatisfaction with his son-in-law’s compliance with the final court judgment granting him contact rights, in so far as he had been influencing the child in choosing the locations of their meetings and therefore he had not allowed him to spend time with his granddaughter at his home. The applicant and his granddaughter had enjoyed the time together, while the applicant’s son-in-law had kept a low profile. Also the parties had agreed to allow the child and her grandfather to choose together the locations of their future meetings. At the end of the day the applicant’s granddaughter had refused her father’s proposal to travel back to her home in the company of her grandfather.', '43. On 9 February 2014 the bailiff accompanied once more the applicant to his granddaughter’s home. The report produced by the bailiff on the same date stated that the applicant and his granddaughter had agreed for the meeting to take place in a public location. The applicant and his son-in-law had a disagreement on whether the location of the meetings could have been chosen by the applicant on his own or only with the child’s consent. The interaction between the applicant and his granddaughter had been short and the child had behaved apprehensively towards him because he had scolded her over the phone prior to their meeting. Subsequently, the applicant and his son-in-law had had a fight and the latter had taken his daughter and had left. Before leaving the applicant’s son-in-law had stated that he had not complied with the judgment granting the applicant visiting rights because he had felt compelled, but as a result of the enforcement proceedings.', '44. On 2 April 2014, once more, the bailiff notified the applicant’s sonin-law that he needed to comply with the domestic courts’ judgment and that a new meeting between the applicant and his granddaughter would take place on 13 April 2014. She also reiterated that she would proceed to enforce of the judgment as provided, among other things, by Articles 910 and 911 of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code if he refused to comply. Moreover, she drew the applicant’s son-in-law’s attention to the provisions of Article 912 of the Romanian Civil Procedure Code and informed him about the applicant’s right under the last paragraph of Article 912 to motion the courts to apply penalties if the child refused to comply even during those enforcement proceedings.', '45. On 5 May 2014 the applicant asked the bailiff to cease the enforcement proceedings. In his written request he stated, among other things, that the judgment could not be enforced because his son-in-law had influenced his granddaughter. Moreover, his son-in-law had allegedly informed him that he would never allow his granddaughter to visit his home.', '46. On 22 July 2014 a bailiff located in the applicant’s home town informed the Government that no enforcement file had been registered by his office concerning the final judgment of 27 March 2012.', '47. On 25 July 2014 a second bailiff located in the applicant’s home town informed the Government that the applicant had not asked him to enforce the final judgment granting him visiting rights. However, the aforementioned bailiff stated that an unknown person had spoken to him in 2013 about a case similar to that of the applicant, but that after the discussion the person had left without returning. He had advised that person that the refusal of the child to have contact with him had been a problem and that the adult had to make efforts in order to rekindle the relationship with the child. At the same time he had advised that person to notify the child protection services and a psychologist in order to avoid any trauma for the child.', '48. On 29 July 2014 the bailiff employed by the applicant informed the Government that the applicant and his son-in-law had fought every time they had met. The applicant had been dissatisfied with his son-in-law’s presence at the meetings and had accused him that he had not allowed the child to go to his home. At the same time, the applicant’s granddaughter had obstinately refused to meet with her grandfather in her father’s absence. During each meeting the bailiff had repeatedly tried to convince the child to meet with her grandfather in her father’s absence, but she had refused.', '49. On 5 February 2013 the Arbore Police Department informed the applicant’s son-in-law that, following his request, the applicant had been warned not to visit his granddaughter’s school, although he had spoken only to the teachers and had enquired about her schooling situation.', '50. On 23 July 2014 the Arbore Mayor’s Office informed the Government that they had not taken any steps in order to assist the applicant in the enforcement of his visiting rights because he had not asked them to assist him. Moreover, they acknowledged that the applicant’s son-in-law had complained before them that the applicant had visited his granddaughter’s school in breach of the visiting programme set out by the domestic courts. They also stated that the applicant’s son-in-law had attached a number of documents to his complaint including copies of the operative part of the judgment setting out the applicant’s visiting rights, a copy of the judgment dismissing the applicant’s criminal complaint against his son-in-law and the reports prepared by the bailiff employed by the applicant on 8 December 2013 and 12 January 2014.', '51. Articles 14 and 16 provided that a child had the right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with his parents, relatives and other persons with whom he had developed a close connection. He also had a right to know his relatives and to maintain personal relations with them as well as with other persons with whom he had developed family relations if it did not affect his best interest. The child’s parents or any other legal representative could not prohibit the child’s contact with his grandparents, except in circumstances where a court had decided otherwise.', '52. Article 15 provided that the child’s personal relationships could be maintained by meeting the person entitled to have contact with him at the child’s or the aforementioned person’s home.', '53. On 3 October 2013 Law no. 272/2004 was amended. Following its amendment Article 15 also provided among other things that the parent living with the child had a duty to help maintain the child’s relationship with the other parent. In order to rekindle and maintain a child’s personal relationships, the social protection or the child protection agencies had to provide professional counselling to both the child and his parents upon their request. If the parent living with the child obstructed the child’s personal relations with the other parent by ignoring the schedule set out by the court or agreed on by the parties, the other parent could request the social assistance services from the child’s home to monitor the situation for up to six months. During the monitoring process the representatives of the social assistance services could attend the moment the parent not leaving with the child would take him from his home or return him and could interview the parents, the child or any other person either leaving with the child or not in order to produce a monitoring report. The monitoring report could recommend the extension of the monitoring period by a maximum of six months, the psychological counselling of one or both parents and a series of measures aimed at improving the child’s relation with the parent with whom he was not living. The monitoring report could also be used as evidence before the court.', '54. Following the amendment of Law no. 272/2004 on 3 October 2013 Article 161 was introduced. It provided that at the request of an interested person the domestic courts could order several measures, such as fines and security deposits, in order to secure the child’s contact rights with other persons.', '55. The relevant provisions concerning interlocutory measures, namely Article 581, are set out in Costreie v. Romania (no. 31703/05, § 56, 13 October 2009).', '56. Article 300 provided that an appeal on points of law suspended the enforcement of a judgment only in cases concerning the moving of land borders, destruction of constructions, crops or of any other fixed work as well as in cases expressly provided by law.', '57. Article 24 provided that the provisions of the New Civil Procedure Code applied only to trials and enforcement proceedings started after it had entered into force.', '58. Article 711 provided among other things that any interested party could contest the enforcement or the enforcement acts. The enforcement could also be contested if the bailiff refused to carry out an enforcement or to carry out an enforcement act according to law.', '59. Articles 909 provided among other things that if the debtor ignored the bailiff’s notification to observe the creditor’s contact rights, the bailiff could, at the creditor’s request, ask the court to apply penalties on the debtor.', '60. Article 910 provided among other things that if the debtor failed to comply with his duties within a month from the notification of the court order for penalties, the bailiff had to proceed with the enforcement. The enforcement had to be carried out in the presence of a representative of a child protection agency, and when the latter considered it necessary, in the presence of a psychologist assigned by him. If requested by the bailiff, public agents had to assist with the enforcement. Bullying or pressuring the child in order to successfully enforce a judgment was prohibited.', '61. Article 911 provided among other things that if the debtor was acting in bad faith and hid the child, the bailiff had to record the incident and inform the prosecutor’s office attached to the court charged with the enforcement proceedings in order to open criminal proceedings against the debtor for failure to comply with a court judgment.', '62. Article 912 provided among other things that if the bailiff noted that the child himself categorically refused to leave the debtor or was hostile towards the creditor, he had to produce a report describing the situation. He also had to communicate the aforementioned report to the parties and to the representative of the child protection agency. The representative of the child protection agency had to motion the competent court from the child’s home, for the court to set out, depending on the child’s age, a schedule for psychological counselling sessions for a period no longer than three months. The court had to examine the request urgently in a council chamber, by a final interlocutory judgment after summoning the parties and the person living with the child. The court-appointed psychologist had to produce a report at the end of the counselling sessions which had to be communicated to the court, the bailiff and to the child protection service. The bailiff had to resume the enforcement proceedings as provided by Article 910 after receiving the psychologist’s report. If the minor continued to refuse to comply, even during those enforcement proceedings, the creditor could ask the competent court from the child’s home to order penalties.', '63. Article 307 provided among other things that the refusal of a parent to return a child without the consent of the other parent or the person enjoying custody rights in respect of the child was punishable by a prison sentence or by a fine. The same punishment could be applied in respect of the person who enjoyed custody rights if he or she had repeatedly prevented the child’s parents from maintaining contact with their child as agreed by the parties or set out by a court.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The President of the Fifth Section decided to appoint Mr S. Goncharenko to sit as an ad hoc judge (Rule 29 § 1(b)).', '4. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '5. Between 1993 and 2005 the applicant was dismissed several times from his position as chief forester at Balta Forestry and reinstated following court proceedings.', '6. On 22 December 2005 the applicant was again dismissed from his position for inadequate performance of his professional duties.', '7. On 17 January 2006 the applicant instituted civil proceedings in the Baltskiy District Court to be reinstated and claiming various payments in compensation.', '8. On 21 February 2007 the District Court allowed the applicant’s claims in part. In particular, it found that the defendant, Balta Forestry, had failed to substantiate its allegations that the applicant’s performance at work had been inadequate and ordered his reinstatement. It also awarded him part of the sum claimed in compensation.', '9. The defendant appealed, maintaining that the applicant had been dismissed lawfully.', '10. On an unspecified date the Odessa Regional Court of Appeal (“the Court of Appeal”) scheduled a hearing for 27 September 2007.', '11. On 13 September 2007 the Court of Appeal sent to the applicant, by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt, an envelope which the applicant received on 15 or 16 September 2007 (see paragraph 13 below).', '12. A copy of the envelope submitted to the Court bears no indication of its contents and the parties disagree as to those contents:', '13. The applicant received the envelope on 15 or 16 September 2007. A copy of the acknowledgement slip provided to the Court by the Government contains a signature, purportedly that of the applicant, and a handwritten note, “27.09.07”, in the field of the slip for the “collect payment on delivery” arrangements. According to the applicant, even though he received the envelope, he was not familiar with the contents of the slip, did not sign it and the signature appearing on it was not his.', '14. According to an undated certificate issued by the Court of Appeal’s clerk, on 3 (sic) September 2007 both the applicant and the defendant were informed of the hearing, to be held at 2 p.m. on 27 September 2007.', '15.

On 27 September 2007 the Court of Appeal examined the case in the applicant’s absence but in the presence of the defendant’s representative, who gave oral submissions to the effect that he maintained the appeal. The court found no reason warranting an adjournment on account of the applicant’s absence as the applicant had not filed any such request and had been duly notified of the time of the hearing. It examined the evidence in the file and the applicant’s written comments.', '17. On the same date the court reversed the judgment of the trial court. Having looked again at the evidence, it concluded that the applicant had systematically failed to carry out his professional duties and had therefore been lawfully dismissed.', '18. In November 2007 the applicant appealed in cassation, arguing that he had performed his professional duties properly. The applicant also complained that the appellate court had had no basis whatsoever to state that he had been duly notified of the appeal hearing. The only judicial correspondence he had received in connection with the preparation of the appeal hearing had contained a copy of the other party’s appeal. He had never been served with any summonses for the hearing informing him of its date and time. As a result, he had been deprived of the opportunity to confront his adversary before the Court of Appeal, which had led to the reversal of the earlier judgment in his favour.', '19. On 11 June 2008 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant’s application for leave to appeal, concluding that the Court of Appeal had complied with the substantive and procedural law in adjudicating the applicant’s case.', '20.

On 19 February 2008 the prosecutor instituted a criminal investigation into the allegations of sexual abuse.', '9. On 21 January 2008 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court issued an interim contact order. Under the terms of that order, the applicant was allowed to visit the children every other Sunday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.', '10. On 28 March 2008 the court stayed the custody proceedings as the criminal proceedings into the alleged sexual abuse were pending.', '11. Meanwhile, on 15 June 2008 the Warsaw District Court of its own motion instituted proceedings concerning the limitation of the applicant’s custody rights.', '12. During the course of the criminal proceedings, the prosecutor obtained two expert reports and heard a number of witnesses. On 31 October 2008 the prosecution discontinued the criminal proceedings into the allegations of sexual abuse on the grounds that there was not enough evidence that the alleged offences had been committed. The court-appointed expert established that A. and J. had not demonstrated the psychological symptoms of a sexually abused child. However, according to a private expert opinion provided by A.W., the facts of the case demonstrated that the children had been sexually abused. A.W. appealed against the decision to discontinue the proceedings. The prosecutor’s decision was upheld by the Warsaw Mokotów District Court.', '13. On 20 January 2009 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court resumed the proceedings for the establishment of contact. At the same time it also resumed the proceedings for limitation of the applicant’s custody rights.', '14. On 10 June 2009 the District Court modified the interim contact order, allowing the applicant to see his daughters every Saturday between 9 a.m and 6 p.m. in their home. The court also ordered A.W. to set a new time in case a Saturday visit was not possible. Both parties lodged interlocutory appeals. They were dismissed on 9 November 2009.', '15. On 3 September 2009 the applicant submitted a report to the court indicating that the mother had failed to comply with the terms of the access arrangements. The applicant’s letter also contained a description of several visits that had taken place between May 2008 and August 2009.', '16. On 23 December 2009 the mother applied for a change to the access arrangements. She asked the court to order visits every two weeks for four hours.', '17. On 24 February 2010 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court again modified the interim contact order, allowing the applicant to visit his children every Saturday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. in their home. The court also ordered that the parents and children be examined by experts in the Regional Family Consultation Centre (Rodzinny ośrodek diagnostyczno-konsultacyjny) (“RODK”). The court also ordered a further expert opinion.', '18. The meeting scheduled with RODK for June 2010 did not take place because the daughters were ill. The next meeting took place on 20 September 2010. According to the expert opinion, the daughters were drawn into the parents’ conflict by their mother. Both daughters sought contact with their father and wished to visit him in his home. The experts recommended therapy involving both parents and children.', '19. The opinions of RODK and of the court’s expert were submitted to the court on 22 October 2010 and 7 February 2011. Following the change of the presiding judge, a hearing date was set for 2 March 2011.', '20. Subsequently, the applicant applied for a change of the access arrangements. On 9 March 2011 the court issued yet another interim contact order and ruled that the applicant could meet his children every other Saturday and Sunday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. outside their home. The court considered that there was an emotional bond between the applicant and his daughters and in order to preserve it, it was important that the contact take place outside the children’s home. The court further referred to the expert opinion of W.B., who confirmed that A. and J. had not demonstrated symptoms of being victims of sexual abuse. However, the mother refused to comply with this order and lodged an appeal. On 25 July 2011 the Warsaw Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision.', '21. Subsequently, A.W. cancelled most of the visits on the grounds that the children had been away and from 10 September 2011 she refused all visits.', '22. On 7 October 2011 A.W. applied for modification of the access arrangements. Her motion was dismissed by the Warsaw Mokotów District Court on 24 October 2011.', '23. During a hearing held on 11 October 2011, A.W. again applied for a change of access arrangements. She agreed to respect the interim order of 9 March 2011, however she made a request to the court that the contact should take place in the presence of the children’s babysitter or a court-appointed guardian. During that hearing the court heard evidence from the expert W.B., who confirmed that he did not consider that A. and J. demonstrated behaviour typical of children who had been sexually abused. He based his opinion on an analysis of the court files and a VHS recording of the children’s interview.', '24. On 16 December 2011 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court gave a final decision in the case. It ordered that the applicant could meet his children every other Saturday and Sunday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The visits would take place in the children’s home with the mother present and in the applicant’s home with the presence of a court-appointed guardian. The court considered that the applicant should be allowed to meet his daughters outside their home and without the mother’s presence since the girls needed contact with their father. However, the court also stressed that, because the applicant’s contact with his daughters had not been regular, he did not know much about them. The applicant appealed.', '25. After February/March 2012, the applicant was again able to exercise his right of contact with his daughters on a weekly basis, every Saturday between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. at A.W.’s home.', '26. On 29 May 2012 the Warsaw Regional Court quashed the Warsaw District Court’s decision. The court held that the proceedings concerning the limitation of the applicant’s custody rights should not have been joined with the access proceedings. In addition, due to different requirements concerning the composition of the court in both cases, the District Court had sat in an incorrect formation and the proceedings were null and void.', '27. At a hearing held on 30 November 2012 both the applicant and A.W. testified. The applicant submitted that after their separation in 2005 the contact with his children had been irregular. In September 2007 A.W. (who is an actress) had participated in a live TV show and the girls had stayed at the applicant’s home every Saturday and had been collected by their mother on Sunday morning. Once the TV shows were finished at the beginning of October 2007, the applicant had wished to continue this arrangement, however A.W. disagreed. Consequently he lodged his application with the District Court. He stressed that after the court had delivered its first interim order (see paragraph 9 above), many of the visits had not taken place since A.W. had been absent for the weekend. The applicant further submitted that the interim order of 9 March 2011 (see paragraph 20 above) had never been enforced because whenever he had come to collect the children either A.W. had not been at home or she had refused to open the door. Lastly, the applicant confirmed that between September 2011 and February 2012 he had not seen his children at all. Since March 2012 he had been visiting his daughters every Saturday for 4 hours at their home.', 'The children’s mother A.W. confirmed to the District Court that between 2005 and September 2007 she had allowed the applicant to contact their daughters on many occasions. However, after she discovered that the applicant might have abused her daughter A., she had prohibited all contact. The contact had restarted in January 2008. She had never complied with the order of 9 March 2011 since she had been concerned about her daughters’ wellbeing. She further informed the court that she was planning to move to Gdansk with the daughters and her new partner.', '28. On 3 December 2012 the Warsaw District Court gave its decision. The court ordered that the applicant could meet his children every other Saturday and Sunday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. The visits would take place outside the children’s home and without the presence of their mother. In addition, he could spend Christmas with them every odd year and Easter every even year and also parts of the summer and winter holidays. However, the applicant was only allowed to visit his daughters between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and they were not allowed to stay overnight at his home.', '29. Both parties appealed.', '30. The applicant instituted proceedings for enforcement of the interim contact orders and made several applications for fines to be imposed on A.W. under Article 1051 of the Code of Civil Procedure.', '31. On 23 November 2009 the applicant lodged a motion for the imposition of a fine on A.W. for failure to comply with the access arrangements as specified in the interim contact order of 10 June 2009.', '32. On 17 May 2010 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court ordered A.W. to enforce the interim contact order of 27 February 2010 within 30 days, on pain of payment of a fine of 500 Polish zlotys (PLN). The court established that initially the contact had taken place regularly, but this had been in accordance with the terms of the previous interim contact order of 21 January 2008 (every other Saturday from 10 am to 2 pm instead of every Saturday from 9 am to 6 pm). Such an arrangement had resulted from the interpretation given to A.W. by the lawyers from the Ombudsman’s Office, who informed her that the new interim contact order would be effective only once it had become final. The court further observed that the contact had been regular; most of the visits were shortened or cancelled by the applicant and not by the mother. Lastly, the court ordered the mother to comply with the interim order of 27 February 2010.', '33. On 24 August 2010 the applicant lodged a motion for imposition of a fine on A.W. He submitted that she had failed to comply with the order of 17 May 2010.', '34. On 15 March 2011 the Warsaw Mokotów District Court discontinued the enforcement proceedings. The court held that the interim contact order had been modified in the meantime (on 9 March 2011) and there was therefore no need to deliver a decision in the present set of proceedings. The applicant appealed, asking the court to impose a fine on A.W. His appeal was dismissed by the Warsaw Regional Court on 11 August 2011. The court repeated the reasons given by the District Court and held that the interim order of 10 June 2009 had been replaced by a new interim order of 9 March 2011.', '35. In November 2012 the applicant lodged a new motion for the imposition of a fine on A.W.', '36. On 4 January 2013 the court imposed a fine on A.W.']",[],[],[],['8'],['8-1'],[],0

De Gaetano,"['5. The applicant was born in 1969 and lives in Timişoara.', '6. In 2004 the applicant lodged a civil action against her employer, a private company, C.G.H.T. (“the company”), seeking the revocation of its decision of 17 October 2003 to dismiss her, and claiming various salary entitlements.', '7. On 29 April 2004 the Timiș County Court dismissed her action as illfounded. The applicant appealed.', '8. In a final judgment of 29 September 2004 (“the judgment”), the Timișoara Court of Appeal allowed the applicant’s appeal. It ordered the company to revoke its dismissal decision and to pay the applicant pecuniary damages in the form of all her salary entitlements from 17 October 2003 until the pronouncement of the final judgment, updated and index-linked. The domestic court also awarded the applicant the costs and expenses incurred in the proceedings.', '9. On 15 November 2004 the Timiș County Court validated the judgment (învestire cu formulă executorie), pursuant to Article 374 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter “the RCCP”), as in force at the time (see paragraph 37 below).', '10. The applicant instituted enforcement proceedings on 21 January 2005, requesting the bailiffs’ office M.S.R. & S.A.I. (“the bailiff”) to enforce the judgment.', '11. On 26 January 2005 the bailiff issued a notice of payment (somație) and served it on the company.', '12. According to a report of 11 February 2005 issued by the bailiff, the bailiff and the applicant’s lawyer visited the company’s premises. As the company’s legal representative was not present, the bailiff granted the company a further five days in which to execute the final judgment of their own accord.', '13. However, the company refused to fulfil its obligations. Moreover, it lodged a complaint seeking to have the enforcement proceedings annulled, pursuant to Article 399 of the RCCP, as in force at the time (see paragraph 39 below). During those proceedings and at the company’s request, on 24 February 2005 the Timișoara District Court ordered the suspension of the enforcement proceedings until a final judgment was given; the suspension was made subject to payment of a deposit of 4,000,000 Romanian lei (ROL), namely approximately 90 euros (EUR).', '14. In response, on 16 May 2005 the applicant brought urgent proceedings seeking to have the impugned suspension lifted. She argued that the matter was urgent because she needed to obtain the salary entitlements that would allow her to provide for herself and her infant.', '15. In a judgment of 18 May 2005 the Timișoara District Court dismissed the applicant’s request, holding that she had not proved the existence of any imminent damage, so as to justify the urgency of the request.', '16. On 2 June 2005 the Timișoara District Court allowed the company’s complaint against the enforcement proceedings. The court held that the procedural requirements had not been thoroughly complied with in so far as the bailiff had failed to serve the company with a copy of the enforceable judgment.', '17. The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law against the court’s judgment. On 6 October 2005 the Timiș County Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal on points of law as ungrounded. The first-instance judgment thus became final.', '18. The company lodged another request seeking to obtain the annulment of the restriction order (anularea măsurii de poprire) issued by the bailiff in respect of its bank accounts. On 21 April 2005 the Timișoara District Court allowed the request, in so far as the restriction order had been issued subsequent to the suspension of the enforcement proceedings ordered by the court (see paragraph 13 above).', '19. In the meantime, on 29 June 2005, the bailiff issued another notice of payment. On 4 July 2005 it was posted, together with the enforceable judgment, at the company’s main entrance.', '20. On 2 November 2005 the bailiff received a letter from the applicant, in which she enquired whether the company had complied with the outstanding judgment. The bailiff replied in the negative on 4 November 2005.', '21. In so far as this was the last exchange of information between the applicant and the bailiff concerning the impugned enforcement procedure, and in view of the obligations imposed by law on the creditor, who was required to play a constantly active role throughout the enforcement procedure, on 28 May 2007 the bailiff issued an official report, noting that, under Article 389 of the RCCP as in force at the time, the procedure had become time-barred (“perimarea executării”; see paragraph 38 below). It is not clear whether that report was communicated to the applicant or not.', '22. On 5 May 2005 the applicant lodged a complaint before the Timișoara District Court seeking to obtain a court order for immediate enforcement of the judgment, pursuant to Article 5803 of the RCCP as in force at the time (see paragraph 40 below).', '23. In a decision of 18 August 2005 the Timișoara District Court allowed the applicant’s complaint and ordered the company to pay a coercive fine of ROL 500,000 per day until it fulfilled its obligations.', '24. An appeal by the company against that decision was allowed on 16 December 2005 by the Timiş County Court. The court held that the coercive fine had the nature of a civil penalty aimed at securing the enforcement of a personal obligation which could not be otherwise executed, as provided for by Article 5803. However, the payment of the company’s debt could be enforced with the assistance of a bailiff; therefore the applicant’s complaint was ill-founded.', '25. On 12 July 2005 the applicant complained to the Minister of Justice about the outcome of the judgment of 2 June 2005 (see paragraph 16 above). The complaint was lodged under the provisions of Law no. 303/2004, defining the framework for judges’ disciplinary and criminal responsibility and the specific authorities empowered to initiate such proceedings.', '26. On 24 August 2005 the applicant’s complaint was forwarded to the Timișoara Court of Appeal. On 5 September 2005 the Timișoara Court of Appeal noted that the impugned proceedings had been terminated by a judgment that was final and therefore not subject to appeal.', '27. In 2005 the applicant complained to different State authorities that the company’s representatives had failed to execute the judgment. She relied on Articles 277, 278 and 280 of the Labour Code and Article 83 of Law no. 168/1999 regarding the resolution of labour disputes (see paragraphs 43-44 below).', '28. On 5 December 2006 a criminal investigation was initiated against M.D., the company’s administrator, for refusal to execute the judgment.', 'On 4 February 2008 the prosecutor’s office at the Timișoara District Court decided to discontinue the proceedings against M.D. and fined him RON 1,000, namely approximately EUR 250. The prosecutor investigating the case found that M.D.’s actions could not be classified as an offence.', '29. A complaint lodged by the applicant against that decision was dismissed on 8 April 2008 by the senior prosecutor at the Timişoara District Court.', '30. On 2 June 2008 both the applicant and M.D. appealed against the prosecutors’ decisions before the Timişoara District Court. The court dismissed both appeals on 17 October 2008. It held that the applicant’s appeal had been lodged outside the time-limit. With regard to M.D.’s appeal, it reiterated that even though he had not executed the judgment, his actions could not be classified as an offence and, therefore, the administrative fine had been fair.', '31. In a final judgment of 28 January 2009 the Timiş County Court dismissed appeals on points of law lodged by the applicant and M.D.', '32. On 5 August 2014 the company’s two shareholders decided that the company should be liquidated (dizolvare), in accordance with the provisions of Law no. 31/1990 on trading companies. At their request, the Companies Registration Office (Oficiul Registrului Comerţului) decided on 7 August 2014 to publish the shareholders’ decision in the Romanian Official Journal. The decision was published on 26 August 2014, in accordance with the provisions of Emergency Government Ordinance no. 116/2009 regulating the registration of specific acts in the companies register (see paragraph 48 below).', '33. It was noted in an accounting report drawn up on 30 August 2014 that the company’s only creditors were the two shareholders.', '34. On 10 October 2014 one of the shareholders asked the Companies Registration Office to strike the company off the register. The request was granted on the same day, and the Companies Registration Office decided that the decision would be published in the Romanian Official Journal.', '35.

A list of the applicants is set out in the appendix.', '2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '3. The applicants stated that they are nationals of the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus”. Their names, dates of birth and places of residence are set out in the Annex. They are represented before the Court by Ms Y. Renda, a lawyer practising in Nicosia.', '4. The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The applicants are relatives of a Turkish-Cypriot man who went missing from hospital in Nicosia on 23 December 1963 at a time of mounting tension and violence in which Turkish Cypriots or Turkish-Cypriot villages were targeted.', '5. Their relative was listed as a missing person, the information being given to the Cypriot authorities, the Red Cross and the United Nations.', '6. The remains of the missing man were found in 2007 during exhumations carried out by the United Nations Committee for Missing Persons (“CMP”). The remains were identified in 2008.', '7. By letter dated 11 October 2010, the Attorney-General instructed the police to carry out an investigation into the circumstances of the death of the applicants’ relative.', 'By report dated 21 June 2013, the Attorney-General informed the applicants that police had submitted in the investigation file in September 2012. He had returned it, indicating further steps to be taken. In April 2013, the file had been re-submitted. On the basis of the information obtained and analysis of the file, the Attorney-General had come to the conclusion that the investigation had reached a point where it could not proceed further as all leads had been pursued exhaustively, the evidence concerning the core facts was scanty and did not lead to persons who could be considered as possible suspects. He listed the investigative steps taken, which included', 'The police searched for any evidence in the hospital files to identify anyone who might have been in the same ward or who might have taken the deceased away; they found the name of one person admitted at the same time but this person had since died;', 'The police made enquiries at the state prison where the deceased had been a warder to find information about the persons who might have accompanied the deceased to the hospital or might have come to take him away; only one name H.F. was identified as a person who had come to the hospital to take the deceased away; enquiries revealed that H.F had moved to Greece and had since died; of 17 persons who had been working at the prison at the time, they identified that 11 were still;', 'The police interviewed all 11 ex-prison staff. Six said that they had known the deceased; none admitted having any information about how he had gone missing from the hospital, save for a rumour that his family had gone to pick him up.', 'The police also interviewed police officers who were in service at the relevant time but no relevant information was forthcoming about the deceased.', '8. The Attorney-General concluded that the passage of time since events had rendered unfeasible the questioning of the persons who might have been able to shed light on the investigation. As there were no remaining leads, the investigation could not be pursued further. However, if any new evidence or information did come to light in the course of other ongoing investigations into events in 1963-1964, he had instructed the police to bring it to his attention for evaluation and further directions. He would keep the applicants updated in such event.']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The applicant, Mr Mirosław Wyżga, is a Polish national who was born in 1976 and lives in Kraków. He was represented before the Court by Mr J. Krupa, a lawyer practising in Kraków.', '2. The Polish Government (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Mrs J. Chrzanowska of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. On an unknown date the applicant was charged with several offences and in particular uttering threats (committed mostly in 2008).', '5. On 10 July 2008 the Kraków District Prosecutor asked the Kraków District Court to remand the applicant in custody. The prosecutor indicated that the applicant had failed to report for a court-ordered psychiatric observation. The applicant was arrested and placed in the hospital on 18 June 2008. However, he escaped two days later.', '6. The applicant was remanded in custody on 31 August 2008 and placed in the psychiatric ward of the Kraków Remand Centre Hospital. Between 22 September 2008 and 3 November 2008 he was under psychiatric observation. On 19 November 2008 two expert psychiatrists gave an opinion and determined that the applicant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. They observed that the applicant should be placed in a psychiatric hospital as there was a very high probability that he would commit another, similar offence.', '7. On 9 March 2009 the Kraków District Court gave a decision and discontinued the criminal proceedings against the applicant. The court, referring to the experts’ opinion, established that the applicant could not be held criminally responsible as he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. It ordered that the applicant be placed in a psychiatric hospital. On 28 April 2009 the Kraków Regional Court upheld that decision.', '8. The applicant’s remand in custody was subsequently extended. On 6 May 2009 a doctor confirmed that the applicant could be treated in the hospital wing of the detention facility until he could be transferred to a psychiatric hospital.', '9. On 17 June 2009 the Psychiatric Commission on Preventive Measures (“the Commission”) ruled that the applicant should be placed in the Jarosław Psychiatric Hospital. On 22 July 2009 the Kraków District Court asked the Commission to indicate the Kraków Babinski Psychiatric Hospital (“Babinski Hospital”) as the hospital where the applicant should be placed, since sending him to the Jarosław Hospital would make it difficult for him to maintain contact with his family. On the same day, the Commission recommended Babinski Hospital.', '10. On 24 September 2009 the applicant was transferred from the detention centre to Babinski Hospital.', '11. On 4 March 2010 the Kraków District Court, citing an expert opinion of 18 January 2010, confirmed that the applicant’s condition had not changed and that it was necessary to keep him in the hospital. The applicant appealed. On 28 May 2010 the Kraków Regional Court upheld the district court’s decision.', '12. Meanwhile, another set of criminal proceedings against the applicant (charges of computer hacking committed in 2003) was discontinued by the Kraków District Court on 27 May 2010. The court held that the applicant could not be held criminally responsible. It further considered, citing a psychiatric opinion of 13 April 2010 given by expert psychiatrists D.W. and S.T. that the applicant needed constant pharmacological treatment but he could be treated outside a psychiatric hospital.', '13. At a session held on 22 October 2010 the Kraków District Court confirmed that the applicant’s condition had not changed. Its decision given on that day was identical to that of 4 March 2010. The court examined an expert opinion of 16 July 2010, signed by two psychiatrists (including D.W.) and two psychologists, who confirmed that the applicant should continue to be treated in a psychiatric hospital. The court also refused a request by the applicant’s lawyer for experts to be appointed from outside the Kraków region. It further noted that the two expert opinions (of April and July 2010) could not be compared, as different circumstances had been examined in these two sets of proceedings.', '14. The applicant’s lawyer appealed against this decision, claiming that D.W.’s opinions were contradictory and that it had not been reliably shown that the applicant’s continued detention was necessary. On 10 December 2010 the Kraków Regional Court upheld the district court’s decision, concurring that the applicant’s confinement should be extended.', '15. On 21 April and 11 October 2011 the Kraków District Court again extended the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital. These decisions were identical to the two previous decisions. However, the court referred to fresh experts’ opinions, of 14 January and 14 July 2011 respectively. These decisions were upheld on 11 July and 15 December 2011 by the Kraków Regional Court.', '16. On 27 January 2012 the Kraków District Court confirmed that the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued, basing this decision on an opinion of 12 January 2012. The court referred to the applicant’s attempted escape of 11 January 2012. The applicant’s appeal was dismissed by the Kraków Regional Court on 29 February 2012.', '17. On 23 May 2012 expert psychiatrists confirmed that the applicant should continue to be treated in hospital, as he was still completely uncritical as regards the acts he had committed and his illness.', '18. On 11 June 2012 the Kraków District Court confirmed that the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued. The court cited a fresh expert report and the applicant’s attempted escape of 11 January 2012. On 30 July 2012 the Kraków Regional Court upheld the district court’s decision.', '19. On 3 December 2012 the Kraków District Court, on the basis of an experts’ opinion of 23 November 2012, held that the applicant’s detention in a psychiatric hospital should be continued. An appeal against this by the applicant was dismissed by the Kraków Regional Court on 25 January 2013.', '20. In their opinions of 16 May and 15 July 2013 experts found that the reasons for applying the preventive measure remained. However, owing to the applicant’s inappropriate behaviour (harassment of other patients and uttering threats towards patients and the hospital staff) they recommended that he be transferred to a different hospital. Nevertheless, on 8 August 2013 the Kraków District Court decided to keep the applicant in Babinski Hospital. That decision was upheld by the Kraków Regional Court on 24 September 2013.', '21. On 19 September 2013, upon a recommendation by the Psychiatric Commission, the Kraków District Court decided to place the applicant in the Dębica Medical Centre (“Dębica Hospital”). The applicant was transferred there on 25 September 2013.', '22. On 10 December 2013 two expert psychiatrists and a psychologist from the Tarnów region confirmed that the applicant did not see a need to continue treatment, he was uncritical about his illness, and there was a risk that he might commit yet another offence. Therefore, he should continue treatment in a secured psychiatric facility. Referring to this opinion, the Kraków District Court decided to extend the applicant’s confinement on 27 January 2014. The decision was upheld by the Kraków Regional Court on 23 May 2014.', '23. On 24 April 2014 two expert psychiatrists and a psychologist held that the applicant’s condition had deteriorated and there was still a risk that he might commit yet another offence. For these reasons it was necessary to continue his treatment in a secure psychiatric facility. Subsequently, on 26 June 2014 the Kraków District Court extended the applicant’s detention.', '24. On 21 August 2014 the Kraków District Court decided to transfer the applicant to the Branice Psychiatric Hospital – a high-security psychiatric facility. On 16 October 2014 the Kraków Regional Court dismissed the applicant’s appeal against that decision. The court stressed, referring to a recent expert opinion that the applicant’s condition had deteriorated since March 2014. He was aggressive and threatened other patients and medical staff.', '25. The applicant was transferred to Branice Hospital on 4 September 2014.', '26. On 10 February 2015 expert psychiatrists from the Opole region observed some improvement in the applicant’s mental state. He was no longer threatening other patients and had not attempted to escape. However, the improvement was not permanent, and there was still a high risk that the applicant would commit another similar offence.', '27. On 19 March 2015 the Kraków District Court again extended the applicant’s detention. In view of the experts’ opinion it also ordered that the applicant be transferred to a less secure psychiatric facility - the Rybnik Psychiatric Hospital.', '28. According to the information available to the Court on the date of adoption of the present decision the applicant is still detained in a psychiatric hospital.', '29. Conditions for the detention of persons of unsound mind who are not criminally responsible on medical grounds are laid down in the Polish Criminal Code of 1997:', 'Article 93', '“The court may impose a preventive measure as provided for in this chapter, which involves committal to a secure medical institution only if necessary in order to prevent the repeated commission of a prohibited act by an offender suffering from mental illness ... mental impairment or addiction to alcohol or other narcotic drugs. Before imposing such a measure, the court shall hear evidence from psychiatrists and a psychologist...”', 'Article 94', '“1. If an offender has committed a prohibited act in a state of insanity as specified in Article 31 § 1, causing significant harm to the community, and there is a high probability that he will commit such an act again, the court shall commit him to a suitable psychiatric institution.', '2. The duration of the stay in the institution shall not be fixed in advance; the court shall release the offender from the institution if his stay there is no longer deemed necessary.', '3. The court may reorder the committal of an offender (as specified in paragraph 1) to a suitable psychiatric institution if it is advisable in the light of the circumstances specified in paragraph 1 or Article 93; such an order may not be issued more than five years after release from the institution.”', '30. Pursuant to Article 22 § 1 of the Code of Execution of Criminal Sentences of 1997, as applicable from 1 January 2012, an offender and his defence lawyer may take part in a court hearing only if this is expressly provided by law.', 'Article 204, as applicable at the material time, provided:', '“1. The court shall, no less frequently than every six months, and in the event of receiving an opinion that further detention of the offender in a secure medical institution in which a preventive measure is being executed is unnecessary, immediately make a decision as regards the further execution of that measure. If necessary, the court shall refer to the opinion of other medical experts.', '2. A decision on the further execution of a preventive measure may be appealed against.”', '31. On 1 July 2015 Article 204 was amended to the effect that it now provides explicitly for the obligatory participation of a prosecutor (always) and a defence lawyer (if the offender is deaf, mute or blind, or a minor, if there are justified doubts as to whether he could be held criminally responsible or if the court finds that the defence may be particularly difficult).']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0

The first applicant, Mr Arūnas Kudrevičius (hereinafter “A.K.”), was born in 1970 and lives in Vaitkūnai village, Utenos region; the second applicant, Mr Bronius Markauskas (hereinafter “B.M.”), was born in 1960 and lives in Triušeliai village, Klaipėda region; the third applicant, Mr Artūras Pilota (hereinafter “A.P.”), was born in 1973 and lives in Ožkasviliai village, Marijampolė region; the fourth applicant, Mr Kęstutis Miliauskas (hereinafter “K.M.”), was born in 1959 and lives in Jungėnai village, Marijampolė region; and the fifth applicant, Mr Virginijus Mykolaitis (hereinafter “V.M.”), was born in 1961 and lives in Varakiškė village, Vilkaviškis region.', '13. On 15 April 2003 a group of farmers held a demonstration in front of the Seimas (the Lithuanian Parliament) building to protest about the situation in the agricultural sector with regard to a fall in wholesale prices for various agricultural products and the lack of subsidies for their production, demanding that the State take action. On 22 April 2003 Parliament passed a resolution on reinforcing the competitiveness of agriculture, providing for an increase in subsidies for the agricultural sector. According to the applicants, this resolution was not implemented by the government.', '14. On 16 May 2003 the Chamber of Agriculture (Žemės ūkio rūmai), an organisation established to represent the interests of farmers, met to discuss possible solutions to the issues. If no positive changes in legal regulation were forthcoming, the measures foreseen included addressing complaints to the administrative courts. In the meantime, it was decided to organise protests, in three different locations next to major highways (prie magistralinių kelių), to draw attention to the problems in the agricultural sector.', '15. In May 2003 the Kalvarija municipality issued a permit to hold peaceful assemblies in Kalvarija town “near the marketplace” from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on 13-16 May 2003, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on 17 May 2003 and from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on 19-20 May 2003. The organisers had been warned about possible liability under the Code of Administrative Law Offences as well as under the Criminal Code, including under Article 283 of the latter (see paragraph 62 below). According to the Government, similar permits, accompanied by the same warnings, were issued for 21-23, 24 and 26-30 May 2003.', '16. On 8 May 2003 the Pasvalys municipality issued a permit to hold a demonstration “at the car park at the sixty-third kilometre of the Via Baltica highway and next to that highway”. The farmers were also authorised to display agricultural machineries for ten days from 15 to 25 May 2003. On 12 May 2003 the organisers of the gathering were informed about possible liability under the Code of Administrative Law Offences as well as under the Criminal Code, including under Article 283 of the latter.', '17. On 19 May 2003 the Klaipėda municipality issued a permit to hold an assembly in an “area in Divupiai village next to, but not closer than twenty-five metres from, the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway” from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on 19-25 May 2003. The permit specified that it granted the right to organise a peaceful assembly in compliance with the provisions set forth, inter alia, in the Constitution and in the Law on Assembly. It was also indicated therein that the organisers and the participants were to observe the laws and to adhere to any orders from the authorities and the police; failure to do so could engage their administrative or criminal liability. The second applicant, B.M., who was indicated as one of the organisers of the gathering, signed a receipt for the notification of the permit.', '18. The Klaipėda police received information about the demonstrators’ possible intention to overstep the limits established by the permits. B.M. was therefore contacted by telephone and a meeting with him was organised in order to avoid unlawful acts during the demonstrations.', '19. The demonstrations started on 19 May 2003. The farmers gathered in the designated areas.', '20. On 21 May 2003 the farmers blocked and continued to demonstrate on the roads next to Dirvupiai village, on the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway, at the sixty-third kilometre of the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway, and at the ninety-fourth kilometre of the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway.', '21. The Government underlined that the police had not received any prior official notification of the demonstrators’ intention to block the three major roads of the country. They described as follows the behaviour of the farmers and of the applicants during the demonstrations:', '(a) On 21 May 2003 at around 12 noon a group of approximately 500 people moved onto the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway and remained standing there, thus stopping the traffic.', '(b) On 21 May 2003 at 12 noon a group of approximately 250 people moved onto the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway and remained standing there, thus stopping the traffic. Such blockage continued until 12 noon on 23 May 2003. The first applicant encouraged the demonstrators to move from the car park onto the highway.', '(c) On 21 May 2003 at 11.50 a.m. a group of 1,500 people moved onto the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway and kept standing there, thus stopping the traffic. In addition, on the same day between 3 and 4.30 p.m. the third, fourth and fifth applicants drove tractors onto the highway and left them standing there. Such blockage continued until 4 p.m. on 22 May 2003.', '22. On 22 May 2003 the farmers continued negotiations with the government. The next day, following a successful outcome to those negotiations, the farmers stopped blocking the roads.', '23. The parties disagreed as to the extent of the disruption to traffic created by the farmers’ demonstrations.', '24. According to the applicants (see paragraph 121 below), knowing that blockages were likely to occur, the police had prepared alternative road itineraries in the vicinity of the places where the demonstrations were held, so that the roadblocks would not disrupt the flow of goods. Indeed, on the days in question the latter had been “even better than usual”. This could be proven by the “data from posts where the roadblocks took place”.', '25. In a letter of 24 August 2004 addressed to the applicants’ lawyer, the State Border Guard Service indicated that several queues of lorries (ranging from two to ten kilometres) had formed from 21 until 23 May in both directions in the proximity of the Kalvarija border crossing between Lithuania and Poland. According to the same letter, “there were no queues of passenger cars.” Moreover, no queues had formed at the Lazdijai State border post (another post on the Lithuanian-Polish border).', '26. The Government first observed that the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway was the main trunk road connecting the three biggest cities in the country, while the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway (otherwise known as Via Baltica) and the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway were transitional trunk roads used to enter and leave the country. According to the Government, all three roads were blocked at locations next to the customs post for approximately 48 hours.', '27. The Government alleged, in particular, that owing to the blocking of the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway, which prevented vehicles from passing through the border control station, rows of heavy goods vehicles and cars formed in Lithuania and Poland at the Kalvarija border crossing. The heavy goods vehicles were forced to drive along other routes in order to avoid traffic jams. As the functioning of the Kalvarija customs post was disturbed, the Kaunas territorial customs authority was obliged to re-allocate human resources as well as to prepare for a possible re-organisation of activities with the State Border Guard Service and the Polish customs. As a consequence, the Kaunas territorial customs authority incurred additional costs; however, the concrete material damage had not been calculated.', '28. According to a report of the Kalvarija police, the road was blocked on 22 May 2003. The lorries returning to Lithuania from Poland were directed by the police to a car park at the Kalvarija border crossing. At around 11.40 a.m. the lorry drivers approached the farmers. They demanded an end to the roadblocks, with the threat of using physical force. The police urged the parties to the conflict to calm down and to wait for the results of the negotiations between the farmers and the Prime Minister. According to the Government, the farmers and the lorry drivers had a few arguments, but more serious confrontations were avoided. At around 4.15 p.m. the farmers received a telephone call about the positive outcome of the negotiations and moved one tractor off the road. The traffic then resumed in both directions.', '29. The Government also noted that, owing to the blocking of the Vilnius-Riga highway on 22 May 2003 from 2 until 4 p.m., heavy goods vehicles could not cross the border and rows of traffic of 1,600 and 700 metres respectively appeared in both directions. Cars took diversions along a gravel road.', '30. On 1 September 2003 the Pasvalys police issued a certificate stating that on 19-23 May 2003 the farmers had held a demonstration in the car park at the sixty-third kilometre of the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway. On 21 May 2003 at around midday the farmers had gone onto the highway and had stopped the traffic. They had only allowed through passenger vehicles and vehicles carrying dangerous substances. Vehicles that carried goods and cars were allowed to go through ten at a time on each side of the road once every hour. In order to improve the situation, the police had attempted to let the traffic bypass the blockade through neighbouring villages. However, owing to the poor condition of those neighbouring roads, not all lorries that carried goods were able to drive on them and they had to remain on the highway until the farmers had left. Some lorries became stuck in sand and special machinery was necessary to pull them out. The police indicated that the farmers had unblocked the highway at 4 p.m. on 23 May 2003.', '31. As can be seen from the documents submitted to the Court, in May and September 2003 four logistics companies informed the police and Linava, the Lithuanian National Road Carriers’ Association, that they had sustained pecuniary damage in the sum of 25,245 Lithuanian litai (LTL – approximately EUR 7,300) as a result of the roadblocks during the farmers’ demonstrations. The companies stated that they would institute court proceedings in respect of those claims.', '32. The Government alleged that notwithstanding the fact that only one claim for pecuniary damage was ultimately lodged (see paragraph 40 below), more than one carrier company incurred material loss owing to the disruption of traffic. As submitted by Linava, Vilniaus Dobilas incurred damage amounting to LTL 6,100 (approximately EUR 1,760); Rokauta incurred damage amounting to LTL 4,880 (approximately EUR 1,400); and Immensum incurred damage amounting to LTL 3 600 (approximately EUR 1,050). Moreover, in a letter of 26 May 2003 the company Ridma indicated that the loss incurred owing to the roadblocks amounted to LTL 10,655 (approximately EUR 3,000).', '33. Pre-trial investigations against the applicants and a number of other persons, on suspicion of having caused a riot, were initiated. In July 2003 B.M., V.M., A.P. and K.M. were ordered not to leave their places of residence. That measure was lifted in October 2003.', '34. On 1 October 2003 the police imposed a fine of LTL 40 (approximately EUR 12) on farmer A.D. According to the applicants, it was established in the police record relating to the fine that on 21 May 2003 A.D. had taken the farmers to block the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway in Kalvarija municipality; he had walked in the middle of the road, pushing a cart in front of him, thus obstructing the traffic. By such actions A.D. had breach paragraph 81 of the Road Traffic Regulations (see paragraph 67 below) and thus committed an administrative law violation, as provided for in Article 131 of the Code of Administrative Law Offences (see paragraph 66 below).', '35. The Government noted that the criminal proceedings against A.D. were discontinued on 1 August 2003 as he had not organised or provoked a gathering to seriously breach public order; his act (walking in the middle of the road pushing a cart in front of him) was not considered to fall under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 below). The Government further noted that the criminal proceedings had been discontinued on similar grounds in respect of three other persons. In respect of a fourth person the criminal prosecution was discontinued owing to his immunity as a Member of Parliament.', '36. On 4 December 2003 an indictment was laid before the courts. B.M. and A.K. were accused of incitement to rioting under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '37. The prosecutor noted that B.M. had taken part in the farmers’ meeting of 16 May 2003, at which the farmers had decided to hold demonstrations near major highways on 19 May and, should the government not satisfy their requests by 11 a.m. on 21 May, to blockade those highways. On 19 May B.M. had told the farmers to blockade the roads on 21 May. As a result, at 12.09 p.m. on that date around 500 farmers had gone onto the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway. The farmers had refused to obey police requests not to stand on the road. Consequently, traffic had been blocked until 1 p.m. on 23 May. Traffic jams had occurred on neighbouring roads and road transport in the region had become impossible.', '38. With regard to A.K., the prosecutor claimed that he had also incited the farmers to blockade the highway. As a result, at midday on 21 May 2003 approximately 250 people had gone onto the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway, refusing to obey police orders not to block the highway. The road had remained blocked until 10.58 a.m. on 23 May. The roads in the vicinity had become clogged. The normal functioning of the Saločiai-Grenctale border control post had been disrupted.', '39. V.M., K.M. and A.P. were accused of a serious breach of public order during the riot, under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code. The prosecutor maintained that on 21 May 2003, at around 11.50 a.m., approximately 1,500 people had gone onto the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway at the ninety-fourth kilometre. At about 3-4 p.m. the aforementioned applicants had driven onto the highway with three tractors and had left the tractors on the carriageway. The three applicants had refused to follow police instructions not to breach public order and not to leave the tractors on the road. The tractors had remained on the road until 4.15 p.m. on 23 May 2003. As a result, the highway had been blocked from the eighty-fourth to the ninety-fourth kilometre. Due to the resulting increase of traffic on neighbouring roads, congestion had built up and road transport in the region had come to a halt. The normal functioning of the Kalvarija and Marijampolė State border control posts had been disrupted.', '40. Within the criminal proceedings, a logistics company brought a civil claim against A.K., as the person who had incited the farmers to block the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway, seeking damages of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290) for the loss allegedly incurred by it owing to the blockading of that road.', '41. Several hearings, during which a number of witnesses testified, took place before the Kaunas City District Court.', '42. On 29 September 2004 the Kaunas City District Court found the applicants guilty of having incited riots or having participated in them, under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '43. In convicting B.M., the District Court relied on video recordings of the events, documentary evidence and the testimony of one witness. The court concluded that B.M. had organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order, namely by rioting. B.M. had been one of the leaders of the farmers’ meeting on 16 May 2003, at which the farmers had decided to attempt to achieve their goals by organising protests next to major highways. The District Court noted that the second applicant had coordinated the actions of the farmers and as a consequence, on 21 May 2003, approximately 500 people had gone to the Vilnius-Klaipėda highway and had blocked it. As a result, traffic had been blocked until 23 May 2003. The ensuing serious breach of public order had been deliberate and had to be characterised as a riot. The District Court dismissed B.M.’s claim that he and other farmers had acted out of necessity because the roadblock had been their last opportunity to draw the government’s attention to their problems. The farmers had had an alternative, namely, they could have brought complaints before the administrative courts. The farmers had themselves mentioned that alternative during the meeting of 16 May 2003 (see paragraph 14 above). The District Court further noted that a person who created a dangerous situation by his or her actions could only rely on the defence of necessity when a dangerous situation arose through negligence (Article 31 § 2 of the Criminal Code – see paragraph 65 below). However, the actions of B.M. had been deliberate and it was therefore appropriate to find him guilty of organising the riot.', '44. The District Court found it established, mainly on the basis of video recordings and documentary evidence, that A.K. had also organised a gathering with the aim of seriously breaching public order. He had taken part in the farmers’ meeting of 16 May 2003 and had known about the decision to hold protests next to the roads. When a crowd of farmers had blocked the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway on 21 May 2003, public order had been seriously breached. Traffic had been stopped on that part of the road, causing inconvenience to drivers and goods carriers. The District Court held that “during the blockade of 21 and 22 May, A.K. coordinated the actions of the crowd, that is to say he gave orders that some of the vehicles should be let through, incited [the farmers] to hold on and not to move away from the highway, was in contact with the participants in the protests in Kalvarija municipality and Klaipėda region, [and] was negotiating with the authorities by mobile phone in the name of the farmers”. The District Court emphasised that the farmers who had gathered (approximately 250 people) “obeyed the actions of A.K. and followed his orders”. For the District Court, the actions of A.K. were to be characterised as organising a riot under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code.', '45. On the basis of written evidence submitted by Linava, the District Court also found that by having organised the blockade of the Panevėžys-Pasvalys-Riga highway, A.K. had caused pecuniary damage to three carrier companies. As one of the carriers had submitted a civil claim for the sum of LTL 1,100 (approximately EUR 290 – see paragraph 40 above), the District Court deemed it proper to grant that claim.', '46. In finding V.M., K.M. and A.P. guilty of having caused a serious breach of public order during a riot, the District Court, on the basis of documentary evidence, audio-visual material and the testimony of two witnesses, established that on 21 May 2003 between 11.50 a.m. and 4.15 p.m. the three of them had driven tractors onto the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway at its ninety-fourth kilometre. They had refused to obey lawful orders by the police not to breach public order and not to park the tractors on the road (ant važiuojamosios kelio dalies) and had kept the tractors there until 4.15 p.m. on 22 May 2003. As a consequence, and because about 1,500 people had gathered on the road, the traffic had been blocked between the eighty-fourth and ninety-fourth kilometre of the Kaunas-Marijampolė-Suvalkai highway, traffic jams had occurred and the normal functioning of the Kalvarija and Lazdijai border control offices had been disrupted.', '47. The five applicants were each given a sixty-day custodial sentence (baudžiamasis areštas). The District Court also noted that all the applicants had positive characteristics and that there were no circumstances aggravating their guilt. Accordingly, there was reason to believe that the aim of the punishment could be achieved without actually depriving them of their liberty. Consequently, the District Court suspended the execution of their sentences for one year. The applicants were ordered not to leave their places of residence for more than seven days without the authorities’ prior agreement. This measure was to last for one year, whilst execution of the sentence was suspended.', '48. The District Court also acquitted, for lack of evidence, two other individuals charged with organising the riots.', '49. On 18 October 2004 the applicants lodged an appeal with the Kaunas Regional Court. They noted, inter alia, that another farmer, A.D., had been punished under administrative law for an identical violation (see paragraphs 34-35 above).', '50. The applicants further argued that in European Union (hereinafter, the “EU”) member States, roadblocks were accepted as a form of demonstration, and that the right to demonstrate was guaranteed by Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention. They referred, inter alia, to Article 2 of EU Council Regulation (EC) No 2679/98 of 7 December 1998 (see paragraph 77 below) and to a report of 22 March 2001 by the European Commission (COM (2001)160) on the application of that Regulation, as well as to the judgment of the European Court of Justice (hereinafter, the “ECJ”) in the case of Eugen Schmidberger, Internationale Transporte und Planzüge v. Austria (see paragraphs 73-76 below).', '51. On 14 January 2005 the Kaunas Regional Court found that the District C The appellate court observed that the offence of rioting endangered public order, the safety of society, human health, dignity and the inviolability of property. The objective aspect of the offence was the organising of a gathering of people for a common goal – namely, to breach public order – and the implementation of their decision which, in the instant case, had been to organise the roadblocks. To constitute an offence, the actions also had to be committed deliberately, that is to say, the persons charged had to understand the unlawfulness of their behaviour. In relation to B.M. and A.K., the Regional Court observed that during the demonstrations the two applicants had told others that it had been decided to block the roads. It had been established that B.M. and A.K. had understood that the roadblocks would be illegal and that they had been warned about their liability as organisers. Even so, they had continued to coordinate the farmers’ actions and had insisted that the farmers would maintain the roadblocks. As a direct result of the actions of B.M. and A.K., on 21 May 2003 a crowd had gone onto the highways and had blocked them, thereby stopping the traffic and breaching the constitutional rights and liberties of others to move freely and without restriction, causing damage to goods carriers and thus seriously breaching public order.', '52. The Regional Court also shared the District Court’s conclusion as to the reasonableness of convicting V.M., K.M. and A.P. It noted that by driving tractors onto the highway, thus causing traffic congestion and disturbing the work of the State border control service, and by refusing to obey lawful requests by the police not to park their tractors on the road, the three applicants had seriously breached public order. The fact that after the highway had been blocked the police and the drivers had negotiated with the farmers, with the result that some of the drivers had been let through, did not diminish the danger of the offence or its unlawfulness. The Regional Court also emphasised that the blockading of a major highway had had dangerous consequences and could not be considered to have been a mere administrative law offence such as a traffic violation. As to the applicants’ argument that their offences were identical to that for which another farmer, A.D., had been given a mere administrative sanction for a traffic violation (see paragraph 49 above), the Regional Court indicated that it was not an administrative tribunal and thus could not comment on the administrative offence.', '53. Whilst noting that the applicants had the right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Convention, the Regional Court nevertheless observed that such right was not without restrictions, should the interests of public order and prevention of crime be at stake. Analogous limitations to freedom of expression were listed in Article 25 of the Lithuanian Constitution (see paragraph 61 below). On this issue, the Regional Court emphasised that the behaviour of B.M. and A.K., in guiding the actions of the other individuals involved in the protest, could not be regarded as a non-punishable expression of their opinion, because they had breached public order, thus engaging criminal liability.', '54. The Regional Court further noted that the criminal offence had not lost its element of public danger merely because the government had refused to raise wholesale prices or had allegedly failed to take the necessary action.', '55. On 2 March 2005 the applicants appealed on points of law.', '56. On 4 October 2005 the Supreme Court, composed of an enlarged chamber of seven judges (see paragraph 70 below), dismissed the appeal. In providing an explanation as to the substance of the offence of rioting, as established in Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 62 below), the Supreme Court referred to its classification as an offence against public order, which was the objective aspect of the crime (nusikaltimo objektas). In describing the scope of the offence, the aforementioned provision stipulated the following features: the organisation of a gathering with the aim of causing public violence, damaging property or otherwise breaching public order, or the commission of those actions during a gathering. For the Supreme Court, a riot was to be characterised as a situation where a gathering of people deliberately and seriously breached public order, caused public violence, or damaged property. The subjective aspect of the crime was that of direct intent (kaltė pasireiškia tiesiogine tyčia). The guilty person had to (i) be aware that he or she was performing an action that was listed as an offence in Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code and (ii) wish to act accordingly.', '57. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Supreme Court found that the courts below had been correct in characterising the applicants’ actions as falling under Article 283 § 1 of the Criminal Code. In particular, the trial court had properly established all the prerequisites for the application of Article 283 § 1, namely that there had been a crowd and that public order had been breached by blocking the highways, stopping traffic and disturbing the work of the State border control service. The applicants had been sentenced for their offences under a law which had been in force at the time when they were committed and their sentences had been imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code. It followed that the applicants’ convictions had been in accordance with the law and not in breach of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention.', '58. The Supreme Court also stated that the applicants had not been sentenced for expressing their opinion or imparting ideas, actions which were protected by the guarantees of Article 10 § 1 of the Convention, but for actions by which they had seriously breached public order.', '59. Lastly, the Supreme Court shared the Regional Court’s view that the applicants could not be regarded as having acted out of necessity (see paragraph 54 above). The fall in milk purchase prices and other problems with subsidies for agriculture had not constituted a clear or present danger to property, because the property in question had not yet materialised. The State had not deprived the applicants of their property, and their dissatisfaction with the government’s agricultural policy had not justified the acts for which the applicants had been convicted.', '60.

A list of the eleven applicants, who are all Slovak nationals, is set out in the appendix (“the applicants”).', '2. The applicants were represented before the Court by Mr M. Hrouda, a lawyer practising in Košice. The Government of the Slovak Republic (“the Government”) were represented by their Agent, Ms M. Pirošíková.', '3. The facts of the case, as submitted by the parties, may be summarised as follows.', '4. This application and three others (nos. 18803/10, 48554/10 and 44019/11) concern the regularisation of the relationship between ownership and use of real property located in the cadastral area of Košice-Sever.', '5. Certain land in this area was expropriated in the 1980s by the (then socialist) State and a public sports centre was built on it. The sports centre comprises buildings and various other facilities, such as a tennis court, a grandstand, a water station and paved areas.', '6. After the post 1989 political, constitutional and legal changes, litigation took place with a view to resolving various property claims made by the original owners (or their legal successors) against the entities that owned or operated the sports centre or various parts of it.', '7. The land concerned is divided into a number of plots with various owners, many of whom are linked by family relations and history, and who had the same legal representation in the above-mentioned proceedings. Their lawsuits followed a similar pattern, but sometimes had varying results. They included the following proceedings.', '8. The applicants in the present case are all successors in title to a plot of land in the above-mentioned area, having inherited their title from the original owners, who died in 1948 and 1982, respectively.', '9. On 3 October 1994 the applicants, represented then and throughout the proceedings by a laywer, lodged an action against a sports club seeking to obtain a court order for the removal of the constructions on the land.', '10. The principal line of argument was that the expropriation decision of 24 February 1984 was invalid in law. The applicants were therefore the lawful owners of the land in question, in particular plot no. 10605 (recorded on sheet no. 1303 of the “old” records), and the defendant had no lawful title to the constructions on the applicants’ land.', '11. The action was subsequently amended to state that, alternatively, the applicants sought a judicial ruling establishing an easement on their land for the benefit of the owner of the sports centre in return for financial compensation payable to the applicants. It was also extended to two more defendants, a municipality and a private company.', '12. The action was dismissed at first instance by the Košice I District Court (Okresný súd) on 11 August 2008, and – following the applicants’ appeal – by the Košice Regional Court (Krajský súd) on 2 February 2009.', '13. The courts reached their conclusions after having taken complex oral and documentary evidence, including expert evidence.', '14. In accordance with the applicants’ claim, the courts found that (i) the expropriation of 1984 was legally ineffective on account of procedural flaws; (ii) the applicants were the owners of the land in question; (iii) the constructions on it had been built without a valid legal title in so far as the land was concerned; and (iv) the applicants were entitled to seek redress under general civil law, that is to say Article 135c of the Civil Code (Law no. 40/1964 Coll., as amended), which was not subject to any statute of limitation, unlike the special legislation on restitution, which contained specific time-limits.', '15. As regards the options available under Article 135c of the Civil Code for resolving the discrepancy between the ownership and use of the land and the constructions concerned, the District Court found that, for practical reasons, it was out of the question to have the applicants established as the owners of the constructions and to order them to pay the current owners financial compensation. Furthermore, in the circumstances, it was likewise not practical to order the physical removal of the constructions in question.', 'The establishment of an easement for the benefit of the owners of the constructions in return for compensation payable by them to the applicants was therefore in principle an option.', '16. However, on the specific facts, and contrary to the applicants’ assertions, the courts found that no easement could be established on the land. The bone of contention was the legal nature of the constructions concerned. In particular, these constructions could not be considered as “buildings” in terms of civil law. However, an easement over land could only be established for the benefit of the owner of a “building”.', '17. The court dismissed the applicants’ argument that the buildings and the adjacent facilities belonged to one integrated complex and in reality served a single purpose, that in the past easements had been established on some plots in that area and that, accordingly, a similar solution should be adopted in their own case. However, the court did not respond to their specific argument that, in case no. 15C 251/94, an easement had been established also over land that had no “buildings” on it (see paragraph 27 below).', '18. Observing that the sports centre had always served the public, the courts also took into account the “nature and extent of economic prejudice” suffered by the applicants.', '19. Lastly, it was held that the applicants had alternative means of asserting their rights by lodging an action for a declaratory ruling and an action for compensation in respect of unjustified enrichment.', '20. On 23 April 2009 the applicants lodged a complaint with the Constitutional Court (Ústavný súd) under Article 127 § 1 of the Constitution (Constitutional Law no. 460/1992 Coll., as amended), to which they added further grounds of complaint on 14 January 2010.', 'Citing similar grounds to those mentioned above, the applicants contested the outcome of the proceedings and alleged that their rights under, inter alia, Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (fairness, adequate reasoning) and the constitutional equivalent of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 had been violated.', '21. On 18 March 2010 the Constitutional Court declared the complaint inadmissible as being manifestly ill-founded. Observing that it was not a court of further appeal against decisions of the ordinary courts, it found no constitutionally relevant unfairness, arbitrariness or irregularity in the impugned judgments.', 'The decision was served on the applicants’ lawyer on 25 October 2010.', '22. The position taken by the courts was subsequently fully endorsed by the Public Prosecution Service when it dismissed the applicants’ petition for an extraordinary appeal on points of law to be lodged on their behalf in the present case.', '23. Article 135c deals with situations concerning so-called “unlawful constructions”, that is buildings (stavba) constructed on somebody else’s plot of land (pozemok) without an entitlement to do so.', 'At the request of the owner of the land, the court has the power to order the removal of such buildings at the cost of the person who constructed it (paragraph 1).', 'However, if the removal of the building is not practical, and subject to consent by the owner of the land, the court has the power to rule that title to the building be transferred to the owner of the land in return for compensation (paragraph 2).', 'The court also has the power to regularise the relationship between the owner of the land and the owner of the building by taking other measures, in particular by establishing an easement, which is necessary for the exercise of ownership rights in respect of the building, in return for compensation (paragraph 3).', '24. In a case registered at the District Court under file no. 15C 251/94 a different group of claimants raised essentially the same claims as the applicants in respect of other plots of land under the same sports centre, the defendant being the respective municipality.', '25. Before the case was resolved on the merits with final effect, the Supreme Court had determined the claimants’ appeal on points of law (dovolanie) (no. 3 Cdo 96/98) against a previous judgment of the Regional Court. In its judgment of 25 February 1999, the Supreme Court observed that before the action could be determined on the merits (of the claim for an easement), preliminary questions had to be answered as to whether the claimants were the owners of the property concerned and, if they were, whether they had standing to sue in the case.', 'The Supreme Court further observed that, when dealing with those questions, the Regional Court had noted that the land in question had been expropriated in 1984. The Regional Court had therefore held that, even assuming that the expropriation had been flawed, it could only have been challenged by means of administrative-law remedies and within the statutory timelimits. That, however, had been beyond the scope of the case at hand and, therefore, the Regional Court held that the 1984 expropriation should be considered as being a matter of fact.', '26. The Supreme Court disagreed with the Regional Court’s position described above. As was found in the present case (see paragraph 14 above), it found that the expropriation of 1984 was legally ineffective. As a consequence, the courts were bound to examine the preliminary question of the claimants’ ownership independently and irrespective of the expropriation decision.', '27. The case was finally decided on the merits by the District Court on 13 March 2002. The action was granted and an easement was established for the benefit of the claimants in respect of the entire property covered by their claim, that is to say including some plots on which no “buildings”, in the sense explained above, were situated.', 'The judgment was not appealed against and became final and binding on 3 May 2002.', '28. The ensuing question concerning the financial compensation payable by the municipality to the claimants for the easement was resolved by the District Court in a judgment of 13 December 2006 (case no. 15C 717/02) on the basis of an expert assessment.', '29. In another similar case concerning property in the same area as in the present case, the claimants raised in principle the same claims. The court took the same position as in the present case, that is to say that the claimants were entitled to assert their property claims under the general provisions of the Civil Code and the determinative factor was whether or not the land in question was under “buildings”. As that was only partly so, the action was partly granted and partly dismissed. The respective judgments were given on 24 November 2008 (the District Court) and 20 April 2009 (the Regional Court), and the final decision was given by the Constitutional Court on 8 September 2009.', '30. In a number of other similar cases concerning property in the same area as in the present case, the position was taken that the claimants could not assert their rights under the general provisions of the Civil Code, as those provisions constituted a lex generalis, and their application was excluded by virtue of the special legislation on the restitution of property, as a lex specialis. However, that position does not appear to be settled.', '31. The relevant parts of the report state that, in order for the principle of legal certainty – essential for maintaining confidence in the judicial system and the rule of law – to be achieved, the State must make the law easily accessible and must also apply the laws it has enacted in a foreseeable and consistent manner. As the existence of conflicting decisions within the highest courts may be contrary to this principle, it is necessary for these courts to establish mechanisms to avoid conflicts and ensure the coherence of their case-law.', '32. The relevant parts of the Opinion read as follows:', '“47. While recognising the judges’ power to interpret the law, the obligation of the judges to promote legal certainty has also to be remembered. Indeed legal certainty guarantees the predictability of the content and application of the legal rules, thus contributing in ensuring a high quality judicial system.', '48. Judges will apply the interpretative principles applicable in both national and international law with this aim in mind. ... In civil law countries, they will be guided by case law, especially that of the highest courts, whose task includes ensuring the uniformity of case law.', '49. Judges should in general apply the law consistently. However when a court decides to depart from previous case law, this should be clearly mentioned in its decision.”']",[],[],[],[],[],[],0
